18433619	the man upstairs  and other stories      by p g wodehouse      contents   the man upstairs  something to worry about  deep waters  when doctors disagree  by advice of counsel  roughhew them how we will  the man who disliked cats  ruth in exile  archibalds benefit  the man the maid and the miasma  the good angel  pots o money  out of school  three from dunsterville  the tuppenny millionaire  ahead of schedule  sir agravaine  the goalkeeper and the plutocrat  in alcala     the man upstairs   there were three distinct stages in the evolution of annette broughams attitude towards the knocking in the room above in the beginning it had been merely a vague discomfort absorbed in the composition of her waltz she had heard it almost subconsciously the second stage set in when it became a physical pain like redhot pincers wrenching her mind from her music finally with a thrill in indignation she knew it for what it wasan insult the unseen brute disliked her playing and was intimating his views with a bootheel  defiantly with her foot on the loud pedal she struckalmost slappedthe keys once more  bang from the room above bang bang  annette rose her face was pink her chin tilted her eyes sparkled with the light of battle she left the room and started to mount the stairs no spectator however just could have helped feeling a pang of pity for the wretched man who stood unconscious of imminent doom possibly even triumphant behind the door at which she was on the point of tapping  come in cried the voice rather a pleasant voice but what is a pleasant voice if the soul be vile  annette went in the room was a typical chelsea studio scantily furnished and lacking a carpet in the centre was an easel behind which were visible a pair of trousered legs a cloud of grey smoke was curling up over the top of the easel  i beg your pardon began annette  i dont want any models at present said the brute leave your card on the table  i am not a model said annette coldly i merely came  at this the brute emerged from his fortifications and removing his pipe from his mouth jerked his chair out into the open  i beg your pardon he said wont you sit down  how reckless is nature in the distribution of her gifts not only had this blackhearted knocker on floors a pleasant voice but in addition a pleasing exterior he was slightly dishevelled at the moment and his hair stood up in a disordered mop but in spite of these drawbacks he was quite passably goodlooking annette admitted this though wrathful she was fair  i thought it was another model he explained theyve been coming in at the rate of ten an hour ever since i settled here i didnt object at first but after about the eightieth child of sunny italy had shown up it began to get on my nerves  annette waited coldly till he had finished  i am sorry she said in a thisiswhereyougetyours voice if my playing disturbed you  one would have thought nobody but an eskimo wearing his furs and winter underclothing could have withstood the iciness of her manner but the brute did not freeze  i am sorry repeated annette well below zero if my playing disturbed you i live in the room below and i heard you knocking  no no protested the young man affably i like it really i do  then why knock on the floor said annette turning to go it is so bad for my ceiling she said over shoulder i thought you would not mind my mentioning it good afternoon  no but one moment dont go  she stopped he was surveying her with a friendly smile she noticed most reluctantly that he had a nice smile his composure began to enrage her more and more long ere this he should have been writhing at her feet in the dust crushed and abject  you see he said im awfully sorry but its like this i love music but what i mean is you werent playing a tune it was just the same bit over and over again  i was trying to get a phrase said annette with dignity but less coldly in spite of herself she was beginning to thaw there was something singularly attractive about this shockheaded youth  a phrase  of music for my waltz i am composing a waltz  a look of such unqualified admiration overspread the young mans face that the last remnants of the icepack melted for the first time since they had met annette found herself positively liking this blackguardly floorsmiter  can you compose music he said impressed  i have written one or two songs  it must be great to be able to do thingsartistic things i mean like composing  well you do dont you you paint  the young man shook his head with a cheerful grin  i fancy he said i should make a pretty good housepainter i want scope canvas seems to cramp me  it seemed to cause him no discomfort he appeared rather amused than otherwise  let me look  she crossed over to the easel  i shouldnt he warned her you really want to is this not mere recklessness very well then  to the eye of an experienced critic the picture would certainly have seemed crude it was a study of a darkeyed child holding a large black cat statisticians estimate that there is no moment during the day when one or more young artists somewhere on the face of the globe are not painting pictures of children holding cats  i call it child and cat said the young man rather a neat title dont you think gives you the main idea of the thing right away that he explained pointing obligingly with the stem of his pipe is the cat  annette belonged to that large section of the public which likes or dislikes a picture according to whether its subject happens to please or displease them probably there was not one of the million or so childandcat eyesores at present in existence which she would not have liked besides he had been very nice about her music  i think its splendid she announced  the young mans face displayed almost more surprise than joy  do you really he said then i can die happythat is if youll let me come down and listen to those songs of yours first  you would only knock on the floor objected annette  ill never knock on another floor as long as i live said the exbrute reassuringly i hate knocking on floors i dont see what people want to knock on floors for anyway  friendships ripen quickly in chelsea within the space of an hour and a quarter annette had learned that the young mans name was alan beverley for which family heraldic affliction she pitied rather than despised him that he did not depend entirely on his work for a living having a little money of his own and that he considered this a fortunate thing from the very beginning of their talk he pleased her she found him an absolutely new and original variety of the unsuccessful painter unlike reginald sellers who had a studio in the same building and sometimes dropped in to drink her coffee and pour out his troubles he did not attribute his nonsuccess to any malice or stupidity on the part of the public she was so used to hearing sellers lash the philistine and hold forth on unappreciated merit that she could hardly believe the miracle when in answer to a sympathetic bromide on the popular lack of taste in art beverley replied that as far as he was concerned the public showed strong good sense if he had been striving with every nerve to win her esteem he could not have done it more surely than with that one remark though she invariably listened with a sweet patience which encouraged them to continue long after the point at which she had begun in spirit to throw things at them annette had no sympathy with men who whined she herself was a fighter she hated as much as anyone the sickening blows which fate hands out to the struggling and ambitious but she never made them the basis of a monologue act often after a dreary trip round the offices of the musicpublishers she would howl bitterly in secret and even gnaw her pillow in the watches of the night but in public her pride kept her unvaryingly bright and cheerful  today for the first time she revealed something of her woes there was that about the mopheaded young man which invited confidences she told him of the stonyheartedness of musicpublishers of the difficulty of getting songs printed unless you paid for them of their wretched sales  but those songs youve been playing said beverley theyve been published  yes those three but they are the only ones  and didnt they sell  hardly at all you see a song doesnt sell unless somebody well known sings it and people promise to sing them and then dont keep their word you cant depend on what they say  give me their names said beverley and ill go round tomorrow and shoot the whole lot but cant you do anything  only keep on keeping on  i wish he said that any time youre feeling blue about things you would come up and pour out the poison on me its no good bottling it up come up and tell me about it and youll feel ever so much better or let me come down any time things arent going right just knock on the ceiling  she laughed  dont rub it in pleaded beverley it isnt fair theres nobody so sensitive as a reformed floorknocker you will come up or let me come down wont you whenever i have that sad depressed feeling i go out and kill a policeman but you wouldnt care for that so the only thing for you to do is to knock on the ceiling then ill come charging down and see if theres anything i can do to help  youll be sorry you ever said this  i wont he said stoutly  if you really mean it it would be a relief she admitted sometimes id give all the money im ever likely to make for someone to shriek my grievances at i always think it must have been so nice for the people in the old novels when they used to say sit down and i will tell you the story of my life mustnt it have been heavenly  well said beverley rising you know where i am if im wanted right up there where the knocking came from  knocking said annette i remember no knocking  would you mind shaking hands said beverley                                       a particularly maddening hour with one of her pupils drove her up the very next day her pupils were at once her salvation and her despair they gave her the means of supporting life but they made life hardly worth supporting some of them were learning the piano others thought they sang all had solid ivory skulls there was about a teaspoonful of grey matter distributed among the entire squad and the pupil annette had been teaching that afternoon had come in at the tailend of the division  in the studio with beverley she found reginald sellers standing in a critical attitude before the easel she was not very fond of him he was a long offensive patronizing person with a moustache that looked like a smear of charcoal and a habit of addressing her as ah little one  beverley looked up  have you brought your hatchet miss brougham if you have youre just in time to join in the massacre of the innocents sellers has been smiting my child and cat hip and thigh look at his eye there did you see it flash then hes on the warpath again  my dear beverley said sellers rather stiffly i am merely endeavouring to give you my idea of the pictures defects i am sorry if my criticism has to be a little harsh  go right on said beverley cordially dont mind me its all for my good  well in a word then it is lifeless neither the child nor the cat lives  he stepped back a pace and made a frame of his hands  the cat now he said it ishow shall i put it it has nonoer  that kind of cat wouldnt said beverley it isnt that breed  i think its a dear cat said annette she felt her temper always quick getting the better of her she knew just how incompetent sellers was and it irritated her beyond endurance to see beverleys goodhumoured acceptance of his patronage  at any rate said beverley with a grin you both seem to recognize that it is a cat youre solid on that point and thats something seeing im only a beginner  i know my dear fellow i know said sellers graciously you mustnt let my criticism discourage you dont think that your work lacks promise far from it i am sure that in time you will do very well indeed quite well  a cold glitter might have been observed in annettes eyes  mr sellers she said smoothly had to work very hard himself before he reached his present position you know his work of course  for the first time beverley seemed somewhat confused  ierwhy he began  oh but of course you do she went on sweetly its in all the magazines  beverley looked at the great man with admiration and saw that he had flushed uncomfortably he put this down to the modesty of genius  in the advertisement pages said annette mr sellers drew that picture of the waukeesy shoe and the restawhile settee and the tin of sardines in the little gem sardine advertisement he is very good at still life  there was a tense silence beverley could almost hear the voice of the referee uttering the count  miss brougham said sellers at last spitting out the words has confined herself to the purely commercial side of my work there is another  why of course there is you sold a landscape for five pounds only eight months ago didnt you and another three months before that  it was enough sellers bowed stiffly and stalked from the room  beverley picked up a duster and began slowly to sweep the floor with it  what are you doing demanded annette in a choking voice  the fragments of the wretched man whispered beverley they must be swept up and decently interred you certainly have got the punch miss brougham  he dropped the duster with a startled exclamation for annette had suddenly burst into a flood of tears with her face buried in her hands she sat in her chair and sobbed desperately  good lord said beverley blankly  im a cat im a beast i hate myself  good lord said beverley blankly  im a pig im a fiend  good lord said beverley blankly  were all struggling and trying to get on and having hard luck and instead of doing what i can to help i go and tttaunt him with not being able to sell his pictures im not fit to live oh  good lord said beverley blankly  a series of gulping sobs followed diminishing by degrees into silence presently she looked up and smiled a moist and pathetic smile  im sorry she said for being so stupid but he was so horrid and patronizing to you i couldnt help scratching i believe im the worst cat in london  no this is said beverley pointing to the canvas at least according to the late sellers but i say tell me isnt the deceased a great artist then he came curveting in here with his chest out and started to slate my masterpiece so i naturally said whatho tis a genius isnt he  he cant sell his pictures anywhere he lives on the little he can get from illustrating advertisements and i ttaunt  please said beverley apprehensively  she recovered herself with a gulp  i cant help it she said miserably i rubbed it in oh it was hateful of me but i was all on edge from teaching one of my awful pupils and when he started to patronize you  she blinked  poor devil said beverley i never guessed good lord  annette rose  i must go and tell him im sorry she said hell snub me horribly but i must  she went out beverley lit a pipe and stood at the window looking thoughtfully down into the street                                       it is a good rule in life never to apologize the right sort of people do not want apologies and the wrong sort take a mean advantage of them sellers belonged to the latter class when annette meek penitent with all her claws sheathed came to him and grovelled he forgave her with a repulsive magnanimity which in a less subdued mood would have stung her to renewed pugnacity as it was she allowed herself to be forgiven and retired with a dismal conviction that from now on he would be more insufferable than ever  her surmise proved absolutely correct his visits to the newcomers studio began again and beverleys picture now nearing completion came in for criticism enough to have filled a volume the good humour with which he received it amazed annette she had no proprietary interest in the painting beyond what she acquired from a growing regard for its parent which disturbed her a good deal when she had time to think of it but there were moments when only the recollection of her remorse for her previous outbreak kept her from rending the critic beverley however appeared to have no artistic sensitiveness whatsoever when sellers savaged the cat in a manner which should have brought the spca down upon him beverley merely beamed his longsufferingness was beyond annettes comprehension  she began to admire him for it  to make his position as critic still more impregnable sellers was now able to speak as one having authority after years of floundering his luck seemed at last to have turned his pictures which for months had lain at an agents careened like crippled battleships had at length begun to find a market within the past two weeks three landscapes and an allegorical painting had sold for good prices and under the influence of success he expanded like an opening floweret when epstein the agent wrote to say that the allegory had been purchased by a glasgow plutocrat of the name of bates for one hundred and sixty guineas sellers views on philistines and their crass materialism and lack of taste underwent a marked modification he spoke with some friendliness of the man bates  to me said beverley when informed of the event by annette the matter has a deeper significance it proves that glasgow has at last produced a sober man no drinker would have dared face that allegory the whole business is very gratifying  beverley himself was progressing slowly in the field of art he had finished the child and cat and had taken it to epstein together with a letter of introduction from sellers sellers habitual attitude now was that of the kindly celebrity who has arrived and wishes to give the youngsters a chance  since its departure beverley had not done much in the way of actual execution whenever annette came to his studio he was either sitting in a chair with his feet on the windowsill smoking or in the same attitude listening to sellers views on art sellers being on the upgrade a man with many pounds to his credit in the bank had more leisure now he had given up his advertisement work and was planning a great canvasanother allegorical work this left him free to devote a good deal of time to beverley and he did so beverley sat and smoked through his harangues he may have been listening or he may not annette listened once or twice and the experience had the effect of sending her to beverley quivering with indignation  why do you let him patronize you like that she demanded if anybody came and talked to me like that about my music ididi dont know what id do yes even if he were really a great musician  dont you consider sellers a great artist then even now  he seems to be able to sell his pictures so i suppose they must be good but nothing could give him the right to patronize you as he does  my learned friends manner would be intolerable in an emperor to a blackbeetle quoted beverley well what are we going to do about it  if only you could sell a picture too  ah well ive done my part of the contract ive delivered the goods there the thing is at epsteins the public cant blame me if it doesnt sell all theyve got to do is to waltz in in their thousands and fight for it and by the way talking of waltzes  oh its finished said annette dispiritedly published too for that matter  published whats the matter then why this drooping sadness why arent you running around the square singing like a bird  because said annette unfortunately i had to pay the expenses of publication it was only five pounds but the sales havent caught up with that yet if they ever do perhaps therell be a new edition  and will you have to pay for that  no the publishers would  who are they  grusczinsky and buchterkirch  heavens then what are you worrying about the things a cert a man with a name like grusczinsky could sell a dozen editions by himself helped and inspired by buchterkirch he will make the waltz the talk of the country infants will croon it in their cots  he didnt seem to think so when i saw him last  of course not he doesnt know his own power grusczinskys shrinking diffidence is a byword in musical circles he is the genuine human violet you must give him time  ill give him anything if hell only sell an edition or two said annette  the outstanding thing was that he did there seemed no particular reason why the sale of that waltz should not have been as small and as slow as that of any other waltz by an unknown composer but almost without warning it expanded from a trickle into a flood grusczinsky beaming paternally whenever annette entered the shopwhich was oftenannounced two new editions in a week beverley his artistic growth still under a watchful eye of sellers said he had never had any doubts as to the success of the thing from the moment when a single phrase in it had so carried him away that he had been compelled to stamp his applause enthusiastically on the floor even sellers forgot his own triumphs long enough to allow him to offer affable congratulations and money came rolling in smoothing the path of life  those were great days there was a hat   life in short was very full and splendid there was indeed but one thing which kept it from being perfect the usual drawback to success is that it annoys ones friends so but in annettes case this drawback was absent sellers demeanour towards her was that of an oldestablished inmate welcoming a novice into the hall of fame her pupilsworthy souls though boneheadedfawned upon her beverley seemed more pleased than anyone yet it was beverley who prevented her paradise from being complete successful herself she wanted all her friends to be successful but beverley to her discomfort remained a cheery failure and worse absolutely refused to snub sellers it was not as if sellers advice and comments were disinterested beverley was simply the instrument on which he played his songs of triumph it distressed annette to such an extent that now if she went upstairs and heard sellers voice in the studio she came down again without knocking                                       one afternoon sitting in her room she heard the telephonebell ring  the telephone was on the stairs just outside her door she went out and took up the receiver  halloa said a querulous voice is mr beverley there  annette remembered having heard him go out she could always tell his footstep  he is out she said is there any message  yes said the voice emphatically tell him that rupert morrison rang up to ask what he was to do with all this great stack of music thats arrived does he want it forwarded on to him or what the voice was growing high and excited evidently mr morrison was in a state of nervous tension when a man does not care particularly who hears his troubles so long as he unburdens himself of them to someone  music said annette  music shrilled mr morrison stacks and stacks and stacks of it is he playing a practical joke on me or what he demanded hysterically plainly he had now come to regard annette as a legitimate confidante she was listening that was the main point he wanted someonehe did not care whomwho would listen he lends me his rooms wailed mr morrison so that i can be perfectly quiet and undisturbed while i write my novel and first thing i know this music starts to arrive how can i be quiet and undisturbed when the floors littered two yards high with great parcels of music and more coming every day  annette clung weakly to the telephone box her mind was in a whirl but she was beginning to see many things  are you there called mr morrison  yes whatwhat firm does the music come from  whats that  who are the publishers who send the music  i cant remember some long name yes ive got it grusczinsky and someone  ill tell mr beverley said annette quietly a great weight seemed to have settled on her head  halloa halloa are you there came mr morrisons voice  yes  and tell him there are some pictures too  pictures  four great beastly pictures the size of elephants i tell you there isnt room to move and  annette hung up the receiver                                       mr beverley returned from his walk was racing up the stairs three at a time in his energetic way when as he arrived at annettes door it opened  have you a minute to spare said annette  of course whats the trouble have they sold another edition of the waltz  i have not heard mrbates  for once she looked to see the cheerful composure of the man upstairs become ruffled but he received the blow without agitation  you know my name he said  i know a good deal more than your name you are a glasgow millionaire  its true he admitted but its hereditary my father was one before me  and you use your money said annette bitterly creating fools paradises for your friends which last i suppose until you grow tired of the amusement and destroy them doesnt it ever strike you mr bates that its a little cruel do you think mr sellers will settle down again cheerfully to hackwork when you stop buying his pictures and he finds out thatthat  i shant stop said the young man if a glasgow millionaire maynt buy sellers allegorical pictures whose allegorical pictures may he buy sellers will never find out hell go on painting and ill go on buying and all will be joy and peace  indeed and what future have you arranged for me  you he said reflectively i want to marry you  annette stiffened from head to foot he met her blazing eyes with a look of quiet devotion  marry me  i know what you are thinking he said your mind is dwelling on the prospect of living in a house decorated throughout with sellers allegorical pictures but it wont be well store them in the attic  she began to speak but he interrupted her  listen he said sit down and i will tell you the story of my life well skip the first twentyeight years and three months merely mentioning that for the greater part of that time i was looking for somebody just like you a month and nine days ago i found you you were crossing the embankment i was also on the embankment in a taxi i stopped the taxi got out and observed you just stepping into the charing cross underground i sprang  this does not interest me said annette  the plot thickens he assured her we left our hero springing i think just so well you took the west end train and got off at sloane square so did i you crossed sloane square turned up kings road and finally arrived here i followed i saw a notice up studio to let i reflected that having done a little painting in an amateur way i could pose as an artist all right so i took the studio also the name of alan beverley my own is bill bates i had often wondered what it would feel like to be called by some name like alan beverley or cyril trevelyan it was simply the spin of the coin which decided me in favour of the former once in the problem was how to get to know you when i heard you playing i knew it was all right i had only to keep knocking on the floor long enough  doyoumeantotellmeannettes voice trembled do you mean to tell me that you knocked that time simply to make me come up  that was it rather a scheme dont you think and now would you mind telling me how you found out that i had been buying your waltz those remarks of yours about fools paradises were not inspired solely by the affairs of sellers but it beats me how you did it i swore rozinsky or whatever his name is to secrecy  a mr morrison sad annette indifferently rang up on the telephone and asked me to tell you that he was greatly worried by the piles of music which were littering the rooms you lent him  the young man burst into a roar of laughter  poor old morrison i forgot all about him i lent him my rooms at the albany hes writing a novel and he cant work if the slightest thing goes wrong it just shows  mr bates  yes  perhaps you didnt intend to hurt me i dare say you meant only to be kind butbutoh cant you see how you have humiliated me you have treated me like a child giving me a makebelieve success just tojust to keep me quiet i suppose you  he was fumbling in his pocket  may i read you a letter he said  a letter  quite a short one it is from epstein the picturedealer this is what he says sir meaning me not dear bill mind youjust sir i am glad to be able to inform you that i have this morning received an offer of ten guineas for your picture child and cat kindly let me know if i am to dispose of it at this price  well said annette in a small voice  i have just been to epsteins it seems that the purchaser is a miss brown she gave an address in bayswater i called at the address no miss brown lives there but one of your pupils does i asked her if she was expecting a parcel for miss brown and she said that she had had your letter and quite understood and would take it in when it arrived  annette was hiding her face in her hands  go away she said faintly  mr bates moved a step nearer  do you remember that story of the people on the island who eked out a precarious livelihood by taking in one anothers washing he asked casually  go away cried annette  ive always thought he said that it must have drawn them very close togethermade them feel rather attached to each other dont you  go away  i dont want to go away i want to stay and hear you say youll marry me  please go away i want to think  she heard him moving towards the door he stopped then went on again the door closed quietly presently from the room above came the sound of footstepsfootsteps pacing monotonously to and fro like those of an animal in a cage  annette sat listening there was no break in the footsteps  suddenly she got up in one corner of the room was a long pole used for raising and lowering the windowsash she took it and for a moment stood irresolute then with a quick movement she lifted it and stabbed three times at the ceiling     something to worry about   a girl stood on the shingle that fringes millbourne bay gazing at the red roofs of the little village across the water she was a pretty girl small and trim just now some secret sorrow seemed to be troubling her for on her forehead were wrinkles and in her eyes a look of wistfulness she had in fact all the distinguishing marks of one who is thinking of her sailor lover  but she was not she had no sailor lover what she was thinking of was that at about this time they would be lighting up the shopwindows in london and that of all the deadly depressing spots she had ever visited this village of millbourne was the deadliest  the evening shadows deepened the incoming tide glistened oilily as it rolled over the mud flats she rose and shivered  goo what a hole she said eyeing the unconscious village morosely what a hole                                       this was sally prestons first evening in millbourne she had arrived by the afternoon train from londonnot of her own free will left to herself she would not have come within sixty miles of the place london supplied all that she demanded from life she had been born in london she had lived there ever sinceshe hoped to die there she liked fogs motorbuses noise policemen paperboys shops taxicabs artificial light stone pavements houses in long grey rows mud bananaskins and movingpicture exhibitions especially movingpicture exhibitions it was indeed her taste for these that had caused her banishment to millbourne  the great public is not yet unanimous on the subject of movingpicture exhibitions sally as i have said approved of them her father on the other hand did not an austere exbutler who let lodgings in ebury street and preached on sundays in hyde park he looked askance at the movies it was his boast that he had never been inside a theatre in his life and he classed cinema palaces with theatres as wiles of the devil sally suddenly unmasked as an habitual frequenter of these abandoned places sprang with one bound into prominence as the bad girl of the family instant removal from the range of temptation being the only possible plan it seemed to mr preston that a trip to the country was indicated  he selected millbourne because he had been butler at the hall there and because his sister jane who had been a parlourmaid at the rectory was now married and living in the village  certainly he could not have chosen a more promising reformatory for sally here if anywhere might she forget the heady joys of the cinema tucked away in the corner of its little bay which an accommodating island converts into a still lagoon millbourne lies dozing in all sleepy hampshire there is no sleepier spot it is a place of calmeyed men and drowsy dogs things crumble away and are not replaced tradesmen book orders and then lose interest and forget to deliver the goods only centenarians die and nobody worries about anythingor did not until sally came and gave them something to worry about                                       next door to sallys aunt jane in a cosy little cottage with a wonderful little garden lived thomas kitchener a large grave selfsufficing young man who by sheer application to work had become already though only twentyfive second gardener at the hall gardening absorbed him when he was not working at the hall he was working at home on the morning following sallys arrival it being a thursday and his day off he was crouching in a constrained attitude in his garden every fibre of his being concentrated on the interment of a plump young bulb consequently when a chunk of mud came sailing over the fence he did not notice it  a second however compelled attention by bursting like a shell on the back of his neck he looked up startled nobody was in sight he was puzzled it could hardly be raining mud yet the alternative theory that someone in the next garden was throwing it was hardly less bizarre the nature of his friendship with sallys aunt jane and old mr williams her husband was comfortable rather than rollicking it was inconceivable that they should be flinging clods at him  as he stood wondering whether he should go to the fence and look over or simply accept the phenomenon as one of those things which no fellow can understand there popped up before him the head and shoulders of a girl poised in her right hand was a third clod which seeing that there was now no need for its services she allowed to fall to the ground  halloa she said good morning  she was a pretty girl small and trim tom was by way of being the strong silent man with a career to think of and no time for bothering about girls but he saw that there was moreover a certain alertness in her expression rarely found in the feminine population of millbourne who were apt to be slightly bovine  what do you think youre messing about at she said affably  tom was a slowminded young man who liked to have his thoughts well under control before he spoke he was not one of your gay rattlers besides there was something about this girl which confused him to an extraordinary extent he was conscious of new and strange emotions he stood staring silently  whats your name anyway  he could answer that he did so  oh mines sally preston mrs williams is my aunt ive come from london  tom had no remarks to make about london  have you lived here all your life  yes said tom  my goodness dont you ever feel fed up dont you want a change  tom considered the point  no he said  well i do i want one now  its a nice place hazarded tom  its nothing of the sort its the beastliest hole in existence its absolutely chronic perhaps you wonder why im here dont think i wanted to come here not me i was sent it was like this she gave him a rapid summary of her troubles there dont you call it a bit thick she concluded  tom considered this point too  you must make the best of it he said at length  i wont ill make father take me back  tom considered this point also rarely if ever had he been given so many things to think about in one morning  how he inquired at length  i dont know ill find some way you see if i dont ill get away from here jolly quick i give you my word  tom bent low over a rosebush his face was hidden but the brown of his neck seemed to take on a richer hue and his ears were undeniably crimson his feet moved restlessly and from his unseen mouth there proceeded the first gallant speech his lips had ever framed merely considered as a speech it was perhaps nothing wonderful but from tom it was a miracle of chivalry and polish  what he said was i hope not  and instinct telling him that he had made his supreme effort and that anything further must be bathos he turned abruptly and stalked into his cottage where he drank tea and ate bacon and thought chaotic thoughts and when his appetite declined to carry him more than halfway through the third rasher he understood he was in love  these strong silent men who mean to be headgardeners before they are thirty and eliminate woman from their lives as a dangerous obstacle to the successful career pay a heavy penalty when they do fall in love the average irresponsible young man who has hung about north street on saturday nights walked through the meadows and round by the mill and back home past the creek on sunday afternoons taken his seat in the brake for the annual outing shuffled his way through the polka at the tradesmens ball and generally seized all legitimate opportunities for sporting with amaryllis in the shade has a hundred advantages which your successful careerer lacks there was hardly a moment during the days which followed when tom did not regret his neglected education  for he was not sallys only victim in millbourne that was the trouble her beauty was not of that elusive type which steals imperceptibly into the vision of the rare connoisseur it was sudden and compelling it hit you bright brown eyes beneath a mass of fair hair a determined little chin a slim figurethese are disturbing things and the youths of peaceful millbourne sat up and took notice as one youth throw your mind back to the last musical comedy you saw recall the leading ladys song with chorus of young men all proffering devotion simultaneously in a neat row well that was how the lads of the village comported themselves towards sally  mr and mrs williams till then a highlyesteemed but littlefrequented couple were astonished at the sudden influx of visitors the cottage became practically a salon there was not an evening when the little sittingroom looking out on the garden was not packed it is true that the conversation lacked some of the sparkle generally found in the better class of salon to be absolutely accurate there was hardly any conversation the youths of melbourne were sturdy and honest they were the backbone of england england in her hour of need could have called upon them with the comfortable certainty that unless they happened to be otherwise engaged they would leap to her aid  but they did not shine at smalltalk conversationally they were a spent force after they had asked mr williams how his rheumatism was thereafter they contented themselves with sitting massively about in corners glowering at each other still it was all very jolly and sociable and helped to pass the long evenings and as mrs williams pointed out in reply to some rather strong remarks from mr williams on the subject of packs of young fools who made it impossible for a man to get a quiet smoke in his own home it kept them out of the publichouses  tom kitchener meanwhile observed the invasion with growing dismay shyness barred him from the evening gatherings and what was going on in that house with young bloods like ted pringle albert parsons arthur brown and joe blossom to name four of the most assiduous exercising their fascinations at close range he did not like to think again and again he strove to brace himself up to join the feasts of reason and flows of soul which he knew were taking place nightly around the object of his devotions but every time he failed habit is a terrible thing it shackles the strongest and tom had fallen into the habit of inquiring after mr williams rheumatism over the garden fence first thing in the morning  it was a civil neighbourly thing to do but it annihilated the only excuse he could think of for looking in at night he could not help himself it was like some frightful scourgethe morphine habit or something of that sort every morning he swore to himself that nothing would induce him to mention the subject of rheumatism but no sooner had the stricken old gentlemans head appeared above the fence than out it came  morning mr williams  morning tom  pause indicative of a strong man struggling with himself then  hows the rheumatism mr williams  better thankee tom  and there he was with his guns spiked  however he did not give up he brought to his wooing the same determination which had made him second gardener at the hall at twentyfive he was a novice at the game but instinct told him that a good line of action was to shower gifts he did so all he had to shower was vegetables and he showered them in a way that would have caused the goddess ceres to be talked about his garden became a perfect crater erupting vegetables why vegetables i think i hear some heckler cry why not flowersfresh fair fragrant flowers you can do a lot with flowers girls love them there is poetry in them and what is more there is a recognized language of flowers shoot in a rose or a calceolaria or an herbaceous border or something i gather and you have made a formal proposal of marriage without any of the trouble of rehearsing a long speech and practising appropriate gestures in front of your bedroom lookingglass why then did not thomas kitchener give sally preston flowers well you see unfortunately it was now late autumn and there were no flowers nature had temporarily exhausted her floral blessings and was jogging along with potatoes and artichokes and things love is like that it invariably comes just at the wrong time a few months before there had been enough roses in tom kitcheners garden to win the hearts of a dozen girls now there were only vegetables twas ever thus  it was not to be expected that a devotion so practically displayed should escape comment this was supplied by that shrewd observer old mr williams he spoke seriously to tom across the fence on the subject of his passion  young tom he said drop it  tom muttered unintelligibly mr williams adjusted the tophat without which he never stirred abroad even into his garden he blinked benevolently at tom  youre making up to that young gal of janes he proceeded you cant deceive me all these ptaties and what not i seen your game fast enough just you drop it young tom  why muttered tom rebelliously a sudden distaste for old mr williams blazed within him  why cos youll only burn your fingers if you dont thats why i been watching this young gal of janes and i seen what sort of a young gal she be shes a flipperty piece thats what she be you marry that young gal tom and youll never have no more quiet and happiness shed just take and turn the place upsydown on you the man as marries that young gal has got to be master in his own home hes got to show her whats what now you aint got the devil in you to do that tom youre what i might call a sort of a sheep i admires it in you tom i like to see a young man steady and quiet same as what you be so thats how it is you see just you drop this foolishness young tom and leave that young gal be else youll burn your fingers same as what i say  and giving his tophat a rakish tilt the old gentleman ambled indoors satisfied that he had dropped a guarded hint in a pleasant and tactful manner  it is to be supposed that this interview stung tom to swift action otherwise one cannot explain why he should not have been just as reticent on the subject nearest his heart when bestowing on sally the twentyseventh cabbage as he had been when administering the hundred and sixtieth potato at any rate the fact remains that as that fateful vegetable changed hands across the fence something resembling a proposal of marriage did actually proceed from him as a sustained piece of emotional prose it fell short of the highest standard most of it was lost at the back of his throat and what did emerge was mainly inaudible however as she distinctly caught the word love twice and as tom was shuffling his feet and streaming with perspiration and looking everywhere at once except at her sally grasped the situation whereupon without any visible emotion she accepted him  tom had to ask her to repeat her remark he could not believe his luck it is singular how diffident a normally selfconfident man can become once he is in love when colonel milvery of the hall had informed him of his promotion to the post of second gardener tom had demanded no encore he knew his worth he was perfectly aware that he was a good gardener and official recognition of the fact left him gratified but unperturbed but this affair of sally was quite another matter it had revolutionized his standards of valueforced him to consider himself as a man entirely apart from his skill as a gardener and until this moment he had had grave doubt as to whether apart from his skill as a gardener he amounted to much  he was overwhelmed he kissed sally across the fence humbly sally for her part seemed very unconcerned about it all a more critical man than thomas kitchener might have said that to all appearances the thing rather bored sally  dont tell anybody just yet she stipulated  tom would have given much to be allowed to announce his triumph defiantly to old mr williams to say nothing of making a considerable noise about it in the village but her wish was law and he reluctantly agreed                                       there are moments in a mans life when however enthusiastic a gardener he may be his soul soars above vegetables toms shot with a jerk into the animal kingdom the first present he gave sally in his capacity of fiance was a dog  it was a halfgrown puppy with long legs and a long tail belonging to no one species but generously distributing itself among about six sally loved it and took it with her wherever she went and on one of these rambles down swooped constable cobb the village policeman pointing out that contrary to regulations the puppy had no collar  it is possible that a judicious meekness on sallys part might have averted disaster mr cobb was human and sally was looking particularly attractive that morning meekness however did not come easily to sally in a speech which began as argument and ended mr cobb proving solid and unyielding as pure cheek she utterly routed the constable but her victory was only a moral one for as she turned to go mr cobb dull red and puffing slightly was already entering particulars of the affair in his notebook and sally knew that the last word was with him  on her way back she met tom kitchener he was looking very tough and strong and at the sight of him a halfformed idea which she had regretfully dismissed as impracticable of assaulting constable cobb returned to her in an amended form tom did not know it but the reason why she smiled so radiantly upon him at that moment was that she had just elected him to the post of hired assassin while she did not want constable cobb actually assassinated she earnestly desired him to have his helmet smashed down over his eyes and it seemed to her that tom was the man to do it  she poured out her grievance to him and suggested her scheme she even elaborated it  why shouldnt you wait for him one night and throw him into the creek it isnt deep and its jolly muddy  um said tom doubtfully  it would just teach him she pointed out  but the prospect of undertaking the higher education of the police did not seem to appeal to tom in his heart he rather sympathized with constable cobb he saw the policemans point of view it is all very well to talk but when you are stationed in a sleepy village where no one ever murders or robs or commits arson or even gets drunk and disorderly in the street a puppy without a collar is simply a godsend a man must look out for himself  he tried to make this side of the question clear to sally but failed signally she took a deplorable view of his attitude  i might have known youd have been afraid she said with a contemptuous jerk of her chin good morning  tom flushed he knew he had never been afraid of anything in his life except her but nevertheless the accusation stung and as he was still afraid of her he stammered as he began to deny the charge  oh leave off said sally irritably suck a lozenge  im not afraid said tom condensing his remarks to their minimum as his only chance of being intelligible  you are  im not its just that i  a nasty gleam came into sallys eyes her manner was haughty  it doesnt matter she paused ive no doubt ted pringle will do what i want  for all her contempt she could not keep a touch of uneasiness from her eyes as she prepared to make her next remark there was a look about toms set jaw which made her hesitate but her temper had run away with her and she went on  i am sure he will she said when we became engaged he said that he would do anything for me  there are some speeches that are such conversational knockout blows that one can hardly believe that life will ever pick itself up and go on again after them yet it does the dramatist brings down the curtain on such speeches the novelist blocks his readers path with a zareba of stars but in life there are no curtains no stars nothing final and definiteonly ragged pauses and discomfort there was such a pause now  what do you mean said tom at last you promised to marry me  i know i didand i promised to marry ted pringle  that touch of panic which she could not wholly repress the panic that comes to everyone when a situation has run away with them like a strange unmanageable machine infused a shade too much of the defiant into sallys manner she had wished to be cool even casual but she was beginning to be afraid why she could not have said certainly she did not anticipate violence on toms part perhaps that was it perhaps it was just because he was so quiet that she was afraid she had always looked on him contemptuously as an amiable transparent lout and now he was puzzling her she got an impression of something formidable behind his stolidity something that made her feel mean and insignificant  she fought against the feeling but it gripped her and in spite of herself she found her voice growing shrill and out of control  i promised to marry ted pringle and i promised to marry joe blossom and i promised to marry albert parsons and i was going to promise to marry arthur brown and anybody else who asked me so now you know i told you id make father take me back to london well when he hears that ive promised to marry four different men i bet hell have me home by the first train  she stopped she had more to say but she could not say it she stood looking at him and he looked at her his face was grey and his mouth oddly twisted silence seemed to fall on the whole universe  sally was really afraid now and she knew it she was feeling very small and defenceless in an extremely alarming world she could not have said what it was that had happened to her she only knew that life had become of a sudden very vivid and that her ideas as to what was amusing had undergone a striking change a mans development is a slow and steady process of the yearsa womans a thing of an instant in the silence which followed her words sally had grown up  tom broke the silence  is that true he said  his voice made her start he had spoken quietly but there was a new note in it strange to her just as she could not have said what it was that had happened to her so now she could not have said what had happened to tom he too had changed but how she did not know yet the explanation was simple he also had in a sense grown up he was no longer afraid of her  he stood thinking hours seemed to pass  come along he said at last and he began to move off down the road  sally followed the possibility of refusing did not enter her mind  where are you going she asked it was unbearable this silence  he did not answer  in this fashion he leading she following they went down the road into a lane and through a gate into a field they passed into a second field and as they did so sallys heart gave a leap ted pringle was there  ted pringle was a big young man bigger even than tom kitchener and like tom he was of silent habit he eyed the little procession inquiringly but spoke no word there was a pause  ted said tom theres been a mistake  he stepped quickly to sallys side and the next moment he had swung her off her feet and kissed her  to the type of mind that millbourne breeds actions speak louder than words and ted pringle who had gaped gaped no more he sprang forward and tom pushing sally aside turned to meet him  i cannot help feeling a little sorry for ted pringle in the light of what happened i could wish that it were possible to portray him as a hulking brute of evil appearance and worse moralsthe sort of person concerning whom one could reflect comfortably that he deserved all he got i should like to make him an unsympathetic character over whose downfall the reader would gloat but honesty compels me to own that ted was a thoroughly decent young man in every way he was a good citizen a dutiful son and would certainly have made an excellent husband furthermore in the dispute on hand he had right on his side fully as much as tom the whole affair was one of those elemental clashings of man and man where the historian cannot sympathize with either side at the expense of the other but must confine himself to a mere statement of what occurred and briefly what occurred was that tom bringing to the fray a pentup fury which his adversary had had no time to generate fought ted to a complete standstill in the space of two minutes and a half  sally had watched the proceedings sick and horrified she had never seen men fight before and the terror of it overwhelmed her her vanity received no pleasant stimulation from the thought that it was for her sake that this storm had been let loose for the moment her vanity was dead stunned by collision with the realities she found herself watching in a dream she saw ted fall rise fall again and lie where he had fallen and then she was aware that tom was speaking  come along  she hung back ted was lying very still gruesome ideas presented themselves she had just accepted them as truth when ted wriggled he wriggled again then he sat up suddenly looked at her with unseeing eyes and said something in a thick voice she gave a little sob of relief it was ghastly but not so ghastly as what she had been imagining  somebody touched her arm tom was by her side grim and formidable he was wiping blood from his face  come along  she followed him without a word and presently behold in another field whistling meditatively and regardless of impending ill albert parsons  in everything that he did tom was a man of method he did not depart from his chosen formula  albert he said theres been a mistake  and albert gaped as ted had gaped  tom kissed sally with the gravity of one performing a ritual  the uglinesses of life as we grow accustomed to them lose their power to shock and there is no doubt that sally looked with a different eye upon this second struggle she was conscious of a thrill of excitement very different from the shrinking horror which had seized her before her stunned vanity began to tingle into life again the fight was raging furiously over the trampled turf and quite suddenly as she watched she was aware that her heart was with tom  it was no longer two strange brutes fighting in a field it was her man battling for her sake  she desired overwhelmingly that he should win that he should not be hurt that he should sweep triumphantly over albert parsons as he had swept over ted pringle  unfortunately it was evident even to her that he was being hurt and that he was very far from sweeping triumphantly over albert parsons he had not allowed himself time to recover from his first battle and his blows were slow and weary albert moreover was made of sterner stuff than ted though now a peaceful tender of cows there had been a time in his hot youth when travelling with a circus he had fought week in week out relays of just such rustic warriors as tom he knew their methodstheir headlong rushes their swinging blows they were the merest commonplaces of life to him he slipped tom he sidestepped tom he jabbed tom he did everything to tom that a trained boxer can do to a reckless novice except knock the fight out of him until presently through the sheer labour of hitting he too grew weary  now in the days when albert parsons had fought whole families of toms in an evening he had fought in rounds with the boss holding the watch and halfminute rests and water to refresh him and all orderly and proper today there were no rounds no rests no water and the peaceful tending of cows had caused flesh to grow where there had been only muscle toms headlong rushes became less easy to sidestep his swinging blows more difficult than the scientific counter that shot out to check them as he tired tom seemed to regain strength the tide of the battle began to ebb he clinched and tom threw him off he feinted and while he was feinting tom was on him it was the climax of the battlethe last rally down went albert and stayed down physically he was not finished but in his mind a question had framed itselfthe question was it worth itand he was answering no there were other girls in the world no girl was worth all this trouble  he did not rise  come along said tom  he spoke thickly his breath was coming in gasps he was a terrible spectacle but sally was past the weaker emotions she was back in the stone age and her only feeling was one of passionate pride she tried to speak she struggled to put all she felt into words but something kept her dumb and she followed him in silence  in the lane outside his cottage down by the creek joe blossom was clipping a hedge the sound of footsteps made him turn  he did not recognize tom till he spoke  joe theres been a mistake said tom  been a gunpowder explosion more like said joe a simple practical man what you been doin to your face  shes going to marry me joe  joe eyed sally inquiringly  eh you promised to marry me  she promised to marry all of us you me ted pringle and albert parsons  promisedtomarryallofus  thats where the mistake was shes only going to marry me iive arranged it with ted and albert and now ive come to explain to you joe  you promised to marry  the colossal nature of sallys deceit was plainly troubling joe blossom he expelled his breath in a long note of amazement then he summed up  why youre nothing more nor less than a joshua  the years that had passed since joe had attended the village sundayschool had weakened his once easy familiarity with the characters of the old testament it is possible that he had somebody else in his mind  tom stuck doggedly to his point  you cant marry her joe  joe blossom raised his shears and clipped a protruding branch the point under discussion seemed to have ceased to interest him  who wants to he said good riddance  they went down the lane silence still brooded over them the words she wanted continued to evade her  they came to a grassy bank tom sat down he was feeling unutterably tired  tom  he looked up his mind was working dizzily  youre going to marry me he muttered  she sat down beside him  i know she said tom dear lay your head on my lap and go to sleep  if this story proves anything beyond the advantage of being in good training when you fight it proves that you cannot get away from the moving pictures even in a place like millbourne for as sally sat there nursing tom it suddenly struck her that this was the very situation with which that romance of the middle ages film ended you know the one i mean sir percival ye something which has slipped my memory for the moment goes out after the holy grail meets damsel in distress overcomes her persecutors rescues her gets wounded and is nursed back to life in her arms sally had seen it a dozen times and every time she had reflected that the days of romance are dead and that that sort of thing cant happen nowadays     deep waters   historians of the social life of the later roman empire speak of a certain young man of ariminum who would jump into rivers and swim in em when his friends said you fish he would answer oh pish fish cant swim like me theyve no vim in em  just such another was george barnert callender  on land in his land clothes george was a young man who excited little remark he looked very much like other young men he was much about the ordinary height his carriage suggested the possession of an ordinary amount of physical strength such was georgeon shore but remove his clothes drape him in a bathingsuit and insert him in the water and instantly like the gentleman in the tempest he suffered a seachange into something rich and strange other men puffed snorted and splashed george passed through the ocean with the silent dignity of a torpedo other men swallowed water here a mouthful there a pint anon maybe a quart or so and returned to the shore like foundering derelicts georges mouth had all the exclusiveness of a fashionable club his breaststroke was a thing to see and wonder at when he did the crawl strong men gasped when he swam on his back you felt that that was the only possible method of progression  george came to marvis bay at about five oclock one evening in july marvis bay has a wellestablished reputation as a summer resort and while not perhaps in every respect the paradise which the excitable writer of the local guidebook asserts it to be on the whole it earns its reputation its sands are smooth and firm sloping almost imperceptibly into the ocean there is surf for those who like it and smoother water beyond for those whose ideals in bathing are not confined to jumping up and down on a given jellyfish at the northern end of the beach there is a long pier it was to this that george made his way on his arrival  it was pleasant on the pier once you had passed the initial zareba of fruit stands souvenir stands icecream stands and the lair of the enthusiast whose aim in life it was to sell you picture postcards and had won through to the long walk where the seats were you were practically alone with nature at this hour of the day the place was deserted george had it to himself he strolled slowly along the water glittered under the sunrays breaking into a flurry of white foam as it reached the beach a cool breeze blew the whole scenic arrangements were a great improvement on the stuffy city he had left not that george had come to marvis bay with the single aim of finding an antidote to metropolitan stuffiness there was a more important reason in three days marvis bay was to be the scene of the production of fates footballs a comedy in four acts by g barnert callender for george though you would not have suspected it from his exterior was one of those in whose cerebra the grey matter splashes restlessly about producing strong curtains and crisp dialogue the company was due at marvis bay on the following evening for the last spasm of rehearsals  georges mind as he paced the pier was divided between the beauties of nature and the forthcoming crisis in his affairs in the ratio of oneeighth to the former and seveneighths to the latter at the moment when he had left london thoroughly disgusted with the entire theatrical world in general and the company which was rehearsing fates footballs in particular rehearsals had just reached that stage of brisk delirium when the author toys with his bottle of poison and the stagemanager becomes icily polite the footpillsas arthur mifflin the leading juvenile in the great play insisted upon calling it much to georges disapprovalwas his first piece never before had he been in one of those kitchens where many cooks prepare and sometimes spoil the theatrical broth consequently the chaos seemed to him unique had he been a more experienced dramatist he would have said to himself twas ever thus as it was what he said to himselfand otherswas more forcible  he was trying to dismiss the whole thing from his minda feat which had hitherto proved beyond his powerswhen fate in an unusually kindly mood enabled him to do so in a flash by presenting to his jaundiced gaze what on consideration he decided was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen when a mans afraid shrewdly sings the bard a beautiful maid is a cheering sight to see in the present instance the sight acted on george like a tonic he forgot that the lady to whom an injudicious management had assigned the role of heroine in fates footballs invariablyno doubt from the best motivesomitted to give the cynical roue his cue for the big speech in act iii his mind no longer dwelt on the fact that arthur mifflin an estimable person in private life and one who had been a friend of his at cambridge preferred to deliver the impassioned lines of the great renunciation scene in a manner suggesting a small boy and a sufferer from nasal catarrh at that speaking a piece at a sundayschool treat the recollection of the hideous depression and gloom which the leading comedian had radiated in great clouds fled from him like some grisly nightmare before the goddess of day every cell in his brain was occupied to the exclusion of all other thoughts by the girl swimming in the water below  she swam well his practised eye saw that her strong easy strokes carried her swiftly over the swell of the waves he stared transfixed he was a wellbroughtup young man and he knew how illbred it was to stare but this was a special occasion ordinary rules of conventional etiquette could not apply to a case like this he stared more he gaped as the girl passed on into the shadow of the pier he leaned farther over the rail and his neck extended in joints like a telescope  at this point the girl turned to swim on her back her eyes met his hers were deep and clear his bulging for what seemed an eternity to george she continued to look at him then turning over again she shot past under the pier  georges neck was now at its full stretch no power of will or muscle could add another yard to it realizing this he leaned farther over the rail and farther still his hat slid from his hand he grabbed at it and overbalancing fell with a splash into the water  now in ordinary circumstances to fall twelve feet into the ocean with all his clothes on would have incommoded george little he would hardly have noticed it he would have swum to shore with merely a feeling of amused selfreproach akin to that of the man who absentmindedly walks into a lamppost in the street when therefore he came to the surface he prepared without agitation to strike out in his usual bold fashion at this moment however two hands grasping him beneath the arms lifted his head still farther from the waves and a voice in his ear said keep still dont struggle theres no danger  george did not struggle his brain working with the cool rapidity of a buzzsaw in an icebox had planned a line of action few things are more difficult in this world for a young man than the securing of an introduction to the right girl under just the right conditions when he is looking his best he is presented to her in the midst of a crowd and is swept away after a rapid handshake when there is no crowd he has toothache or the sun has just begun to make his nose peel thousands of young lives have been saddened in this manner  how different was georges case by this simple accident he reflected as helping the good work along with an occasional surreptitious legstroke he was towed shorewards there had been formed an acquaintanceship if nothing more which could not lightly be broken a girl who has saved a man from drowning cannot pass him by next day with a formal bow and what a girl too there had been a time in extreme youth when his feminine ideal was the sort of girl who has fuzzy golden hair and drops things indeed in his first year at the university he had saidand writtenas much to one of the type the episode concluding with a strong little drama in which a wrathful chequesigning father had starred supported by a subdued misogynistic son which things aided by the march of time had turned georges tastes towards the healthy openair girl who did things instead of dropping them  the pleasantest functions must come to an end sooner or later and in due season george felt his heels grate on the sand his preserver loosed her hold they stood up and faced each other george began to express his gratitude as best he couldit was not easy to find neat convincing sentences on the spur of the momentbut she cut him short  of course it was nothing nothing at all she said brushing the seawater from her eyes it was just lucky i happened to be there  it was splendid said the infatuated dramatist it was magnificent it  he saw that she was smiling  youre very wet she said  george glanced down at his soaked clothes it had been a nice suit once  hadnt you better hurry back and change into something dry  looking round about him george perceived that sundry of the inquisitive were swooping down with speculation in their eyes it was time to depart  have you far to go  not far im staying at the beach view hotel  why so am i i hope we shall meet again  we shall said george confidently  how did you happen to fall in  i waseri was looking at something in the water  i thought you were said the girl quietly  george blushed  i know he said it was abominably rude of me to stare like that but  you should learn to swim interrupted the girl i cant understand why every boy in the country isnt made to learn to swim before hes ten years old and it isnt a bit difficult really i could teach you in a week  the struggle between george and georges conscience was brief the conscience weak by nature and flabby from long want of exercise had no sort of chance from the start  i wish you would said george and with those words he realized that he had definitely committed himself to his hypocritical role till that moment explanation would have been difficult but possible now it was impossible  i will said the girl ill start tomorrow if you like she waded into the water  well talk it over at the hotel she said hastily here comes a crowd of horrid people im going to swim out again  she hurried into deeper water while george turning made his way through a growing throng of goggling spectators of the fifteen who got within speaking distance of him six told him that he was wet the other nine asked him if he had fallen                                       her name was vaughan and she was visiting marvis bay in company with an aunt so much george ascertained from the management of the hotel later after dinner meeting both ladies on the esplanade he gleaned further informationto wit that her first name was mary that her aunt was glad to make his acquaintance liked marvis bay but preferred trouville and thought it was getting a little chilly and would go indoors  the elimination of the third factor had a restorative effect upon georges conversation which had begun to languish in feminine society as a rule he was apt to be constrained but with mary vaughan it was different within a couple of minutes he was pouring out his troubles the cuewithholding leading lady the sticklike mifflin the funereal comedianup they all came and she gently sympathetic was endeavouring not without success to prove to him that things were not so bad as they seemed  its sure to be all right on the night she said  how rare is the combination of beauty and intelligence george thought he had never heard such a clearheaded wellexpressed remark  i suppose it will he said but they were very bad when i left mifflin for instance he seems to think nature intended him for a napoleon of advertising he has a bee in his bonnet about booming the piece sits up at nights when he ought to be sleeping or studying his part thinking out new schemes for advertising the show and the comedian his speciality is drawing me aside and asking me to write in new scenes for him i couldnt stand it any longer i just came away and left them to fight it out among themselves  im sure you have no need to worry a play with such a good story is certain to succeed  george had previously obliged with a brief description of the plot of the footpills  did you like the story he said tenderly  i thought it was fine  how sympathetic you are cooed george glutinously edging a little closer do you know  shall we be going back to the hotel said the girl                                       those noisome creatures the hired murderers of fates footpills descended upon marvis bay early next afternoon and george meeting them at the station in reluctant pursuance of a promise given to arthur mifflin felt moodily that if only they could make their acting onehalf as full of colour as their clothes the play would be one of the most pronounced successes of modern times in the forefront gleamed like the white plumes of navarre the light flannel suit of arthur mifflin the woodenest juvenile in captivity  his woodenness was however confined to stage rehearsals it may be mentioned that once the run of a piece had begun he was sufficiently volatile and in private life he was almost excessively soa fact which had been noted at an early date by the keeneyed authorities of his university the discovery leading to his tearing himself away from alma mater by request with some suddenness he was a long slender youth with green eyes jetblack hair and a passionate fondness for the sound of his own voice  well here we are he said kicking breezily at georges leg with his cane  i saw you said george coldly sidestepping  the whole team continued mr mifflin all bright bonny and trained to the minute  what happened after i left george asked has anybody begun to act yet or are they waiting till the dressrehearsal  the rehearsals admitted mr mifflin handsomely werent perfect but you wait itll be all right on the night  george thought he had never heard such a futile vapid remark  besides said mr mifflin i have an idea which will make the show lend me your earboth ears you shall have them back tell me what pulls people into a theatre a good play sometimes but failing that as in the present case what fine acting by the leading juvenile we have that but it is not enough no my boy advertisement is the thing look at all these men on the beach are they going to roll in of their own free wills to see a play like the footpills not on your life about the time the curtain rises every man of them will be sitting in his own private corner of the beach  how many corners do you think the beach has  gazing into a girls eyes singing shine on thou harvest moon and telling her how his boss is practically dependent on his advice you know  i dont said george coldly  unless proceeded mr mifflin we advertise and by advertise i mean advertise in the right way we have a pressagent but for all the good he does he might be back on the old farm gathering in the hay luckily for us i am among those present i have brains i have resource whats that  i said nothing  i thought you did well i have an idea which will drag these people like a magnet i thought it out coming down in the train  what is it  ill tell you later there are a few details to be worked upon first meanwhile let us trickle to the seafront and take a sail in one of those boats i am at my best in a boat i rather fancy nature intended me for a viking  matters having been arranged with the financier to whom the boat belonged they set forth mr mifflin having remarked yoho in a meditative voice seated himself at the helm somewhat saddened by his failure to borrow a quid of tobacco from the ocean beautys proprietor for as he justly observed without properties and makeup where were you george being skilled in the ways of boats was in charge of the sheet the summer day had lost its oppressive heat the sun no longer beat down on the face of the waters a fresh breeze had sprung up george manipulating the sheet automatically fell into a reverie a moment comes in the life of every man when an inward voice whispers to him this is the one in georges case the voice had not whispered it had shouted from now onward there could be but one woman in the world for him from now onwardsthe ocean beauty gave a sudden plunge george woke up  what the deuce are you doing with that tiller he inquired  my gentle somnambulist said mr mifflin aggrieved i was doing nothing with this tiller we will now form a commission to inquire into what you were doing with that sheet were you asleep  my fault said george i was thinking  if you must break the habit of a lifetime said mr mifflin complainingly i wish you would wait till we get ashore you nearly upset us  it shant happen again they are tricky these sailing boatsturn over in a second whatever you do dont get her broadside on theres more breeze out here than i thought there was  mr mifflin uttered a startled exclamation  whats the matter asked george  just like a flash said mr mifflin complacently its always the way with me give me time and the artistic idea is bound to come just some little thought some little apparently obvious idea which stamps the man of genius it beats me why i didnt think of it before why of course a costume piece with a male star is a hundred times more effective  what are you talking about  i see now continued mr mifflin that there was a flaw in my original plan my idea was this we were talking in the train about the bathing down here and jane happened to say she could swim some and it suddenly came to me  jane was the leading woman she who omitted to give cues  i said to myself george is a sportsman he will be delighted to do a little thing like that  like to do what  why rescue jane  what  she and you said mr mifflin were to go in swimming together while i waited on the sands holding our boneheaded pressagent on a leash about a hundred yards from the shore up go her arms piercing scream agitated crowds on the beach what is the matter what has happened a touch of cramp will she be drowned no g barnert callender author of fates footballs which opens at the beach theatre on monday evening next at eightfifteen sharp will save her see he has her he is bringing her in she is safe how pleased her mother will be and the public what a bit of luck for them they will be able to see her act at eightfifteen sharp on monday after all back you come to the shore cheering crowds weeping women strong situation i unleash the pressagent and off he shoots in time to get the story into the evening paper it was a great idea but i see now there were one or two flaws in it  you do do you said george  it occurs to me on reflection that after all you wouldnt have agreed to it a something i dont know what which is lacking in your nature would have made you reject the scheme  im glad that occurred to you  and a far greater flaw was that it was too altruistic it boomed you and it boomed jane but i didnt get a thing out of it my revised scheme is a thousand times better in every way  dont say you have another  i have and added mr mifflin with modest pride it is a winner this time i unhesitatingly assert that i have the goods in about one minute from now you will hear me exclaim in a clear musical voice the single word jump that is your cue to leap over the side as quick as you can move for at that precise moment this spanking craft is going to capsize  george spun round in his seat mr mifflins face was shining with kindly enthusiasm the shore was at least two hundred yards away and that morning he had had his first swimminglesson  a movement of the tiller will do it these accidents are common objects of the seashore i may mention that i can swim just enough to keep myself afloat so its up to you i wouldnt do this for everyone but seeing that we were boys togetherare you ready  stop cried george dont do it listen  are you ready  the ocean beauty gave a plunge  you lunatic listen to me it  jump said mr mifflin  george came to the surface some yards from the overturned boat and looking round for mr mifflin discovered that great thinker treading water a few feet away  get to work george he remarked  it is not easy to shake ones fist at a man when in deep water but george managed it  for twopence he cried id leave you to look after yourself  you can do better than that said mr mifflin ill give you threepence to tow me in hurry up its cold  in gloomy silence george gripped him by the elbows mr mifflin looked over his shoulder  we shall have a good house he said the stalls are full already and the dresscircles filling work away george youre doing fine this act is going to be a scream from start to finish  with pleasant conversation he endeavoured to while away the monotony of the journey but george made no reply he was doing some rapid thinking with ordinary luck he felt bitterly all would have been well he could have gone on splashing vigorously under his teachers care for a week gradually improving till he emerged into a reasonably proficient swimmer but now in an age of miracles he might have explained away his present performance but how was he toand then there came to him an ideasimple as all great ideas are but magnificent  he stopped and trod water  tired said mr mifflin well take a rest he added kindly take a rest no need to hurry  look here said george this piece is going to be recast were going to exchange parts youre rescuing me see never mind why i havent time to explain it to you now do you understand  no said mr mifflin  ill get behind you and push you but dont forget when we get to the shore that youve done the rescuing  mr mifflin pondered  is this wise he said it is a strong part the rescuer but im not sure the other wouldnt suit my style better the silent handgrip the catch in the voice you want a practised actor for that i dont think youd be up to it george  never mind about me thats how its going to be  mr mifflin pondered once more  no he said at length it wouldnt do you mean well george but it would kill the show well go on as before  will we said george unpleasantly would you like to know what im going to do to you then im going to hit you very hard under the jaw and im going to take hold of your neck and squeeze it till you lose consciousness and then im going to drag you to the beach and tell people i had to hit you because you lost your head and struggled  mr mifflin pondered for the third time  you are he said  i am said george  then said mr mifflin cordially say no more i take your point my objections are removed but he concluded this is the last time i come bathing with you george  mr mifflins artistic misgivings as to his colleagues ability to handle so subtle a part as that of rescuee were more than justified on their arrival a large and interested audience had collected by the time they reached the shore an audience to which any artist should have been glad to play but george forcing his way through hurried to the hotel without attempting to satisfy them not a single silent handshake did he bestow on his rescuer there was no catch in his voice as he made the one remark which he did maketo a man with whiskers who asked him if the boat had upset as an exhibition of rapid footwork his performance was good in other respects it was poor  he had just changed his wet clothesit seemed to him that he had been doing nothing but change his wet clothes since he had come to marvis baywhen mr mifflin entered in a bathrobe  they lent me this downstairs he explained while they dried my clothes they would do anything for me im the popular hero my boy you made the mistake of your life when you threw up the rescuer part it has all the fat i see that now the rescuer plays the other man off the stage every time ive just been interviewed by the fellow on the local newspaper hes correspondent to a couple of london papers the country will ring with this thing ive told them all the parts ive ever played and my favourite breakfast food theres a man coming up to take my photograph tomorrow footpills stock has gone up with a run wait till monday and see what sort of a house we shall draw by the way the reporter fellow said one funny thing he asked if you werent the same man who was rescued yesterday by a girl i said of course notthat you had only come down yesterday but he stuck to it that you were  he was quite right  what  i was  mr mifflin sat down on the bed  this fellow fell off the pier and a girl brought him in  george nodded  and that was you  george nodded  mr mifflins eyes opened wide  its the heat he declared finally that and the worry of rehearsals i expect a doctor could give the technical name for it its a whatdoyoucallitan obsession you often hear of cases fellows who are absolutely sane really but cracked on one particular subject some of them think theyre teapots and things youve got a craving for being rescued from drowning what happens old man do you suddenly get the delusion that you cant swim no it cant be that because you were doing all the swimming for the two of us just now i dont know though maybe you didnt realize that you were swimming  george finished lacing his shoe and looked up  listen he said ill talk slow so that you can understand suppose you fell off a pier and a girl took a great deal of trouble to get you to the shore would you say much obliged but you neednt have been so officious i can swim perfectly well  mr mifflin considered this point intelligence began to dawn in his face there is more in this than meets the eye he said tell me all  this morninggeorges voice grew dreamyshe gave me a swimminglesson she thought it was my first dont cackle like that theres nothing to laugh at  mr mifflin contradicted this assertion  there is you he said simply this should be a lesson to you george avoid deceit in future be simple and straightforward take me as your model you have managed to scrape through this time dont risk it again you are young there is still time to make a fresh start it only needs willpower meanwhile lend me something to wear they are going to take a week drying my clothes                                       there was a rehearsal at the beach theatre that evening george attended it in a spirit of resignation and left it in one of elation three days had passed since his last sight of the company at work and in those three days apparently the impossible had been achieved there was a snap and go about the piece now the leading lady had at length mastered that cue and gave it out with belllike clearness arthur mifflin as if refreshed and braced by his saltwater bath was infusing a welcome vigour into his part and even the comedian george could not help admitting showed signs of being on the eve of becoming funny it was with a light heart and a light step that he made his way back to the hotel  in the veranda were a number of basketchairs only one was occupied he recognized the occupant  ive just come back from a rehearsal he said seating himself beside her  really  the whole thing is different he went on buoyantly they know their lines they act as if they meant it arthur mifflins fine the comedians improved till you wouldnt know him im awfully pleased about it  really  george felt damped  i thought you might be pleased too he said lamely  of course i am glad that things are going well your accident this afternoon was lucky too in a way was it not it will interest people in the play  you heard about it  i have been hearing about nothing else  curious it happening so soon after  and so soon before the production of your play most curious  there was a silence george began to feel uneasy you could never tell with women of course it might be nothing but it looked uncommonly as if  he changed the subject  how is your aunt this evening miss vaughan  quite well thank you she went in she found it a little chilly  george heartily commended her good sense a little chilly did not begin to express it if the girl had been like this all the evening he wondered her aunt had not caught pneumonia he tried again  will you have time to give me another lesson tomorrow he said  she turned on him  mr callender dont you think this farce has gone on long enough  once in the dear dead days beyond recall when but a happy child george had been smitten unexpectedly by a sportive playmate a bare halfinch below his third waistcoatbutton the resulting emotions were still green in his memory as he had felt then so did he feel now  miss vaughan i dont understand  really  what have i done  you have forgotten how to swim  a warm and prickly sensation began to manifest itself in the region of georges forehead  forgotten  forgotten and in a few months i thought i had seen you before and today i remembered it was just about this time last year that i saw you at hayling island swimming perfectly wonderfully and today you are taking lessons can you explain it  a froglike croak was the best george could do in that line  she went on  business is business i suppose and a play has to be advertised somehow but  you dont think croaked george  i should have thought it rather beneath the dignity of an author but of course you know your own business best only i object to being a conspirator i am sorry for your sake that yesterdays episode attracted so little attention today it was much more satisfactory wasnt it i am so glad  there was a massive silence for about a hundred years  i think ill go for a short stroll said george                                       scarcely had he disappeared when the long form of mr mifflin emerged from the shadow beyond the veranda  could you spare me a moment  the girl looked up the man was a stranger she inclined her head coldly  my name is mifflin said the other dropping comfortably into the chair which had held the remains of george  the girl inclined her head again more coldly but it took more than that to embarrass mr mifflin dynamite might have done it but not coldness  the mifflin he explained crossing his legs i overheard your conversation just now  you were listening said the girl scornfully  for all i was worth said mr mifflin these things are very much a matter of habit for years i have been playing in pieces where i have had to stand concealed up stage drinking in the private conversation of other people and the thing has become a second nature to me however leaving that point for a moment what i wish to say is that i heard youunknowingly of coursedoing a good man a grave injustice  mr callender could have defended himself if he had wished  i was not referring to george the injustice was to myself  to you  i was the sole author of this afternoons little drama i like george but i cannot permit him to pose in any way as my collaborator george has oldfashioned ideas he does not keep abreast of the times he can write plays but he needs a man with a big brain to boom them for him so far from being entitled to any credit for this afternoons work he was actually opposed to it  then why did he pretend you had saved him she demanded  georges said mr mifflin is essentially a chivalrous nature at any crisis demanding a display of the finer feelings he is there with the goods before you can turn round his friends frequently wrangle warmly as to whether he is most like bayard lancelot or happy hooligan some say one some the other it seems that yesterday you saved him from a watery grave without giving him time to explain that he could save himself what could he do he said to himself she must never know and acted accordingly but let us leave george and return  thank you mr mifflin there was a break in her laugh i dont think there is any necessity i think i understand now it was very clever of you  it was more than cleverness said mr mifflin rising it was genius                                       a white form came to meet george as he reentered the veranda  mr callender  he stopped  im very sorry i said such horrid things to you just now i have been talking to mr mifflin and i want to say i think it was ever so nice and thoughtful of you i understand everything  george did not by a good deal but he understood sufficient for his needs he shot forward as if some strong hand were behind him with a needle  miss vaughanmaryi  i think i hear aunt calling said she                                       but a benevolent providence has ordained that aunts cannot call for ever and it is on record that when george entered his box on the two hundredth night of that great london success fates footballs he did not enter it alone     when doctors disagree   it is possible that at about the time at which this story opens you may have gone into the hotel belvoir for a haircut many people did for the young man behind the scissors though of a singularly gloomy countenance was undoubtedly an artist in his line he clipped judiciously he left no ridges he never talked about the weather and he allowed you to go away unburdened by any bottle of hairfood  it is possible too that being there you decided that you might as well go the whole hog and be manicured at the same time  it is not unlikely moreover that when you had got over the first shock of finding your hands so unexpectedly large and red you felt disposed to chat with the young lady who looked after that branch of the business in your genial way you may have permitted a note of gay but gentlemanly badinage to creep into your end of the dialogue  in which case if you had raised your eyes to the mirror you would certainly have observed a marked increase of gloom in the demeanour of the young man attending to your apex he took no official notice of the matter a quick frown a tightening of the lips nothing more jealous as arthur welsh was of all who inflicted gay badinage however gentlemanly on maud peters he never forgot that he was an artist never even in his blackest moments had he yielded to the temptation to dig the point of the scissors the merest fraction of an inch into a clients skull  but maud who saw would understand and if the customer was an observant man he would notice that her replies at that juncture became somewhat absent her smile a little mechanical                                       jealousy according to an eminent authority is the hydra of calamities the sevenfold death arthur welshs was all that and a bit over it was a constant shadow on mauds happiness no fairminded girl objects to a certain tinge of jealousy kept within proper bounds it is a compliment it makes for piquancy it is the gin in the gingerbeer of devotion but it should be a condiment not a fluid  it was the unfairness of the thing which hurt maud her conscience was clear she knew girlsseveral girlswho gave the young men with whom they walked out ample excuse for being perfect othellos if she had ever flirted on the open beach with the baritone of the troupe of pierrots like jane oddy she could have excused arthurs attitude if like pauline dicey she had rollerskated for a solid hour with a blackmoustached stranger while her fiance floundered in mugs alley she could have understood his frowning disapprovingly but she was not like pauline she scorned the coquetries of jane arthur was the centre of her world and he knew it ever since the rainy evening when he had sheltered her under his umbrella to her tube station he had known perfectly well how things were with her and yet just because in a strictly businesslike way she was civil to her customers he must scowl and bite his lip and behave generally as if it had been brought to his notice that he had been nurturing a serpent in his bosom it was worse than wickedit was unprofessional  she remonstrated with him  it isnt fair she said one morning when the rush of customers had ceased and they had the shop to themselves  matters had been worse than usual that morning after days of rain and greyness the weather had turned over a new leaf the sun glinted among the bottles of unfailing lotion in the window and everything in the world seemed to have relaxed and become cheerful unfortunately everything had included the customers during the last few days they had taken their seats in moist gloom and brooding over the prospect of coming colds in the head had had little that was pleasant to say to the divinity who was shaping their ends but today it had been different warm and happy they had bubbled over with gay smalltalk  it isnt fair she repeated  arthur who was stropping a razor and whistling tunelessly raised his eyebrows his manner was frosty  i fail to understand your meaning he said  you know what i mean do you think i didnt see you frowning when i was doing that gentlemans nails  the allusion was to the client who had just lefta jovial individual with a red face who certainly had made maud giggle a good deal and why not if a gentleman tells really funny stories what harm is there in giggling you had to be pleasant to people if you snubbed customers what happened why sooner or later it got round to the boss and then where were you besides it was not as if the redfaced customer had been rude write down on paper what he had said to her and nobody could object to it write down on paper what she had said to him and you couldnt object to that either it was just arthurs silliness  she tossed her head  i am gratified said arthur ponderouslyin happier moments maud had admired his gift of language he read a great deal encyclopedias and papers and thingsi am gratified to find that you had time to bestow a glance on me you appeared absorbed  maud sniffed unhappily she had meant to be cold and dignified throughout the conversation but the sense of her wrongs was beginning to be too much for her a large tear splashed on to her tray of orangesticks she wiped it away with the chamois leather  it isnt fair she sobbed it isnt you know i cant help it if gentlemen talk and joke with me you know its all in the days work im expected to be civil to gentlemen who come in to have their hands done silly i should look sitting as if id swallowed a poker i do think you might understand arthur you being in the profession yourself  he coughed  it isnt so much that you talk to them as that you seem to like  he stopped mauds dignity had melted completely her face was buried in her arms she did not care if a million customers came in all at the same time  maud  she heard him moving towards her but she did not look up the next moment his arms were round her and he was babbling  and a customer pushing open the door unnoticed two minutes later retired hurriedly to get shaved elsewhere doubting whether arthurs mind was on his job  for a time this little thunderstorm undoubtedly cleared the air for a day or two maud was happier than she ever remembered to have been arthurs behaviour was unexceptionable he bought her a wristwatch light brown leather very smart he gave her some chocolates to eat in the tube he entertained her with amazing statistics culled from the weekly paper which he bought on tuesdays he was in short the perfect lover on the second day the redfaced man came in again arthur joined in the laughter at his stories everything seemed ideal  it could not last gradually things slipped back into the old routine maud looking up from her work would see the frown and the bitten lip she began again to feel uncomfortable and selfconscious as she worked sometimes their conversation on the way to the tube was almost formal  it was useless to say anything she had a wholesome horror of being one of those women who nagged and she felt that to complain again would amount to nagging she tried to put the thing out of her mind but it insisted on staying there in a way she understood his feelings he loved her so much she supposed that he hated the idea of her exchanging a single word with another man this in the abstract was gratifying but in practice it distressed her she wished she were some sort of foreigner so that nobody could talk to her but then they would look at her and that probably would produce much the same results it was a hard world for a girl  and then the strange thing happened arthur reformed one might almost say that he reformed with a jerk it was a parallel case to those sudden conversions at welsh revival meetings on monday evening he had been at his worst on the following morning he was a changed man not even after the original thunderstorm had he been more docile maud could not believe that first the lip once bitten was stretched in a smile she looked for the frown it was not there  next day it was the same and the day after that when a week had gone by and still the improvement was maintained maud felt that she might now look upon it as permanent a great load seemed to have been taken off her mind she revised her views on the world it was a very good world quite one of the best with arthur beaming upon it like a sun  a number of eminent poets and essayists in the course of the last few centuries have recorded in their several ways their opinion that one can have too much of a good thing the truth applies even to such a good thing as absence of jealousy little by little maud began to grow uneasy it began to come home to her that she preferred the old arthur of the scowl and the gnawed lip of him she had at least been sure whatever discomfort she may have suffered from his spirited imitations of othello at any rate they had proved that he loved her she would have accepted gladly an equal amount of discomfort now in exchange for the same certainty she could not read this new arthur his thoughts were a closed book superficially he was all that she could have wished he still continued to escort her to the tube to buy her occasional presents to tap when conversing the pleasantly sentimental vein but now these things were not enough her heart was troubled her thoughts frightened her the little black imp at the back of her mind kept whispering and whispering till at last she was forced to listen hes tired of you he doesnt love you any more hes tired of you                                       it is not everybody who in times of mental stress can find ready to hand among his or her personal acquaintances an expert counsellor prepared at a moments notice to listen with sympathy and advise with tact and skill everyones world is full of friends relatives and others who will give advice on any subject that may be presented to them but there are crises in life which cannot be left to the amateur it is the aim of a certain widely read class of paper to fill this void  of this class fireside chat was one of the bestknown representatives in exchange for one penny its five hundred thousand readers received every week a serial story about life in highest circles a short story packed with heartinterest articles on the removal of stains and the best method of coping with the cold mutton anecdotes of royalty photographs of peeresses hints on dress chats about baby brief but pointed dialogues between blogson and snogson poems great thoughts from the dead and brainy halfhours in the editors cosy sanctum a slab of brown paper andthe journals leading featureadvice on matters of the heart the weekly contribution of the advice specialist of fireside chat entitled in the consulting room by dr cupid was made up mainly of answers to correspondents he affected the bedside manner of the kind breezy old physician and probably gave a good deal of comfort at any rate he always seemed to have plenty of cases on his hands  it was to this expert that maud took her trouble she had been a regular reader of the paper for several years and had indeed consulted the great man once before when he had replied favourably to her query as to whether it would be right for her to accept caramels from arthur then almost a stranger it was only natural that she should go to him now in an even greater dilemma the letter was not easy to write but she finished it at last and after an anxious interval judgement was delivered as follows  well well well bless my soul what is all this m p writes me  i am a young lady and until recently was very very happy except that my fiance though truly loving me was of a very jealous disposition though i am sure i gave him no cause he would scowl when i spoke to any other man and this used to make me unhappy but for some time now he has quite changed and does not seem to mind at all and though at first this made me feel happy to think that he had got over his jealousy i now feel unhappy because i am beginning to be afraid that he no longer cares for me do you think this is so and what ought i to do  my dear young lady i should like to be able to reassure you but it is kindest sometimes you know to be candid however it may hurt it has been my experience that when jealousy flies out of the window indifference comes in at the door in the old days a knight would joust for the love of a ladye risking physical injury rather than permit others to rival him in her affections i think m p that you should endeavour to discover the true state of your fiances feelings i do not of course advocate anything in the shape of unwomanly behaviour of which i am sure my dear young lady you are incapable but i think that you should certainly try to pique your fiance to test him at your next ball for instance refuse him a certain number of dances on the plea that your programme is full at gardenparties athomes and so on exhibit pleasure in the society and conversation of other gentlemen and mark his demeanour as you do so these little tests should serve either to relieve your apprehensions provided they are groundless or to show you the truth and after all if it is the truth it must be faced must it not m p  before the end of the day maud knew the whole passage by heart the more her mind dwelt on it the more clearly did it seem to express what she had felt but could not put into words the point about jousting struck her as particularly well taken she had looked up joust in the dictionary and it seemed to her that in these few words was contained the kernel of her trouble in the old days if any man had attempted to rival him in her affections outside business hours arthur would undoubtedly have joustedand jousted with the vigour of one who means to make his presence felt now in similar circumstances he would probably step aside politely as who should say after you my dear alphonse  there was no time to lose an hour after her first perusal of dr cupids advice maud had begun to act upon it by the time the first lull in the mornings work had come and there was a chance for private conversation she had invented an imaginary young man a shadowy lothario who being introduced into her home on the previous sunday by her brother horace had carried on in a way you wouldnt believe paying all manner of compliments  he said i had such white hands said maud  arthur nodded stropping a razor the while he appeared to be bearing the revelations with complete fortitude yet only a few weeks before a customers comment on this same whiteness had stirred him to his depths  and this morningwhat do you think why he meets me as bold as you please and gives me a cake of toilet soap like his impudence  she paused hopefully  always useful soap said arthur politely sententious  lovely it was went on maud dully conscious of failure but stippling in like an artist the little touches which give atmosphere and verisimilitude to a story all scented horace will tease me about it i can tell you  she paused surely he mustwhy a seaanemone would be torn with jealousy at such a tale  arthur did not even wince he was charming about it thought it very kind of the young fellow didnt blame him for being struck by the whiteness of her hands touched on the history of soap which he happened to have been reading up in the encyclopedia at the free library and behaved altogether in such a thoroughly gentlemanly fashion that maud stayed awake half the night crying                                       if maud had waited another twentyfour hours there would have been no need for her to have taxed her powers of invention for on the following day there entered the shop and her life a young man who was not imaginarya lothario of flesh and blood he made his entry with that air of having bought most of the neighbouring property which belongs exclusively to minor actors men of weight on the stock exchange and american professional pugilists  mr skipper shute belonged to the lastnamed of the three classes he had arrived in england two months previously for the purpose of holding a conference at eightstone four with one joseph edwardes to settle a question of superiority at that weight which had been vexing the sporting public of two countries for over a year having successfully outargued mr edwardes mainly by means of strenuous work in the clinches he was now on the eve of starting on a lucrative musichall tour with his celebrated inaudible monologue as a result of these things he was feeling very very pleased with the world in general and with mr skipper shute in particular and when mr shute was pleased with himself his manner was apt to be of the breeziest  he breezed into the shop took a seat and having cast an experienced eye at maud and found her pleasing extended both hands and observed go the limit kid  at any other time maud might have resented being addressed as kid by a customer but now she welcomed it with the exception of a slight thickening of the lobe of one ear mr shute bore no outward signs of his profession and being to use his own phrase a swell dresser he was really a most presentable young man just in fact what maud needed she saw in him her last hope if any faint spark of his ancient fire still lingered in arthur it was through mr shute that it must be fanned  she smiled upon mr shute she worked on his robust fingers as if it were an artistic treat to be permitted to handle them so carefully did she toil that she was still busy when arthur taking off his apron and putting on his hat went out for his twentyminutes lunch leaving them alone together  the door had scarcely shut when mr shute bent forward  say  he sank his voice to a winning whisper  you look good to muh he said gallantly  the idea said maud tossing her head  on the level mr shute assured her  maud laid down her orangesticks  dont be silly she said thereive finished  ive not said mr shute not by a mile say  well  what do you do with your evenings  i go home  sure but when you dont its a poor heart that never rejoices dont you ever whoop it up  whoop it up  the mad whirl explained mr shute icecream soda and buckwheat cakes and a happy evening at lovely luna park  i dont know where luna park is  what did they teach you at school its out in that direction said mr shute pointing over his shoulder you go straight on about three thousand miles till you hit little old new york then you turn to the right say dont you ever get a little treat why not come along to the white city some old evening this evening  mr welsh is taking me to the white city tonight  and who is mr welsh  the gentleman who has just gone out  is that so well he doesnt look a live one but maybe its just because hes had bad news today you never can tell he rose farewell evelina fairest of your sex we shall meet again so keep a stout heart  and taking up his cane straw hat and yellow gloves mr shute departed leaving maud to her thoughts  she was disappointed she had expected better results mr shute had lowered with ease the record for gay badinage hitherto held by the redfaced customer yet to all appearances there had been no change in arthurs manner but perhaps he had scowled or bitten his lip and she had not noticed it apparently he had struck mr shute an unbiased spectator as gloomy perhaps at some moment when her eyes had been on her workshe hoped for the best  whatever his feelings may have been during the afternoon arthur was undeniably cheerful that evening he was in excellent spirits his lighthearted abandon on the wigglewoggle had been noted and commented upon by several lookerson confronted with the hairy ainus he had touched a high level of facetiousness and now as he sat with her listening to the band he was crooning joyously to himself in accompaniment to the music without it would appear a care in the world  maud was hurt and anxious in a mere acquaintance this blithe attitude would have been welcome it would have helped her to enjoy her evening but from arthur at that particular moment she looked for something else why was he cheerful only a few hours ago she had beenyes flirting with another man before his very eyes what right had he to be cheerful he ought to be heated full of passionate demands for an explanationa flushed throaty thing to be coaxed back into a good temper and then forgivenall this at great lengthfor having been in a bad one yes she told herself she had wanted certainty one way or the other and here it was now she knew he no longer cared for her  she trembled  cold said arthur lets walk evenings beginning to draw in now lumdadiddleyah thats what i call a good tune give me something lively and bright dumtyumptyiddleyah dum tum  funny thing said maud deliberately  whats a funny thing  the gentleman in the brown suit whose hands i did this afternoon  he was agreed arthur brightly a very funny thing  maud frowned wit at the expense of hairy ainus was one thingat her own another  i was about to say she went on precisely that it was a funny thing a coincidence seeing that i was already engaged that the gentleman in the brown suit whose hands i did this afternoon should have asked me to come here to the white city with him tonight  for a moment they walked on in silence to maud it seemed a hopeful silence surely it must be the prelude to an outburst  oh he said and stopped  mauds heart gave a leap surely that was the old tone  a couple of paces and he spoke again  i didnt hear him ask you  his voice was disappointingly level  he asked me after you had gone out to lunch  its a nuisance said arthur cheerily when things clash like that but perhaps hell ask you again nothing to prevent you coming here twice well repays a second visit i always say i think  you shouldnt said a voice behind him it hurts the head well kid being shown a good time  the possibility of meeting mr shute had not occurred to maud she had assumed that being aware that she would be there with another he would have stayed away it may however be remarked that she did not know mr shute he was not one of your sensitive plants he smiled pleasantly upon her looking very dapper in evening dress and a silk hat that though a size too small for him shone like a mirror  maud hardly knew whether she was glad or sorry to see him it did not seem to matter much now either way nothing seemed to matter much in fact arthurs cheery acceptance of the news that she received invitations from others had been like a blow leaving her numb and listless  she made the introductions the two men eyed each other  pleased to meet you said mr shute  weather keeps up said arthur  and from that point onward mr shute took command  it is to be assumed that this was not the first time that mr shute had made one of a trio in these circumstances for the swift dexterity with which he lost arthur was certainly not that of a novice so smoothly was it done that it was not until she emerged from the witching waves guided by the pugilists slim but formidable right arm that maud realized that arthur had gone  she gave a little cry of dismay secretly she was beginning to be somewhat afraid of mr shute he was showing signs of being about to step out of the role she had assigned to him and attempt something on a larger scale his manner had that extra touch of warmth which makes all the difference  oh hes gone she cried  sure said mr shute hes got a hurrycall from the uji village the chiefs cousin wants a haircut  we must find him we must  surest thing you know said mr shute plenty of time  we must find him  mr shute regarded her with some displeasure  seems to be acehigh with you that dub he said  i dont understand you  my observation was explained mr shute coldly that judging from appearances that doughfaced lemon was willieboy the first and only love  maud turned on him with flaming cheeks  mr welsh is nothing to me nothing nothing she cried  she walked quickly on  then if theres a vacancy stareyes said the pugilist at her side holding on a hat which showed a tendency to wobble count me in directly i saw yousee here whats the idea of this roadwork we arent racing  maud slowed down  thats better as i was saying directly i saw you i said to myself thats the one you need the original candy kid the  his hat lurched drunkenly as he answered the girls increase of speed he cursed it in a brief aside  thats what i said the original candy kid so  he shot out a restraining hand arthur cried maud arthur  its not my name breathed mr shute tenderly call me clarence  considered as an embrace it was imperfect at these moments a silk hat a size too small handicaps a man the necessity of having to be careful about the nap prevented mr shute from doing himself complete justice but he did enough to induce arthur welsh who having sighted the missing ones from afar had been approaching them at a walking pace to substitute a run for the walk and arrive just as maud wrenched herself free  mr shute took off his hat smoothed it replaced it with extreme care and turned his attention to the newcomer  arthur said maud  her heart gave a great leap there was no mistaking the meaning in the eye that met hers he cared he cared  arthur  he took no notice his face was pale and working he strode up to mr shute  well he said between his teeth  an eightstonefour champion of the world has many unusual experiences in his life but he rarely encounters men who say well to him between their teeth mr shute eyed this freak with profound wonder  ill teach you toto kiss young ladies  mr shute removed his hat again and gave it another brush this gave him the necessary time for reflection  i dont need it he said ive graduated  put them up hissed arthur  almost a shocked look spread itself over the pugilists face so might raphael have looked if requested to draw a pavementpicture  you arent speaking to me he said incredulously  put them up  maud trembling from head to foot was conscious of one overwhelming emotion she was terrifiedyes but stronger than the terror was the great wave of elation which swept over her all her doubts had vanished at last after weary weeks of uncertainty arthur was about to give the supreme proof he was going to joust for her  a couple of passersby had paused interested to watch developments you could never tell of course many an apparently promising row never got any farther than words but glancing at arthurs face they certainly felt justified in pausing mr shute spoke  if it wasnt he said carefully that i dont want trouble with the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals id  he broke off for to the accompaniment of a shout of approval from the two spectators arthur had swung his right fist and it had taken him smartly on the side of the head  compared with the blows mr shute was wont to receive in the exercise of his profession arthurs was a gentle tap but there was one circumstance which gave it a deadliness all its own achilles had his heel mr shutes vulnerable point was at the other extremity instead of countering he uttered a cry of agony and clutched wildly with both hands at his hat  he was too late it fell to the ground and bounded away with its proprietor in passionate chase arthur snorted and gently chafed his knuckles  there was a calm about mr shutes demeanour as having given his treasure a final polish and laid it carefully down he began to advance on his adversary which was more than ominous his lips were a thin line of steel the muscles stood out over his jawbones crouching in his professional manner he moved forward softly like a cat  and it was at this precise moment just as the two spectators reinforced now by eleven other men of sporting tastes were congratulating themselves on their acumen in having stopped to watch that policeconstable robert bryce intruding fourteen stones of bone and muscle between the combatants addressed to mr shute these memorable words ullo ullo ullo ullo ullo  mr shute appealed to his sense of justice  the mutt knocked me hat off  and id do it again said arthur truculently  not while im here you wouldnt young fellow said mr bryce with decision im surprised at you he went on pained and you look a respectable young chap too you pop off  a shrill voice from the crowd at this point offered the constable all cinematograph rights if he would allow the contest to proceed  and you pop off too all of you continued mr bryce blest if i know what kids are coming to nowadays and as for you he said addressing mr shute all youve got to do is to keep that face of yours closed thats what youve got to do ive got my eye on you mind and if i catch you afollerin of himhe jerked his thumb over his shoulder at arthurs departing figureill pinch you sure as youre alive he paused id have done it already he added pensively if it wasnt me birthday                                       arthur welsh turned sharply for some time he had been dimly aware that somebody was calling his name  oh arthur  she was breathing quickly he could see the tears in her eyes  ive been running you walked so fast  he stared down at her gloomily  go away he said ive done with you  she clutched at his coat  arthur listenlisten its all a mistake i thought youyou didnt care for me any more and i was miserable and i wrote to the paper and asked what should i do and they said i ought to test you and try and make you jealous and that that would relieve my apprehensions and i hated it but i did it and you didnt seem to care till now and you know that theres nobody but you  youthe paper what he stammered  yes yes yes i wrote to fireside chat and dr cupid said that when jealousy flew out of the window indifference came in at the door and that i must exhibit pleasure in the society of other gentlemen and mark your demeanour so ioh  arthur luckier than mr shute was not hampered by a too small silk hat  it was a few moments later as they moved slowly towards the flipflapwhich had seemed to both of them a fitting climax for the evenings emotionsthat arthur fumbling in his waistcoat pocket produced a small slip of paper  whats that maud asked  read it said arthur its from home moments in answer to a letter i sent them and he added with heat id like to have five minutes alone with the chap who wrote it  and under the electric light maud read  answers to correspondents  by the heart specialist  arthur wjealousy arthur w is not only the most wicked but the most foolish of passions shakespeare says    it is the greeneyed monster which doth mock   the meat it feeds on  you admit that you have frequently caused great distress to the young lady of your affections by your exhibition of this weakness exactly there is nothing a girl dislikes or despises more than jealousy be a man arthur w fight against it you may find it hard at first but persevere keep a smiling face if she seems to enjoy talking to other men show no resentment be merry and bright believe me it is the only way     by advice of counsel   the traveller champed meditatively at his steak he paid no attention to the altercation which was in progress between the waiter and the man at the other end of the dingy room the sounds of strife ceased the waiter came over to the travellers table and stood behind his chair he was ruffled  if he meant lamb he said querulously why didnt he say lamb sos a feller could hear him i thought he said ham so i brought ham now lord percy gets all peevish  he laughed bitterly the traveller made no reply  if people spoke distinct said the waiter there wouldnt be half the trouble there is in the world not half the trouble there wouldnt be i shouldnt be here for one thing in this restawrong i mean a sigh escaped him  i shouldnt he said and thats the truth i should be getting up when i pleased eating and drinking all i wanted and carrying on same as in the good old days you wouldnt think to look at me would you now that i was once like the lily of the field  the waiter was a tall stringy man who gave the impression of having no spine in that he drooped he might have been said to resemble a flower but in no other respect he had sandy hair weak eyes set close together and a days growth of red stubble on his chin one could not see him in the lily class  what i mean to say is i didnt toil neither did i spin ah them was happy days lying on me back plenty of tobacco something cool in a jug  he sighed once more  did you ever know a man of the name of moore jerry moore  the traveller applied himself to his steak in silence  nice feller simple sort of feller big quiet bit deaf in one ear strawcoloured hair blue eyes andsome rather had a ouse just outside of reigate has it still money of his own left him by his pa simple sort of feller not much to say for himself i used to know him well in them days used to live with him nice feller he was big bit hard of hearing got a sleepy kind of grin like thissomething  the traveller sipped his beer in thoughtful silence  i reckon you never met him said the waiter maybe you never knew gentleman bailey either we always called him that he was one of these brokendown eton or arrer fellers folks said we struck up a partnership kind of casual both being on the tramp together and after a while we appened to be round about reigate and the first house we come to was this jerry moores he come up just as we was sliding to the back door and grins that sleepy grin like thissomething ullo he says gentleman kind of gives a whoop and hollers if it aint my old pal jerry moore jack he says to me this is my old pal mr jerry moore wot i met in appier days down at ramsgate one summer  they shakes hands and jerry moore says is this a friend of yours bailey looking at me gentleman introduces me we are partners he says partners in misfortune this is my friend mr roach  come along in says jerry  so we went in and he makes us at home hes a bachelor and lives all by himself in this desirable ouse  well i seen pretty quick that jerry thinks the world of gentleman all that evening hes acting as if hes as pleased as punch to have him there couldnt do enough for him it was a bit of all right i said to meself it was too  next day we gets up late and has a good breakfast and sits on the lawn and smokes the sun was shining the little birds was singing and there wasnt a thing east west north or south that looked like work if i had been asked my address at that moment on oath i wouldnt have hesitated a second i should have answered no 1 easy street you see jerry moore was one of these slow simple fellers and you could tell in a moment what a lot he thought of gentleman gentleman you see had a way with him not haughty he wasnt more affable i should call it he sort of made you feel that all men are born equal but that it was awful good of him to be talking to you and that he wouldnt do it for everybody it went down proper with jerry moore jerry would sit and listen to him giving his views on things by the hour by the end of the first day i was having visions of sitting in that garden a whitebaked old man and being laid out when my time should come in jerrys front room  he paused his mind evidently in the past among the cigars and big breakfasts presently he took up his tale  this here jerry moore was a simple sort of feller deafies are like that ever noticed not that jerry was a real deafy his hearing was a bit off but he could foller you if you spoke to him nice and clear well i was saying he was kind of simple liked to put in his days pottering about the little garden hed made for himself looking after his flowers and his fowls and sit of an evening listening to gentleman olding forth on life he was a philosopher gentleman was and jerry took everything he said as gospel he didnt want no proofs e and the king of denmark would have been great pals he just sat by with his big blue eyes getting rounder every minute and lapped it up  now youd think a man like that could be counted on wouldnt you would he want anything more not he youd say youd be wrong believe me there isnt a man on earth thats fixed and contented but what a woman cant knock his old paradise into ash with one punch  it wasnt long before i begin to notice a change in jerry he never had been what youd call a champion catchascatchcan talker but now he was silenter than ever and he got a habit of switching gentleman off from his theories on life in general to woman in particular this suited gentleman just right what he didnt know about woman wasnt knowledge  gentleman was too busy talking to have time to get suspicious but i wasnt and one day i draws gentleman aside and puts it to him straight gentleman i says jerry moore is in love  well this was a nasty knock of course for gentleman he knew as well as i did what it would mean if jerry was to lead home a blushing bride through that front door it would be outside into the cold hard world for the bachelor friends gentleman sees that quick and his jaw drops i goes on all the time i says that youre talking away of an evening jerrys seeing visions of a little woman sitting in your chair and you can bet we dont enter into them visions he may dream of little feet pattering about the house i says but they arent ours and you can ave something on that both ways look alive gentleman i says and think out some plan or we might as well be padding the hoof now  well gentleman did what he could in his evening discourses he started to give it to woman all he knew began to talk about delilahs and jezebels and foolstherewas and the rest of it and what a mug a feller was to let a female into is cosy home whod only make him spend his days hooking her up and his nights wondering how to get back the blankets without waking her my he was crisp enough to have given romeo the jumps youd have thought but lor its no good talking to them when theyve got it bad  a few days later we caught him with the goods talking in the road to a girl in a pink dress  i couldnt but admit that jerry had picked one right from the top of the basket this wasnt one of them languishing sort wot sits about in cosy corners and reads storybooks and dont care whats happening in the home so long as they find out what became of the hero in his duel with the grand duke she was a brown slim wirylooking little thing you know held her chin up and looked you up and down with eyes the colour of scotch whisky as much as to say well what about it you could tell without looking at her just by the feel of the atmosphere when she was near that she had as much snap and go in her as jerry moore hadnt which was a good bit i knew just as sure as i was standing there on one leg that this was the sort of girl who would have me and gentleman out of that house about three seconds after the clergyman had tied the knot  jerry says these are my friends miss tuxtonmr bailey and mr roach they are staying with me for a visit this is miss jane tuxton he says to us i was just going to see miss tuxton home he says sort of wistful excellent says gentleman well come too and we all goes along there wasnt much done in the way of conversation jerry never was one for pushing out the words nor was i when in the presence of the sect and miss jane had her chin in the air as if she thought me and gentleman was not needed in any way whatsoever the only talk before we turned her in at the garden gate was done by gentleman who told a pretty long story about a friend of his in upper sydenham who had been silly enough to marry and had had trouble ever since  that night after we had went to bed i said to gentleman gentleman i says whats going to be done about this weve got about as much chance if jerry marries that girl i says as a couple of helpless chocolate creams at a schoolgirls picnic if says gentleman he aint married her yet that is a girl of character jack trust me didnt she strike you as a girl who would like a man with a bit of devil in him a man with some go in him a youbedarned kind of man does jerry fill the bill hes more like a doormat with welcome written on it than anything else  well we seen a good deal of miss jane in the next week or so we keeps jerry underwhats it the heroine says in the melodrama oh cruel cruel sp something espionage thats it we keeps jerry under espionage and whenever he goes trickling round after the girl we goes trickling round after him  things is running our way says gentleman to me after one of these meetings that girl is getting cross with jerry she wants reckless rudolf not a man who stands and grins when other men butt in on him and his girl mark my words jack shell get tired of jerry and go off and marry a soldier and well live happy ever after think so i says sure of it said gentleman  it was the sunday after this that jerry moore announces to us wriggling that he had an engagement to take supper with jane and her folks hed have liked to have slipped away secret but we was keeping him under espionage too crisp for that so he has to tell us excellent said gentleman it will be a great treat to jack and myself to meet the family we will go along with you so off we all goes and pushes our boots in sociable fashion under the tuxton table i looked at miss jane out of the corner of my eye and honest that chin of hers was sticking out a foot and jerry didnt dare look at her loves young dream i muses to myself how swift it fades when a man has the nature and disposition of a lopeared rabbit  the tuxtons was four in number not counting the parrot and all male there was pa tuxton an old feller with a beard and glasses a fat uncle a big brother who worked in a bank and was dressed like moses in all his glory and a little brother with a snub nose that cheeky youd have been surprised and the parrot in its cage and a fat yellow dog and theyre all making themselves pleasant to jerry the wealthy future soninlaw something awful its how are the fowls mr moore and a little bit of this pie mr moore jane made it and jerry sitting there with a feeble grin saying yes and no and nothing much more while miss janes eyes are snapping like fifth of november fireworks i could feel jerrys chances going back a mile a minute i felt as happy as a little child that evening i sang going back home  gentlemans pleased too jack he says to me when were in bed this is too easy in my most sanguinary dreams i hardly hoped for this no girl of spirits going to love a man who behaves that way to her parents the way to win the heart of a certain type of girl he says beginning on his theories the type to which jane tuxton belongs is to be rude to her family ive got jane tuxton sized up and labelled her kind wants her folks to dislike her young man she wants to feel that shes the only one in the family thats got the sense to see the hidden good in willie she doesnt want to be one of a crowd hollering out what a nice young man he is it takes some pluck in a man to stand up to a girls family and thats what jane tuxton is looking for in jerry take it from one who has studied the sect says gentleman from john o groats to lands end and back again  next day jerry moores looking as if hed only sixpence in the world and had swallowed it whats the matter jerry says gentleman jerry heaves a sigh bailey he says and you mr roach i expect you both seen how it is with me i love miss jane tuxton and you seen for yourselves what transpires she dont value me not tuppence say not so says gentleman sympathetic youre doing fine if you knew the sect as i do you wouldnt go by mere superficial silences and chintiltings i can read a girls heart jerry he says patting him on the shoulder and i tell you youre doing fine all you want now is a little rapid work and you win easy to make the thing a cert he says getting up all you have to do is to make a dead set at her folks he winks at me dont just sit there like you did last night show em youve got something in you you know what folks are they think themselves the most important things on the map well go to work consult them all you know every opportunity you get theres nothing like consulting a girls folks to put you in good with her and he pats jerry on the shoulder again and goes indoors to find his pipe  jerry turns to me do you think thats really so he says i says i do he knows all about girls i reckon says jerry you can go by him every time i says well well says jerry sort of thoughtful  the waiter paused his eye was sad and dreamy then he took up the burden of his tale  first thing that happens is that gentleman has a sore tooth on the next sunday so dont feel like coming along with us he sits at home dosing it with whisky and jerry and me goes off alone  so jerry and me pikes off and once more we prepares to settle down around the board i hadnt noticed jerry particular but just now i catches sight of his face in the light of the lamp ever see one of those fighters when hes sitting in his corner before a fight waiting for the gong to go well jerry looks like that and it surprises me  i told you about the fat yellow dog that permeated the tuxtons house didnt i the family thought a lot of that dog though of all the ugly brutes i ever met he was the worst sniffing round and growling all the time well this evening he comes up to jerry just as hes going to sit down and starts to growl old pa tuxton looks over his glasses and licks his tongue rover rover he says kind of mild naughty rover he dont like strangers im afraid jerry looks at pa tuxton and he looks at the dog and im just expecting him to say no or yes same as the other night when he lets out a nasty laughone of them bitter laughs ho he says ho dont he then perhaps hed better get further away from them and he ups with his boot andwell the dog hit the far wall  jerry sits down and pulls up his chair i dont approve he says fierce of folks keeping great fat ugly badtempered yellow dogs that are a nuisance to all i dont like it  there was a silence you could have scooped out with a spoon have you ever had a rabbit turn round on you and growl thats how we all felt when jerry outs with them crisp words they took our breath away  while we were getting it back again the parrot which was in its cage let out a squawk honest i jumped a foot in my chair  jerry gets up very deliberate and walks over to the parrot is this a menagerie he says cant a man have supper in peace without an image like you starting to holler go to sleep  we was all staring at him surprised especially uncle dick tuxton whose particular pet the parrot was hed brought him home all the way from some foreign parts  hello billy says the bird shrugging his shoulders and puffing himself up rrrr rrrr lo billy lo lo lo rr wah  jerry gives its cage a bang  dont talk back at me he says or ill knock your head off you think because youve got a green tail youre someone and he stalks back to his chair and sits glaring at uncle dick  well all this wasnt what you might call promoting an easy flow of conversation everyones looking at jerry specially me wondering what next and trying to get their breath and jerrys frowning at the cold beef and theres a sort of awkward pause miss jane is the first to get busy she bustles about and gets the food served out and we begins to eat but still theres not so much conversation that youd notice it this goes on till we reaches the concluding stages and then uncle dick comes up to the scratch  how is the fowls mr moore he says  gimme some more pie says jerry what  uncle dick repeats his remark  fowls says jerry what do you know about fowls your notion of a fowl is an ugly bird with a green tail a wellington nose andgimme a bit of cheese  uncle dicks fond of the parrot so he speaks up for him pollys always been reckoned a handsome bird he says  he wants stuffing says jerry  and uncle dick drops out of the talk  up comes big brother ralph his name was hes the bankclerk and a dude he gives his cuffs a flick and starts in to make things jolly all round by telling a story about a man he knows named wotherspoon jerry fixes him with his eye and halfway through interrupts  that waistcoat of yours is fierce he says  pardon says ralph  that waistcoat of yours says jerry it hurts me eyes its like an electric sign  why jerry i says but he just scowls at me and i stops  ralph is proud of his clothes and he isnt going to stand this he glares at jerry and jerry glares at him  who do you think you are says ralph breathing hard  button up your coat says jerry  look ere says ralph  cover it up i tell you says jerry do you want to blind me pa tuxton interrupts  why mr moore he begins sort of soothing when the small brother whos been staring at jerry chips in i told you he was cheeky  he says pa what a funny nose mr moores got  and that did it jerry rises very slow and leans across the table and clips the kid brother one side of the earole and then theres a general imbroglio everyone standing up and the kid hollering and the dog barking  if youd brought him up better says jerry severe to pa tuxton this wouldnt ever have happened  pa tuxton gives a sort of howl  mr moore he yells what is the meaning of this extraordinary behaviour you come here and strike me child  jerry bangs on the table  yes he says and id strike him again listen to me he says you think just because im quiet i aint got no spirit you think all i can do is to sit and smile you thinkbah you arent on to the hidden depths in me character im one of them still waters that runs deep imhere you get out of it yes all of you except jane jane and me wants this room to have a private talk in ive got a lot of things to say to jane are you going  i turns to the crowd i was awful disturbed you mustnt take any notice i says he aint well he aint himself when just then the parrot cuts with another of them squawks jerry jumps at it  you first he says and flings the cage out of the window now you he says to the yellow dog putting him out through the door and then he folds his arms and scowls at us and we all notice suddenly that hes very big we look at one another and we begins to edge towards the door all except jane whos staring at jerry as if hes a ghost  mr moore says pa tuxton dignified well leave you youre drunk  im not drunk says jerry im in love  jane says pa tuxton come with me and leave this ruffian to himself  jane says jerry stop here and come and lay your head on my shoulder  jane says pa tuxton do you hear me  jane says jerry im waiting  she looks from one to the other for a spell and then she moves to where jerrys standing  ill stop she says sort of quiet  and we drifts out  the waiter snorted  i got back home quick as i could he said and relates the proceedings to gentleman gentlemans rattled i dont believe it he says dont stand there and tell me jerry moore did them things why it aint in the man specially after what i said to him about the way he ought to behave how could he have done so just then in comes jerry beaming all over boys he shouts congratulate me its all right weve fixed it up she says she hadnt known me properly before she says shed always reckoned me a sheep while all the time i was one of them strong silent men he turns to gentleman  the man at the other end of the room was calling for his bill  all right all right said the waiter coming he turns to gentleman he went on rapidly and he says bailey i owe it all to you because if you hadnt told me to insult her folks  he leaned on the travellers table and fixed him with an eye that pleaded for sympathy  ow about that he said isnt that crisp insult her folks them was his very words insult her folks  the traveller looked at him inquiringly  can you beat it said the waiter  i dont know what you are saying said the traveller if it is important write it on a slip of paper i am stonedeaf     roughhew them how we will   paul boielle was a waiter the word waiter suggests a softvoiced defthanded being moving swiftly and without noise in an atmosphere of luxury and shaded lamps at bredins parisian cafe and restaurant in soho where paul worked there were none of these things and paul himself though he certainly moved swiftly was by no means noiseless his progress through the room resembled in almost equal proportions the finish of a marathon race the staract of a professional juggler and a monologue by an earls court sideshowman constant acquaintance rendered regular habitues callous to the wonder but to a stranger the sight of paul tearing over the difficult betweentables course his hands loaded with two vast pyramids of dishes shouting as he went the mystic word comingsarecominginamomentsaresteaksareyessarecomingsare was impressive to a degree for doing far less exacting feats on the stage musichall performers were being paid fifty pounds a week paul got eighteen shillings  what a blessing is poverty properly considered if paul had received more than eighteen shillings a week he would not have lived in an attic he would have luxuriated in a bedsittingroom on the second floor and would consequently have missed what was practically a genuine north light the skylight which went with the attic was so arranged that the room was a studio in miniature and as paul was engaged in his spare moments in painting a great picture nothing could have been more fortunate for paul like so many of our public men lived two lives off duty the sprinting barking juggler of bredins parisian cafe became the quiet follower of art ever since his childhood he had had a passion for drawing and painting he regretted that fate had allowed him so little time for such work but after all he reflected all great artists had had their strugglesso why not he moreover they were now nearly at an end an hour here an hour there and every thursday a whole afternoon and the great picture was within measurable distance of completion he had won through without models without leisure hungry tired he had nevertheless triumphed a few more touches and the masterpiece would be ready for purchase and after that all would be plain sailing paul could forecast the scene so exactly the picture would be at the dealers possiblyone must not be too sanguinethrust away in some odd corner the wealthy connoisseur would come in at first he would not see the masterpiece other more prominently displayed works would catch his eye he would turn from them in weary scorn and then paul wondered how big the cheque would be  there were reasons why he wanted the money looking at him as he cantered over the linoleum at bredins you would have said that his mind was on his work but it was not so he took and executed orders as automatically as the pennyintheslot musicalbox in the corner took pennies and produced tunes his thoughts were of jeanne le brocq his coworker at bredins and a little cigar shop down brixton way which he knew was in the market at a reasonable rate to marry the former and own the latter was pauls idea of the earthly paradise and it was the wealthy connoisseur and he alone who could open the gates  jeanne was a large slowmoving norman girl stolidly handsome one could picture her in a de maupassant farmyard in the clatter and bustle of bredins parisian cafe she appeared out of place like a cow in a boilerfactory to paul who worshipped her with all the fervour of a little man for a large woman her deliberate methods seemed all that was beautiful and dignified to his mind she lent a tone to the vulgar whirlpool of gorging humanity as if she had been some goddess mixing in a homeric battle the whirlpool had other viewsand expressed them one coarsefibred brute indeed once went so far as to address to her the frightful words urry up there tottie look slippy it was wrong of course for paul to slip and spill an order of scrambled eggs down the brutes coatsleeve but who can blame him  among those who did not see eye to eye with paul in his views on deportment in waitresses was m bredin himself the owner of the parisian cafe and it was this circumstance which first gave paul the opportunity of declaring the passion which was gnawing him with the fierce fury of a bredin customer gnawing a tough steak against time during the rush hour he had long worshipped her from afar but nothing more intimate than a good morning miss jeanne had escaped him till one day during a slack spell he came upon her in the little passage leading to the kitchen her face hidden in her apron her back jerking with sobs  business is business paul had a message to deliver to the cook respecting two fried coffee and one stale he delivered it and returned jeanne was still sobbing  ah miss jeanne cried paul stricken what is the matter what is it why do you weep  the patron sobbed jeanne he  my angel said paul he is a pig  this was perfectly true no conscientious judge of character could have denied that paul had hit the bulls eye bredin was a pig he looked like a pig he ate like a pig he grunted like a pig he had the lavish embonpoint of a pig also a porcine soul if you had tied a bit of blue ribbon round his neck you could have won prizes with him at a show  pauls eyes flashed with fury i will slap him in the eye he roared  he called me a tortoise  and kick him in the stomach added paul  jeannes sobs were running on second speed now the anguish was diminishing paul took advantage of the improved conditions to slide an arm part of the way round her waist in two minutes he had said as much as the ordinary man could have worked off in ten all good stuff too no padding  jeannes face rose from her apron like a full moon she was too astounded to be angry  paul continued to babble jeanne looked at him with growing wrath that she who received daily the affectionate badinage of gentlemen in bowler hats and check suits who had once been invited to the white city by a solicitors clerk should be addressed in this way by a waiter it was too much she threw off his hand  wretched little man she cried stamping angrily  my angel protested paul  jeanne uttered a scornful laugh  you she said  there are few more withering remarks than you spoken in a certain way jeanne spoke it in just that way  paul wilted  on eighteen shillings a week went on jeanne satirically you would support a wife yes why  paul recovered himself he had an opening now and proceeded to use it  listen he said at present yes it is true i earn but eighteen shillings a week but it will not always be so no i am not only a waiter i am also an artist i have painted a great picture for a whole year i have worked and now it is ready i will sell it and then my angel  jeannes face had lost some of its scorn she was listening with some respect a picture she said thoughtfully there is money in pictures  for the first time paul was glad that his arm was no longer round her waist to do justice to the great work he needed both hands for purposes of gesticulation  there is money in this picture he said oh it is beautiful i call it the awakening it is a woodland scene i come back from my work here hot and tired and a mere glance at that wood refreshes me it is so cool so green the sun filters in golden splashes through the foliage on a mossy bank between two trees lies a beautiful girl asleep above her bending fondly over her just about to kiss that flowerlike face is a young man in the dress of a shepherd at the last moment he has looked over his shoulder to make sure that there is nobody near to see he is wearing an expression so happy so proud that ones heart goes out to him  yes there might be money in that cried jeanne  there is there is cried paul i shall sell it for many francs to a wealthy connoisseur and then my angel  you are a good little man said the angel patronizingly perhaps we will see  paul caught her hand and kissed it she smiled indulgently yes she said there might be money these english pay much money for pictures                                       it is pretty generally admitted that geoffrey chaucer the eminent poet of the fourteenth century though obsessed with an almost rooseveltian passion for the new spelling was there with the goods when it came to profundity of thought it was chaucer who wrote the lines    the lyfe so short the craft so long to lerne   th assay so hard so sharpe the conquering  which means broadly that it is difficult to paint a picture but a great deal more difficult to sell it  across the centuries paul boielle shook hands with geoffrey chaucer so sharpe the conquering put his case in a nutshell  the full story of his wanderings with the masterpiece would read like an odyssey and be about as long it shall be condensed  there was an artist who dined at intervals at bredins parisian cafe and as the artistic temperament was too impatient to be suited by jeannes leisurely methods it had fallen to paul to wait upon him it was to this expert that paul emboldened by the geniality of the artists manner went for information how did monsieur sell his pictures monsieur said he didnt except once in a blue moon but when he did oh he took the thing to the dealers paul thanked him a friend of him he explained had painted a picture and wished to sell it  poor devil was the artists comment  next day it happening to be a thursday paul started on his travels he started buoyantly but by evening he was as a punctured balloon every dealer had the same remark to maketo wit no room  have you yet sold the picture inquired jeanne when they met not yet said paul but they are delicate matters these negotiations i use finesse i proceed with caution  he approached the artist again  with the dealers he said my friend has been a little unfortunate they say they have no room  i know said the artist nodding  is there perhaps another way  what sort of a picture is it inquired the artist  paul became enthusiastic  ah monsieur it is beautiful it is a woodland scene a beautiful girl  oh then he had better try the magazines they might use it for a cover  paul thanked him effusively on the following thursday he visited divers art editors the art editors seemed to be in the same unhappy condition as the dealers overstocked was their cry  the picture said jeanne on the friday morning is it sold  not yet said paul but  always but  my angel  bah said jeanne with a toss of her large but shapely head  by the end of the month paul was fighting in the last ditch wandering disconsolately among those who dwell in outer darkness and have grimy thumbs seven of these in all he visited on that black thursday and each of the seven rubbed the surface of the painting with a grimy thumb snorted and dismissed him sick and beaten paul took the masterpiece back to his skylight room  all that night he lay awake thinking it was a weary bundle of nerves that came to the parisian cafe next morning he was late in arriving which was good in that it delayed the inevitable question as to the fate of the picture but bad in every other respect m bredin squatting behind the cashdesk grunted fiercely at him and worse jeanne who owing to his absence had had to be busier than suited her disposition was distant and haughty a murky gloom settled upon paul  now it so happened that m bredin when things went well with him was wont to be filled with a ponderous amiability it was not often that this took a practical form though it is on record that in an exuberant moment he once gave a small boy a halfpenny more frequently it merely led him to soften the porcine austerity of his demeanour today business having been uncommonly good he felt pleased with the world he had left his cashdesk and was assailing a bowl of soup at one of the sidetables except for a belated luncher at the end of the room the place was empty it was one of the hours when there was a lull in the proceedings at the parisian cafe paul was leaning wrapped in the gloom against the wall jeanne was waiting on the proprietor  m bredin finished his meal and rose he felt content all was well with the world as he lumbered to his desk he passed jeanne he stopped he wheezed a compliment then another paul from his place by the wall watched with jealous fury  m bredin chucked jeanne under the chin  as he did so the belated luncher called waiter but paul was otherwise engaged his entire nervous system seemed to have been stirred up with a pole with a hoarse cry he dashed forward he would destroy this pig who chucked his jeanne under the chin  the first intimation m bredin had of the declaration of war was the impact of a french roll on his ear it was one of those nobbly chunky rolls with sharp corners almost as deadly as a piece of shrapnel m bredin was incapable of jumping but he uttered a howl and his vast body quivered like a stricken jelly a second roll whizzing by slapped against the wall a moment later a creambun burst in sticky ruin on the proprietors left eye  the belated luncher had been anxious to pay his bill and go but he came swiftly to the conclusion that this was worth stopping on for he leaned back in his chair and watched m bredin had entrenched himself behind the cashdesk peering nervously at paul through the cream and paul pouring forth abuse in his native tongue was brandishing a chocolate eclair the situation looked good to the spectator  it was spoiled by jeanne who seized paul by the arm and shook him adding her own voice to the babel it was enough the eclair fell to the floor pauls voice died away his face took on again its crushed hunted expression the voice of m bredin freed from competition rose shrill and wrathful  the marksman is getting sacked mused the onlooker diagnosing the situation  he was right the next moment paul limp and depressed had retired to the kitchen passage discharged it was here after a few minutes that jeanne found him  fool idiot imbecile said jeanne  paul stared at her without speaking  to throw rolls at the patron imbecile  he began paul  bah and what if he did must you then attack him like a mad dog what is it to you  paul was conscious of a dull longing for sympathy a monstrous sense of oppression everything was going wrong surely jeanne must be touched by his heroism but no she was scolding furiously suppose andromeda had turned and scolded perseus after he had slain the seamonster paul mopped his forehead with his napkin the bottom had dropped out of his world  jeanne  bah do not talk to me idiot of a little man almost you lost me my place also the patron was in two minds but i coaxed him a fine thing that would have been to lose my good place through your foolishness to throw rolls my goodness  she swept back into the room again leaving paul still standing by the kitchen door something seemed to have snapped inside him how long he stood there he did not know but presently from the diningroom came calls of waiter and automatically he fell once more into his work as an actor takes up his part a stranger would have noticed nothing remarkable in him he bustled to and fro with undiminished energy  at the end of the day m bredin paid him his eighteen shillings with a grunt and paul walked out of the restaurant a masterless man  he went to his attic and sat down on the bed propped up against the wall was the picture he looked at it with unseeing eyes he stared dully before him  then thoughts came to him with a rush leaping and dancing in his mind like imps in hades he had a curious sense of detachment he seemed to be watching himself from a great distance  this was the end the little imps danced and leaped and then one separated itself from the crowd to grow bigger than the rest to pirouette more energetically he rose his mind was made up he would kill himself  he went downstairs and out into the street he thought hard as he walked he would kill himself but how  his preoccupation was so great that an automobile rounding a corner missed him by inches as he crossed the road the chauffeur shouted angrily at him as he leapt back  paul shook his fist at the retreating lights  pig he shouted assassin scoundrel villain would you kill me i will take your number rascal i will inform the police villain  a policeman had strolled up and was eyeing him curiously paul turned to him full of his wrongs  officer he cried i have a complaint these pigs of chauffeurs they are reckless they drive so recklessly hence the great number of accidents  awful said the policeman pass along sonny  paul walked on fuming it was abominable that these chauffeursand then an idea came to him he had found a way                                       it was quiet in the park he had chosen the park because it was dark and there would be none to see and interfere he waited long in the shadow by the roadside presently from the darkness there came the distant drone of powerful engines lights appeared like the blazing eyes of a dragon swooping down to devour its prey  he ran out into the road with a shout  it was an error that shout he had intended it for an inarticulate farewell to his picture to jeanne to life it was excusable to the driver of the motor that he misinterpreted it it seemed to him a cry of warning there was a great jarring of brakes a scuttering of locked wheels on the dry road and the car came to a standstill a full yard from where he stood  what the deuce said a cool voice from behind the lights  paul struck his chest and folded his arms  i am here he cried destroy me  let george do it said the voice in a marked american accent i never murder on a friday its unlucky if its not a rude question which asylum are you from halloa  the exclamation was one of surprise for pauls nerves had finally given way and he was now in a heap on the road sobbing  the man climbed down and came into the light he was a tall young man with a pleasant cleancut face he stopped and shook paul  quit that he said maybe its not true and if it is theres always hope cut it out whats the matter all in  paul sat up gulping convulsively he was thoroughly unstrung the cold desperate mood had passed in its place came the old feeling of desolation he was a child aching for sympathy he wanted to tell his troubles punctuating his narrative with many gestures and an occasional gulp he proceeded to do so the american listened attentively  so you cant sell your picture and youve lost your job and your girl has shaken you he said pretty bad but still youve no call to go mingling with automobile wheels you come along with me to my hotel and tomorrow well see if we cant fix up something                                       there was breakfast at the hotel next morning a breakfast to put heart into a man during the meal a messenger dispatched in a cab to pauls lodgings returned with the canvas a deferential waiter informed the american that it had been taken with every possible care to his suite  good said the young man if youre through well go and have a look at it  they went upstairs there was the picture resting against a chair  why i call that fine said the young man its a cracker jack  pauls heart gave a sudden leap could it be that here was the wealthy connoisseur he was wealthy for he drove an automobile and lived in an expensive hotel he was a connoisseur for he had said that the picture was a crackerjack  monsieur is kind murmured paul  its a bearcat said the young man admiringly  monsieur is flattering said paul dimly perceiving a compliment  ive been looking for a picture like that said the young man for months  pauls eyes rolled heavenwards  if youll make a few alterations ill buy it and ask for more  alterations monsieur  one or two small ones he pointed to the stooping figure of the shepherd now you see this prominent citizen whats he doing  he is stooping said paul fervently to bestow upon his loved one a kiss and she sleeping all unconscious dreaming of him  never mind about her fix your mind on him willie is the star in this show you have summed him up accurately he is stooping stooping good now if that fellow was wearing braces and stooped like that youd say hed burst those braces wouldnt you  with a somewhat dazed air paul said that he thought he would till now he had not looked at the figure from just that viewpoint  youd say hed bust them  assuredly monsieur  no said the young man solemnly tapping him earnestly on the chest thats where youre wrong not if they were galloways tried and proven galloways tried and proven will stand any old strain you care to put on them see small bills wear galloways tried and proven and fate cannot touch you you can take it from me im the companys general manager  indeed monsieur  and ill make a proposition to you cut out that mossy bank and make the girl lying in a hammock put willie in shirtsleeves instead of a bathrobe and fix him up with a pair of the tried and proven and ill give you three thousand dollars for that picture and a retaining fee of four thousand a year to work for us and nobody else for any number of years you care to mention youve got the goods youve got just the touch that happy look on willies face for instance you can see in a minute why hes so happy its because hes wearing the tried and proven and he knows that however far he stoops they wont break is that a deal  pauls reply left no room for doubt seizing the young man firmly round the waist he kissed him with extreme fervour on both cheeks  here break away cried the astonished general manager thats no way to sign a business contract                                       it was at about five minutes after one that afternoon that constable thomas parsons patrolling his beat was aware of a man motioning to him from the doorway of bredins parisian cafe and restaurant the man looked like a pig he grunted like a pig he had the lavish embonpoint of a pig constable parsons suspected that he had a porcine soul indeed the thought flitted across constable parsons mind that if he were to tie a bit of blue ribbon round his neck he could win prizes with him at a show  whats all this he inquired halting  the stout man talked volubly in french constable parsons shook his head  talk sense he advised  in dere cried the stout man pointing behind him into the restaurant a man ahow you sayyes sacked an employe whom i yesterday sacked today he returns i say to him cochon va  whats that  i say peeg go how you say yes pop off i say peeg pop off but heno no he sits and will not go come in officer and expel him  with massive dignity the policeman entered the restaurant at one of the tables sat paul calm and distrait from across the room jeanne stared freezingly  whats all this inquired constable parsons paul looked up  i too he admitted i cannot understand figure to yourself monsieur i enter this cafe to lunch and this man here would expel me  he is an employe whom ii myselfhave but yesterday dismissed vociferated m bredin he has no money to lunch at my restaurant  the policeman eyed paul sternly  eh he said that so youd better come along  pauls eyebrows rose  before the round eyes of m bredin he began to produce from his pockets and to lay upon the table banknotes and sovereigns the cloth was covered with them  he picked up a halfsovereign  if monsieur he said to the policeman would accept this as a slight consolation for the inconvenience which this foolish person here has caused him  not half said mr parsons affably look herehe turned to the gaping proprietorif you go on like this youll be getting yourself into trouble see you take care another time  paul called for the bill of fare  it was the inferior person who had succeeded to his place as waiter who attended to his needs during the meal but when he had lunched it was jeanne who brought his coffee  she bent over the table  you sold your picture paulyes she whispered for much money how glad i am dear paul now we will  paul met her glance coolly  will you be so kind he said as to bring me also a cigarette my good girl     the man who disliked cats   it was harold who first made us acquainted when i was dining one night at the cafe britannique in soho it is a peculiarity of the cafe britannique that you will always find flies there even in winter snow was falling that night as i turned in at the door but glancing about me i noticed several of the old faces my old acquaintance percy the bluebottle looking wonderfully fit despite his years was doing deep breathing exercises on a mutton cutlet and was too busy to do more than pause for a moment to nod at me but his cousin harold always active sighted me and bustled up to do the honours  he had finished his game of touchlast with my right ear and was circling slowly in the air while he thought out other ways of entertaining me when there was a rush of air a swish of napkin and no more harold  i turned to thank my preserver whose table adjoined mine he was a frenchman a melancholylooking man he had the appearance of one who has searched for the leak in lifes gaspipe with a lighted candle of one whom the clenched fist of fate has smitten beneath the temperamental third waistcoatbutton  he waved my thanks aside it was a bagatelle he said we became friendly he moved to my table and we fraternized over our coffee  suddenly he became agitated he kicked at something on the floor his eyes gleamed angrily  pssst he hissed vaten  i looked round the corner of the table and perceived the restaurant cat in dignified retreat  you do not like cats i said  i ate all animals monsieur cats especially he frowned he seemed to hesitate  i will tell you my story he said you will sympathize you have a sympathetic face it is the story of a mans tragedy it is the story of a blighted life it is the story of a woman who would not forgive it is the story  ive got an appointment at eleven i said  he nodded absently drew at his cigarette and began                                       i have conceived my atred of animals monsieur many years ago in paris animals are to me a symbol for the lost dreams of youth for ambitions foiled for artistic impulses cruelly stifled you are astonished you ask why i say these things i shall tell you  i am in paris young ardent artistic i wish to paint pictures i ave the genius the entusiasm i wish to be disciple of the great bouguereau but no i am dependent for support upon an uncle he

uncles hotel is fashionable hotel rich americans rich maharajahs rich people of every nation come to my uncles hotel they come and with them they have brought their pets monsieur it was the existence of a nightmare wherever i have looked there are animals listen there is an indian prince he has with him two dromedaries there is also one other indian prince with him is a giraffe the giraffe drink every day one dozen best champagne to keep his coat good i the artist have my bock and my coat is not good there is a guest with a young lion there is a guest with an alligator but especially there is a cat he is fat his name is alexander he belongs to an american woman she is fat she exhibits him to me he is wrapped in a silk and fur creation like an opera cloak every day she exhibits him it is alexander this and alexander that till i ate alexander very much i ate all the animals but especially alexander  and so monsieur it goes on day by day in this hotel that is a zoological garden and every day i ate the animals the more but especially alexander  we artists monsieur we are martyrs to our nerves it became insupportable this thing each day it became more insupportable at night i dream of all the animals one by onethe giraffe the two dromedaries the young lion the alligator and alexander especially alexander you have eard of men who cannot endure the society of a cathow they cry out and jump in the air if a cat is among those present hein your lord roberts precisely monsieur i have read so much listen then i am become by degrees almost like im i do not cry out and jump in the air when i see the cat alexander but i grind my teeth and i ate im  yes i am the sleeping volcano and one morning monsieur i have suffered the eruption it is like this i shall tell you  not only at that time am i the martyr to nerves but also to toothache that morning i ave ad the toothache very bad i ave been in pain the most terrible i groan as i add up the figures in my book  as i groan i ear a voice  say good morning to m priaulx alexander conceive my emotions monsieur when this fat beastly cat is placed before me upon my desk  it put the cover upon it no that is not the phrase the lid it put the lid upon it all my smothered atred of the animal burst forth i could no longer conceal my atred  i rose i was terrible i seized im by the tail i flung himi did not know where i did not care not then afterwards yes but not then  your longfellow has a poem i shot an arrow into the air it fell to earth i know not where and then he has found it the arrow in the eart of a friend am i right also was that the tragedy with me i flung the cat alexander my uncle on whom i am dependent is passing at the moment he has received the cat in the middle of his face  my companion with the artists instinct for the curtain paused he looked round the brightlylit restaurant from every side arose the clatter of knife and fork and the clear sharp note of those who drank soup in a distant corner a small waiter with a large voice was calling the cook names through the speakingtube it was a cheerful scene but it brought no cheer to my companion he sighed heavily and resumed                                       i urry over that painful scene there is blooming row my uncle is ottempered man the cat is eavy cat i ave thrown im very hard for my nerves and my toothache and my atred ave given me the giants strength alone is this enough to enrage my ottempered uncle i am there in his hotel you will understand as cashier not as catthrower and now besides all this i have insulted valuable patron she ave left the hotel that day  there are no doubts in my mind as to the outcome with certainty i await my conge and after painful scene i get it i am to go at once he ave assured the angry american woman that i go at once  he has called me into his private office jean he has said to me at the end of other things you are a fool dolt nogood imbecile i give you good place in my hotel

yes but he does not sparkle he has not my verve my elan ihow do you sayi make the rings round him  but chut at that moment i would have made the rings round the ole british army yes and also the corps diplomatique for i am inspired love as inspired me i am conqueror  but i will not weary you monsieur with the details of my wooing you are sympathetic but i must not weary you let us say that i ave in four days or five made progress the most remarkable and proceed to the tragic end  almost could i tell it in four words in them one would say that it is set forth there was in london at that time popular a song a comic vulgar song of the alls the cat came back you ave eard it yes i eard it myself and without emotion it had no sinister warning for me it did not strike me as omen yet in those four words monsieur is my tragedy  how i shall tell you every word is a sword twisted in my eart but i shall tell you  one afternoon we are at tea all is well i am vivacious gay miss marion charming gracious there is present also an aunt mr endersons sister but er i do not much notice it is to marion i speakboth with my lips and also with my eyes  as we sit captain bassett is announced  he has entered we have greeted each other politely but coldly for we are rivals there is in his manner also a something which i do not much likea species of suppressed triumph of elation  i am uneasybut only yet vaguely you will understand i have not the foreboding that he is about to speak my deathsentence  he addresses miss marion there is joy in his voice miss enderson he has said i have for you the bally good news you will remember isnt it the cat belonging to the american woman in the hotel at paris of which you have spoken to me last night at dinner i have been seated beside her at first i am not certain is it she then i say that there cannot be two mrs balderstone rockmettlers in europe so i mention to her the cat and to cut the long story short i have ventured to purchase for you as a little present the cat alexander  i have uttered a cry of horror but it is not eard because of miss marions cry of joy  oh captain bassett she has said how very splendid of you ever since i first saw him have i loved alexander i cannot tell you how grateful i am but it amazes me that you should have been able to induce her to part with im in paris she has refused all my offers  he has paused embarrassed  the fact is he has said there is between her and alexander a certain coolness he as deceived er and she loves him no more immediately upon arrival in london he had the misfortune to ave six fine kittens owever out of evil cometh good and i have thus been able to secure im for you e is downstairs in a basket  miss marion as rung the bell and commanded for him to be brought instantly  i will not describe the meeting monsieur you are sympathetic you will understand my feelings let us urry on  figure yourself monsieur to what extent i was now arassed i am artist i am a man of nerves i cannot be gay brilliant debonair in the presence of a cat yet always the cat is there it is terrible  i feel that i am falling behind in the race er gratitude has made her the more gracious to captain bassett she smiles upon him and like chanticleer at the sight of the sun he flaps his wings and crows he is no longer the silent listener it is i who have become the silent listener  i have said to myself that something must be done  chance has shown me the way one afternoon i am by fortune alone in the all in his cage the parrot polly is opping i address him through the bars  move and i shoot i he has cried  the tears have filled my eyes ow it has brought the ole scene back to me  as i weep i perceive the cat alexander approaching  i have formed a plan i have opened the cagedoor and released the parrot the cat i think will attack the parrot of which miss enderson is so fond she will love him no more he will be expelled                                       he paused i suppose my face must have lost some of its alleged sympathy as he set forth this fiendish plot even percy the bluebottle seemed shocked he had settled on the sugarbowl but at these words he rose in a marked manner and left the table  you do not approve he said  i shrugged my shoulders  its no business of mine i said but dont you think yourself it was playing it a bit low down didnt the thought present itself to you in a shadowy way that it was rather rough on the bird  it did monsieur but what would you it is necessary to break eggs in order to make an omelette all is fair you say in love and war and this was both moreover you must understand i do not dictate his movements to the parrot he is free agent i do but open the cagedoor should he op out and proceed to the floor where is the cat that is his affair i shall continue yes                                       alors i open the cagedoor and disappear discreetly it is not politic that i remain to witness what shall transpire it is for me to establish an alibi i go to the drawingroom where i remain  at dinner that night mr enderson has laughed  in the all this afternoon he has said i have seen by chance the dickens of a funny occurrence that parrot of yours marion had escaped once again from its cage and was aving an argument with that cat which captain bassett has given to you  oh i hope that alexander as not hurt poor polly of whom i am very fond she has said  the affair did not come to blows has said mr enderson you may trust that bird to take care of himself my dear when i came upon the scene the cat was crouching in a corner with his fur bristling and his back up while polly standing before im was telling im not to move or he would shoot nor did he move till i ad seized the parrot and replaced him in the cage when he shot upstairs like a streak of lightning by sheer force of character that excellent bird ad won the bloodless victory i drink to im  you can conceive my emotion as i listen to this tale i am like the poets mice and men whose bestkid schemes have gone away i am baffled i am discouraged i do not know what i shall do i must find another plan but i do not know what  how shall i remove the cat shall i kill im no for i might be suspect  shall i ire someone to steal im no for my accomplice might betray me  shall i myself steal im ah that is better that is a very good plan  soon i have it perfected this plan listen monsieur it is as follows it is simple but it is good i will await my opportunity i will remove the cat secretly from the ouse i will take him to an office of the district messenger boys i will order a messenger to carry him at once to the cats house and to request m le directeur immediately to destroy him it is a simple plan but it is good  i carry it through without a itch it is not so difficult to secure the cat e is asleep in the drawingroom there is nobody at hand i have in my bedroom a atbox which i have brought from paris i have brought it with me to the drawingroom i have placed in it the cat i have escaped from the ouse the cat has uttered a cry but none has eard i have reached the office of the district messenger boys i have anded over the cat in its box the manager is courteous sympathetic a messenger has started in a cab for the cats house i have breathed a sigh of relief i am saved  that is what i say to myself as i return my troubles are over and once more i can be gay debonair vivacious with miss marion for no longer will there be present the cat alexander to arass me  when i have returned there is commotion in the ouse i pass on the stairs domestics calling puss puss the butler is chirruping loudly and poking beneath the furniture with a umbrella all is confusion and agitation  in the drawingroom is miss marion she is distressed  nowhere she has said can there be found the cat alexander of whom i am so fond nowhere in the ouse is he where can he be he is lost  i am gentle sympathetic i endeavour to console her i int to her that am i not sufficient substitute for a beastly cat she is however inconsolable i must be patient i must wait my time  captain bassett is announced he is informed of what has appened he is distressed he has the air as if he too would endeavour to be gentle sympathetic but i am johnnyonthespot i stay till he as gone  next day again it is puss puss again the butler has explored under the furniture with the umbrella again miss marion is distressed again ave i endeavoured to console  this time i think i am not so unsuccessful i am you understand young andsome sympathetic in another two ticks i am about to seize er and and declare my passion  but before i can do so captain bassett is announced  i gaze at him as at unsuccessful rival i am confident i am conqueror ah i little know it is in the moments of our highest ope monsieur that we are destroyed  captain bassett he too as the air of the conqueror  he has begun to speak  miss enderson he has said i have once more the bally good news i rather fancy that i ave tracked down the missing alexander do you not know  miss marion as cried cut with joy but i am calm for is not alexander already yesterday destroyed  it is like this he has resumed i have thought to myself where is lost cat most likely to be and i have answered in the cats house i go this morning to the cats house and there i see a cat which is either lost alexander or his living image exactly is he the same to all appearances as the lost alexander but there is when i try to purchase im some curious itch which they do not explain they must ave time they say to consider they cannot at once decide  why what nonsense miss marion ave cried if the cat is my cat surely then must they return im to me come she has said let us all three at once in a taxicab go to the cats house if the all three of us identify the lost alexander then must they return im  monsieur i am uneasy i have foreboding but i go what choice we go in a taxicab to the cats house  the directeur is courteous and sympathetic he has introduced us to the cat and my eart as turned to water for it is alexander why has he not been destroyed  the directeur is speaking i ear him in a dream  if you identify im as your cat miss he has said the matter is ended my esitation when you sir approached me this morning on the matter was due to the fact that a messenger was sent with instructions that he be destroyed at once  rather rough wasnt it that on the messenger yes captain bassett has said he is facetious you understand for he is conqueror  i am silent i am not facetious for already i feelhow do you saymy fowl is cooked  not the messenger sir the directeur has said you ave misunderstood me it was the cat which was to be destroyed as per instructions of the anonymous sender  who could have played such a wicked trick miss marion has asked indignant  the directeur has stooped and from behind a table he has brought a atbox  in this he has said the above animal was conveyed but with it was no accompanying letter the sender was anonymous  peraps captain bassett has saidand still more in a dream i ear himperaps on the atbox there is some bally name or other do you not knowwhat  i clutch at the table the room is spinning round and round i have no stomachonly emptiness  why bless me the directeur has said youre quite right sir so there is funny of me not to have before observed it there is a name and also an address it is the name of jean priaulx and the address is the hotel jules priaulx paris  my companion stopped abruptly he passed a handkerchief over his forehead with a quick movement he reached for his glass of liqueur brandy and drained it at a gulp  monsieur he said you will not wish me to describe the scene there is no need for meheinto be zolaesque you can imagine  she chucked you in moments of emotion it is the simplest language that comes to the lips  he nodded  and married captain bassett  he nodded again  and your uncle i said how did he take it  he sighed  there was once more he said blooming row monsieur  he washed his hands of you  not altogether he was angry but he gave me one more chance i am still is dear brothers child and he cannot forget it an acquaintance of his a man of letters a m paul sartines was in need of a secretary the post was not well paid but it was permanent my uncle insist that i take it what choice i took it it is the post which i still old  he ordered another liqueur brandy and gulped it down  the name is familiar to you monsieur you ave eard of m sartines  i dont think i have who is he  he is a man of letters a savant for five years he has been occupied upon a great work it is with that that i assist him by collecting facts for is use i ave spent this afternoon in the british museum collecting facts tomorrow i go again and the next day and again after that the book will occupy yet another ten years before it is completed it is his great work  it sounds as if it was i said whats it about  he signalled to the waiter  garcon one other liqueur brandy the book monsieur is a istory of the cat in ancient egypt     ruth in exile   the clock struck fivebriskly as if time were money ruth warden got up from her desk and having put on her hat emerged into the outer office where m gandinot received visitors m gandinot the ugliest man in rovillesurmer presided over the local montdepiete and ruth served him from ten to five as a sort of secretaryclerk her duties if monotonous were simple they consisted of sitting detached and invisible behind a groundglass screen and entering details of loans in a fat book she was kept busy as a rule for roville possesses two casinos each offering the attraction of petits chevaux and just round the corner is monte carlo very brisk was the business done by m gandinot the pawnbroker and very frequent were the pitying shakes of the head and clicks of the tongue of m gandinot the man for in his unofficial capacity ruths employer had a gentle soul and winced at the evidences of tragedy which presented themselves before his official eyes  he blinked up at ruth as she appeared and ruth as she looked at him was conscious as usual of a lightening of the depression which nowadays seemed to have settled permanently upon her the peculiar quality of m gandinots extraordinary countenance was that it induced mirthnot mocking laughter but a kind of smiling happiness it possessed that indefinable quality which characterizes the billiken due perhaps to the unquenchable optimism which shone through the irregular features for m gandinot despite his calling believed in his fellowman  you are going mademoiselle  as ruth was wearing her hat and making for the door and as she always left at this hour a purist might have considered the question superfluous but m gandinot was a man who seized every opportunity of practising his english  you will not wait for the good papa who calls so regularly for you  i think i wont today m gandinot i want to get out into the air i have rather a headache will you tell my father i have gone to the promenade  m gandinot sighed as the door closed behind her ruths depression had not escaped his notice he was sorry for her and not without cause for fate had not dealt too kindly with ruth  it would have amazed mr eugene warden that genial old gentleman if on one of those occasions of manly emotion when he was in the habit of observing that he had been nobodys enemy but his own somebody had hinted that he had spoiled his daughters life such a thought had never entered his head he was one of those delightful irresponsible erratic persons whose heads thoughts of this kind do not enter and who are about as deadly to those whose lives are bound up with theirs as a upas tree  in the memory of his oldest acquaintance ruths father had never done anything but drift amiably through life there had been a time when he had done his drifting in london feeding cheerfully from the hand of a longsuffering brotherinlaw but though blood as he was wont to remark while negotiating his periodical loans is thicker than water a brotherinlaws affection has its limits a day came when mr warden observed with pain that his relative responded less nimbly to the touch and a little while later the other delivered his ultimatum mr warden was to leave england and to stay away from england to behave as if england no longer existed on the map and a small but sufficient allowance would be made to him if he declined to do this not another penny of the speakers money would he receive he could choose  he chose he left england ruth with him they settled in roville that haven of the exile who lives upon remittances  ruths connexion with the montdepiete had come about almost automatically very soon after their arrival it became evident that to a man of mr wardens nature resident a stonesthrow distant from two casinos the small allowance was not likely to go very far even if ruth had not wished to work circumstances could have compelled her as it was she longed for something to occupy her and the vacancy at the montdepiete occurring she had snatched at it there was a certain fitness in her working there business transactions with that useful institution had always been conducted by her it being mr wardens theory that woman can extract in these crises just that extra franc or two which is denied to the mere male through constantly going round running across stepping over and popping down to the montdepiete she had established almost a legal claim on any post that might be vacant there  and under m gandinots banner she had served ever since                                       five minutes walk took her to the promenade des anglais that apparently endless thoroughfare which is rovilles pride the evening was fine and warm the sun shone gaily on the whitewalled houses the bright gardens and the two gleaming casinos but ruth walked listlessly blind to the glitter of it all  visitors who go to roville for a few weeks in the winter are apt to speak of the place on their return in a manner that conveys the impression that it is a paradise on earth with gambling facilities thrown in but then they are visitors their sojourn comes to an end ruths did not  a voice spoke her name she turned and saw her father dapper as ever standing beside her  what an evening my dear said mr warden what an evening smell the sea  mr warden appeared to be in high spirits he hummed a tune and twirled his cane he chirruped frequently to bill the companion of his walks abroad a wiry foxterrier of a demeanour like his masters both jaunty and slightly disreputable an air of gaiety pervaded his bearing  i called in at the montdepiete but you had gone gandinot told me you had come here what an ugly fellow that gandinot is but a good sort i like him i had a chat with him  the high spirits were explained ruth knew her father she guessed correctly that m gandinot kindest of pawnbrokers had obliged in his unofficial capacity with a trifling loan  gandinot ought to go on the stage went on mr warden pursuing his theme with that face he would make his fortune you cant help laughing when you see it one of these days  he broke off stirring things had begun to occur in the neighbourhood of his ankles where bill the foxterrier had encountered an acquaintance and to the accompaniment of a loud gargling noise was endeavouring to bite his head off the acquaintance a gentleman of uncertain breed equally willing was chewing bills paw with the gusto of a gourmet an irish terrier with no personal bias towards either side was dancing round and attacking each in turn as he came uppermost and two poodles leaped madly in and out of the melee barking encouragement  it takes a better man than mr warden to break up a gathering of this kind the old gentleman was bewildered he added his voice to the babel and twice smote bill grievously with his cane with blows intended for the acquaintance but beyond that he effected nothing it seemed probable that the engagement would last till the combatants had consumed each other after the fashion of the kilkenny cats when there suddenly appeared from nowhere a young man in grey  the world is divided into those who can stop dogfights and those who cannot the young man in grey belonged to the former class within a minute from his entrance on the scene the poodles and the irish terrier had vanished the dog of doubtful breed was moving off up the hill yelping with the dispatch of one who remembers an important appointment and bill miraculously calmed was seated in the centre of the promenade licking honourable wounds  mr warden was disposed to effervesce with gratitude the scene had shaken him and there had been moments when he had given his ankles up for lost  dont mention it said the young man i enjoy arbitrating in these little disputes dogs seem to like me and trust my judgement i consider myself as a sort of honorary dog  well i am bound to say mr  vincegeorge vince  my name is warden my daughter  ruth inclined her head and was conscious of a pair of very penetrating brown eyes looking eagerly into hers in a manner which she thoroughly resented she was not used to the other sex meeting her gaze and holding it as if confident of a friendly welcome she made up her mind in that instant that this was a young man who required suppression  ive seen you several times out here since i arrived miss warden said mr vince four in all he added precisely  really said ruth  she looked away her attitude seemed to suggest that she had finished with him and would be obliged if somebody would come and sweep him up  as they approached the casino restlessness crept into mr wardens manner at the door he stopped and looked at ruth  i think my dear he said  going to have a dash at the petits chevaux inquired mr vince i was there just now i have an infallible system  mr warden started like a warhorse at the sound of the trumpet  only its infallible the wrong way went on the young man well i wish you luck ill see miss warden home  please dont trouble said ruth in the haughty manner which had frequently withered unfortunate fellowexiles in their tracks  it had no such effect on mr vince  i shall like it he said  ruth set her teeth she would see whether he would like it  they left mr warden who shot in at the casino door like a homing rabbit and walked on in silence which lasted till ruth suddenly becoming aware that her companions eyes were fixed on her face turned her head to meet a gaze of complete not to say loving admiration she flushed she was accustomed to being looked at admiringly but about this particular look there was a subtle quality that distinguished it from the ordinarysomething proprietorial  mr vince appeared to be a young man who wasted no time on conventional conversationopenings  do you believe in affinities miss warden he said  no said ruth  you will before weve done said mr vince confidently why did you try to snub me just now  did i  you mustnt again it hurts me im a sensitive man diffident shy miss warden will you marry me  ruth had determined that nothing should shake her from her icy detachment but this did she stopped with a gasp and stared at him  mr vince reassured her  i dont expect you to say yes that was just a beginningthe shot fired across the bows by way of warning in you miss warden i have found my affinity have you ever considered this matter of affinities affinities are thethewait a moment  he paused reflecting  i began ruth  sh said the young man holding up his hand  ruths eyes flashed she was not used to having sh said to her by young men and she resented it  ive got it he declared with relief i knew i should but these good things take time affinities are the zero on the rouletteboard of life just as we select a number on which to stake our money so do we select a type of girl whom we think we should like to marry and just as zero pops up instead of the number so does our affinity come along and upset all our preconceived notions of the type of girl we should like to marry  i began ruth again  the analogy is in the rough at present i havent had time to condense and polish it but you see the idea take my case for instance when i saw you a couple of days ago i knew in an instant that you were my affinity but for years i had been looking for a woman almost your exact opposite you are dark three days ago i couldnt have imagined myself marrying anyone who was not fair your eyes are grey three days ago my preference for blue eyes was a byword you have a shocking temper three days ago  mr vince  there said that philosopher complacently you stamped the gentle blueeyed blonde whom i was looking for three days ago would have drooped timidly three days ago my passion for timid droopers amounted to an obsession  ruth did not reply it was useless to bandy words with one who gave such clear evidence of being something out of the common run of wordbandiers no verbal attack could crush this extraordinary young man she walked on all silence and stony profile uncomfortably conscious that her companion was in no way abashed by the former and was regarding the latter with that frank admiration which had made itself so obnoxious to her before until they reached their destination mr vince meanwhile chatted cheerfully and pointed out objects of interest by the wayside  at the door ruth permitted herself a word of farewell  goodbye she said  till tomorrow evening said mr vince i shall be coming to dinner  mr warden ambled home very happy and contented two hours later with half a franc in his pocket this comparative wealth being due to the fact that the minimum stake permitted by the roville casino is just double that sum he was sorry not to have won but his mind was too full of rosy dreams to permit of remorse it was the estimable old gentlemans dearest wish that his daughter should marry some rich openhanded man who would keep him in affluence for the remainder of his days and to that end he was in the habit of introducing to her notice any such that came his way there was no question of coercing ruth he was too tenderhearted for that besides he couldnt ruth was not the sort of girl who is readily coerced he contented himself with giving her the opportunity to inspect his exhibits roville is a sociable place and it was not unusual for him to make friends at the casino and to bring them home when made for a cigar up to the present he was bound to admit his efforts had not been particularly successful ruth he reflected sadly was a curious girl she did not show her best side to these visitors there was no encouragement in her manner she was apt to frighten the unfortunate exhibits but of this young man vince he had brighter hopes he was rich that was proved by the very handsome way in which he had behaved in the matter of a small loan when looking in at the casino after parting from ruth he had found mr warden in sore straits for want of a little capital to back a brandnew system which he had conceived through closely observing the run of the play he was also obviously attracted by ruth and as he was remarkably presentableindeed quite an unusually goodlooking young manthere seemed no reason why ruth should not be equally attracted by him the world looked good to mr warden as he fell asleep that night  ruth did not fall asleep so easily the episode had disturbed her a new element had entered her life and one that gave promise of producing strange byproducts  when on the following evening ruth returned from the stroll on the promenade which she always took after leaving the montdepiete with a feeling of irritation towards things in general this feeling was not diminished by the sight of mr vince very much at his ease standing against the mantelpiece of the tiny parlour  how do you do he said by an extraordinary coincidence i happened to be hanging about outside this house just now when your father came along and invited me in to dinner have you ever thought much about coincidences miss warden to my mind they may be described as the zero on the rouletteboard of life  he regarded her fondly  for a shy man conscious that the girl he loves is inspecting him closely and making up her mind about him he proceeded these unexpected meetings are very trying ordeals you must not form your judgement of me too hastily you see me now nervous embarrassed tonguetied but i am not always like this beneath this crust of diffidence there is sterling stuff miss warden people who know me have spoken of me as a little ray of sunbut here is your father  mr warden was more than usually disappointed with ruth during dinner it was the same old story so far from making herself pleasant to this attractive stranger she seemed positively to dislike him she was barely civil to him with a sigh mr warden told himself that he did not understand ruth and the rosy dreams he had formed began to fade  ruths ideas on the subject of mr vince as the days went by were chaotic though she told herself that she thoroughly objected to him he had nevertheless begun to have an undeniable attraction for her in what this attraction consisted she could not say when she tried to analyse it she came to the conclusion that it was due to the fact that he was the only element in her life that made for excitement since his advent the days had certainly passed more swiftly for her the dead level of monotony had been broken there was a certain fascination in exerting herself to suppress him which increased daily as each attempt failed  mr vince put this feeling into words for her he had a maddening habit of discussing the progress of his courtship in the manner of an impartial lecturer  i am making headway he observed the fact that we cannot meet without your endeavouring to plant a temperamental left jab on my spiritual solar plexus encourages me to think that you are beginning at last to understand that we are affinities to persons of spirit like ourselves the only happy marriage is that which is based on a firm foundation of almost incessant quarrelling the most beautiful line in english poetry to my mind is we fell out my wife and i you would be wretched with a husband who didnt like you to quarrel with him the position of affairs now is that i have become necessary to you if i went out of your life now i should leave an aching void you would still have that beautiful punch of yours and there would be nobody to exercise it on you would pine away from now on matters should i think move rapidly during the course of the next week i shall endeavour to propitiate you with gifts here is the first of them  he took a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it her it was a pencilsketch rough and unfinished but wonderfully clever even ruth could appreciate thatand she was a prejudiced observer for the sketch was a caricature of herself it represented her drawn up to her full height with enormous scornful eyes and curling lips and the artist had managed to combine an excellent likeness while accentuating everything that was marked in what she knew had come to be her normal expression of scorn and discontent  i didnt know you were an artist mr vince she said handing it back  a poor amateur nothing more you may keep it  i have not the slightest wish to keep it  you havent  it is not in the least clever and it is very impertinent of you to show it to me the drawing is not funny it is simply rude  a little more said mr vince and i shall begin to think you dont like it are you fond of chocolates  ruth did not answer  i am sending you some tomorrow  i shall return them  then i shall send some more and some fruit gifts soliloquized mr vince gifts that is the secret keep sending gifts if men would only stick to gifts and quarrelling there would be fewer bachelors  on the morrow as promised the chocolates arrived many pounds of them in a lordly box the bludgeoning of fate had not wholly scotched in ruth a human weakness for sweets and it was with a distinct effort that she wrapped the box up again and returned it to the sender she went off to her work at the montdepiete with a glow of satisfaction which comes to those who exhibit an iron will in trying circumstances  and at the montdepiete there occurred a surprising incident  surprising incidents as mr vince would have said are the zero on the rouletteboard of life they pop up disturbingly when least expected confusing the mind and altering preconceived opinions and this was a very surprising incident indeed  ruth as has been stated sat during her hours of work behind a groundglass screen unseen and unseeing to her the patrons of the establishment were mere disembodied voiceswheedling voices pathetic voices voices that protested voices that hectored voices that whined moaned broke appealed to the saints and in various other ways endeavoured to instil into m gandinot more spacious and princely views on the subject advancing money on property pledged she was sitting behind her screen this morning scribbling idly on the blottingpad for there had been a lull in the business when the door opened and the polite bonjour monsieur of m gandinot announced the arrival of another unfortunate  and then shaking her like an electric shock came a voice that she knewthe pleasant voice of mr vince  the dialogues that took place on the other side of the screen were often protracted and always sordid but none had seemed to ruth so interminable so hideously sordid as this one  round and round its miserable centrea silver cigarettecasethe dreary argument circled the young man pleaded m gandinot adamant in his official role was immovable  ruth could bear it no longer she pressed her hands over her burning ears and the voices ceased to trouble her  and with the silence came thought and a blaze of understanding that flashed upon her and made all things clear she understood now why she had closed her ears  poverty is an acid which reacts differently on differing natures it had reduced mr eugene wardens selfrespect to a minimum ruths it had reared up to an abnormal growth her pride had become a weed that ran riot in her soul darkening it and choking finer emotions perhaps it was her fathers naive stratagems for the enmeshing of a wealthy husband that had produced in her at last a morbid antipathy to the idea of playing beggarmaid to any mans king cophetua the state of mind is intelligible the cophetua legend never has been told from the beggarmaids point of view and there must have been moments when if a woman of spirit she resented that monarchs somewhat condescending attitude and felt that secure in his wealth and magnificence he had taken her grateful acquiescence very much for granted  this she saw now was what had prejudiced her against george vince she had assumed that he was rich he had conveyed the impression of being rich and she had been on the defensive against him accordingly now for the first time she seemed to know him a barrier had been broken down the royal robes had proved tinsel and no longer disguised the man she loved  a touch on her arm aroused her m gandinot was standing by her side terms apparently had been agreed upon and the interview concluded for in his hand was a silver cigarettecase  dreaming mademoiselle i could not make you hear the more i call to you the more you did not answer it is necessary to enter this loan  he recited the details and ruth entered them in her ledger this done m gandinot doffing his official self sighed  it is a place of much sorrow mademoiselle this office how he would not take no for an answer that young man recently departed a fellowcountryman of yours mademoiselle you would say what does this young man so welldressed in a montdepiete but i know better i gandinot you have an expression you englishi heard it in paris in a cafe and inquired its meaningwhen you say of a man that he swanks how many young men have i seen here admirably dressedrich you would say no no the montdepiete permits no secrets to swank mademoiselle what is it to deceive the world yes but not the montdepiete yesterday also when you had departed was he here that young man yet here he is once more today he spends his money quickly alas that poor young swanker  when ruth returned home that evening she found her father in the sittingroom smoking a cigarette he greeted her with effusion but with some uneasinessfor the old gentleman had nerved himself to a delicate task he had made up his mind tonight to speak seriously to ruth on the subject of her unsatisfactory behaviour to mr vince the more he saw of that young man the more positive was he that this was the human goldmine for which he had been searching all these weary years accordingly he threw away his cigarette kissed ruth on the forehead and began to speak  it had long been mr wardens opinion that if his daughter had a fault it was a tendency towards a quite unnecessary and highly inconvenient frankness she had not that tact which he would have liked a daughter of his to possess she would not evade ignore agree not to see she was at times painfully blunt  this happened now he was warming to his subject when she interrupted him with a question  what makes you think mr vince is rich father she asked  mr warden was embarrassed the subject of mr vinces opulence had not entered into his discourse he had carefully avoided it the fact that he was thinking of it and that ruth knew that he was thinking of it and that he knew that ruth knew had nothing to do with the case the question was not in order and it embarrassed him  iwhyi donti never said he was rich my dear i have no doubt that he has ample  he is quite poor  mr wardens jaw fell slightly  poor but my dear thats absurd he cried why only this evening  he broke off abruptly but it was too late  father youve been borrowing money from him  mr warden drew in his breath preparatory to an indignant denial but he altered his mind and remained silent as a borrower of money he had every quality but one he had come to look on her perspicacity in this matter as a sort of second sight it had frequently gone far to spoiling for him the triumph of success  and he has to pawn things to live her voice trembled he was at the montdepiete today and yesterday too i heard him he was arguing with m gandinothaggling  her voice broke she was sobbing helplessly the memory of it was too raw and vivid  mr warden stood motionless many emotions raced through his mind but chief among them the thought that this revelation had come at a very fortunate time an exceedingly lucky escape he felt he was aware also of a certain measure of indignation against this deceitful young man who had fraudulently imitated a goldmine with what might have been disastrous results  the door opened and jeanne the maidofallwork announced mr vince  he entered the room briskly  good evening he said i have brought you some more chocolates miss warden and some fruit great scott whats the matter  he stopped but only for an instant the next he had darted across the room and before the horrified eyes of mr warden was holding ruth in his arms she clung to him  bill the foxterrier over whom mr vince had happened to stumble was the first to speak almost simultaneously mr warden joined in and there was a striking similarity between the two voices for mr warden searching for words emitted as a preliminary to them a sort of passionate yelp  mr vince removed the hand that was patting ruths shoulder and waved it reassuringly at him  its all right he said  all right all right  affinities explained mr vince over his shoulder two hearts that beat as one were going to be married whats the matter dear dont you worry youre all right  i refuse shouted mr warden i absolutely refuse  mr vince lowered ruth gently into a chair and holding her hand inspected the fermenting old gentleman gravely  you refuse he said why i thought you liked me  mr wardens frenzy had cooled it had been something foreign to his nature he regretted it these things had to be managed with restraint  my personal likes and dislikes he said have nothing to do with the matter mr vince they are beside the point i have my daughter to consider i cannot allow her to marry a man without a penny  quite right said mr vince approvingly dont have anything to do with the fellow if he tries to butt in send for the police  mr warden hesitated he had always been a little ashamed of ruths occupation but necessity compelled  mr vince my daughter is employed at the montdepiete and was a witness to all that took place this afternoon  mr vince was genuinely agitated he looked at ruth his face full of concern  you dont mean to say you have been slaving away in that stuffygreat scott ill have you out of that quick you mustnt go there again  he stooped and kissed her  perhaps you had better let me explain he said explanations i always think are the zero on the rouletteboard of life theyre always somewhere about waiting to pop up have you ever heard of vinces stores mr warden perhaps they are since your time well my father is the proprietor one of our specialities is childrens toys but we havent picked a real winner for years and my father when i last saw him seemed so distressed about it that i said id see if i couldnt whack out an idea for something something on the lines of the billiken only better was what he felt he needed im not used to brain work and after a spell of it i felt i wanted a rest i came here to recuperate and the very first morning i got an inspiration you may have noticed that the manager of the montdepiete here isnt strong on conventional good looks i saw him at the casino and the thing flashed on me he thinks his names gandinot but it isnt its uncle zip the humpcurer the man who makes you smile  he pressed ruths hand affectionately  i lost track of him and it was only the day before yesterday that i discovered who he was and where he was to be found well you cant go up to a man and ask him to pose as a model for uncle zip the humpcurer the only way to get sittings was to approach him in the way of business so i collected what property i had and waded in thats the whole story do i pass  mr wardens frosty demeanour had gradually thawed during this recital and now the sun of his smile shone out warmly he gripped mr vinces hand with every evidence of esteem and after that he did what was certainly the best thing by passing gently from the room on his face as he went was a look such as moses might have worn on the summit of pisgah  it was some twenty minutes later that ruth made a remark  i want you to promise me something she said promise that you wont go on with that uncle zip drawing i know it means ever so much money but it might hurt poor m gandinots feelings and he has been very kind to me  that settles it said mr vince its hard on the children of great britain but say no more no uncle zip for them  ruth looked at him almost with awe  you really wont go on with it in spite of all the money you would make are you always going to do just what i ask you no matter what it costs you  he nodded sadly  you have sketched out in a few words the whole policy of my married life i feel an awful fraud and i had encouraged you to look forward to years of incessant quarrelling do you think you can manage without it im afraid its going to be shockingly dull for you said mr vince regretfully     archibalds benefit   archibald mealing was one of those golfers in whom desire outruns performance nobody could have been more willing than archibald he tried and tried hard every morning before he took his bath he would stand in front of his mirror and practise swings every night before he went to bed he would read the golden words of some master on the subject of putting driving or approaching yet on the links most of his time was spent in retrieving lost balls or replacing america whether it was that archibald pressed too much or pressed too little whether it was that his club deviated from the dotted line which joined the two points a and b in the illustrated plate of the man making the brassy shot in the hints on golf book or whether it was that he was pursued by some malignant fate i do not know archibald rather favoured the last theory  the important point is that in his thirtyfirst year after six seasons of untiring effort archibald went in for a championship and won it  archibald mark you whose golf was a kind of blend of hockey swedish drill and buckandwing dancing  i know the ordeal i must face when i make such a statement i see clearly before me the solid phalanx of men from missouri some urging me to tell it to the king of denmark others insisting that i produce my eskimos nevertheless i do not shrink i state once more that in his thirtyfirst year archibald mealing went in for a golf championship and won it                                       archibald belonged to a select little golf club the members of which lived and worked in new york but played in jersey men of substance financially as well as physically they had combined their superfluous cash and with it purchased a strip of land close to the sea this land had been drainedto the huge discomfort of a colony of mosquitoes which had come to look on the place as their private propertyand converted into links which had become a sort of refuge for incompetent golfers the members of the cape pleasant club were easygoing refugees from other and more exacting clubs men who pottered rather than raced round the links men in short who had grown tired of having to stop their game and stand aside in order to allow perspiring experts to whiz past them the cape pleasant golfers did not make themselves slaves to the game their language when they foozled was gently regretful rather than sulphurous the moment in the days play which they enjoyed most was when they were saying well heres luck in the clubhouse  it will therefore be readily understood that archibalds inability to do a hole in single figures did not handicap him at cape pleasant as it might have done at st andrews his kindly clubmates took him to their bosoms to a man and looked on him as a brother archibalds was one of those admirable natures which prompt their possessor frequently to remark these are on me and his fellow golfers were not slow to appreciate the fact they all loved archibald  archibald was on the floor of his bedroom one afternoon picking up the fragments of his mirrora friend had advised him to practise the walter j travis lofting shotwhen the telephone bell rang he took up the receiver and was hailed by the comfortable voice of mccay the club secretary  is that mealing asked mccay say archie im putting your name down for our championship competition thats right isnt it  sure said archibald when does it start  next saturday  thats me  good for you oh archie  hello  a man i met today told me you were engaged is that a fact  sure murmured archibald blushfully  the wire hummed with mccays congratulations  thanks said archibald thanks old man what oh yes milsoms her name by the way her family have taken a cottage at cape pleasant for the summer some distance from the links yes very convenient isnt it goodbye  he hung up the receiver and resumed his task of gathering up the fragments now mccay happened to be of a romantic and sentimental nature he was by profession a chartered accountant and inclined to be stout and all rather stout chartered accountants are sentimental mccay was the sort of man who keeps old ball programmes and bundles of letters tied round with lilac ribbon at country houses where they lingered in the porch after dinner to watch the moonlight flooding the quiet garden it was mccay and his colleague who lingered longest mccay knew ella wheeler wilcox by heart and could take browning without anaesthetics it is not to be wondered at therefore that archibalds remark about his fiancee coming to live at cape pleasant should give him food for thought it appealed to him  he reflected on it a good deal during the day and running across sigsbee a fellow cape pleasanter after dinner that night at the sybarites club he spoke of the matter to him it so happened that both had dined excellently and were looking on the world with a sort of cosy benevolence they were in the mood when men pat small boys on the head and ask them if they mean to be president when they grow up  i called up archie mealing today said mccay did you know he was engaged  i did hear something about it girl of the name of wilson or  milsom shes going to spend the summer at cape pleasant archie tells me  then shell have a chance of seeing him play in the championship competition  mccay sucked his cigar in silence for a while watching with dreamy eyes the blue smoke as it curled ceilingward when he spoke his voice was singularly soft  do you know sigsbee he said sipping his maraschino with a gentle melancholydo you know there is something wonderfully pathetic to me in this business i see the whole thing so clearly there was a kind of quiver in the poor old chaps voice when he said she is coming to cape pleasant which told me more than any words could have done it is a tragedy in its way sigsbee we may smile at it think it trivial but it is none the less a tragedy that warmhearted enthusiastic girl all eagerness to see the man she loves do wellarchie poor old archie all on fire to prove to her that her trust in him is not misplaced and the enddisillusionmentdisappointmentunhappiness  he ought to keep his eye on the ball said the more practical sigsbee  quite possibly continued mccay he has told her that he will win this championship  if archies mutt enough to have told her that said sigsbee decidedly he deserves all he gets waiter two scotch highballs  mccay was in no mood to subscribe to this stonyhearted view  i tell you he said im sorry for archie im sorry for the poor old chap and im more than sorry for the girl  well i dont see what we can do said sigsbee we can hardly be expected to foozle on purpose just to let archie show off before his girl  mccay paused in the act of lighting his cigar as one smitten with a great thought  why not he said why not sigsbee sigsbee youve hit it  eh  you have i tell you sigsbee youve solved the whole thing archies such a bully good fellow why not give him a benefit why not let him win this championship you arent going to tell me that you care whether you win a tin medal or not  sigsbees benevolence was expanding under the influence of the scotch highball and his cigar little acts of kindness on archies part here a cigar there a lunch at another time seats for the theatre began to rise to the surface of his memory like rainbowcoloured bubbles he wavered  yes but what about the rest of the men he said there will be a dozen or more in for the medal  we can square them said mccay confidently we will broach the matter to them at a series of dinners at which we will be joint hosts they are white men who will be charmed to do a little thing like that for a sport like archie  how about gossett said sigsbee  mccays face clouded gossett was an unpopular subject with members of the cape pleasant golf club he was the serpent in their eden nobody seemed quite to know how he had got in but there unfortunately he was gossett had introduced into cape pleasant golf a cheerless atmosphere of the rigour of the game it was to enable them to avoid just such golfers as gossett that the cape pleasanters had founded their club genial courtesy rather than strict attention to the rules had been the leading characteristics of their play till his arrival up to that time it had been looked on as rather bad form to exact a penalty a cheery giveandtake system had prevailed then gossett had come full of strange rules and created about the same stir in the community which a hawk would create in a gathering of middleaged doves  you cant square gossett said sigsbee  mccay looked unhappy  i forgot him he said of course nothing will stop him trying to win i wish we could think of something i would almost as soon see him lose as archie win but after all he does have off days sometimes  you need to have a very off day to be as bad as archie  they sat and smoked in silence  ive got it said sigsbee suddenly gossett is a fine golfer but nervous if we upset his nerves enough he will go right off his stroke couldnt we think of some way  mccay reached out for his glass  yours is a noble nature sigsbee he said  oh no said the paragon modestly have another cigar                                       in order that the render may get the mental halfnelson on the plot of this narrative which is so essential if a short story is to charm elevate and instruct it is necessary now for the nonce but only for the nonce to inspect archibalds past life  archibald as he had stated to mccay was engaged to a miss milsommiss margaret milsom how few men dear reader are engaged to girls with svelte figures brown hair and large blue eyes now sparkling and vivacious now dreamy and soulful but always large and blue how few i say you are dear reader and so am i but who else archibald was one of the few who happened to be  he was happy it is true that margarets mother was not as it were wrapped up in him she exhibited none of that effervescent joy at his appearance which we like to see in our mothersinlaw elect on the contrary she generally cried bitterly whenever she saw him and at the end of ten minutes was apt to retire sobbing to her room where she remained in a state of semicoma till an advanced hour she was by way of being a confirmed invalid and something about archibald seemed to get right in among her nerve centres reducing them for the time being to a complicated hash she did not like archibald she said she liked big manly men behind his back she not infrequently referred to him as a gaby sometimes even as that guffin  she did not do this to margaret for margaret besides being blueeyed was also a shade quicktempered whenever she discussed archibald it was with her son stuyvesant stuyvesant milsom who thought archibald a bit of an ass was always ready to sit and listen to his mother on the subject it being however an understood thing that at the conclusion of the seance she yielded one or two saffroncoloured bills towards his racing debts for stuyvesant having developed a habit of backing horses which either did not start at all or else sat down and thought in the middle of the race could always do with ten dollars or so his prices for these interviews worked out as a rule at about three cents a word  in these circumstances it was perhaps natural that archibald and margaret should prefer to meet when they did meet at some other spot than the milsom home it suited them both better that they should arrange a secret tryst on these occasions archibald preferred it because being in the same room as mrs milsom always made him feel like a murderer with particularly large feet and margaret preferred it because as she told archibald these secret meetings lent a touch of poetry to what might otherwise have been a commonplace engagement  archibald thought this charming but at the same time he could not conceal from himself the fact that margarets passion for the poetic cut so to speak both ways he admired and loved the loftiness of her soul but on the other hand it was a tough job having to live up to it for archibald was a very ordinary young man they had tried to inoculate him with a love of poetry at school but it had not taken until he was thirty he had been satisfied to class all poetry except that of mr george cohan under the general heading of punk then he met margaret and the trouble began on the day he first met her at a picnic she had looked so soulful so aloof from this world that he had felt instinctively that here was a girl who expected more from a man than a mere statement that the weather was great it so chanced that he knew just one quotation from the classics to wit tennysons critique of the islandvalley of avilion he knew this because he had had the passage to write out one hundred and fifty times at school on the occasion of his being caught smoking by one of the faculty who happened to be a passionate admirer of the idylls of the king  a remark of margarets that it was a splendid day for a picnic and that the country looked nice gave him his opportunity  it reminds me he said it reminds me strongly of the islandvalley of avilion where falls not hail or rain or any snow nor ever wind blows loudly but it lies deepmeadowd happy fair with orchard lawns  he broke off here to squash a hornet but margaret had heard enough are you fond of the poets mr mealing she said with a faroff look  me said archibald fervently me why i eat em alive                                       and that was how all the trouble had started it had meant unremitting toil for archibald he felt that he had set himself a standard from which he must not fall he bought every new volume of poetry which was praised in the press and learned the reviews by heart every evening he read painfully a portion of the classics he plodded through the poetry sections of bartletts familiar quotations margarets devotion to the various bards was so enthusiastic and her reading so wide that there were times when archibald wondered if he could endure the strain but he persevered heroically and so far had not been found wanting but the strain was fearful                                       the early stages of the cape pleasant golf tournament need no detailed description the rules of match play governed the contests and archibald disposed of his first three opponents before the twelfth hole he had been diffident when he teed off with mccay in the first round but finding that he defeated the secretary with ease he met one butler in the second round with more confidence butler too he routed with the result that by the time he faced sigsbee in round three he was practically the conquering hero fortune seemed to be beaming upon him with almost insipid sweetness when he was trapped in the bunker at the seventh hole sigsbee became trapped as well when he sliced at the sixth tee sigsbee pulled and archibald striking a brilliant vein did the next three holes in eleven nine and twelve and romping home qualified for the final  gossett that serpent meanwhile had beaten each of his three opponents without much difficulty  the final was fixed for the following thursday morning gossett who was a broker had made some frivolous objection about the difficulty of absenting himself from wall street but had been overruled when sigsbee pointed out that he could easily defeat archibald and get to the city by lunchtime if he wished and that in any case his partner would be looking after things he allowed himself to be persuaded though reluctantly it was a wellknown fact that gossett was in the midst of some rather sizeable deals at that time  thursday morning suited archibald admirably it had occurred to him that he could bring off a double event margaret had arrived at cape pleasant on the previous evening and he had arranged by telephone to meet her at the end of the boardwalk which was about a mile from the links at one oclock supply her with lunch and spend the afternoon with her on the water if he started his match with gossett at eleventhirty he would have plenty of time to have his game and be at the end of the boardwalk at the appointed hour he had no delusions about the respective merits of gossett and himself as golfers he knew that gossett would win the necessary ten holes off the reel it was saddening but it was a scientific fact there was no avoiding it one simply had to face it  having laid these plans he caught the train on the thursday morning with the consoling feeling that however sadly the morning might begin it was bound to end well  the day was fine the sun warm but tempered with a light breeze one or two of the club had come to watch the match among them sigsbee  sigsbee drew gossett aside  you must let me caddie for you old man he said i know your temperament so exactly i know how little it takes to put you off your stroke in an ordinary game you might take one of these boys i know but on an important occasion like this you must not risk it a grubby boy probably with a squint would almost certainly get on your nerves he might even make comments on the game or whistle but i understand you you must let me carry your clubs  its very good of you said gossett  not at all said sigsbee                                       archibald was now preparing to drive off from the first tee he did this with great care everyone who has seen archibald mealing play golf knows that his teeing off is one of the most impressive sights ever witnessed on the links he tilted his cap over his eyes waggled his club a little shifted his feet waggled his club some more gazed keenly towards the horizon for a moment waggled his club again and finally with the air of a strong man lifting a bar of iron raised it slowly above his head then bringing it down with a sweep he drove the ball with a lofty slice some fifty yards it was rarely that he failed either to slice or pull his ball his progress from hole to hole was generally a majestic zigzag  gossetts drive took him well on the way to the green he holed out in five archibald mournful but not surprised made his way to the second tee  the second hole was shorter gossett won it in three the third he took in six the fourth in four archibald began to feel that he might just as well not be there he was practically a spectator  at this point he reached in his pocket for his tobaccopouch to console himself with smoke to his dismay he found it was not there he had had it in the train but now it had vanished this added to his gloom for the pouch had been given to him by margaret and he had always thought it one more proof of the way her nature towered over the natures of other girls that she had not woven a monogram on it in forgetmenots this record pouch was missing and archibald mourned for the loss  his sorrows were not alleviated by the fact that gossett won the fifth and sixth holes  it was now a quarter past twelve and archibald reflected with moody satisfaction that the massacre must soon be over and that he would then be able to forget it in the society of margaret  as gossett was about to drive off from the seventh tee a telegraph boy approached the little group  mr gossett he said  gossett lowered his driver and wheeled round but sigsbee had snatched the envelope from the boys hand  its all right old man he said go right ahead ill keep it safe for you  give it to me said gossett anxiously it may be from the office something may have happened to the market i may be needed  no no said sigsbee soothingly dont you worry about it better not open it it might have something in it that would put you off your stroke wait till the end of the game  give it to me i want to see it  sigsbee was firm  no he said im here to see you win this championship and i wont have you taking any risks besides even if it was important a few minutes wont make any difference  well at any rate open it and read it  it is probably in cipher said sigsbee i wouldnt understand it play on old man youve only a few more holes to win  gossett turned and addressed his ball again then he swung the club tipped the ball and it rolled sluggishly for a couple of feet archibald approached the tee now there were moments when archibald could drive quite decently he always applied a considerable amount of muscular force to his efforts it was in that direction as a rule he erred on this occasion whether inspired by his rivals failure or merely favoured by chance he connected with his ball at precisely the right moment it flew from the tee straight hard and low struck the ground near the green bounded on and finally rocked to within a foot of the hole no such long ball had been driven on the cape pleasant links since their foundation  that it should have taken him three strokes to hole out from this promising position was unfortunate but not fatal for gossett who seemed suddenly to have fallen off his game only reached the green in seven a moment later a murmur of approval signified the fact that archibald had won his first hole  mr gossett said a voice  those murmuring approval observed that the telegraph boy was once more in their midst this time he bore two missives sigsbee dexterously impounded both  no he said with decision i absolutely refuse to let you look at them till the game is over i know your temperament  gossett gesticulated  but they must be important they must come from my office where else would i get a stream of telegrams something has gone wrong i am urgently needed  sigsbee nodded gravely  that is what i fear he said that is why i cannot risk having you upset time enough gossett for bad news after the game play on man and dismiss it from your mind besides you couldnt get back to new york just yet in any case there are no trains dismiss the whole thing from your mind and just play your usual and youre sure to win  archibald had driven off during this conversation but without his previous success this time he had pulled his ball into some long grass gossetts drive was however worse and the subsequent movement of the pair to the hole resembled more than anything else the manoeuvres of two men rolling peanuts with toothpicks as the result of an election bet archibald finally took the hole in twelve after gossett had played his fourteenth  when archibald won the next in eleven and the tenth in nine hope began to flicker feebly in his bosom but when he won two more holes bringing the score to likeaswelie it flamed up within him like a beacon  the ordinary golfer whose scores per hole seldom exceed those of colonel bogey does not understand the whirl of mixed sensations which the really incompetent performer experiences on the rare occasions when he does strike a winning vein as stroke follows stroke and he continues to hold his opponent a wild exhilaration surges through him followed by a sort of awe as if he were doing something wrong even irreligious then all these yeasty emotions subside and are blended into one glorious sensation of grandeur and majesty as of a giant among pygmies  by the time that archibald putting with the care of one brushing flies off a sleeping venus had holed out and won the thirteenth he was in the full grip of this feeling and as he walked to the fifteenth tee after winning the fourteenth he felt that this was life that till now he had been a mere mollusc  just at that moment he happened to look at his watch and the sight was like a douche of cold water the hands stood at five minutes to one                                       let us pause and ponder on this point for a while let us not dismiss it as if it were some mere trivial everyday difficulty you dear reader play an accurate scientific game and beat your opponent with ease every time you go the links and so do i but archibald was not like us this was the first occasion on which he had ever felt that he was playing well enough to give him a chance of defeating a really good man true he had beaten mccay sigsbee and butler in the earlier rounds but they were ignoble rivals compared with gossett to defeat gossett however meant the championship on the other hand he was passionately devoted to margaret milsom whom he was due to meet at the end of the boardwalk at one sharp it was now five minutes to one and the end of the boardwalk still a mile away  the mental struggle was brief but keen a sharp pang and his mind was made up cost what it might he must stay on the links if margaret broke off the engagementwell it might be that time would heal the wound and that after many years he would find some other girl for whom he might come to care in a wrecked broken sort of way but a chance like this could never come again what is love compared with holing out before your opponent  the excitement now had become so intense that a small boy following with the crowd swallowed his chewinggum for a slight improvement had become noticeable in gossetts play and a slight improvement in the play of almost anyone meant that it became vastly superior to archibalds at the next hole the improvement was not marked enough to have its full effect and archibald contrived to halve this made him two up and three to play what the average golfer would consider a commanding lead but archibald was no average golfer a commanding lead for him would have been two up and one to play  to give the public of his best your golfer should have his mind cool and intent upon the game inasmuch as gossett was worrying about the telegrams while archibald strive as he might to dismiss it was haunted by a vision of margaret standing alone and deserted on the boardwalk play became as it were ragged fine putting enabled gossett to do the sixteenth hole in twelve and when winning the seventeenth in nine he brought his score level with archibalds the match seemed over but just then  mr gossett said a familiar voice  once more was the muchenduring telegraph boy among those present  tree dis time he observed  gossett sprang but again the watchful sigsbee was too swift  be brave gossettbe brave he said this is a crisis in the game keep your nerve play just as if nothing existed outside the links to look at these telegrams now would be fatal  eyewitnesses of that great encounter will tell the story of the last hole to their dying day it was one of those titanic struggles which time cannot efface from the memory archibald was fortunate in getting a good start he only missed twice before he struck his ball on the tee gossett had four strokes ere he achieved the feat nor did archibalds luck desert him in the journey to the green he was out of the bunker in eleven  gossett emerged only after sixteen finally when archibalds twentyfirst stroke sent the ball trickling into the hole gossett had played his thirtieth  the ball had hardly rested on the bottom of the hole before gossett had begun to tear the telegrams from their envelopes as he read his eyes bulged in their sockets  not bad news i hope said a sympathetic bystander  sigsbee took the sheaf of telegrams  the first ran good luck hope you win mccay the second also ran good luck hope you win mccay so singularly enough did the third fourth fifth sixth and seventh  great scott said sigsbee he seems to have been pretty anxious not to run any risk of missing you gossett  as he spoke archibald close beside him was looking at his watch the hands stood at a quarter to two  margaret and her mother were seated in the parlour when archibald arrived mrs milsom who had elicited the fact that archibald had not kept his appointment had been saying i told you so for some time and this had not improved margarets temper when therefore archibald damp and dishevelled was shown in the chill in the air nearly gave him frostbite mrs milsom did her celebrated imitation of the gorgon while margaret lightly humming an air picked up a weekly paper and became absorbed in it  margaret let me explain panted archibald mrs milsom was understood to remark that she dared say margarets attention was riveted by a fashion plate  driving in a taximeter to the ferry this morning resumed archibald i had an accident  this was the result of some rather feverish brainwork on the way from the links to the cottage  the periodical flopped to the floor  oh archie are you hurt  a few scratches nothing more but it made me miss my train  what train did you catch asked mrs milsom sepulchrally  the one oclock i came straight on here from the station  why said margaret stuyvesant was coming home on the one oclock train did you see him  archibalds jaw dropped slightly  erno he said  how curious said margaret  very curious said archibald  most curious said mrs milsom  they were still reflecting on the singularity of this fact when the door opened and the son of the house entered in person  thought i should find you here mealing he said they gave me this at the station to give to you you dropped it this morning when you got out of the train  he handed archibald the missing pouch  thanks said the latter huskily when you say this morning of course you mean this afternoon but thanks all the samethanksthanks  no archibald mealing he does not mean this afternoon said mrs milsom stuyvesant speak from what train did that gufdid mr mealing alight when he dropped the tobaccopouch                                       the ten oclock the fellow told me said he would have given it back to him then only he sprinted off in the deuce of a hurry  six eyes focused themselves upon archibald  margaret he said i will not try to deceive you  you may try observed mrs milsom but you will not succeed  well archibald  archibald fingered his collar  there was no taximeter accident  ah said mrs milsom  the fact is i have been playing in a golf tournament  margaret uttered an exclamation of surprise  playing golf  archibald bowed his head with manly resignation  why didnt you tell me why didnt you arrange for us to meet on the links i should have loved it  archibald was amazed  you take an interest in golf margaret you i thought you scorned it considered it an unintellectual game i thought you considered all games unintellectual  why i play golf myself not very well  margaret why didnt you tell me  i thought you might not like it you were so spiritual so poetic i feared you would despise me  archibald took a step forward his voice was tense and trembling  margaret he said this is no time for misunderstandings we must be open with one another our happiness is at stake tell me honestly do you like poetry really  margaret hesitated then answered bravely  no archibald she said it is as you suspect i am not worthy of you i do not like poetry ah you shudder you turn away your face grows hard and scornful  i dont yelled archibald it doesnt it doesnt do anything of the sort youve made me another man  she stared wildeyed astonished  what do you mean that you too  i should just say i do i tell you i hate the beastly stuff i only pretended to like it because i thought you did the hours ive spent learning it up i wonder ive not got brain fever  archie used you to read it up too oh if id only known  and you forgive methis morning i mean  of course you couldnt leave a golf tournament by the way how did you get on  archibald coughed  rather well he said modestly pretty decently in fact not badly as a matter of fact i won the championship  the championship whispered margaret of america  well not absolutely of america said archibald but all the same a championship  my hero  you wont be wanting me for a while i guess said stuyvesant nonchalantly think ill smoke a cigarette on the porch  and sobs from the stairs told that mrs milsom was already on her way to her room     the man the maid and the miasma   although this story is concerned principally with the man and the maid the miasma pervades it to such an extent that i feel justified in putting his name on the bills websters dictionary gives the meaning of the word miasma as an infection floating in the air a deadly exhalation and in the opinion of mr robert ferguson his late employer that description though perhaps a little too flattering on the whole summed up master roland bean pretty satisfactorily until the previous day he had served mr ferguson in the capacity of officeboy but there was that about master bean which made it practically impossible for anyone to employ him for long a syndicate of galahad parsifal and marcus aurelius might have done it but to an ordinary erring man conscious of things done which should not have been done and other things equally numerous left undone he was too oppressive one conscience is enough for any man the employer of master bean had to cringe before two nobody can last long against an officeboy whose eyes shine with quiet respectful reproof through goldrimmed spectacles whose manner is that of a middleaged saint and who obviously knows all the plod and punctuality books by heart and orders his life by their precepts master bean was a walking edition of steppingstones to success millionaires who have never smoked and young man get up early galahad parsifal and marcus aurelius as i say might have remained tranquil in his presence but robert ferguson found the contract too large after one month he had braced himself up and sacked the punctual plodder  yet now he was sitting in his office long after the last clerk had left long after the hour at which he himself was wont to leave his mind full of his late employee  was this remorse was he longing for the touch of the vanished hand the gleam of the departed spectacles he was not his mind was full of master bean because master bean was waiting for him in the outer office and he lingered on at his desk after the days work was done for the same reason word had been brought to him earlier in the evening that master roland bean would like to see him the answer to that was easy tell him im busy master beans admirably dignified reply was that he understood how great was the pressure of mr fergusons work and that he would wait till he was at liberty liberty talk of the liberty of the treed possum but do not use the word in connexion with a man bottled up in an office with roland bean guarding the only exit  mr ferguson kicked the wastepaper basket savagely the unfairness of the thing hurt him a sacked officeboy ought to stay sacked he had no business to come popping up again like banquos ghost it was not playing the game  the reader may wonder what was the troublewhy mr ferguson could not stalk out and brusquely dispose of his foe but then the reader has not employed master bean for a month mr ferguson had and his nerve had broken  a slight cough penetrated the door between the two offices mr ferguson rose and grabbed his hat perhaps a sudden rushhe shot out with the tense concentration of one moving towards the refreshmentroom at a station where the train stops three minutes  good evening sir was the watchers viewhallo  ah bean said mr ferguson flitting rapidly you still here i thought you had gone im afraid i cannot stop now some other time  he was almost through  i fear sir that you will be unable to get out said master bean sympathetically the building is locked up  men who have been hit by bullets say the first sensation is merely a sort of dull shock so it was with mr ferguson he stopped in his tracks and stared  the porter closes the door at seven oclock punctually sir it is now nearly twenty minutes after the hour  mr fergusons brain was still in the numbed stage  closes the door he said  yes sir  then how are we to get out  i fear we cannot get out sir  mr ferguson digested this  i am no longer in your employment sir said master bean respectfully but i hope that in the circumstances you will permit me to remain here during the night  during the night  it would enable me to sleep more comfortably than on the stairs  but we cant stop here all night said mr ferguson feebly  he had anticipated an unpleasant five minutes in master beans company imagination boggled at the thought of an unpleasant thirteen hours  he collapsed into a chair  i called said master bean shelving the trivial subject of the prospective vigil in the hope that i might persuade you sir to reconsider your decision in regard to my dismissal i can assure you sir that i am extremely anxious to give satisfaction if you would take me back and inform me how i have fallen short i would endeavour to improve i  we cant stop here all night interrupted mr ferguson bounding from his chair and beginning to pace the floor  without presumption sir i feel that if you were to give me another chance i should work to your satisfaction i should endeavour  mr ferguson stared at him in dumb horror he had a momentary vision of a sleepless night spent in listening to a nicelypolished speech for the defence he was seized with a mad desire for flight he could not leave the building but he must get away somewhere and think  he dashed from the room and raced up the dark stairs and as he arrived at the next floor his eye was caught by a thin pencil of light which proceeded from a door on the left  no shipwrecked mariner on a desert island could have welcomed the appearance of a sail with greater enthusiasm he bounded at the door he knew to whom the room belonged it was the office of one blaythwayt and blaythwayt was not only an acquaintance but a sportsman quite possibly there might be a pack of cards on blaythwayts person to help pass the long hours and if not at least he would be company and his office a refuge he flung open the door without going through the formality of knocking etiquette is not for the marooned  i say blaythwayt he began and stopped abruptly  the only occupant of the room was a girl  i beg your pardon he said i thought  he stopped again his eyes dazzled with the light had not seen clearly they did so now  you he cried  the girl looked at him first with surprise then with a cool hostility there was a long pause eighteen months had passed since they had parted and conversation does not flow easily after eighteen months of silence especially if the nature of the parting has been bitter and stormy  he was the first to speak  what are you doing here he said  i thought my doings had ceased to interest you she said i am mr blaythwayts secretary i have been here a fortnight i have wondered if we should meet i used to see you sometimes in the street  i never saw you  no she said indifferently  he ran his hand through his hair in a dazed way  do you know we are locked in he said  he had expected wild surprise and dismay she merely clicked her tongue in an annoyed manner  again she said what a nuisance i was locked in only a week ago  he looked at her with unwilling respect the respect of the novice for the veteran she was nothing to him now of course she had passed out of his life but he could not help remembering that long agoeighteen months agowhat he had admired most in her had been this same spirit this game refusal to be disturbed by fates blows it braced him up  he sat down and looked curiously at her  so you left the stage he said  i thought we agreed when we parted not to speak to one another said she coldly  did we i thought it was only to meet as strangers  its the same thing  is it i often talk to strangers  what a bore they must think you she said hiding oneeighth of a yawn with the tips of two fingers i suppose she went on with faint interest you talk to them in trains when they are trying to read their paper  i dont force my conversation on anyone  dont you she said raising her eyebrows in sweet surprise only your companyis that it  are you alluding to the present occasion  well you have an office of your own in this building i believe  i have  then why  i am at perfect liberty he said with dignity to sit in my friend blaythwayts office if i choose i wish to see mr blaythwayt  on business  he proved that she had established no corner in raised eyebrows  i fear he said that i cannot discuss my affairs with mr blaythwayts employees i must see him personally  mr blaythwayt is not here  i will wait  he will not be here for thirteen hours  ill wait  very well she burst out you have brought it on yourself youve only yourself to blame if you had been good and had gone back to your office i would have brought you down some cake and cocoa  cake and cocoa said he superciliously  yes cake and cocoa she snapped its all very well for you to turn up your nose at them now but wait youve thirteen hours of this in front of you i know what it is last time i had to spend the night here i couldnt get to sleep for hours and when i did i dreamed that i was chasing chocolate eclairs round and round trafalgar square and i never caught them either long before the night was finished i would have given anything for even a dry biscuit i made up my mind id always keep something here in case i ever got locked in againyes smile youd better while you can  he was smiling but wanly nobody but a professional fasting man could have looked unmoved into the inferno she had pictured then he rallied  cake he said scornfully  she nodded grimly  cocoa  again that nod ineffably sinister  im afraid i dont care for either he said  if you will excuse me she said indifferently i have a little work that i must finish  she turned to her desk leaving him to his thoughts they were not exhilarating he had maintained a brave front but inwardly he quailed reared in the country he had developed at an early age a fine healthy appetite once soon after his arrival in london he had allowed a dangerous fanatic to persuade him that the secret of health was to go without breakfast  his lunch that day had cost him eight shillings and only decent shame had kept the figure as low as that he knew perfectly well that long ere the dawn of day his whole soul would be crying out for cake squealing frantically for cocoa would it not be better tono a thousand times no death but not surrender his selfrespect was at stake looking back he saw that his entire relations with this girl had been a series of battles of will so far though he had certainly not won he had not been defeated he must not be defeated now  he crossed his legs and sang a gay air under his breath  if you wouldnt mind said the girl looking up  i beg your pardon  your groaning interrupts my work  i was not groaning i was singing  oh im sorry  not at all  eight bars rest  mr ferguson deprived of the solace of song filled in the time by gazing at the toilers backhair it set in motion a train of thoughtan express train bound for the land of yesterday it recalled days in the woods evenings on the lawn it recalled sunshinestorm plenty of storm minor tempests that burst from a clear sky apparently without cause and the great final tornado there had been cause enough for that why was it mused mr ferguson that every girl in every country town in every county of england who had ever recited curfew shall not ring tonight well enough to escape lynching at the hands of a rustic audience was seized with the desire to come to london and go on the stage  he sighed  please dont snort said a cold voice from behind the backhair  there was a trainwreck in the land of yesterday mr ferguson the only survivor limped back into the present  the present had little charm but at least it was better than the cakeless future he fixed his thoughts on it he wondered how master bean was passing the time probably doing deepbreathing exercises or reading a pocket aristotle the girl pushed back her chair and rose  she went to a small cupboard in the corner of the room and from it produced in instalments all that goes to make cake and cocoa she did not speak presently filling space there sprang into being an odour and as it reached him mr ferguson stiffened in his chair bracing himself as for a fight to the death it was more than an odour it was the soul of the cocoa singing to him his fingers gripped the arms of the chair this was the test  the girl separated a section of cake from the parent body she caught his eye  you had better go she said if you go now its just possible that i maybut i forgot you dont like cocoa  no said he resolutely i dont  she seemed now in the mood for conversation  i wonder why you came up here at all she said  theres no reason why you shouldnt know i came up here because my late officeboy is downstairs  why should that send you up  youve never met him or you wouldnt ask have you ever had to face someone who is simply incarnate saintliness and disapproval who  are you forgetting that i was engaged to you for several weeks  he was too startled to be hurt the idea of himself as a roland bean was too new to be assimilated immediately it called for meditation  was i like that he said at last almost humbly  you know you were oh im not thinking only about your views on the stage it was everything whatever i did you were there to disapprove like alike alike an aunt she concluded triumphantly you were too good for anything if only you would just once have done something wrong i think id havebut you couldnt youre simply perfect  a man will remain cool and composed under many charges hint that his tastes are criminal and he will shrug his shoulders but accuse him of goodness and you rouse the lion  mr fergusons brow darkened  as a matter of fact he said haughtily i was to have had supper with a chorusgirl this very night  how very appalling said she languidly  she sipped her cocoa  i suppose you consider that very terrible she said  for a beginner  she crumbled her cake suddenly she looked up  who is she she demanded fiercely  i beg your pardon he said coming out of a pleasant reverie  who is this girl  sheerher nameher name is mariemarie templeton  she seemed to think for a moment  that dear old lady she said i know her quite well  what  mother we used to call her have you met her son  her son  a rather nicelooking man he plays heavy parts on tour hes married and has two of the sweetest children their grandmother is devoted to them hasnt she ever mentioned them to you  she poured herself out another cup of cocoa conversation again languished  i suppose youre very fond of her she said at length  im devoted to her he paused dear little thing he added  she rose and moved to the door there was a nasty gleam in her eyes  you arent going he said  i shall be back in a moment im just going to bring your poor little officeboy up here he must be missing you  he sprang up but she had gone leaning over the banisters he heard a door open below then a short conversation and finally footsteps climbing the stairs  it was pitch dark on the landing he stepped aside and they passed without seeing him master bean was discoursing easily on cocoa the processes whereby it was manufactured and the remarkable distances which natives of mexico had covered with it as their only food the door opened flooding the landing with light and mr ferguson stepping from ambush began to descend the stairs  the girl came to the banisters  mr ferguson  he stopped  did you want me he asked  are you going back to your office  i am i hope you will enjoy beans society he has a fund of useful information on all subjects  he went on after a while she returned to the room and closed the door  mr ferguson went into his office and sat down                                       there was once a person of the name of simeon stylites who took up a position on top of a pillar and stayed there having no other engagements for thirty years mr ferguson who had read tennysons poem on the subject had until tonight looked upon this as a pretty good thing reading the lines                      thrice ten years   thrice multiplied by superhuman pangs   in hunger and in thirsts fevers and colds   in coughs aches stitches ulcerous throes and cramps    patient on this tall pillar i have borne   rain wind frost heat hail damp and sleet and snow  he had gathered roughly as it were that simeon had not been comfortable he had pitied him but now sitting in his officechair he began to wonder what the man had made such a fuss about he suspected him of having had a touch of the white feather in him it was not as if he had not had food he talked about hungers and thirsts but he must have had something to eat or he could not have stayed the course very likely if the truth were known there was somebody below who passed him up regular supplies of cake and cocoa  he began to look on simeon as an overrated amateur  sleep refused to come to him it got as far as his feet but no farther he rose and stamped to restore the circulation  it was at this point that he definitely condemned simeon stylites as a sybaritic fraud  if this were one of those realistic zolaesque stories i would describe the crick in the back thatbut let us hurry on  it was about six hours laterhe had no watch but the numbers of aches stitches not to mention cramps that he had experienced could not possibly have been condensed into a shorter periodthat his manly spirit snapped let us not judge him too harshly the girl upstairs had broken his heart ruined his life and practically compared him to roland bean and his pride should have built up an impassable wall between them butshe had cake and cocoa in similar circumstances king arthur would have grovelled before guinevere  he rushed to the door and tore it open there was a startled exclamation from the darkness outside  i hope i didnt disturb you said a meek voice  mr ferguson did not answer his twitching nostrils were drinking in a familiar aroma  were you asleep may i come in ive brought you some cake and cocoa  he took the rich gifts from her in silence there are moments in a mans life too sacred for words the wonder of the thing had struck him dumb an instant before and he had had but a desperate hope of winning these priceless things from her at the cost of all his dignity and selfrespect he had been prepared to secure them through a shower of biting taunts a blizzard of razorlike i told you sos yet here he was draining the cup and still able to hold his head up look the world in the face and call himself a man  his keen eye detected a crumb on his coatsleeve this retrieved and consumed he turned to her seeking explanation  she was changed the battlegleam had faded from her eyes she seemed scared and subdued her manner was of one craving comfort and protection that awful boy she breathed  bean said mr ferguson picking a crumb off the carpet  hes frightful  i thought you might get a little tired of him what has he been doing  talking i feel battered hes like one of those awful encyclopedias that give you a sort of dull leaden feeling in your head directly you open them do you know how many tons of water go over niagara falls every year  no  he does  i told you he had a fund of useful information the purpose and tenacity books insist on it thats how you catch your employers eye one morning the boss suddenly wants to know how many horsehair sofas there are in brixton the number of pins that would reach from london bridge to waterloo you tell him and he takes you into partnership later you become a millionaire but i havent thanked you for the cocoa it was fine  he waited for the retort but it did not come a pleased wonderment filled him could these things really be thus  and it isnt only what he says she went on i know what you mean about him now its his accusing manner  ive tried to analyse that manner i believe its the spectacles  its frightful when he looks at you you think of all the wrong things you have ever done or ever wanted to do  does he have that effect on you he said excitedly why that exactly describes what i feel  the affinities looked at one another  she was the first to speak  we always did think alike on most things didnt we she said  of course we did  he shifted his chair forward  it was all my fault he said i mean what happened  it wasnt it  yes it was i want to tell you something i dont know if it will make any difference now but i should like you to know it its this ive altered a good deal since i came to london for the better i think im a pretty poor sort of specimen still but at least i dont imagine i can measure life with a footrule i dont judge the world any longer by the standards of a country town london has knocked some of the corners off me i dont think you would find me the bean type any longer i dont disapprove of other people much now not as a habit i find i have enough to do keeping myself up to the mark  i want to tell you something too she said i expect its too late but never mind i want you to hear it ive altered too since i came to london i used to think the universe had been invented just to look on and wave its hat while i did great things london has put a large piece of cold ice against my head and the swelling has gone down im not the girl with ambitions any longer i just want to keep employed and not have too bad a time when the days work is over  he came across to where she sat  we said we would meet as strangers and we do we never have known each other dont you think we had better get acquainted he said  there was a respectful tap at the door  come in snapped mr ferguson well behind the goldrimmed spectacles of master bean there shone a softer look than usual a look rather complacent than disapproving  i must apologize sir for intruding upon you i am no longer in your employment but i do hope that in the circumstances you will forgive my entering your private office thinking over our situation just now an idea came to me by means of which i fancy we might be enabled to leave the building  what  it occurred to me sir that by telephoning to the nearest policestation  good heavens cried mr ferguson  two minutes later he replaced the receiver  its all right he said ive made them understand the trouble theyre bringing a ladder i wonder what the time is it must be about four in the morning  master bean produced a waterbury watch  the time sir is almost exactly half past ten  half past ten we must have been here longer than three hours your watch is wrong  no sir i am very careful to keep it exactly right i do not wish to run any risk of being unpunctual  half past ten cried mr ferguson why were in heaps of time to look in at the savoy for supper this is great ill phone them to keep a table  supper i thought  she stopped  whats that thought what  hadnt you an engagement for supper  he stared at her  whatever gave you that idea of course not  i thought you said you were taking miss templeton  miss tempoh his face cleared oh there isnt such a person i invented her i had to when you accused me of being like our friend the miasma legitimate selfdefence  i do not wish to interrupt you sir when you are busy said master bean but  come and see me tomorrow morning said mr ferguson                                       bob said the girl as the first threatening mutters from the orchestra heralded an imminent storm of melody when that boy comes tomorrow what are going to do  call up the police  no but you must do something we shouldnt have been here if it hadnt been for him  thats true he pondered ive got it ill get him a job with raikes and courtenay  why raikes and courtenay  because i have a pull with them but principally said mr ferguson with a devilish grin because they live in edinburgh which as you are doubtless aware is a long long way from london  he bent across the table  isnt this like old times he said do you remember the first time i ever ki  just then the orchestra broke out     the good angel   any man under thirty years of age who tells you he is not afraid of an english butler lies he may not show his fear outwardly he may be braveaggressive even perhaps to the extent of calling the great man here or hi but in his heart when he meets that cold blue introspective eye he quakes  the effect that keggs the butler at the keiths had on martin rossiter was to make him feel as if he had been caught laughing in a cathedral he fought against the feeling he asked himself who keggs was anyway and replied defiantly that keggs was a menialand an overfed menial but all the while he knew that logic was useless  when the keiths had invited him to their country home he had been delighted they were among his oldest friends he liked mr keith he liked mrs keith he loved elsa keith and had done so from boyhood  but things had gone wrong as he leaned out of his bedroom window at the end of the first week preparatory to dressing for dinner he was more than half inclined to make some excuse and get right out of the place next day the bland dignity of keggs had taken all the heart out of him  nor was it keggs alone who had driven his thoughts towards flight keggs was merely a passive evil like toothache or a rainy day what had begun actively to make the place impossible was a perfectly pestilential young man of the name of barstowe  the houseparty at the keiths had originally been from martins viewpoint almost ideal the rest of the men were of the speechless moustachetugging breed they had come to shoot and they shot when they were not shooting they congregated in the billiardroom and devoted their powerful intellects exclusively to snookerpool leaving martin free to talk undisturbed to elsa he had been doing this for five days with great contentment when aubrey barstowe arrived mrs keith had developed of late leanings towards culture in her town house a charge of smallshot fired in any direction on a thursday afternoon could not have failed to bring down a poet a novelist or a painter aubrey barstowe author of the souls eclipse and other poems was a constant member of the crowd a youth of insinuating manners he had appealed to mrs keith from the start and unfortunately the virus had extended to elsa many a pleasant sunshiny thursday afternoon had been poisoned for martin by the sight of aubrey and elsa together on a distant settee matching temperaments the rest is too painful it was a rout the poet did not shoot so that when martin returned of an evening his rival was about five hours of soultosoul talk up and only two to play and those two the afterdinner hours which had once been the hours for which martin had lived were pure torture  so engrossed was he with his thoughts that the first intimation he had that he was not alone in the room was a genteel cough behind him holding a small can was keggs  your ot water sir said the butler austerely but not unkindly  keggs was a manone must use that word though it seems grossly inadequateof medium height pigeontoed at the base bulgy halfway up and bald at the apex his manner was restrained and dignified his voice soft and grave  but it was his eye that quelled martin that cold blue dukeshavetreatedmeasanelderbrother eye  he fixed it upon him now as he added placing the can on the floor it is fredericks duty but tonight i hundertook it  martin had no answer he was dazed keggs had spoken with the proud humility of an emperor compelled by misfortune to shine shoes  might i have a word with you sir  yeess yes stammered martin wont you take ai mean yes certainly  it is perhaps a liberty began keggs he paused and raked martin with the eye that had rested on dining dukes  not at all said martin hurriedly  i should like went on keggs bowing to speak to you on a somewhat intimate subjectmiss elsa  martins eyes and mouth opened slowly  you are going the wrong way to work if you will allow me to say so sir  martins jaw dropped another inch  whaa  women sir proceeded keggs young ladiesare peculiar i have had if i may say so certain hopportunities of observing their ways miss elsa reminds me in some respects of lady angelica fendall whom i had the honour of knowing when i was butler to her father lord stockleigh her ladyship was hinclined to be romantic she was fond of poetry like miss elsa she would sit by the hour sir listening to young mr knox reading tennyson which was no part of his duties he being employed by his lordship to teach lord bertie latin and greek and what not you may have noticed sir that young ladies is often took by tennyson hespecially in the summertime mr barstowe was reading tennyson to miss elsa in the all when i passed through just now the princess if i am not mistaken  i dont know what the thing was groaned martin she seemed to be enjoying it  lady angelica was greatly addicted to the princess young mr knox was reading portions of that poem to her when his lordship come upon them most rashly his lordship made a public hexpose and packed mr knox off next day it was not my place to volunteer advice but i could have told him what would happen two days later her ladyship slips away to london early in the morning and theyre married at a registryoffice that is why i say that you are going the wrong way to work with miss elsa sir with certain types of igh spirited young lady hopposition is useless now when mr barstowe was reading to miss elsa on the occasion to which i ave alluded you were sitting by trying to engage her attention its not the way sir you should leave them alone together let her see so much of him and nobody else but him that she will grow tired of him fondness for poetry sir is very much like the whisky abit you cant cure a man what has got that by hopposition now if you will permit me to offer a word of advice sir i say let miss elsa ave all the poetry she wants  martin was conscious of one coherent feeling at the conclusion of this address and that was one of amazed gratitude a lesser man who had entered his room and begun to discuss his private affairs would have had reason to retire with some speed but that keggs should descend from his pedestal and interest himself in such lowly matters was a different thing altogether  im very much obliged he was stammering when the butler raised a deprecatory hand  my interest in the matter he said smoothly is not entirely haltruistic for some years back in fact since miss elsa came out we have had a matrimonial sweepstake in the servants hall at each houseparty the names of the gentlemen in the party are placed in a hat and drawn in due course should miss elsa become engaged to any member of the party the pool goes to the drawer of his name should no engagement occur the money remains in my charge until the following year when it is added to the new pool hitherto i have ad the misfortune to draw nothing but married gentlemen but on this occasion i have secured you sir and i may tell you sir he added with stately courtesy that in the opinion of the servants hall your chances are ighly fanciedvery ighly the pool has now reached considerable proportions and aving had certain losses on the turf very recent i am extremely anxious to win it so i thought if i might take the liberty sir i would place my knowledge of the sex at your disposal you will find it sound in every respect that is all thank you sir  martins feelings had undergone a complete revulsion in the last few minutes the butler had shed his wings and grown horns cloven feet and a forked tail his rage deprived him of words he could only gurgle  dont thank me sir said the butler indulgently i ask no thanks we are working together for a common hobject and any little elp i can provide is given freely  you old scoundrel shouted martin his wrath prevailing even against that blue eye you have the insolence to come to me and  he stopped the thought of these hounds these demons coolly gossiping and speculating below stairs about elsa making her the subject of little sporting flutters to relieve the monotony of country life choked him  i shall tell mr keith he said  the butler shook his bald head gravely  i shouldnt sir it is a ighly fantastic story and i dont think he would believe it  then illoh get out  keggs bowed deferentially  if you wish it sir he said i will withdraw if i may make the suggestion sir i think you should commence to dress dinner will be served in a few minutes thank you sir  he passed softly out of the room                                       it was more as a demonstration of defiance against keggs than because he really hoped that anything would come of it that martin approached elsa next morning after breakfast elsa was strolling on the terrace in front of the house with the bard but martin broke in on the conference with the dogged determination of a steamdrill  coming out with the guns today elsa he said  she raised her eyes there was an absent look in them  the guns she said oh no i hate watching men shoot  you used to like it  i used to like dolls she said impatiently  mr barstowe gave tongue he was a slim tall sickeningly beautiful young man with large dark eyes full of expression  we develop he said the years go by and we develop our souls expandtimidly at first like little halffledged birds stealing out from the  i dont know that im so set on shooting today myself said martin will you come round the links  i am going out in the motor with mr barstowe said elsa  the motor cried mr barstowe ah rossiter that is the very poetry of motion i never ride in a motorcar without those words of shakespeares ringing in my mind ill put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes  i shouldnt give way to that sort of thing if i were you said martin the police are pretty down on roadhogging in these parts  mr barstowe was speaking figuratively said elsa with disdain  was he grunted martin whose sorrows were tending to make him every day more like a sulky schoolboy im afraid i havent got a poetic soul  im afraid you havent said elsa  there was a brief silence a bird made itself heard in a neighbouring tree  the moan of doves in immemorial elms quoted mr barstowe softly  only it happens to be a crow in a beech said martin as the bird flew out  elsas chin tilted itself in scorn martin turned on his heel and walked away  its the wrong way sir its the wrong way said a voice i was hobserving you from a window sir its lady angelica over again hopposition is useless believe me sir  martin faced round flushed and wrathful the butler went on unmoved miss elsa is going for a ride in the car today sir  i know that  uncommonly tricky things these motorcars i was saying so to roberts the chauffeur just as soon as i eard miss elsa was going out with mr barstowe i said roberts these cars is tricky break down when youre twenty miles from hanywhere as soon as look at you roberts i said slipping him a sovereign ow awful it would be if the car should break down twenty miles from hanywhere today  martin stared  you bribed roberts to  sir i gave roberts the sovereign because i am sorry for him he is a poor man and has a wife and family to support  very well said martin sternly i shall go and warn miss keith  warn her sir  i shall tell her that you have bribed roberts to make the car break down so that  keggs shook his head  i fear she would hardly credit the statement sir she might even think that you was trying to keep her from going for your own pussonal ends  i believe you are the devil said martin  i ope you will come to look on me sir said keggs unctuously as your good hangel  martin shot abominably that day and coming home in the evening gloomy and savage went straight to his room and did not reappear till dinnertime elsa had been taken in by one of the moustachetuggers martin found himself seated on her other side it was so pleasant to be near her and to feel that the bard was away at the other end of the table that for the moment his spirits revived  well how did you like the ride he asked with a smile did you put that girdle round the world  she looked at himonce the next moment he had an uninterrupted view of her shoulder and heard the sound of her voice as she prattled gaily to the man on her other side  his heart gave a sudden bound he understood now the demon butler had had his wicked way good heavens she had thought he was taunting her he must explain at once he  hock or sherry sir  he looked up into keggs expressionless eyes the butler was wearing his onduty mask there was no sign of triumph in his face  oh sherry i mean hock no sherry neither  this was awful he must put this right  elsa he said  she was engrossed in her conversation with her neighbour  from down the table in a sudden lull in the talk came the voice of mr barstowe he seemed to be in the middle of a narrative  fortunately he was saying i had with me a volume of shelley and one of my own little efforts i had read miss keith the whole of the latter and much of the former before the chauffeur announced that it was once more possible  elsa said the wretched man i had no ideayou dont think  she turned to him  i beg your pardon she said very sweetly  i swear i didnt knowi mean id forgotteni mean  she wrinkled her forehead  im really afraid i dont understand  i mean about the car breaking down  the car oh yes yes it broke down we were delayed quite a little while mr barstowe read me some of his poems it was perfectly lovely i was quite sorry when roberts told us we could go on again but do you really mean to tell me mr lambert that you  and once more the world became all shoulder  when the men trailed into the presence of the ladies for that brief seance on which etiquette insisted before permitting the stampede to the billiardroom elsa was not to be seen  elsa said mrs keith in answer to martins question she has gone to bed the poor child has a headache i am afraid she had a tiring day  there was an early start for the guns next morning and as elsa did not appear at breakfast martin had to leave without seeing her his shooting was even worse than it had been on the previous day  it was not until late in the evening that the party returned to the house martin on the way to his room met mrs keith on the stairs she appeared somewhat agitated  oh martin she said im so glad youre back have you seen anything of elsa  elsa  wasnt she with the guns  with the guns said martin puzzled no  i have seen nothing of her all day im getting worried i cant think what can have happened to her are you sure she wasnt with the guns  absolutely certain didnt she come in to lunch  no tom she said as mr keith came up im so worried about elsa i havent seen her all day i thought she must be out with the guns  mr keith was a man who had built up a large fortune mainly by consistently refusing to allow anything to agitate him he carried this policy into private life  wasnt she in at lunch he asked placidly  i tell you i havent seen her all day she breakfasted in her room  late  yes she was tired poor girl  if she breakfasted late said mr keith she wouldnt need any lunch shes gone for a stroll somewhere  would you put back dinner do you think inquired mrs keith anxiously  i am not good at riddles said mr keith comfortably but i can answer that one i would not put back dinner i would not put back dinner for the king  elsa did not come back for dinner nor was hers the only vacant place mr barstowe had also vanished even mr keiths calm was momentarily ruffled by this discovery the poet was not a favourite of hisit was only reluctantly that he had consented to his being invited at all and the presumption being that when two members of a houseparty disappear simultaneously they are likely to be spending the time in each others society he was annoyed elsa was not the girl to make a fool of herself of course buthe was unwontedly silent at dinner  mrs keiths anxiety displayed itself differently she was frankly worried and mentioned it by the time the fish had been reached conversation at the table had fixed itself definitely on the one topic  it isnt the car this time at any rate said mr keith it hasnt been out today  i cant understand it said mrs keith for the twentieth time and that was the farthest point reached in the investigation of the mystery  by the time dinner was over a spirit of unrest was abroad the company sat about in uneasy groups snookerpool was if not forgotten at any rate shelved somebody suggested searchparties and one or two of the moustachetuggers wandered rather aimlessly out into the darkness  martin was standing in the porch with mr keith when keggs approached as his eyes lit on him martin was conscious of a sudden solidifying of the vague suspicion which had been forming in his mind and yet that suspicion seemed so wild how could keggs with the worst intentions have had anything to do with this he could not forcibly have abducted the missing pair and kept them under lock and key he could not have stunned them and left them in a ditch nevertheless looking at him standing there in his attitude of deferential dignity with the light from the open door shining on his bald head martin felt perfectly certain that he had in some mysterious fashion engineered the whole thing  might i have a word sir if you are at leisure  well keggs  miss elsa sir  yes  keggs voice took on a sympathetic softness  it was not my place sir to make any remark while in the diningroom but i could not elp but hoverhear the conversation i gathered from remarks that was passed that you was somewhat hat a loss to account for miss elsas nonappearance sir  mr keith laughed shortly  you gathered that eh  keggs bowed  i think sir that possibly i may be hable to throw light on the matter  what cried mr keith great scott man then why didnt you say so at the time where is she  it was not my place sir to henter into the conversation of the dinnertable said the butler with a touch of reproof if i might speak now sir  mr keith clutched at his forehead  heavens above do you want a signed permit to tell me where my daughter is get on man get on  i think it ighly possible sir that miss elsa and mr barstowe may be on the hisland in the lake sir about half a mile from the house was a picturesque strip of water some fifteen hundred yards in width and a little less in length in the centre of which stood a small and densely wooded island it was a favourite haunt of visitors at the house when there was nothing else to engage their attention but during the past week with shooting to fill up the days it had been neglected  on the island said mr keith what put that idea into your head  i appened to be rowing on the lake this morning sir i frequently row of a morning sir when there are no duties to detain me in the ouse i find the hexercise hadmirable for the ealth i walk briskly to the boatouse and  yes yes i dont want a schedule of your daily exercises cut out the athletic reminiscences and come to the point  as i was rowing on the lake this morning sir i appened to see a boat itched up to a tree on the hisland i think that possibly miss elsa and mr barstowe might ave taken a row out there mr barstowe would wish to see the hisland sir bein romantic  but you say you saw the boat there this morning  yes sir  well it doesnt take all day to explore a small island whats kept them all this while  it is possible sir that the rope might not have eld mr barstowe if i might say so sir is one of those himpetuous literary pussons and possibly he homitted to see that the knot was hadequately tied orhis eye grave and inscrutable rested for a moment on martinssome party might ave come along and huntied it apuppus  untied it on purpose said mr keith what on earth for  keggs shook his head deprecatingly as one who realizing his limitations declines to attempt to probe the hidden sources of human actions  i thought it right sir to let you know he said  right i should say so if elsa has been kept starving all day on that island by that longhairedhere come along martin  he dashed off excitedly into the night martin remained for a moment gazing fixedly at the butler  i ope sir said keggs cordially that my hinformation will prove of genuine hassistance  do you know what i should like to do to you said martin slowly  i think i ear mr keith calling you sir  i should like to take you by the scruff of your neck and  there sir didnt you ear im then quite distinct it was  martin gave up the struggle with a sense of blank futility what could you do with a man like this it was like quarrelling with westminster abbey  i should urry sir suggested keggs respectfully i think mr keith must have met with some haccident  his surmise proved correct when martin came up he found his host seated on the ground in evident pain  twisted my ankle in a hole he explained briefly give me an arm back to the house theres a good fellow and then run on down to the lake and see if what keggs said is true  martin did as he was requestedso far that is to say as the first half of the commission was concerned as regarded the second he took it upon himself to make certain changes having seen mr keith to his room he put the fittingout of the relief ship into the good hands of a group of his fellow guests whom he discovered in the porch elsas feelings towards her rescuer might be one of unmixed gratitude but it might on the other hand be one of resentment he did not wish her to connect him in her mind with the episode in any way whatsoever martin had once released a dog from a trap and the dog had bitten him he had been on an errand of mercy but the dog had connected him with his sufferings and acted accordingly it occurred to martin that elsas frame of mind would be uncommonly like that dogs  the rescueparty set off martin lit a cigarette and waited in the porch  it seemed a very long time before anything happened but at last as he was lighting his fifth cigarette there came from the darkness the sound of voices they drew nearer someone shouted  its all right weve found them  martin threw away his cigarette and went indoors                                       elsa keith sat up as her mother came into the room two nights and a day had passed since she had taken to her bed  how are you feeling today dear  has he gone mother  who  mr barstowe  yes dear he left this morning he said he had business with his publisher in london  then i can get up said elsa thankfully  i think youre a little hard on poor mr barstowe elsa it was just an accident you know it was not his fault that the boat slipped away  it was it was it was cried elsa thumping the pillow malignantly i believe he did it on purpose so that he could read me his horrid poetry without my having a chance to escape i believe thats the only way he can get people to listen to it  but you used to like it darling you said he had such a musical voice  musical voice the pillow became a shapeless heap mother it was like a nightmare if i had seen him again i should have had hysterics it was awful if he had been even the least bit upset himself i think i could have borne up but he enjoyed it he revelled in it he said it was like omar khayyam in the wilderness and shelleys epipsychidion whatever that is and he prattled on and on and read and read till my head began to split motherher voice sank to a whisperi hit him  elsa  i did she went on defiantly i hit him as hard as i could and heheshe broke off into a little gurgle of laughterhe tripped over a bush and fell right down and i wasnt a bit ashamed i didnt think it unladylike or anything i was just as proud as i could be and it stopped him talking  but elsa dear why  the sun had just gone down and it was a lovely sunset and the sky looked like a great beautiful slice of underdone beef and i said so to him and he said sniffily that he was afraid he didnt see the resemblance and i asked him if he wasnt starving and he said no because as a rule all that he needed was a little ripe fruit and that was when i hit him  elsa  oh i know it was awfully wrong but i just had to and now ill get up it looks lovely out  martin had not gone out with the guns that day mrs keith had assured him that there was nothing wrong with elsa that she was only tired but he was anxious and had remained at home where bulletins could reach him as he was returning from a stroll in the grounds he heard his name called and saw elsa lying in the hammock under the trees near the terrace  why martin why arent you out with the guns she said  i wanted to be on the spot so that i could hear how you were  how nice of you why dont you sit down  may i  elsa fluttered the pages of her magazine  you know youre a very restful person martin youre so big and outdoory how would you like to read to me for a while i feel so lazy  martin took the magazine  what shall i read heres a poem by  elsa shuddered  oh please no she cried i couldnt bear it ill tell you what i should lovethe advertisements theres one about sardines i started it and it seemed splendid its at the back somewhere  is this itlangley and fieldings sardines  thats it  martin began to read  langley and fieldings sardines when you want the daintiest most delicious sardines go to your grocer and say langley and fieldings please you will then be sure of having the finest norwegian smoked sardines packed in the purest olive oil  elsa was sitting with her eyes closed and a soft smile of pleasure curving her mouth  go on she said dreamily  nothing nicer resumed martin with an added touch of eloquence as the theme began to develop for breakfast lunch or supper probably your grocer stocks them ask him if he does not write to us price fivepence per tin the best sardines and the best oil  isnt it lovely she murmured  her hand as it swung touched his he held it she opened her eyes  dont stop reading she said i never heard anything so soothing  elsa  he bent towards her she smiled at him her eyes were dancing  elsa i  mr keith said a quiet voice desired me to say  martin started away he glared up furiously gazing down upon them stood keggs the butlers face was shining with a gentle benevolence  mr keith desired me to say that he would be glad if miss elsa would come and sit with him for a while  ill come at once said elsa stepping from the hammock  the butler bowed respectfully and turned away they stood watching him as he moved across the terrace  what a saintly old man keggs looks said elsa dont you think so he looks as if he had never even thought of doing anything he shouldnt i wonder if he ever has  i wonder said martin  he looks like a stout angel what were you saying martin when he came up     pots omoney   owen bentley was feeling embarrassed he looked at mr sheppherd and with difficulty restrained himself from standing on one leg and twiddling his fingers at one period of his career before the influence of his uncle henry had placed him in the london and suburban bank owen had been an actor on the strength of a batting average of thirtythree point nought seven for middlesex he had been engaged by the astute musicalcomedy impresario to whom the idea first occurred that if you have got to have young men to chant we are merry and gay trala for this is bohemia in the artists ball scene you might just as well have young men whose names are known to the public he had not been an actor long for loss of form had put him out of firstclass cricket and the impresario had given his place in the next piece to a googly bowler who had done well in the last varsity match but he had been one long enough to experience that sinking sensation which is known as stagefright and now as he began to explain to mr sheppherd that he wished for his consent to marry his daughter audrey he found himself suffering exactly the same symptoms  from the very start from the moment when he revealed the fact that his income salary and private means included amounted to less than two hundred pounds he had realized that this was going to be one of his failures it was the gruesome early victorianness of it all that took the heart out of him mr sheppherd had always reminded him of a heavy father out of a threevolume novel but compared with his demeanour as he listened now his attitude hitherto had been light and whimsical until this moment owen had not imagined that this sort of thing ever happened nowadays outside the comic papers by the end of the second minute he would not have been surprised to find himself sailing through the air urged by mr sheppherds boot his transit indicated by a dotted line and a few stars  mr sheppherds manner was inclined to bleakness  this is most unfortunate he said most unfortunate i have my daughters happiness to consider it is my duty as a father he paused you say you have no prospects i should have supposed that your uncle surely with his influence  my uncle shot his bolt when he got me into the bank that finished him as far as im concerned im not his only nephew you know there are about a hundred others all trailing him like bloodhounds  mr sheppherd coughed the small cough of disapproval he was feeling more than a little aggrieved  he had met owen for the first time at dinner at the house of his uncle henry a man of unquestioned substance whose habit it was to invite each of his eleven nephews to dinner once a year but mr sheppherd did not know this for all he knew owen was in the habit of hobnobbing with the great man every night he could not say exactly that it was sharp practice on owens part to accept his invitation to call and having called to continue calling long enough to make the present deplorable situation possible but he felt that it would have been in better taste for the young man to have effaced himself and behaved more like a bankclerk and less like an heir  i am exceedingly sorry for this mr bentley he said but you will understand that i cannotit is of course out of the question it would be best in the circumstances i think if you did not see my daughter again  shes waiting in the passage outside said owen simply  after today goodbye  owen left the room audrey was hovering in the neighbourhood of the door she came quickly up to him and his spirits rose as they always did at the sight of her  well she said  he shook his head  no good he said  audrey considered the problem for a moment and was rewarded with an idea  shall i go in and cry  it wouldnt be of any use  tell me what happened  he said i mustnt see you again  he didnt mean it  he thinks he did  audrey reflected  we shall simply have to keep writing then and we can talk on the telephone that isnt seeing each other has your bank a telephone  yes but  thats all right then ill ring you up every day  i wish i could make some money said owen thoughtfully but i seem to be one of those chaps who cant nothing i try comes off ive never drawn anything except a blank in a sweep i spent about two pounds on sixpenny postal orders when the limerick craze was on and didnt win a thing once when i was on tour i worked myself to a shadow dramatizing a novel nothing came of that either  what novel  a thing called white roses by a woman named edith butler  audrey looked up quickly  i suppose you knew her very well were you great friends  i didnt know her at all id never met her i just happened to buy the thing at a bookstall and thought it would make a good play i expect it was pretty bad rot anyhow she never took the trouble to send it back or even to acknowledge receipt  perhaps she never got it  i registered it  she was a cat said audrey decidedly im glad of it though if another woman had helped you make a lot of money i should have died of jealousy  routine is death to heroism for the first few days after his parting with mr sheppherd owen was in heroic mood full of vaguely dashing schemes regarding the world as his oyster and burning to get at it sword in hand but routine with its ledgers and its copyingink and its customers fell like a grey cloud athwart his horizon blotting out rainbow visions of sudden wealth dramatically won day by day the glow faded and hopelessness grew  if the glow did not entirely fade it was due to audrey who more than fulfilled her promise of ringing him up on the telephone she rang him up at least once frequently several times every day a fact which was noted and commented upon in a harshly critical spirit by the head of his department a man with no soul and a strong objection to doing his subordinates work for them  as a rule her conversation though pleasing was discursive and lacked central motive but one morning she had genuine news to impart  owenher voice was excitedhave you seen the paper today then listen ill read it out are you listening this is what it says the piccadilly theatre will reopen shortly with a dramatized version of miss edith butlers popular novel white roses prepared by the authoress herself a strong cast is being engaged including and then a lot of names what are you going to do about it owen  what am i going to do  dont you see whats happened that awful woman has stolen your play she has waited all these years hoping you would forget what are you laughing at  i wasnt laughing  yes you were it tickled my ear ill ring off if you do it again you dont believe me well you wait and see if im not  edith butlers incapable of such a thing  there was a slight pause at the other end of the wire  i thought you said you didnt know her said audrey jealously  i donti dont said owen hastily but ive read her books theyre simply chunks of superfatted sentiment shes a sort of literary onion she compels tears a woman like that couldnt steal a play if she tried  you cant judge authors from their books you must go and see the play when it comes on then youll see im right im absolutely certain that woman is trying to swindle you dont laugh in that horrid way very well i told you i should ring off and now im going to  at the beginning of the next month owens annual holiday arrived the authorities of the london and suburban bank were no niggards they recognized that a man is not a machine they gave their employees ten days in the year in which to tone up their systems for another twelve months work  owen spent his boyhood in the shropshire village of which his father had been rector and thither he went when his holiday came round to the farm of one dorman he was glad of the chance to get to shropshire there is something about the country there with its green fields and miniature rivers that soothes the wounded spirit and forms a pleasant background for sentimental musings  it was comfortable at the farm the household consisted of mr dorman an old acquaintance his tenyearold son george and mr dormans mother an aged lady with a considerable local reputation as a wise woman rumour had it that the future held no mysteries for her and it was known that she could cure warts bruised fingers and even the botts by means of spells  except for these owen had fancied that he was alone in the house it seemed not however there was a primeval piano in his sittingroom and on the second morning it suited his mood to sit down at this and sing asthore the fruity pathos of which ballad appealed to him strongly at this time accompanying himself by an ingenious arrangement in three chords he had hardly begun however when mr dorman appeared somewhat agitated  if you dont mind mr owen he said i forgot to tell you theres a litery gent boarding with me in the room above and he cant bear to be disturbed  a muffled stamping from the ceiling bore out his words  writing a book he is continued mr dorman he caught young george a clip over the earole yesterday for blowing his trumpet on the stairs gave him sixpence afterwards and said hed skin him if he ever did it again so if you dont mind  oh all right said owen who is he  gentleman of the name of prosser  owen could not recollect having come across any work by anyone of that name but he was not a wide reader and whether the man above was a celebrity or not he was entitled to quiet  i never heard of him he said but thats no reason why i should disturb him let him rip ill cut out the musical effects in future  the days passed smoothly by the literary man remained invisible though occasionally audible tramping the floor in the frenzy of composition nor until the last day of his visit did owen see old mrs dorman  that she was not unaware of his presence in the house however was indicated on the last morning he was smoking an afterbreakfast pipe at the open window and waiting for the dogcart that was to take him to the station when george the son of the house entered  george stood in the doorway grinned and said  farsezjerligranmatellyerforchbythecards  eh said owen  the youth repeated the word  once again  on the second repetition light began to creep in a boyhood spent in the place added to this ten days stay had made owen something of a linguist  father says would i like grandma to do what  tell yer forchn by ther cards  where is she  backyarnder  owen followed him into the kitchen where he found mr dorman the farmer and seated at the table fumbling with a pack of cards an old woman whom he remembered well  mother wants to tell your fortune said mr dorman in a hoarse aside she always will tell visitors fortunes she told mr prossers and he didnt half like it because she said hed be engaged in two months and married inside the year he said wild horses wouldnt make him do it  she can tell me that if she likes i shant object  mother heres mr owen  i seed him fast enough said the old woman briskly shuffle an cut three times  she then performed mysterious manoeuvres with the cards  i see pots o money announced the sibyl  if she says it its there right enough said her son  she means my bonus said owen but thats only ten pounds and i lose it if im late twice more before christmas  itll come sure enough  pots said the old woman and she was still mumbling the encouraging word when owen left the kitchen and returned to the sittingroom  he laughed rather ruefully at that moment he could have found a use for pots o money  he walked to the window and looked out it was a glorious morning the heatmist was dancing over the meadow beyond the brook and from the farmyard came the liquid charawks of carefree fowls it seemed wicked to leave these haunts of peace for london on such a day  an acute melancholy seized him absently he sat down at the piano the prejudices of literary mr prosser had slipped from his mind softly at first then gathering volume as the spirit of the song gripped him he began to sing asthore he became absorbed  he had just for the sixth time won through to iyamah waiting forer theeeeyassthorre and was doing some intricate threechord work preparatory to starting over again when a loaf of bread whizzed past his ear it missed him by an inch and crashed against a plaster statuette of the infant samuel on the top of the piano  it was a standard loaf containing eighty per cent of semolina and it practically wiped the infant samuel out of existence at the same moment at his back there sounded a loud wrathful snort  he spun round the door was open and at the other side of the table was standing a large blackbearded shirtsleeved man in an attitude rather reminiscent of ajax defying the lightning his hands trembled his beard bristled his eyes gleamed ferociously beneath enormous eyebrows as owen turned he gave tongue in a voice like the discharge of a broadside  stop it  owens mind wrenched too suddenly from the dreamy future to the vivid present was not yet completely under control he gaped  stopthatinfernalnoise roared the man  he shot through the door banging it after him and pounded up the stairs  owen was annoyed the artistic temperament was all very well but there were limits it was absurd that obscure authors should behave in this way prosser who on earth was prosser had anyone ever heard of him no yet here he was going about the country clipping small boys over the earhole and flinging loaves of bread at bankclerks as if he were henry james or marie corelli owen reproached himself bitterly for his momentary loss of presence of mind if he had only kept his head he could have taken a flying shot at the man with the marmaladepot it had been within easy reach instead of which he had merely stood and gaped of all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these it might have been  his manly regret was interrupted by the entrance of mr dorman with the information that the dogcart was at the door                                       audrey was out of town when owen arrived in london but she returned a week later the sound of her voice through the telephone did much to cure the restlessness from which he had been suffering since the conclusion of his holiday but the thought that she was so near yet so inaccessible produced in him a meditative melancholy which enveloped him like a cloud that would not lift his manner became distrait he lost weight  if customers were not vaguely pained by his sad pale face it was only because the fierce rush of modern commercial life leaves your business man little leisure for observing pallor in bankclerks what did pain them was the gentle dreaminess with which he performed his duties he was in the inward bills department one of the features of which was the sudden inrush towards the end of each afternoon of hatless energetic young men with leather bags strapped to their left arms clamouring for mysterious crackling documents much fastened with pins owen had never quite understood what it was that these young men did want and now his detached mind refused even more emphatically to grapple with the problem he distributed the documents at random with the air of a preoccupied monarch scattering largess to the mob and the subsequent chaos had to be handled by a wrathful head of the department in person  mans power of endurance is limited at the end of the second week the overwrought head appealed passionately for relief and owen was removed to the postage department where when he had leisure from answering audreys telephone calls he entered the addresses of letters in a large book and took them to the post he was supposed also to stamp them but a man in love cannot think of everything and he was apt at times to overlook this formality  one morning receiving from one of the bank messengers the usual intimation that a lady wished to speak to him on the telephone he went to the box and took up the receiver  is that you owen owen i went to white roses last night have you been yet  not yet  then you must go tonight owen im certain you wrote it its perfectly lovely i cried my eyes out if you dont go tonight ill never speak to you again even on the telephone promise  must i  yes you must why suppose it is yours it may mean a fortune the stalls were simply packed im going to ring up the theatre now and engage a seat for you and pay for it myself  noi say protested owen  yes i shall i cant trust you to go if i dont and ill ring up early tomorrow to hear all about it goodbye  owen left the box somewhat depressed life was quite gloomy enough as it was without going out of ones way to cry ones eyes out over sentimental plays  his depression was increased by the receipt on his return to his department of a message from the manager stating that he would like to see mr bentley in his private room for a moment owen never enjoyed these little chats with authority out of office hours in the circle of his friends he had no doubt the manager was a delightful and entertaining companion but in his private room his conversation was less enjoyable  the manager was seated at his table thoughtfully regarding the ceiling his resemblance to a stuffed trout always striking was subtly accentuated and owen an expert in these matters felt that his fears had been well foundedthere was trouble in the air somebody had been complaining of him and he was now about as the phrase went to be runin  a large man seated with his back to the door turned as he entered and owen recognized the wellremembered features of mr prosser the literary loafslinger  owen regarded him without resentment since returning to london he had taken the trouble of looking up his name in whos who and had found that he was not so undistinguished as he had supposed he was it appeared a regius professor and the author of some halfdozen works on sociologya record owen felt that almost justified loafslinging and earhole clipping in moments of irritation  the manager started to speak but the man of letters anticipated him  is this the fool he roared young man i have no wish to be hard on a congenital idiot who is not responsible for his actions but i must insist on an explanation i understand that you are in charge of the correspondence in this office well during the last week you have three times sent unstamped letters to my fiancee miss vera delane woodlands southbourne hants whats the matter with you do you think she likes paying twopence a time or what is it  owens mind leaped back at the words they recalled something to him then he remembered  he was conscious of a not unpleasant thrill he had not known that he was superstitious but for some reason he had not been able to get those absurd words of mr dormans mother out of his mind and here was another prediction of hers equally improbable fulfilled to the letter  great scott he cried are you going to be married  mr prosser and the manager started simultaneously  mrs dorman said you would be said owen dont you remember  mr prosser looked keenly at him  why ive seen you before he said youre the young turnipheaded scallywag at the farm  thats right said owen  ive been wanting to meet you again i thought the whole thing over and it struck me said mr prosser handsomely that i may have seemed a little abrupt at our last meeting  no no  the fact is i was in the middle of an infernally difficult passage of my book that morning and when you began  it was my fault entirely i quite understand  mr prosser produced a cardcase  we must see more of each other he said come and have a bit of dinner some night come tonight  im very sorry i have to go to the theatre tonight  then come and have a bit of supper afterwards excellent meet me at the savoy at elevenfifteen im glad i didnt hit you with that loaf abruptness has been my failing through life my father was just the same elevenfifteen at the savoy then  the manager who had been listening with some restlessness to the conversation now intervened he was a man with a sense of fitness of things and he objected to having his private room made the scene of what appeared to be a reunion of old college chums he hinted as much  ha prrumph he observed disapprovingly ermr bentley that is all you may return to your workahmmm kindly be more careful another time in stamping the letters  yes by jove said mr prosser suddenly reminded of his wrongs thats right exercise a little ordinary care you ivoryskulled young son of a gun do you think miss delane is made of twopences keep an eye on him he urged the manager these young fellows nowadays want someone standing over them with a knout all the time be more careful another time young man elevenfifteen remember make a note of it or youll go forgetting that                                       the seat audrey had bought for him at the piccadilly theatre proved to be in the centre of the sixth row of stallspractically a deathtrap whatever his sufferings might be escape was impossible he was securely wedged in  the cheaper parts of the house were sparsely occupied but the stalls were full owen disapproving of the whole business refused to buy a programme and settled himself in his seat prepared for the worst he had a vivid recollection of white roses the novel and he did not anticipate any keen enjoyment from it in its dramatized form he had long ceased to be a member of that large public for which miss edith butler catered the sentimental adventures of governesses in ducal housesthe heroine of white roses was a governessno longer contented his soul  there is always a curiously dreamlike atmosphere about a play founded on a book one seems to have seen it all before during the whole of the first act owen attributed to this his feeling of familiarity with what was going on on the stage at the beginning of the second act he found himself anticipating events but it was not till the third act that the truth sank in  the third was the only act in which in his dramatization he had taken any real liberties with the text of the novel but in this act he had introduced a character who did not appear in the novela creature of his own imagination and now with bulging eyes he observed this creature emerge from the wings and heard him utter lines which he now clearly remembered having written  audrey had been right serpent edith butler had stolen his play  his mind during the remainder of the play was active by the time the final curtain fell and he passed out into the open air he had perceived some of the difficulties of the case to prove oneself the author of an original play is hard but not impossible friends to whom one had sketched the plot may come forward as witnesses one may have preserved rough notes but a dramatization of a novel is another matter all dramatizations of any given novel must necessarily be very much alike  he started to walk along piccadilly and had reached hyde park corner before he recollected that he had an engagement to take supper with mr prosser at the savoy hotel he hailed a cab  youre late boomed the author of sociological treatises as he appeared youre infernally late i suppose in your woollenheaded way you forgot all about it come along well just have time for an olive and a glass of something before they turn the lights out  owen was still thinking deeply as he began his supper surely there was some way by which he could prove his claims what had he done with the original manuscript he remembered now he had burnt it it had seemed mere useless litter then probably he felt bitterly the woman butler had counted on this  mr prosser concluded an animated conversation with a waiter on the subject of the wines of france leaned forward and having helped himself briskly to anchovies began to talk he talked loudly and rapidly owen his thoughts far away hardly listened  presently the waiter returned with the selected brand he filled owens glass and owen drank and felt better finding his glass magically full once more he emptied it again and then suddenly he found himself looking across the table at his host and feeling a sense of absolute conviction that this was the one man of all others whom he would have selected as a confidant how kindly though somewhat misty his face was how soothing if a little indistinct his voice  prosser he said you are a man of the world and i should like your advice what would you do in a case like this i go to a theatre to see a play and what do i find  he paused and eyed his host impressively  whats that tune theyre playing said mr prosser you hear it everywhere one of these viennese things i suppose  owen was annoyed he began to doubt whether after all mr prossers virtues as a confidant were not more apparent than real  i find by jove he continued that i wrote the thing myself  its not a patch on the merry widow said mr prosser  owen thumped the table  i tell you i find i wrote the thing myself  what thing  this play im telling you about this white roses thing  he found that he had at last got his hosts ear mr prosser seemed genuinely interested  what do you mean  owen plunged on with his story he started from its dim beginning from the days when he had bought the novel on his journey from bath to cheltenham he described his methods of work his registering of the package his suspense his growing resignation he sketched the progress of his life he spoke of audrey and gave a crisp charactersketch of mr sheppherd he took his hearer right up to the moment when the truth had come home to him  towards the end of his narrative the lights went out and he finished his story in the hotel courtyard in the cool air he felt revived the outlines of mr prosser became sharp and distinct again  the sociologist listened admirably he appeared absorbed and did not interrupt once  what makes you so certain that this was your version he asked as they passed into the strand  owen told him of the creature of his imagination in act iii  but you have lost your manuscript  yes i burnt it  just what one might have expected you to do said mr prosser unkindly young man i begin to believe that there may be something in this you havent got a ghost of a proof that would hold water in a court of law of course but still im inclined to believe you for one thing you havent the intelligence to invent such a story  owen thanked him  in fact if you can answer me one question i shall be satisfied  it seemed to owen that mr prosser was tending to get a little above himself as an intelligent listener he had been of service but that appeared to be no reason why he should constitute himself a sort of judge and master of the ceremonies  thats very good of you he said but will edith butler be satisfied thats more to the point  i am edith butler said mr prosser  owen stopped you  you need not babble it from the housetops you are the only person besides my agent who knows it and i wouldnt have told you if i could have helped it it isnt a thing i want known great scott man dont goggle at me like a fish havent you heard of pseudonyms before  yes but  well never mind take it from me that i am edith butler now listen to me that manuscript reached me when i was in the country there was no name on it that in itself points strongly to the fact that you were its author it was precisely the chuckleheaded sort of thing you would have done to put no name on the thing  i enclosed a letter anyhow  there was a letter enclosed i opened the parcel out of doors there was a fresh breeze blowing at the time it caught the letter and that was the last i saw of it i had read as far as dear madam but one thing i do remember about it and that was that it was sent from some hotel in cheltenham and i could remember it if i heard it now then  i can tell it you it was wilbrahams i was stopping there  you pass said mr prosser it was wilbrahams  owens heart gave a jump for a moment he walked on air  then do you mean to say that its all rightthat you believe  i do said mr prosser by the way he said the notice of white roses went up last night  owens heart turned to lead  butbut he stammered but tonight the house was packed  it was packed with paper all the merry deadheads in london were there it has been the worst failure this season and by george he cried with sudden vehemence serve em right if i told them once it would fail in england i told them a hundred times the london public wont stand that sort of blithering twaddle  owen stopped and looked round a cab was standing across the road he signalled to it he felt incapable of walking home no physical blow could have unmanned him more completely than this hideous disappointment just when by a miracle everything seemed to be running his way  sooner ride than walk said mr prosser pushing his head through the open window lazinessslacknessthats the curse of the modern young man where shall i tell him to drive to  owen mentioned his address it struck him that he had not thanked his host for his hospitality  it was awfully good of you to give me supper mr prosser he said ive enjoyed it tremendously  come again said mr prosser im afraid youre disappointed about the play  owen forced a smile  oh no thats all right he said it cant be helped  mr prosser half turned then thrust his head through the window again  i knew there was something i had forgotten to say he said i ought to have told you that the play was produced in america before it came to london it ran two seasons in new york and one in chicago and there are three companies playing it still on the road heres my card come round and see me tomorrow i cant tell you the actual figures offhand but youll be all right youll have pots o money     out of school   mark you i am not defending james datchett i hold no brief for james on the contrary i am very decidedly of the opinion that he should not have done it i merely say that there were extenuating circumstances just that ext circ nothing more  let us review the matter calmly and judicially not condemning james offhand but rather probing the whole affair to its core to see if we can confirm my view that it is possible to find excuses for him  we will begin at the time when the subject of the colonies first showed a tendency to creep menacingly into the daily chitchat of his uncle frederick  jamess uncle frederick was always talking more or less about the colonies having made a substantial fortune out in western australia but it was only when james came down from oxford that the thing became really menacing up to that time the uncle had merely spoken of the colonies as colonies now he began to speak of them with sinister reference to his nephew he starred james it became a case of frederick knott presents james datchett in the colonies and there seemed every prospect that the production would be an early one for if there was one section of the public which mr knott disliked more than another it was young men who ought to be out earning their livings instead of idling at home he expressed his views on the subject with some eloquence whenever he visited his sisters house mrs datchett was a widow and since her husbands death had been in the habit of accepting every utterance of her brother frederick as a piece of genuine allwool wisdom though as a matter of fact jamess uncle had just about enough brain to make a jaybird fly crooked and no more he had made his money through keeping sheep and any fool can keep sheep however he had this reputation for wisdom and what he said went it was not long therefore before it was evident that the ranks of the ymwotboetli oiah were about to lose a member  james for his part was all against the colonies as a setting for his career that is to say he was no little englander he had no earthly objection to great britain having colonies by all means have colonies they could rely on him for moral support but when it came to legging it out to west australia to act as a sort of valet to uncle fredericks beastly sheepno not for james for him the literary life yes that was jamess dreamto have a stab at the literary life at oxford he had contributed to the isis and since coming down had been endeavouring to do the same to the papers of the metropolis he had had no success so far but some inward voice seemed to tell himread on read on this is no story about the young beginners struggles in london we do not get within fifty miles of fleet street  a temporary compromise was effected between the two parties by the securing for james of a post as assistantmaster at harrow house the private school of one blatherwick ma the understanding being that if he could hold the job he could remain in england and write if it pleased him in his spare time but if he fell short in any way as a handler of small boys he was to descend a step in the animal kingdom and be matched against the west australian sheep there was to be no second chance in the event of failure from the way uncle frederick talked james almost got the idea that he attached a spiritual importance to a connexion with sheep he seemed to strive with a sort of religious frenzy to convert james to west australia so james went to harrow house with much the same emotions that the old guard must have felt on their way up the hill at waterloo  harrow house was a grim mansion on the outskirts of dover it is better of course to be on the outskirts of dover than actually in it but when you have said that you have said everything jamess impressions of that portion of his life were made up almost entirely of chalk chalk in the schoolroom chalk all over the countryside chalk in the milk in this universe of chalk he taught bored boys the rudiments of latin geography and arithmetic and in the evenings after a stately cup of coffee with mr blatherwick in his study went to his room and wrote stories the life had the advantage of offering few distractions except for mr blatherwick and a weird freak who came up from dover on tuesdays and fridays to teach french he saw nobody  it was about five weeks from the beginning of term that the river of life at harrow house became ruffled for the new assistantmaster  i want you to follow me very closely here as far as the excusing of jamess conduct is concerned it is now or never if i fail at this point to touch you i have shot my bolt  let us marshal the facts  in the first place it was a perfectly ripping morning  moreover he had received at breakfast a letter from the editor of a monthly magazine accepting a short story  this had never happened to him before  he was twentytwo  and just as he rounded the angle of the house he came upon violet taking the air like himself  violet was one of the housemaids a trim energetic little person with round blue eyes and a friendly smile she smiled at james now james halted  good morning sir said violet  from my list of contributory causes i find that i have omitted one itemviz that there did not appear to be anybody else about  james looked meditatively at violet violet looked smilingly at james the morning was just as ripping as it had been a moment before james was still twentytwo and the editors letter had not ceased to crackle in his breastpocket  consequently james stooped andin a purely brotherly waykissed violet  this of course was wrong it was no part of jamess duties as assistantmaster at harrow house to wander about bestowing brotherly kisses on housemaids on the other hand there was no great harm done in the circles in which violet moved the kiss was equivalent to the handshake of loftier society everybody who came to the back door kissed violet the carrier did so did the grocer the baker the butcher the gardener the postman the policeman and the fishmonger they were men of widely differing views on most points on religion politics and the prospects of the entrants for the three oclock race their opinions clashed but in one respect they were unanimous whenever they came to the back door of harrow house they all kissed violet  ive had a story accepted by the universal magazine said james casually  have you sir said violet  its a pretty good magazine i shall probably do a great deal for it from time to time the editor seems a decent chap  does he sir  i shant tie myself up in any way of course unless i get very good terms but i shall certainly let him see a good lot of my stuff jolly morning isnt it  he strolled on and violet having sniffed the air for a few more minutes with her tiptilted nose went indoors to attend to her work  five minutes later james back in the atmosphere of chalk was writing on the blackboard certain sentences for his class to turn into latin prose a somewhat topical note ran through them as thus  the uncle of balbus wished him to tend sheep in the colonies provincia  balbus said that england was good enough for him placeo  balbus sent a story versus to maecenas who replied that he hoped to use it in due course  his mind floated away from the classroom when a shrill voice brought him back  sir please sir what does due course mean  james reflected alter it to immediately he said  balbus is a great man he wrote on the blackboard  two minutes later he was in the office of an important magazine and there was a look of relief on the editors face for james had practically promised to do a series of twelve short stories for him                                       it has been well observed that when a writer has a story rejected he should send that story to another editor but that when he has one accepted he should send another story to that editor acting on this excellent plan james being off duty for an hour after tea smoked a pipe in his bedroom and settled down to work on a second effort for the universal  he was getting on rather well when his flow of ideas was broken by a knock on the door  come in yelled james your author is notoriously irritable  the newcomer was adolf adolf was one of that numerous band of swiss and german youths who come to this country prepared to give their services ridiculously cheap in exchange for the opportunity of learning the english language mr blatherwick held the view that for a private school a male frontdoor opener was superior to a female arguing that the parents of prospective pupils would be impressed by the sight of a man in livery he would have liked something a bit more imposing than adolf but the latter was the showiest thing that could be got for the money so he made the best of it and engaged him after all an astigmatic parent seeing adolf in a dim light might be impressed by him you never could tell  well said james glaring  anysing vrom dze fillage sare  the bulk of adolfs perquisites consisted of the tips he received for going to the general store down the road for tobacco stamps and so on no get out growled james turning to his work  he was surprised to find that adolf so far from getting out came in and shut the door  zst said adolf with a finger on his lips  james stared  in dze garten zis morning proceeded his visitor grinning like a gargoyle i did zee you giss violed zo  jamess heart missed a beat considered purely as a situation his present position was not ideal he had to work hard and there was not much money attached to the job but it was what the situation stood for that counted it was his little rock of safety in the midst of a surging ocean of west australian sheep once let him lose his grip on it and there was no chance for him he would be swept away beyond hope of return  what do you mean he said hoarsely  in dze garten i you vrom a window did zee you und violed zo and adolf in the worst taste gave a realistic imitation of the scene himself sustaining the role of james  james said nothing the whole world seemed to be filled with a vast baaing as of countless flocks  lizzun said adolf berhaps i herr blazzervig dell berhaps not i do zo  james roused himself at all costs he must placate this worm mr blatherwick was an austere man he would not overlook such a crime  he appealed to the others chivalry  what about violet he said surely you dont want to lose the poor girl her job theyd be bound to sack her too  adolfs eyes gleamed  zo lizzun when i do gom virst here i myself do to giss violed vunce vish but she do push dze zide of my face and my lof is durned to hate  james listened attentively to this tabloid tragedy but made no comment  anysing vrom dze fillage sare  adolfs voice was meaning james produced a halfcrown  here you are then get me half a dozen stamps and keep the change  zdamps yes sare at vunce  jamess last impression of the departing one was of a vast and greasy grin stretching most of the way across his face                                       adolf as blackmailer in which role he now showed himself differed in some respects from the conventional blackmailer of fiction it may be that he was doubtful as to how much james would stand or it may be that his soul as a general rule was above money at any rate in actual specie he took very little from his victim he seemed to wish to be sent to the village oftener than before but that was all half a crown a week would have covered jamess financial loss  but he asserted himself in another way in his most lighthearted moments adolf never forgot the reason which had brought him to england he had come to the country to learn the language and he meant to do it the difficulty which had always handicapped him hithertonamely the poverty of the vocabularies of those in the servants quarterswas now removed he appointed james tutorinchief of the english language to himself and saw that he entered upon his duties at once  the first time that he accosted james in the passage outside the classroom and desired him to explain certain difficult words in a leading article of yesterdays paper james was pleased adolf he thought regarded the painful episode as closed he had accepted the halfcrown as the full price of silence and was now endeavouring to be friendly in order to make amends  this rightminded conduct gratified james he felt genially disposed toward adolf he read the leading article and proceeded to give a full and kindly explanation of the hard words he took trouble over it he went into the derivations of the words he touched on certain rather tricky submeanings of the same adolf went away with any doubts he might have had of jamess capabilities as a teacher of english definitely scattered he felt that he had got hold of the right man  there was a shade less geniality in jamess manner when the same thing happened on the following morning but he did not refuse to help the untutored foreigner the lecture was less exhaustive than that of the previous morning but we must suppose that it satisfied adolf for he came again next day his faith in his teacher undiminished  james was trying to write a story he turned on the student  get out he howled and take that beastly paper away cant you see im busy do you think i can spend all my time teaching you to read get out  dere some hard vord vos said adolf patiently of which i gannot dze meaning  james briefly cursed the hard word  but proceeded adolf of one vord of dze vord giss i dze meaning know zo  james looked at him there was a pause  two minutes later the english lesson was in full swing                                       all that james had ever heard or read about the wonderful devotion to study of the modern german young man came home to him during the next two weeks our english youth fritters away its time in idleness and pleasureseeking the german concentrates adolf concentrated like a porous plaster every day after breakfast just when the success of jamess literary career depended on absolute seclusion he would come trotting up for his lesson jamess writing practically ceased  this sort of thing cannot last there is a limit and adolf reached it when he attempted to add nightclasses to the existing curriculum  james as had been said was in the habit of taking coffee with mr blatherwick in his study after seeing the boys into bed it was while he was on his way to keep this appointment a fortnight after his first interview with adolf that the young student waylaid him with the evening paper  something should have warned adolf that the moment was not well chosen to begin with james had a headache the result of a hard day with the boys then that mornings english lesson had caused him to forget entirely an idea which had promised to be the nucleus of an excellent plot and lastly passing through the hall but an instant before he had met violet carrying the coffee and the evening post to the study and she had given him two long envelopes addressed in his own handwriting he was brooding over these preparatory to opening them at the very moment when adolf addressed him  eggscuse said adolf opening the paper  jamess eyes gleamed ominously  zere are here continued adolf unseeing some beyondgombarison hard vords vich i do nod onderstand for eggsample  it was at this point that james kicked him  adolf leaped like a stricken chamois  vot iss he cried  with these long envelopes in his hand james cared for nothing he kicked adolf again  zo said the student having bounded away he added a few words in his native tongue and proceeded vait lizzun i zay to you vait brezendly ven i haf dze zilver bolished und my odder dudies zo numerous berformed i do herr blazzervig vil vith von liddle szdory vich you do know go zo  he shot off to his lair  james turned away and went down the passage to restore his nervous tissues with coffee  meanwhile in the study leaning against the mantelpiece in moody reflection mr blatherwick was musing sadly on the hardships of the schoolmasters life the proprietor of harrow house was a long grave man one of the last to hold out against the antiwhisker crusade he had expressionless hazel eyes and a general air of being present in body but absent in spirit mothers who visited the school to introduce their sons put his vagueness down to activity of mind that busy brain they thought is never at rest even while he is talking to us some abstruse point in the classics is occupying his mind  what was occupying his mind at the present moment was the thoroughly unsatisfactory conduct of his wifes brother bertie baxter the more tensely he brooded over the salient points in the lifehistory of his wifes brother bertie baxter the deeper did the iron become embedded in his soul bertie was one of natures touchers this is the age of the specialist berties speciality was borrowing money he was a man of almost eerie versatility in this direction time could not wither nor custom stale his infinite variety he could borrow with a breezy bluffness which made the thing practically a holdup and anon when his victim had steeled himself against this method he could extract another fivepound note from his little hoard with the delicacy of one playing spillikins mr blatherwick had been a goldmine to him for years as a rule the proprietor of harrow house unbelted without complaint for bertie as every good borrower should had that knack of making his victim feel during the actual moment of paying over as if he had just made a rather good investment but released from the spell of his brotherinlaws personal magnetism mr blatherwick was apt to brood he was brooding now why he was asking himself morosely should he be harassed by this bertie it was not as if bertie was penniless he had a little income of his own no it was pure lack of consideration who was bertie that he  at this point in his meditations violet entered with the afterdinner coffee and the evening post  mr blatherwick took the letters there were two of them and one he saw with a rush of indignation was in the handwriting of his brotherinlaw mr blatherwicks blood simmered so the fellow thought he could borrow by post did he not even trouble to pay a visit eh he tore the letter open and the first thing he saw was a cheque for five pounds  mr blatherwick was astounded that a letter from his brotherinlaw should not contain a request for money was surprising that it should contain a cheque even for five pounds was miraculous  he opened the second letter it was short but full of the finest noblest sentiments to wit that the writer charles j pickersgill having heard the school so highly spoken of by his friend mr herbert baxter would be glad if mr blatherwick could take in his three sons aged seven nine and eleven respectively at the earliest convenient date  mr blatherwicks first feeling was one of remorse that even in thought he should have been harsh to the goldenhearted bertie his next was one of elation  violet meanwhile stood patiently before him with the coffee mr blatherwick helped himself his eye fell on violet  violet was a friendly warmhearted little thing she saw that mr blatherwick had had good news and as the bearer of the letters which had contained it she felt almost responsible she smiled kindly up at mr blatherwick  mr blatherwicks dreamy hazel eye rested pensively upon her the major portion of his mind was far away in the future dealing with visions of a school grown to colossal proportions and patronized by millionaires the section of it which still worked in the present was just large enough to enable him to understand that he felt kindly and even almost grateful to violet unfortunately it was too small to make him see how wrong it was to kiss her in a vague fatherly way across the coffee tray just as james datchett walked into the room  james paused mr blatherwick coughed violet absolutely unmoved supplied james with coffee and bustled out of the room  she left behind her a somewhat massive silence  mr blatherwick coughed again  it looks like rain said james carelessly  ah said mr blatherwick  very like rain said james  indeed said mr blatherwick  a pause  pity if it rains said james  true said mr blatherwick  another pause  erdatchett said mr blatherwick  yes said james  ierfeel that perhaps  james waited attentively  have you sugar  plenty thanks said james  i shall be sorry if it rains said mr blatherwick  conversation languished  james laid his cup down  i have some writing to do he said i think ill be going upstairs now  erjust so said mr blatherwick with relief just so an excellent idea                                       erdatchett said mr blatherwick next day after breakfast  yes said james  a feeling of content was over him this morning the sun had broken through the clouds one of the long envelopes which he had received on the previous night had turned out on examination to contain a letter from the editor accepting the story if he would reconstruct certain passages indicated in the margin  i haveahunfortunately been compelled to dismiss adolf said mr blatherwick  yes said james he had missed adolfs shining morning face  yes after you had left me last night he came to my study with a maliciouserfabrication respecting yourself which i need notahparticularize  james looked pained awful thing it is this nourishing vipers in ones bosom  why ive been giving adolf english lessons nearly every day lately no sense of gratitude these foreigners he said sadly  so i was compelled proceeded mr blatherwick toin fact just so  james nodded sympathetically  do you know anything about west australia he asked changing the subject its a fine country i believe i had thought of going there at one time  indeed said mr blatherwick  but ive given up the idea now said james     three from dunsterville   once upon a time there was erected in longacre square new york a large white statue labelled our city the figure of a woman in grecian robes holding aloft a shield critical citizens objected to it for various reasons but its real fault was that its symbolism was faulty the sculptor should have represented new york as a conjuror in evening dress smiling blandly as he changed a rabbit into a bowl of goldfish for that above all else is new yorks speciality it changes  between 1 may when she stepped off the train and 16 may when she received eddy moores letter containing the information that he had found her a post as stenographer in the office of joe rendal it had changed mary hill quite remarkably  mary was from dunsterville which is in canada emigrations from dunsterville were rare it is a somnolent town and as a rule young men born there follow in their fathers footsteps working on the paternal farm or helping in the paternal store occasionally a daring spirit will break away but seldom farther than montreal two only of the younger generation joe rendal and eddy moore had set out to make their fortunes in new york and both despite the gloomy prophecies of the village sages had prospered  mary third and last emigrant did not aspire to such heights all she demanded from new york for the present was that it should pay her a living wage and to that end having studied by stealth typewriting and shorthand she had taken the plunge thrilling with excitement and the romance of things and new york had looked at her raised its eyebrows and looked away again if every city has a voice new yorks at that moment had said huh this had damped mary she saw that there were going to be obstacles for one thing she had depended so greatly on eddy moore and he had failed her three years before at a church festival he had stated specifically that he would die for her perhaps he was still willing to do thatshe had not inquiredbut at any rate he did not see his way to employing her as a secretary he had been very nice about it he had smiled kindly taken her address and said he would do what he could and had then hurried off to meet a man at lunch but he had not given her a position and as the days went by and she found no employment and her little stock of money dwindled and no word came from eddy new york got to work and changed her outlook on things wonderfully what had seemed romantic became merely frightening what had been exciting gave her a feeling of dazed helplessness  but it was not until eddys letter came that she realized the completeness of the change on 1 may she would have thanked eddy politely for his trouble adding however that she would really prefer not to meet poor joe again on 16 may she welcomed him as something heavensent the fact that she was to be employed outweighed a thousandfold the fact that her employer was to be joe  it was not that she disliked joe she was sorry for him  she remembered joe a silent shambling youth all hands feet and shyness who had spent most of his spare time twisting his fingers and staring adoringly at her from afar the opinion of those in the social whirl of dunsterville had been that it was his hopeless passion for her that had made him fly to new york it would be embarrassing meeting him again it would require tact to discourage his silent worshipping without wounding him more deeply she hated hurting people  but even at the cost of that she must accept the post to refuse meant ignominious retreat to dunsterville and from that her pride revolted she must revisit dunsterville in triumph or not at all  joe rendals office was in the heart of the financial district situated about halfway up a building that to mary reared amidst the less impressive architecture of her hometown seemed to reach nearly to the sky a proudlooking officeboy apparently baffled and mortified by the information that she had an appointment took her name and she sat down filled with a fine mixed assortment of emotions to wait  for the first time since her arrival in new york she felt almost easy in her mind new york with its shoving jostling hurrying crowds a giant fowlrun full of human fowls scurrying to and fro clucking ever on the lookout for some desired morsel and ever ready to swoop down and snatch it from its temporary possessor had numbed her but now she felt a slackening of the strain new york might be too much for her but she could cope with joe  the haughty boy returned mr rendal was disengaged she rose and went into an inner room where a big man was seated at a desk  it was joe there was no doubt about that but it was not the joe she remembered he of the twisted ringers and silent stare in his case new york had conjured effectively he was betterlooking betterdressed improved in every respect in the old days one had noticed the hands and feet and deduced the presence of joe somewhere in the background now they were merely adjuncts it was with a rush of indignation that mary found herself bucolic and awkward awkward with joe it was an outrage  his manner heightened the feeling if he had given the least sign of embarrassment she might have softened towards him he showed no embarrassment whatever he was very much at his ease he was cheerful he was even flippant  welcome to our beautiful little city he said  mary was filled with a helpless anger what right had he to ignore the past in this way to behave as if her presence had never reduced him to pulp  wont you sit down he went on its splendid seeing you again mary youre looking very well how long have you been in new york eddy tells me you want to be taken on as a secretary as it happens there is a vacancy for just that in this office a big wide vacancy left by a lady who departed yesterday in a shower of burning words and hairpins she said she would never return and between ourselves that was the right guess would you mind letting me see what you can do will you take this letter down  certainly there was something compelling about this new joe mary took the pencil and pad which he offeredand she took them meekly until this moment she had always been astonished by the reports which filtered through to dunsterville of his success in the big city of course nobody had ever doubted his perseverance but it takes something more than perseverance to fight new york fairly and squarely and win and joe had that something he had force he was sure of himself  read it please he said when he had finished dictating yes thats all right youll do  for a moment mary was on the point of refusing a mad desire gripped her to assert herself to make plain her resentment at this revolt of the serf then she thought of those scuttling clucking crowds and her heart failed her  thank you she said in a small voice  as she spoke the door opened  well well well said joe here we all are come in eddy mary has just been showing me what she can do  if time had done much for joe it had done more for his fellowemigrant eddy moore he had always been goodlooking andaccording to local standardspresentable tall slim with dark eyes that made you catch your breath when they looked into yours and a ready flow of speech he had been dunstervilles prize exhibit and here he was with all his excellence heightened and accentuated by the polish of the city he had filled out his clothes were wonderful and his voice when he spoke had just that same musical quality  so you and joe have fixed it up capital shall we all go and lunch somewhere  got an appointment said joe im late already be here at two sharp mary he took up his hat and went out  the effect of eddys suavity had been to make mary forget the position in which she now stood to joe eddy had created for the moment quite an oldtime atmosphere of good fellowship she hated joe for shattering this and reminding her that she was his employee her quick flush was not lost on eddy  dear old joe is a little abrupt sometimes he said but  hes a pig said mary defiantly  but you mustnt mind it new york makes men like that  it hasnt made younot to me at any rate oh eddy she cried impulsively im frightened i wish i had never come here youre the only thing in this whole city that isnt hateful  poor little girl he said never mind let me take you and give you some lunch come along  eddy was soothing there was no doubt of that he stayed her with minced chicken and comforted her with soft shelled crab his voice was a lullaby lulling her joeharassed nerves to rest  they discussed the dear old days a carper might have said that eddy was the least bit vague on the subject of the dear old days a carper might have pointed out that the discussion of the dear old days when you came to analyse it was practically a monologue on marys part punctuated with musical yes yess from her companion but who cares what carpers think mary herself had no fault to find in the roar of new york dunsterville had suddenly become very dear to her and she found in eddy a sympathetic soul to whom she could open her heart  do you remember the old school eddy and how you and i used to walk there together you carrying my dinnerbasket and helping me over the fences  yes yes  and wed gather hickorynuts and persimmons  persimmons yes murmured eddy  do you remember the prizes the teacher gave the one who got best marks in the spelling class and the treats at christmas when we all got twelve sticks of striped peppermint candy and drawing the water out of the well in that old wooden bucket in the winter and pouring it out in the playground and skating on it when it froze and wasnt it cold in the winter too do you remember the stove in the schoolroom how we used to crowd round it  the stove yes said eddy dreamily ah yes the stove yes yes those were the dear old days mary leaned her elbows on the table and her chin on her hands and looked across at him with sparkling eyes  oh eddy she said you dont know how nice it is to meet someone who remembers all about those old times i felt a hundred million miles from dunsterville before i saw you and i was homesick but now its all different  poor little mary  do you remember  he glanced at his watch with some haste  its two oclock he said i think we should be going  marys face fell  back to that pig joe i hate him and ill show him that i do  eddy looked almost alarmed  ii shouldnt do that he said i dont think i should do that its only his manner at first youll get to like him better hes an awfully good fellow really joe and if youerquarrelled with him you might find it hardwhat i mean is its not so easy to pick up jobs in new york i shouldnt like to think of you mary he added tenderly hunting for a jobtiredperhaps hungry  marys eyes filled with tears  how good you are eddy she said and im horrid grumbling when i ought to be thanking you for getting me the place ill be nice to himif i canas nice as i can  thats right do try and we shall be seeing quite a lot of each other we must often lunch together  mary reentered the office not without some trepidation two hours ago it would have seemed absurd to be frightened of joe but eddy had brought it home to her again how completely she was dependent on her former serfs goodwill and he had told her to be back at two sharp and it was now nearly a quarter past  the outer office was empty she went on into the inner room  she had speculated as she went on joes probable attitude she had pictured him as annoyed even rude what she was not prepared for was to find him on all fours grunting and rooting about in a pile of papers she stopped short  what are you doing she gasped  i cant think what you meant he said there must be some mistake im not even a passable pig i couldnt deceive a novice  he rose and dusted his knees  yet you seemed absolutely certain in the restaurant just now did you notice that you were sitting near to a sort of jungle of potted palms i was lunching immediately on the other side of the forest  mary drew herself up and fixed him with an eye that shone with rage and scorn  eavesdropper she cried  not guilty he said cheerfully i hadnt a notion that you were there till you shouted that pig joe i hate him and almost directly afterwards i left  i did not shout  my dear girl you cracked a wineglass at my table the man i was lunching with jumped clean out of his seat and swallowed his cigar you ought to be more careful  mary bit her lip  and now i suppose you are going to dismiss me  dismiss you not much the thing has simply confirmed my high opinion of your qualifications the ideal secretary must have two qualities she must be able to sec and she must think her employer a pig you fill the bill would you mind taking down this letter                                       life was very swift and stimulating for mary during the early days of her professional career the inner workings of a busy brokers office are always interesting to the stranger she had never understood how business men made their money and she did not understand now but it did not take her long to see that if they were all like joe rendal they earned it there were days of comparative calm there were days that were busy and there were days that packed into the space of a few hours the concentrated essence of a musichall knockabout sketch an earthquake a football scrummage and the rushhour on the tube when the office was full of shouting men when strange figures dived in and out and banged doors like characters in an old farce and harold the proud officeboy lost his air of being on the point of lunching with a duke at the club and perspired like one of the proletariat on these occasions you could not help admiring joe even if you hated him when a man is doing his own job well it is impossible not to admire him and joe did his job well superlatively well he was everywhere where others trotted he sprang where others raised their voices he yelled where others were in two places at once he was in three and moving towards a fourth  these upheavals had the effect on mary of making her feel curiously linked to the firm on ordinary days work was work but on these occasions of storm and stress it was a fight and she looked on every member of the little band grouped under the banner of j rendal as a brotherinarms for joe while the battle raged she would have done anything her resentment at being under his orders vanished completely he was her captain and she a mere unit in the firing line it was a privilege to do what she was told and if the order came sharp and abrupt that only meant that the fighting was fierce and that she was all the more fortunate in being in a position to be of service  the reaction would come with the end of the fight her private hostilities began when the firms ceased she became an ordinary individual again and so did joe and to joe as an ordinary individual she objected there was an indefinable something in his manner which jarred on her she came to the conclusion that it was principally his insufferable goodhumour if only he would lose his temper with her now and then she felt he would be bearable he lost it with others why not with her because she told herself bitterly he wanted to show her that she mattered so little to him that it was not worth while quarrelling with her because he wanted to put her in the wrong to be superior she had a perfect right to hate a man who treated her in that way  she compared him to his disadvantage with eddy eddy during these days continued to be more and more of a comfort it rather surprised her that he found so much time to devote to her when she had first called on him on her arrival in the city he had given her the impressionmore she admitted by his manner than his wordsthat she was not wanted he had shown no disposition to seek her company but now he seemed always to be on hand to take her out to lunch appeared to be his chief hobby  one afternoon joe commented on it with that air of suppressing an indulgent smile which mary found so trying  i saw you and eddy at stephanos just now he said between sentences of a letter which he was dictating youre seeing a great deal of eddy arent you  yes said mary hes very kind he knows im lonely she paused he hasnt forgotten the old days she said defiantly  joe nodded  good old eddy he said  there was nothing in the words to make mary fire up but much in the way they were spoken and she fired up accordingly  what do you mean she cried  mean queried joe  youre hinting at something if you have anything to say against eddy why dont you say it straight out  its a good working rule in life never to say anything straight out speaking in parables i will observe that if america was a monarchy instead of a republic and people here had titles eddy would be a certainty for first earl of pearl street  dignity fought with curiosity in mary for a moment the latter won  i dont know what you mean why pearl street  go and have a look at it  dignity recovered its ground mary tossed her head  we are wasting a great deal of time she said coldly shall i take down the rest of this letter  great idea said joe indulgently do                                       a policeman brooding on life in the neighbourhood of city hall park and broadway that evening awoke with a start from his meditations to find himself being addressed by a young lady the young lady had large grey eyes and a slim figure she appealed to the aesthetic taste of the policeman  hold to me lady he said with gallant alacrity ill see yez acrost  thank you i dont want to cross she said officer  the policeman rather liked being called officer  maam he beamed  officer do you know a street called pearl street  i do that maam  she hesitated what sort of street is it  the policeman searched in his mind for a neat definition  darned crooked miss he said  he then proceeded to point the way but the lady had gone  it was a bomb in a blue dress that joe found waiting for him at the office next morning he surveyed it in silence then raised his hands over his head  dont shoot he said whats the matter  what right had you to say that about eddy you know what i meanabout pearl street  joe laughed  did you take a look at pearl street  marys anger blazed out  i didnt think you could be so mean and cowardly she cried you ought to be ashamed to talk about people behind their backs whenwhenbesides if hes what you say how did it happen that you engaged me on his recommendation  he looked at her for an instant without replying id have engaged you he said on the recommendation of a syndicate of forgers and threecardtrick men  he stood fingering a pile of papers on the desk  eddy isnt the only person who remembers the old days mary he said slowly  she looked at him surprised there was a note in his voice that she had not heard before she was conscious of a curious embarrassment and a subtler feeling which she could not analyse but before she could speak harold the officeboy entered the room with a card and the conversation was swept away on a tidal wave of work                                       joe made no attempt to resume it that morning happened to be one of the earthquake knockaboutsketch mornings and conversation what there was of it consisted of brief strenuous remarks of a purely business nature  but at intervals during the day mary found herself returning to his words their effect on her mind puzzled her it seemed to her that somehow they caused things to alter their perspective in some way joe had become more human she still refused to believe that eddy was not all that was chivalrous and noble but her anger against joe for his insinuations had given way to a feeling of regret that he should have made them she ceased to look on him as something wantonly malevolent a thersites recklessly slandering his betters she felt that there must have been a misunderstanding somewhere and was sorry for it  thinking it over she made up her mind that it was for her to remove this misunderstanding the days which followed strengthened the decision for the improvement in joe was steadily maintained the indefinable something in his manner which had so irritated her had vanished it had been when it had existed so nebulous that words were not needed to eliminate it indeed even now she could not say exactly in what it had consisted she only knew that the atmosphere had changed without a word spoken on either side it seemed that peace had been established between them and it amazed her what a difference it made she was soothed and happy and kindly disposed to all men and every day felt more strongly the necessity of convincing joe and eddy of each others merits or rather of convincing joe for eddy she admitted always spoke most generously of the other  for a week eddy did not appear at the office on the eighth day however he rang her up on the telephone and invited her to lunch  later in the morning joe happened to ask her out to lunch  im so sorry said mary ive just promised eddy he wants me to meet him at stephanos but she hesitated why shouldnt we all lunch together she went on impulsively  she hurried on this was her opening but she felt nervous the subject of eddy had not come up between them since that memorable conversation a week before and she was uncertain of her ground  i wish you liked eddy joe she said hes very fond of you and it seems such a shame thati meanwere all from the same old town andoh i know i put it badly but  i think you put it very well said joe and if i could like a man to order id do it to oblige you butwell im not going to keep harping on it perhaps youll see through eddy yourself one of these days  a sense of the hopelessness of her task oppressed mary she put on her hat without replying and turned to go  at the door some impulse caused her to glance back and as she did so she met his eye and stood staring he was looking at her as she had so often seen him look three years before in dunstervillehumbly appealingly hungrily  he took a step forward a sort of panic seized her her fingers were on the doorhandle she turned it and the next moment was outside  she walked slowly down the street she felt shaken she had believed so thoroughly that his love for her had vanished with his shyness and awkwardness in the struggle for success in new york his words his mannereverything had pointed to that and nowit was as if those three years had not been nothing had altered unless it wereherself  had she altered her mind was in a whirl this thing had affected her like some physical shock the crowds and noises of the street bewildered her if only she could get away from them and think quietly  and then she heard her name spoken and looked round to see eddy  glad you could come he said ive something i want to talk to you about itll be quiet at stephanos  she noticed almost unconsciously that he seemed nervous he was unwontedly silent she was glad of it it helped her to think  he gave the waiter an order and became silent again drumming with his fingers on the cloth he hardly spoke till the meal was over and the coffee was on the table then he leant forward  mary he said weve always been pretty good friends havent we  his dark eyes were looking into hers there was an expression in them that was strange to her he smiled but it seemed to mary that there was effort behind the smile  of course we have eddy she said he touched her hand  dear little mary he said softly  he paused for a moment  mary he went on you would like to do me a good turn you would wouldnt you mary  why eddy of course  he touched her hand again this time somehow the action grated on her before it had seemed impulsive a mere spontaneous evidence of friendship now there was a suggestion of artificialityof calculation she drew back a little in her chair deep down in her some watchful instinct had sounded an alarm she was on guard  he drew in a quick breath  its nothing much nothing at all its only this iijoe will be writing a letter to a man called weston on thursdaythursday remember there wont be anything in itnothing of importancenothing privatebutii want you to mail me a copy of it mary aa copy of  she was looking at him openeyed her face was white and shocked  for goodness sake he said irritably dont look like that im not asking you to commit murder whats the matter with you look here mary youll admit you owe me something i suppose im the only man in new york thats ever done anything for you didnt i get you your job well then its not as if i were asking you to do anything dangerous or difficult or  she tried to speak but could not he went on rapidly he did not look at her his eyes wandered past her shifting restlessly  look here he said ill be square with you youre in new york to make money well you arent going to make it hammering a typewriter im giving you your chance im going to be square with you let me see that letter and  his voice died away abruptly the expression on his face changed he smiled and this time the effort was obvious  halloa joe he said  mary turned joe was standing at her side he looked very large and wholesome and restful  i dont want to intrude he said but i wanted to see you eddy and i thought i should catch you here i wrote a letter to jack weston yesterdayafter i got home from the officeand one to you and somehow i managed to post them in the wrong envelopes it doesnt matter much because they both said the same thing  the same thing  yes i told you i should be writing to you again on thursday to tip you something good that i was expecting from old longwood jack weston has just rung me up on the phone to say that he got a letter that doesnt belong to him i explained to him and thought id drop in here and explain to you why whats your hurry eddy  eddy had risen from his seat  im due back at the office he said hoarsely  busy man im having a slack day well goodbye ill see mary back  joe seated himself in the vacant chair  youre looking tired he said did eddy talk too much  yes he did  joe you were right  ahmary joe chuckled ill tell you something i didnt tell eddy it wasnt entirely through carelessness that i posted those letters in the wrong envelopes in fact to be absolutely frank it wasnt through carelessness at all theres an old gentleman in pittsburgh by the name of john longwood who occasionally is good enough to inform me of some of his intended doings on the market a day or so before the rest of the world knows them and eddy has always shown a strong desire to get early information too do you remember my telling you that your predecessor at the office left a little abruptly there was a reason i engaged her as a confidential secretary and she overdid it she confided in eddy from the look on your face as i came in i gathered that he had just been proposing that you should perform a similar act of christian charity had he  mary clenched her hands  its this awful new york she cried eddy was never like that in dunsterville  dunsterville does not offer quite the same scope said joe  new york changes everything mary returned it has changed eddyit has changed you  he bent towards her and lowered his voice  not altogether he said im just the same in one way ive tried to pretend i had altered but its no use i give it up im still just the same poor fool who used to hang round staring at you in dunsterville  a waiter was approaching the table with the air which waiters cultivate of just happening by chance to be going in that direction joe leaned farther forward speaking quickly  and for whom he said you didnt care a single solitary snap of your fingers mary  she looked up at him the waiter hovered poising for his swoop suddenly she smiled  new york has changed me too joe she said  mary he cried  ze pill sare observed the waiter  joe turned  ze what he exclaimed well im hanged eddys gone off and left me to pay for his lunch that mans a wonder when it comes to brainwork hes in a class by himself he paused but i have the luck he said     the tuppenny millionaire   in the crowd that strolled on the promenade des etrangers enjoying the morning sunshine there were some who had come to roville for their health others who wished to avoid the rigours of the english spring and many more who liked the place because it was cheap and close to monte carlo  none of these motives had brought george albert balmer he was there because three weeks before harold flower had called him a vegetable  what is it that makes men do perilous deeds why does a man go over niagara falls in a barrel not for his health half an hour with a skippingrope would be equally beneficial to his liver no in nine cases out of ten he does it to prove to his friends and relations that he is not the mild steadygoing person they have always thought him observe the musichall acrobat as he prepares to swing from the roof by his eyelids his gaze sweeps the house it isnt true it seems to say im not a jellyfish  it was so with george balmer  in london at the present moment there exist some thousands of respectable neatlydressed mechanical unenterprising young men employed at modest salaries by various banks corporations stores shops and business firms they are put to work when young and they stay put they are mussels each has his special place on the rock and remains glued to it all his life  to these thousands george albert balmer belonged he differed in no detail from the rest of the great army he was as respectable as neatlydressed as mechanical and as unenterprising his life was bounded east west north and south by the planet insurance company which employed him and that there were other ways in which a man might fulfil himself than by giving daily imitations behind a counter of a mechanical figure walking in its sleep had never seriously crossed his mind  on george at the age of twentyfour there descended out of a dear sky a legacy of a thousand pounds  physically he remained unchanged beneath the shock no trace of hauteur crept into his bearing when the head of his department calling his attention to a technical flaw in his work of the previous afternoon addressed him as here youyoung whatsyourconfoundedname he did not point out that this was no way to speak to a gentleman of property you would have said that the sudden smile of fortune had failed to unsettle him  but all the while his mind knocked head over heels was lying in a limp heap wondering what had struck it  to him in his dazed state came harold flower harold messenger to the planet insurance company and one of the most assiduous moneyborrowers in london had listened to the office gossip about the legacy as if to the strains of some grand sweet anthem he was a bibulous individual of uncertain age who in the intervals of creeping about his duties kept an eye open for possible additions to his staff of creditors most of the clerks at the planet had been laid under contribution by him in their time for harold had a way with him that was good for threepence any payday and it seemed to him that things had come to a sorry pass if he could not extract something special from plutocrat balmer in his hour of rejoicing  throughout the day he shadowed george and shortly before closingtime backed him into a corner tapped him on the chest and requested the temporary loan of a sovereign  in the same breath he told him that he was a gentleman that a messengers life was practically that of a blanky slave and that a young man of spirit who wished to add to his already large fortune would have a bit on giant gooseberry for the city and suburban he then paused for a reply  now all through the day george had been assailed by a steady stream of determined earbiters again and again he had been staked out as an oreproducing claim by men whom it would have been impolitic to rebuff he was tired of lending and in a mood to resent unauthorized demands harold flowers struck him as particularly unauthorized he said so  it took some little time to convince mr flower that he really meant it but realizing at last the grim truth he drew a long breath and spoke  ho he said afraid you cant spare it cant you a gentleman comes and asks you with tack and civility for a tempy loan of about arf nothing and all you do is to curse and swear at him do you know what i call youyou and your thousand quid a tuppenny millionaire thats what i call you keep your blooming money thats all i ask keep it much good youll get out of it i know your sort youll never have any pleasure of it not you youre the careful sort youll put it into consols you will and draw your threehapence a year money wasnt meant for your kind it dont mean nothing to you you aint got the go in you to appreciate it a vegetablethats all you are a blanky little vegetable a blanky little gorblimey vegetable i seen turnips with more spirit in em that what youve got and brussels sprouts yes and parsnips  it is difficult to walk away with dignity when a man with a hoarse voice and a watery eye is comparing you to your disadvantage with a parsnip and george did not come anywhere near achieving the feat but he extricated himself somehow and went home brooding  mr flowers remarks rankled particularly because it so happened that consols were the identical investment on which he had decided his uncle robert with whom he lived as a paying guest had strongly advocated them also they had suggested themselves to him independently  but harold flowers words gave him pause they made him think for two weeks and some days he thought flushing uncomfortably whenever he met that watery but contemptuous eye and then came the day of his annual vacation and with it inspiration he sought out the messenger whom till now he had carefully avoided  erflower he said  me lord  i am taking my holiday tomorrow will you forward my letters i will wire you the address i have not settled on my hotel yet i am popping overhe pausedi am popping over he resumed carelessly to monte  to who inquired mr flower  to monte monte carlo you know  mr flower blinked twice rapidly then pulled himself together  yus i dont think he said  and that settled it  the george who strolled that pleasant morning on the promenade des strangers differed both externally and internally from the george who had fallen out with harold flower in the offices of the planet insurance company for a day after his arrival he had clung to the garb of middleclass england on the second he had discovered that this was unpleasantly warm and worse conspicuous at the casino municipale that evening he had observed a man wearing an arrangement in bright yellow velvet without attracting attention the sight had impressed him next morning he had emerged from his hotel in a flannel suit so light that it had been unanimously condemned as impossible by his uncle robert his aunt louisa his cousins percy eva and geraldine and his aunt louisas mother and at a shop in the rue lasalle had spent twenty francs on a homburg hat and roville had taken it without blinking  internally his alteration had been even more considerable roville was not monte carlo in which gay spot he had remained only long enough to send a picture postcard to harold flower before retiring down the coast to find something cheaper but it had been a revelation to him for the first time in his life he was seeing colour and it intoxicated him the silky blueness of the sea was startling the pure white of the great hotels along the promenade and the casino municipale fascinated him he was dazzled at the casino the pillars were crimson and cream the tables skyblue and pink seated on a greenandwhite striped chair he watched a revue of which from start to finish he understood but one wordout to witabsorbed in the doings of a redmoustached gentleman in blue who wrangled in rapid french with a blackmoustached gentleman in yellow while a snowwhite commere and a compere in a mauve flannel suit looked on at the brawl  it was during that evening that there flitted across his mind the first suspicion he had ever had that his uncle roberts mental outlook was a little limited  and now as he paced the promenade watching the stir and bustle of the crowd he definitely condemned his absent relative as a narrowminded chump  if the brown boots which he had polished so assiduously in his bedroom that morning with the inside of a bananaskin and which now gleamed for the first time on his feet had a fault it was that they were a shade tight to promenade with the gay crowd therefore for any length of time was injudicious and george warned by a redhot shooting sensation that the moment had arrived for rest sank down gracefully on a seat to rise at once on discovering that between him and it was something oblong with sharp corners  it was a booka fat new novel george drew it out and inspected it there was a name insidejulia waveney  george from boyhood up had been raised in that school of thought whose watchword is findings are keepings and having ascertained that there was no address attached to the name he was on the point i regret to say of pouching the volume which already he looked upon as his own when a figure detached itself from the crowd and he found himself gazing into a pair of grey and to his startled conscience accusing eyes  oh thank you i was afraid it was lost  she was breathing quickly and there was a slight flush on her face she took the book from georges unresisting hand and rewarded him with a smile  i missed it and i couldnt think where i could have left it then i remembered that i had been sitting here thank you so much  she smiled again turned and walked away leaving george to reckon up all the social solecisms he had contrived to commit in the space of a single moment he had remained seated he reminded himself throughout the interview one he had not raised his hat that fascinating homburg simply made to be raised with a debonair swish under such conditions two call it three because he ought to have raised it twice he had gaped like a fool four and five he had not uttered a single word of acknowledgement in reply to her thanks  five vast bloomers in under a minute i what could she have thought of him the sun ceased to shine what sort of an utter outsider could she have considered him an east wind sprang up what kind of a cockney bounder and cad could she have taken him for the sea turned to an oily grey and george rising strode back in the direction of his hotel in a mood that made him forget that he had brown boots on at all  his mind was active several times since he had come to roville he had been conscious of a sensation which he could not understand a vague yearning sensation a feeling that splendid as everything was in this paradise of colour there was nevertheless something lacking now he understood you had to be in love to get the full flavour of these vivid whites and blues he was getting it now his mood of dejection had passed swiftly to be succeeded by an exhilaration such as he had only felt once in his life before about halfway through a dinner given to the planet staff on a princely scale by a retiring general manager  he was exalted nothing seemed impossible to him he would meet the girl again on the promenade he told himself dashingly renew the acquaintance show her that he was not the gaping idiot he had appeared his imagination donned its sevenleague boots he saw himself proposingeloquentlyaccepted married living happily ever after  it occurred to him that an excellent first move would be to find out where she was staying he bought a paper and turned to the list of visitors miss waveney where was it he ran his eye down the column  and then with a crash down came his aircastles in hideous ruin  hotel cercle de la mediterranee lord frederick weston the countess of southborne and the hon adelaide liss lady julia waveney  he dropped the paper and hobbled on to his hotel his boots had begun to hurt him again for he no longer walked on air                                       at roville there are several institutions provided by the municipality for the purpose of enabling visitors temporarily to kill thought chief among these is the casino municipale where for a price the sorrowful may obtain oblivion by means of the ingenious game of boule disappointed lovers at roville take to boule as in other places they might take to drink it is a fascinating game a woodenfaced high priest flicks a red indiarubber ball into a polished oaken bowl at the bottom of which are holes each bearing a number up to nine the ball swings round and round like a planet slows down stumbles among the holes rests for a moment in the one which you have backed then hops into the next one and you lose if ever there was a pastime calculated to place young adam cupid in the background this is it  to the boule tables that night fled george with his hopeless passion from the instant when he read the fatal words in the paper he had recognized its hopelessness all other obstacles he had been prepared to overcome but a titleno he had no illusions as to his place in the social scale the lady julias of this world did not marry insurance clerks even if their late mothers cousin had left them a thousand pounds that daydream was definitely ended it was a thing of the pastall over except the heartache  by way of a preliminary sip of the waters of lethe before beginning the full draught he placed a franc on number seven and lost another franc on six suffered the same fate he threw a fivefranc cartwheel recklessly on evens it won  it was enough thrusting his hat on the back of his head and wedging himself firmly against the table he settled down to make a night of it  there is nothing like boule for absorbing the mind it was some time before george became aware that a hand was prodding him in the ribs he turned irritated immediately behind him filling the landscape were two stout frenchmen but even as he searched his brain for words that would convey to them in their native tongue his disapproval of this jostling he perceived that they though stout and in a general way offensive were in this particular respect guiltless the prodding hand belonged to somebody invisible behind them it was small and gloved a womans hand it held a fivefranc piece  then in a gap caused by a movement in the crowd he saw the face of lady julia waveney  she smiled at him  on eight please would you mind he heard her say and then the crowd shifted again and she disappeared leaving him holding the coin his mind in a whirl  the game of boule demands undivided attention from its devotees to play with a mind full of other matters is a mistake this mistake george made hardly conscious of what he was doing he flung the coin on the board she had asked him to place it on eight and he thought that he had placed it on eight that in reality blinded by emotion he had placed it on three was a fact which came home to him neither then nor later  consequently when the ball ceased to roll and a sepulchral voice croaked the news that eight was the winning number he fixed on the croupier a gaze that began by being joyful and expectant and ended the croupier remaining entirely unresponsive by being wrathful  he leaned towards him  monsieur he said moi jai jete cinq francs sur huit  the croupier was a man with a pointed moustache and an air of having seen all the sorrow and wickedness that there had ever been in the world he twisted the former and permitted a faint smile to deepen the melancholy of the latter but he did not speak  george moved to his side the two stout frenchmen had strolled off leaving elbowroom behind them  he tapped the croupier on the shoulder  i say he said whats the game jai jete cinq francs sur huit i tell you moi  a forgotten idiom from the days of boyhood and french exercises came to him  moi qui parle he added  messieurs faites vos jeux crooned the croupier in a detached manner  to the normal george as to most englishmen of his age the one cardinal rule in life was at all costs to avoid rendering himself conspicuous in public than george normal no violet that ever hid itself in a mossy bank could have had a greater distaste for scenes but tonight he was not normal roville and its colour had wrought a sort of fever in his brain boule had increased it and love had caused it to rage if this had been entirely his own affair it is probable that the croupiers frigid calm would have quelled him and he would have retired fermenting but baffled but it was not his own affair he was fighting the cause of the only girl in the world she had trusted him could he fail her no he was dashed if he could he would show her what he was made of his heart swelled within him a thrill permeated his entire being starting at his head and running out at his heels he felt tremendousa sort of blend of oliver cromwell a berserk warrior and sir galahad  monsieur he said again hi what about it  this time the croupier did speak  cest fini he said and print cannot convey the pensive scorn of his voice it stung george in his exalted mood like a blow finished was it all right now he would show them they had asked for it and now they should get it how much did it come to five francs the stake had been and you got seven times your stake and you got your stake back he was nearly forgetting that forty francs in all then two of those gold whatdyoucallems in fact very well then  he leaned forward quickly across the croupier snatched the lid off the gold tray and removed two louis  it is a remarkable fact in life that the scenes which we have rehearsed in our minds never happen as we have pictured them happening in the present case for instance it had been georges intention to handle the subsequent stages of this little dispute with an easy dignity he had proposed the money obtained to hand it over to its rightful owner raise his hat and retire with an air a gallant champion of the oppressed it was probably about onesixteenth of a second after his hand had closed on the coins that he realized in the most vivid manner that these were not the lines on which the incident was to develop and with all his heart he congratulated himself on having discarded those brown boots in favour of a worn but roomy pair of gents oxfords  for a moment there was a pause and a silence of utter astonishment while the minds of those who had witnessed the affair adjusted themselves to the marvel and then the world became full of starting eyes yelling throats and clutching hands from all over the casino fresh units swarmed like bees to swell the crowd at the centre of things promenaders ceased to promenade waiters to wait elderly gentlemen sprang on to tables  but in that momentary pause george had got off the mark the table at which he had been standing was the one nearest to the door and he had been on the door side of it as the first eyes began to start the first throats to yell and the first hands to clutch he was passing the counter of the moneychanger he charged the swingdoor at full speed and true to its mission it swung he had a vague glimpse from the corner of his eye of the hatandcloak counter and then he was in the square with the cold night breeze blowing on his forehead and the stars winking down from the blue sky  a paperseller on the pavement ever the man of business stepped forward and offered him the paris edition of the daily mail and being in the direct line of transit shot swiftly into the road and fell into a heap while george shaken but going well turned off to the left where there seemed to be rather more darkness than anywhere else  and then the casino disgorged the pursuers  to george looking hastily over his shoulder there seemed a thousand of them the square rang with their cries he could not understand them but gathered that they were uncomplimentary at any rate they stimulated a little man in evening dress strolling along the pavement towards him to become suddenly animated and to leap from side to side with outstretched arms  panic makes harlequin threequarters of us all for one who had never played rugby football george handled the situation well he drew the defence with a feint to the left then swerving to the right shot past into the friendly darkness from behind came the ringing of feet and an evergrowing din  it is one of the few compensations a fugitive pursued by a crowd enjoys that while he has space for his manoeuvres those who pursue are hampered by their numbers in the little regiment that pounded at his heels it is probable that there were many faster runners than george on the other hand there were many slower and in the early stages of the chase these impeded their swifter brethren at the end of the first halfminute therefore george not sparing himself had drawn well ahead and for the first time found leisure for connected thought  his brain became preternaturally alert so that when rounding a corner he perceived entering the main road from a sidestreet in front of him a small knot of pedestrians he did not waver but was seized with a keen spasm of presence of mind without pausing in his stride he pointed excitedly before him and at the same moment shouted the words la la vite vite  his stock of french was small but it ran to that and for his purpose it was ample the french temperament is not stolid when the french temperament sees a man running rapidly and pointing into the middle distance and hears him shouting la la vite vite it does not stop to make formal inquiries it sprints like a mustang it did so now with the happy result that a moment later george was racing down the road the centre and recognized leader of an enthusiastic band of six which in the next twenty yards swelled to eleven  five minutes later in a wineshop near the harbour he was sipping the first glass of a bottle of cheap but comforting vin ordinaire while he explained to the interested proprietor by means of a mixture of english broken french and gestures that he had been helping to chase a thief but had been forced by fatigue to retire prematurely for refreshment the proprietor gathered however that he had every confidence in the zeal of his still active colleagues  it is convincing evidence of the extent to which love had triumphed over prudence in georges soul that the advisability of lying hid in his hotel on the following day did not even cross his mind immediately after breakfast or what passed for it at roville he set out for the hotel cercle de la mediterranee to hand over the two louis to their owner  lady julia he was informed on arrival was out the porter politely genial advised monsieur to seek her on the promenade des etrangers  she was there on the same seat where she had left the book  good morning he said  she had not seen him coming and she started at his voice the flush was back on her face as she turned to him there was a look of astonishment in the grey eyes  he held out the two louis  i couldnt give them to you last night he said  a horrible idea seized him it had not occurred to him before  i say he stammeredi say i hope you dont think i had run off with your winnings for good the croupier wouldnt give them up you know so i had to grab them and run they came to exactly two louis you put on five francs you know and you get seven times your stake i  an elderly lady seated on the bench who had loomed from behind a parasol towards the middle of these remarks broke abruptly into speech  who is this young man  george looked at her startled he had hardly been aware of her presence till now rapidly he diagnosed her as a motheror aunt she looked more like an aunt of course it must seem odd to her his charging in like this a perfect stranger and beginning to chat with her daughter or niece or whatever it was he began to justify himself  i met yourthis young ladysomething told him that was not the proper way to put it but hang it what else could he sayat the casino last night  he stopped the effect of his words on the elderly lady was remarkable her face seemed to turn to stone and become all sharp points she stared at the girl  so you were gambling at the casino last night she said  she rose from the seat a frozen statue of displeasure  i shall return to the hotel when you have arranged your financial transactions with yourfriend i should like to speak to you you will find me in my room  george looked after her dumbly  the girl spoke in a curiously strained voice as if she were speaking to herself  i dont care she said im glad  george was concerned  im afraid your mother is offended lady julia  there was a puzzled look in her grey eyes as they met his then they lit up she leaned back in the seat and began to laugh softly at first and then with a note that jarred on george whatever the humour of the situationand he had not detected it at presentthis mirth he felt was unnatural and excessive  she checked herself at length and a flush crept over her face  i dont know why i did that she said abruptly im sorry there was nothing funny in what you said but im not lady julia and i have no mother that was lady julia who has just gone and i am nothing more important than her companion  her companion  i had better say her late companion it will soon be that i had strict orders you see not to go near the casino without herand i went  thenthen ive lost you your jobi mean your position if it hadnt been for me she wouldnt have known i  you have done me a great service she said you have cut the painter for me when i have been trying for months to muster up the courage to cut it for myself i dont suppose you know what it is to get into a groove and long to get out of it and not have the pluck my brother has been writing to me for a long time to join him in canada and i hadnt the courage or the energy or whatever it is that takes people out of grooves i knew i was wasting my life but i was fairly happyat least not unhappy sowell there it was i suppose women are like that  and now  and now you have jerked me out of the groove i shall go out to bob by the first boat  he scratched the concrete thoughtfully with his stick  its a hard life out there he said  but it is a life  he looked at the strollers on the promenade they seemed very far awayin another world  look here he said hoarsely and stopped may i sit down he asked abruptly ive got something to say and i cant say it when im looking at you  he sat down and fastened his gaze on a yacht that swayed at anchor against the cloudless sky  look here he said will you marry me  he heard her turn quickly and felt her eyes upon him he went on doggedly  i know he said we only met yesterday you probably think im mad  i dont think youre mad she said quietly i only think youre too quixotic youre sorry for me and you are letting a kind impulse carry you away as you did last night at the casino its like you  for the first time he turned towards her  i dont know what you suppose i am he said but ill tell you im a clerk in an insurance office i get a hundred a year and ten days holiday did you take me for a millionaire if i am im only a tuppenny one somebody left me a thousand pounds a few weeks ago thats how i come to be here now you know all about me i dont know anything about you except that i shall never love anybody else marry me and well go to canada together you say ive helped you out of your groove well ive only one chance of getting out of mine and thats through you if you wont help me i dont care if i get out of it or not will you pull me out  she did not speak she sat looking out to sea past the manycoloured crowd  he watched her face but her hat shaded her eyes and he could read nothing in it  and then suddenly without quite knowing how it had got there he found that her hand was in his and he was clutching it as a drowning man clutches a rope  he could see her eyes now and there was a message in them that set his heart racing a great content filled him she was so companionable such a friend it seemed incredible to him that it was only yesterday that they had met for the first time  and now she said would you mind telling me your name                                       the little waves murmured as they rolled lazily up the beach somewhere behind the trees in the gardens a band had begun to play the breeze blowing in from the blue mediterranean was charged with salt and happiness and from a seat on the promenade a young man swept the crowd with a defiant gaze  it isnt true it seemed to say im not a jellyfish     ahead of schedule   it was to wilson his valet with whom he frequently chatted in airy fashion before rising of a morning that rollo finch first disclosed his great idea wilson was a man of silent habit and men of silent habit rarely escaped rollos confidences  wilson he said one morning from the recesses of his bed as the valet entered with his shavingwater have you ever been in love  yes sir said the valet unperturbed  one would hardly have expected the answer to be in the affirmative like most valets and all chauffeurs wilson gave the impression of being above the softer emotions  what happened inquired rollo  it came to nothing sir said wilson beginning to strop the razor with no appearance of concern  ah said rollo and i bet i know why you didnt go the right way to work  no sir  not one fellow in a hundred does i know ive thought it out ive been thinking the deuce of a lot about it lately its dashed tricky this making love most fellows havent a notion how to work it no system no system wilson old scout  no sir  now i have a system and ill tell it you it may do you a bit of good next time you feel that impulse youre not dead yet now my system is simply to go to it gradually by degrees work by schedule see what i mean  not entirely sir  well ill give you the details first thing you want to find the girl  just so sir  well when youve found her what do you do you just look at her see what i mean  not entirely sir  look at her my boy thats just the startthe foundation you develop from that but you keep away thats the point ive thought this thing out mind you i dont claim absolutely all the credit for the idea myself its by way of being based on christian science absent treatment and all that but most of its mine all the fine work  yes sir  yes absolutely all the fine work heres the thing in a nutshell you find the girl right of course youve got to meet her once just to establish the connexion then you get busy first week looks just look at her second week letters write to her every day third week flowers send her some every afternoon fourth week presents with a bit more class about them bit of jewellery now and then see what i mean fifth weeklunches and suppers and things sixth week propose though you can do it in the fifth week if you see a chance youve got to leave that to the fellows judgement well there you are see what i mean  wilson stropped his masters razor thoughtfully  a trifle elaborate sir is it not he said  rollo thumped the counterpane  i knew youd say that thats what nine fellows out of ten would say theyd want to rush it i tell you wilson old scout you cant rush it  wilson brooded awhile his mind back in the passionate past  in market bumpstead sir  what the deuce is market bumpstead  a village sir where i lived until i came to london  well  in market bumpstead sir the prevailing custom was to escort the young lady home from church buy her some little presentsome ribbons possiblynext day take her for a walk and kiss her sir  wilsons voice as he unfolded these devices of the dashing youth of market bumpstead had taken on an animation quite unsuitable to a conscientious valet he gave the impression of a man who does not depend on idle rumour for his facts his eye gleamed unprofessionally for a moment before resuming its habitual expression of quiet introspection  rollo shook his head  that sort of thing might work in a village he said but you want something better for london                                       rollo finchin the present unsatisfactory state of the law parents may still christen a child rollowas a youth to whom nature had given a cheerful disposition not marred by any superfluity of brain everyone liked rollothe great majority on sight the rest as soon as they heard that he would be a millionaire on the death of his uncle andrew there is a subtle something a sort of nebulous charm as it were about young men who will be millionaires on the death of their uncle andrew which softens the ruggedest misanthrope  rollos mother had been a miss galloway of pittsburgh pennsylvania usa and andrew galloway the worldfamous braces king the inventor and proprietor of the inimitable tried and proven was her brother his braces had penetrated to every corner of the earth wherever civilization reigned you would find men wearing galloways tried and proven  between rollo and this human benefactor there had always existed friendly relations and it was an open secret that unless his uncle were to marry and supply the world with little galloways as well as braces the young man would come into his money  so rollo moved on his way through life popular and happy always merry and bright that was rollo  or nearly always for there were momentswe all have our greyer momentswhen he could have wished that mr galloway had been a trifle older or a trifle less robust the braces potentate was at present passing in excellent health through the indian summer of life he was moreover as has been stated by birth and residence a pittsburgh man and the tendency of middleaged pittsburgh millionaires to marry chorusgirls is notoriously like the homing instinct of pigeons somethingit may be the smokeseems to work on them like a charm  in the case of andrew galloway nature had been thwarted up till now by the accident of an unfortunate attachment in early life the facts were not fully known but it was generally understood that his fiancee had exercised womans prerogative and changed her mind also that she had done this on the actual weddingday causing annoyance to all and had clinched the matter by eloping to jersey city with the prospective bridegrooms own coachman whatever the facts there was no doubt about their result mr galloway having abjured woman utterly had flung himself with moody energy into the manufacture and propagation of his tried and proven braces and had found consolation in it ever since he would be strong he told himself like his braces hearts might snap beneath a sudden strain not so the tried and proven love might tug and tug again but never more should the trousers of passion break away from the tough masterful braces of selfcontrol  as mr galloway had been in this frame of mind for a matter of eleven years it seemed to rollo not unreasonable to hope that he might continue in it permanently he had the very strongest objection to his uncle marrying a chorusgirl and as the years went on and the disaster did not happen his hopes of playing the role of heir till the fall of the curtain grew stronger and stronger he was one of those young men who must be heirs or nothing this is the age of the specialist and years ago rollo had settled on his career even as a boy hardly capable of connected thought he had been convinced that his speciality the one thing he could do really well was to inherit money all he wanted was a chance it would be bitter if fate should withhold it from him  he did not object on principle to men marrying chorusgirls on the contrary he wanted to marry one himself  it was this fact which had given that turn to his thoughts which had finally resulted in the schedule                                       the first intimation that wilson had that the schedule was actually to be put into practical operation was when his employer one monday evening requested him to buy a mediumsized bunch of the best red roses and deliver them personally with a note to miss marguerite parker at the stagedoor of the duke of cornwalls theatre  wilson received the order in his customary gravely deferential manner and was turning to go but rollo had more to add  flowers wilson he said significantly  so i understood you to say sir i will see to it at once  see what i mean third week wilson  indeed sir  rollo remained for a moment in what he would have called thought  charming girl wilson  indeed sir  seen the show  not yet sir  you should said rollo earnestly take my advice old scout and see it first chance you get its topping ive had the same seat in the middle of the front row of the stalls for two weeks  indeed sir  looks wilson the good old schedule  have you noticed any satisfactory results sir  its working on saturday night she looked at me five times shes a delightful girl wilson nice quiet girlnot the usual sort i met her first at a lunch at oddys shes the last girl on the op side im sure youd like her wilson  i have every confidence in your taste sir  youll see her for yourself this evening dont let the fellow at the stagedoor put you off slip him half a crown or a couple of quid or something and say you must see her personally are you a close observer wilson  i think so sir  because i want you to notice particularly how she takes it see that she reads the note in your presence ive taken a good deal of trouble over that note wilson its a good note well expressed watch her face while shes reading it  very good sir excuse me sir  eh  i had almost forgotten to mention it mr galloway rang up on the telephone shortly before you came in  what is he in england  mr galloway was in the habit of taking occasional trips to great britain to confer with the general manager of his london branch rollo had grown accustomed to receiving no notice of these visits  he arrived two days ago on the baltic sir he left a message that he was in london for a week and would be glad if you would dine with him tomorrow at his club  rollo nodded on these occasions it was his practice to hold himself unreservedly at mr galloways disposal the latters invitations were royal commands rollo was glad that the visit had happened now in another two weeks it might have been disastrous to the schedule  the club to which the braces king belonged was a richly but gloomily furnished building in pall mall a place of soft carpets shaded lights and whispers grave elderly men moved noiselessly to and fro or sat in meditative silence in deep armchairs sometimes the visitor felt that he was in a cathedral sometimes in a turkish bath while now and then there was a suggestion of the waitingroom of a more than usually prosperous dentist it was magnificent but not exhilarating  rollo was shown into the smokingroom where his uncle received him there was a good deal of mr andrew galloway grief gnawing at his heart had not sagged his ample waistcoat which preceded him as he moved in much the same manner as birnam woods preceded the army of macduff a wellnourished hand crept round the corner of the edifice and enveloped rollos in a powerful grip  ah my boy bellowed mr galloway cheerfully his voice was always loud glad youve come  it would be absurd to say that rollo looked at his uncle keenly he was not capable of looking keenly at anyone but certainly a puzzled expression came into his face whether it was the heartiness of the others handshake or the unusual cheeriness of his voice he could not say but something gave him the impression that a curious change had come over the braces king when they had met before during the last few years mr galloway had been practically sixteen stone five of blood and ironone of those stern soured men his attitude had been that of one for whom lifes music had ceased had he then inserted another record his manner conveyed that idea  sustained thought always gave rollo a headache he ceased to speculate  still got the same chef here uncle he said deuced brainy fellow i always like dining here  here mr galloway surveyed the somnolent occupants of the room with spirited scorn we arent going to dine in this forsaken old mausoleum ive sent in my resignation today if i find myself wanting this sort of thing at any time ill go to paris and hunt up the morgue bunch of old deadbeats bah ive engaged a table at romanos thats more in my line get your coat and lets be going  in the cab rollo risked the headache at whatever cost this thing must be pondered over his uncle prattled gaily throughout the journey once he whoopedsome weird forgotten college yell dragged from the misty depths of the past it was passing strange and in this unusual manner the two rolled into the strand and drew up at romanos door  mr galloway was a good trencherman at a very early date he had realized that a man who wishes to make satisfactory braces must keep his strength up he wanted a good deal here below and he wanted it warm and well cooked it was therefore not immediately that his dinner with rollo became a feast of reason and a flow of soul indeed the two revellers had lighted their cigars before the elder gave forth any remark that was not purely gastronomic  when he did jerk the conversation up on to a higher plane he jerked it hard he sent it shooting into the realms of the soulful with a whiz  rollo he said blowing a smokering do you believe in affinities  rollo in the act of sipping a liqueur brandy lowered his glass in surprise his head was singing slightly as the result of some rather spirited bollinger extra sec and he wondered if he had heard aright  mr galloway continued his voice rising as he spoke  my boy he said i feel young tonight for the first time in years and hang it im not so old men have married at twice my age  strictly speaking this was incorrect unless one counted methuselah but perhaps mr galloway spoke figuratively  three times my age he proceeded leaning back and blowing smoke thereby missing his nephews agitated start four times my age five times my age six  he pulled himself together in some confusion a generous wine that bollinger he must be careful  he coughed  are youyou arentare you rollo paused are you thinking of getting married uncle  mr galloways gaze was still on the ceiling  a great deal of nonsense he yelled severely is talked about men lowering themselves by marrying actresses i was a guest at a supperparty last night at which an actress was present and a more charming sensible girl i never wish to meet not one of your silly brainless chits who dont know the difference between lobster newburg and canvasback duck and who prefer sweet champagne to dry no sir not one of your mincing affected kind who pretend they never touch anything except a spoonful of cold consomme no sir good healthy appetite enjoyed her food and knew why she was enjoying it i give you my word my boy until i met her i didnt know a woman existed who could talk so damned sensibly about a bavaroise au rhum  he suspended his striking tribute in order to relight his cigar  she can use a chafingdish he resumed his voice vibrating with emotion she told me so she said she could fix chicken so that a man would leave home for it he paused momentarily overcome and welsh rarebits he added reverently  he puffed hard at his cigar  yes he said welsh rarebits too and because he shouted wrathfully because forsooth she earns an honest living by singing in the chorus of a comic opera a whole bunch of snivelling idiots will say i have made a fool of myself let them he bellowed sitting up and glaring at rollo i say let them ill show them that andrew galloway is not the man totois not the man he stopped well anyway ill show them he concluded rather lamely  rollo eyed him with fallen jaw his liqueur had turned to wormwood he had been fearing this for years you may drive out nature with a pitchfork but she will return blood will tell once a pittsburgh millionaire always a pittsburgh millionaire for eleven years his uncle had fought against his natural propensities with apparent success but nature had won in the end his words could have no other meaning andrew galloway was going to marry a chorusgirl  mr galloway rapped on the table and ordered another kummel  marguerite parker he roared dreamily rolling the words round his tongue like port  marguerite parker exclaimed rollo bounding in his chair  his uncle met his eye sternly  that was the name i said you seem to know it perhaps you have something to say against the lady eh have you have you i warn you to be careful what do you know of miss parker speak  erno no oh no i just know the name thats all ii rather think i met her once at lunch or it may have been somebody else i know it was someone  he plunged at his glass his uncles gaze relaxed its austerity  i hope you will meet her many more times at lunch my boy i hope you will come to look upon her as a second mother  this was where rollo asked if he might have a little more brandy  when the restorative came he drank it at a gulp then looked across at his uncle the great man still mused  erwhen is it to be asked rollo the wedding and all that  hardly before the fall i think no not before the fall i shall be busy till then i have taken no steps in the matter yet  no steps you mean havent youhavent you proposed  i have had no time be reasonable my boy be reasonable  oh said rollo  he breathed a long breath a suspicion of silver lining had become visible through the clouds  i doubt said mr galloway meditatively if i shall be able to find time till the end of the week i am very busy let me see tomorrow no meeting of the shareholders thursday friday no no it will have to stand over till saturday after saturdays matinee that will do excellently                                       there is a dramatic spectacle to be observed every day in this land of ours which though deserving of recognition no artist has yet pictured on canvas we allude to the suburban seasonticket holders sudden flash of speed everyone must have seen at one time or another a happy brightfaced seasonticket holder strolling placidly towards the station humming perhaps in his lightheartedness some gay air he feels secure fate cannot touch him for he has left himself for once plenty of time to catch that 850 for which he has so often sprinted like the gazelle of the prairie as he strolls suddenly his eye falls on the church clock the next moment with a passionate cry he is endeavouring to lower his record for the fiftyyard dash all the while his watch has been fifteen minutes slow  in just such a case was rollo finch he had fancied that he had plenty of time and now in an instant the fact was borne in upon him that he must hurry  for the greater part of the night of his uncles dinner he lay sleepless vainly endeavouring to find a way out of the difficulty it was not till early morning that he faced the inevitable he hated to abandon the schedule to do so meant changing a wellordered advance into a forlorn hope but circumstances compelled it there are moments when speed alone can save loves seasonticket holder  on the following afternoon he acted it was no occasion for stint he had to condense into one day the carefully considered movements of two weeks and to the best of his ability he did so he bought three bouquets a bracelet and a gold billiken with ruby eyes and sent them to the theatre by messengerboy with them went an invitation to supper  then with the feeling that he had done all that was possible he returned to his flat and waited for the hour  he dressed with more than usual care that night your wise general never throws away a move he was particular about his tie as a rule wilson selected one for him but there had been times when wilson had made mistakes one could not rely absolutely on wilsons taste in ties he did not blame him better men than wilson had gone wrong over an evening tie but tonight there must be no taking of chances  where do we keep our ties wilson he asked  the closet to the right of the door sir the first twelve shallow shelves counting from the top sir they contain a fair selection of our various cravats replicas in bulk are to be found in the third nest of drawers in your dressingroom sir  i only want one my good man im not a regiment ah i stake all on this one not a word wilson no discussion this is the tie i wear whats the time  eight minutes to eleven sir  i must be off i shall be late i shant want you any more tonight dont wait for me  very good sir  rollo left the room pale but determined and hailed a taxi                                       it is a pleasant spot the vestibule of the carlton hotel glareglitterdistant musicfair womenbrave men but one can have too much of it and as the moments pass and she does not arrive a chill seems to creep into the atmosphere we wait on hoping against hope and at last just as waiters and commissionaires are beginning to eye us with suspicion we face the truth she is not coming then out we crawl into cold callous pall mall and so home you have been through it dear reader and so have i  and so at eleven fortyfive that evening had rollo for a full threequarters of an hour he waited scanning the face of each new arrival with the anxious scrutiny of a lost dog seeking its master but at fourteen minutes to twelve the last faint flicker of hope had died away a girl may be a quarter of an hour late for supper she may be half an hour late but there is a limit and to rollos mind fortyfive minutes passed it at ten minutes to twelve a uniformed official outside the carlton signalled to a taxicab and there entered it a young man whose faith in woman was dead  rollo meditated bitterly as he drove home it was not so much the fact that she had not come that stirred him many things may keep a girl from supper it was the calm way in which she had ignored the invitation when you send a girl three bouquets a bracelet and a gold billiken with ruby eyes you do not expect an entire absence of recognition even a pennyintheslot machine treats you better than that it may give you hairpins when you want matches but at least it takes some notice of you  he was still deep in gloomy thought when he inserted his latchkey and opened the door of his flat  he was roused from his reflections by a laugh from the sittingroom he started it was a pleasant laugh and musical but it sent rollo diving outraged for the handle of the door what was a woman doing in his sittingroom at this hour was his flat an hotel  the advent of an unbidden guest rarely fails to produce a certain gene the sudden appearance of rollo caused a dead silence  it was broken by the fall of a chair on the carpet as wilson rose hurriedly to his feet  rollo stood in the doorway an impressive statue of restrained indignation he could see the outlying portions of a girl in blue at the further end of the table but wilson obscured his vision  didnt expect you back sir said wilson  for the first time in the history of their acquaintance his accustomed calm seemed somewhat ruffled  so i should think said rollo i believe you by george  you had better explain jim said a dispassionate voice from the end of the table  wilson stepped aside  my wife sir he said apologetically but with pride  your wife  we were married this morning sir  the lady nodded cheerfully at rollo she was small and slight with an impudent nose and a mass of brown hair  awfully glad to meet you she said cracking a walnut  rollo gaped  she looked at him again  weve met havent we oh yes i remember we met at lunch once and you sent me some flowers it was ever so kind of you she said beaming  she cracked another nut she seemed to consider that the introductions were complete and that formality could now be dispensed with once more she appeared at peace with all men  the situation was slipping from rollos grip he continued to gape  then he remembered his grievance  i think you might have let me know you werent coming to supper  supper  i sent a note to the theatre this afternoon  i havent been to the theatre

bumpstead  a very rising little place sir assented wilson     sir agravaine a tale of king arthurs round table   some time ago when spending a delightful weekend at the ancestral castle of my dear old friend the duke of weatherstonhope pronounced wop i came across an old blackletter ms it is on this that the story which follows is based  i have found it necessary to touch the thing up a little here and there for writers in those days were weak in construction their idea of telling a story was to take a long breath and start droning away without any stops or dialogue till the thing was over  i have also condensed the title in the original it ran how it came about that ye good knight sir agravaine ye dolorous of ye table round did fare forth to succour a damsel in distress and after divers journeyings and perils by flood and by field did win her for his bride and right happily did they twain live ever afterwards by ambrose ye monk  it was a pretty snappy title for those days but we have such a high standard in titles nowadays that i have felt compelled to omit a few yards of it  we may now proceed to the story                                       the great tournament was in full swing all through the afternoon boilerplated knights on mettlesome chargers had hurled themselves on each others spears to the vast contentment of all bright eyes shone handkerchiefs fluttered musical voices urged chosen champions to knock the cover off their brawny adversaries the cheap seats had long since become hoarse with emotion all round the arena rose the cries of itinerant merchants iced malvoisie scorecards ye cannot tell the jousters without a scorecard all was revelry and excitement  a hush fell on the throng from either end of the arena a mounted knight in armour had entered  the herald raised his hand  ladeezn gemmen battling galahad and agravaine the dolorous galahad on my right agravaine on my left squires out of the ring time  a speculator among the crowd offered six to one on galahad but found no takers nor was the publics caution without reason  a moment later the two had met in a cloud of dust and agravaine shooting over his horses crupper had fallen with a metallic clang  he picked himself up and limped slowly from the arena he was not unused to this sort of thing indeed nothing else had happened to him in his whole jousting career  the truth was that sir agravaine the dolorous was out of his element at king arthurs court and he knew it it was this knowledge that had given him that settled air of melancholy from which he derived his title  until i came upon this blackletter ms i had been under the impression like i presume everybody else that every knight of the round table was a model of physical strength and beauty malory says nothing to suggest the contrary nor does tennyson but apparently there were exceptions of whom sir agravaine the dolorous must have been the chief  there was it seems nothing to mitigate this unfortunate mans physical deficiencies there is a place in the world for the strong ugly man and there is a place for the weak handsome man but to fall short both in features and in muscle is to stake your all on brain and in the days of king arthur you did not find the populace turning out to do homage to brain it was a drug on the market agravaine was a good deal better equipped than his contemporaries with grey matter but his height in his socks was but five feet four and his muscles though he had taken three correspondence courses in physical culture remained distressingly flaccid his eyes were pale and mild his nose snub and his chin receded sharply from his lower lip as if nature designing him had had to leave off in a hurry and finish the job anyhow the upper teeth protruding completed the resemblance to a nervous rabbit  handicapped in this manner it is no wonder that he should feel sad and lonely in king arthurs court at heart he ached for romance but romance passed him by the ladies of the court ignored his existence while as for those wandering damsels who came periodically to camelot to complain of the behaviour of dragons giants and the like and to ask permission of the king to take a knight back with them to fight their cause just as nowadays one goes out and calls a policeman he simply had no chance the choice always fell on lancelot or some other popular favourite                                       the tournament was followed by a feast in those brave days almost everything was followed by a feast the scene was gay and animated fair ladies brave knights churls varlets squires scurvy knaves menatarms malapert roguesall were merry all save agravaine he sat silent and moody to the jests of dagonet he turned a deaf ear and when his neighbour sir kay arguing with sir percivale on current form appealed to him to back up his statement that sir gawain though a workmanlike middleweight lacked the punch he did not answer though the subject was one on which he held strong views he sat on brooding  as he sat there a manatarms entered the hall  your majesty he cried a damsel in distress waits without  there was a murmur of excitement and interest  show her in said the king beaming  the manatarms retired around the table the knights were struggling into an upright position in their seats and twirling their moustaches agravaine alone made no movement he had been through this sort of thing so often what were distressed damsels to him his whole demeanour said as plainly as if he had spoken the words whats the use  the crowd at the door parted and through the opening came a figure at the sight of whom the expectant faces of the knights turned pale with consternation for the newcomer was quite the plainest girl those stately halls had ever seen possibly the only plain girl they had ever seen for no instance is recorded in our authorities of the existence at that period of any such  the knights gazed at her blankly those were the grand old days of chivalry when a thousand swords would leap from their scabbards to protect defenceless woman if she were beautiful the present seemed something in the nature of a special case and nobody was quite certain as to the correct procedure  an awkward silence was broken by the king  eryes he said  the damsel halted  your majesty she cried i am in distress i crave help  just so said the king uneasily flashing an apprehensive glance at the rows of perturbed faces before him just so whaterwhat is the exact nature of theahtrouble any assistance these gallant knights can render will i am sure beaheagerly rendered  he looked imploringly at the silent warriors as a rule this speech was the signal for roars of applause but now there was not even a murmur  i may say enthusiastically he added  not a sound  precisely said the king ever tactful and nowyou were saying  i am yvonne the daughter of earl dorm of the hills said the damsel and my father has sent me to ask protection from a gallant knight against a fiery dragon that ravages the countryside  a dragon gentlemen said the king aside it was usually a safe draw nothing pleased the knight of that time more than a brisk bout with a dragon but now the tempting word was received in silence  fiery said the king  some more silence  the king had recourse to the direct appeal sir gawain this court would be greatly indebted to you if  sir gawain said he had strained a muscle at the last tournament  sir pelleas  the kings voice was growing flat with consternation the situation was unprecedented  sir pelleas said he had an ingrowing toenail  the kings eye rolled in anguish around the table suddenly it stopped it brightened his look of dismay changed to one of relief  a knight had risen to his feet it was agravaine  ah said the king drawing a deep breath  sir agravaine gulped he was feeling more nervous than he had ever felt in his life never before had he risen to volunteer his services in a matter of this kind and his state of mind was that of a small boy about to recite his first piece of poetry  it was not only the consciousness that every eye except one of sir balins which had been closed in the tournament that afternoon was upon him what made him feel like a mild gentleman in a postoffice who has asked the lady assistant if she will have time to attend to him soon and has caught her eye was the fact that he thought he had observed the damsel yvonne frown as he rose he groaned in spirit this damsel he felt wanted the proper goods or none at all she might not be able to get sir lancelot or sir galahad but she was not going to be satisfied with a halfportion  the fact was that sir agravaine had fallen in love at first sight the moment he had caught a glimpse of the damsel yvonne he loved her devotedly to others she seemed plain and unattractive to him she was a queen of beauty he was amazed at the inexplicable attitude of the knights around him he had expected them to rise in a body to clamour for the chance of assisting this radiant vision he could hardly believe even now that he was positively the only starter  this is sir agravaine the dolorous said the king to the damsel will you take him as your champion  agravaine held his breath but all was well the damsel bowed  then sir agravaine said the king perhaps you had better have your charger sent round at once i imagine that the matter is pressingtime anderdragons wait for no man  ten minutes later agravaine still dazed was jogging along to the hills with the damsel by his side  it was some time before either of them spoke the damsel seemed preoccupied and agravaines mind was a welter of confused thoughts the most prominent of which and the one to which he kept returning being the startling reflection that he who had pined for romance so long had got it now in full measure  a dragon fiery withal was he absolutely certain that he was capable of handling an argument with a fiery dragon he would have given much for a little previous experience of this sort of thing it was too late now but he wished he had had the forethought to get merlin to put up a magic prescription for him rendering him immune to dragonbites but did dragons bite or did they whack at you with their tails or just blow fire  there were a dozen such points that he would have liked to have settled before starting it was silly to start out on a venture of this sort without special knowledge he had half a mind to plead a forgotten engagement and go straight back  then he looked at the damsel and his mind was made up what did death matter if he could serve her  he coughed she came out of her reverie with a start  this dragon now said agravaine  for a moment the damsel did not reply a fearsome worm sir knight she said at length it raveneth by day and by night it breathes fire from its nostrils  does it said agravaine does it i you couldnt give some idea what it looks like what kind of size it is  its body is as thick as ten stout trees and its head touches the clouds  does it said agravaine thoughtfully does it  oh sir knight i pray you have a care  i will said agravaine and he had seldom said anything more fervently the future looked about as bad as it could be any hopes he may have entertained that this dragon might turn out to be comparatively small and inoffensive were dissipated this was plainly no debilitated wreck of a dragon its growth stunted by excessivefirebreathing a body as thick as ten stout trees he would not even have the melancholy satisfaction of giving the creature indigestion for all the impression he was likely to make on that vast interior he might as well be a salted almond  as they were speaking a dim mass on the skyline began to take shape  behold said the damsel my fathers castle and presently they were riding across the drawbridge and through the great gate which shut behind them with a clang  as they dismounted a man came out through a door at the farther end of the courtyard  father said yvonne this is the gallant knight sir agravaine who has come to it seemed to agravaine that she hesitated for a moment  to tackle our dragon said the father excellent come right in  earl dorm of the hills was a small elderly man with what agravaine considered a distinctly furtive air about him his eyes were too close together and he was overlavish with a weak cunning smile even agravaine who was in the mood to like the whole family if possible for yvonnes sake could not help feeling that appearances were against this particular exhibit he might have a heart of gold beneath the outward aspect of a confidencetrick expert whose hobby was dogstealing but there was no doubt that his exterior did not inspire a genial glow of confidence  very good of you to come said the earl  its a pleasure said agravaine i have been hearing all about the dragon  a great scourge agreed his host we must have a long talk about it after dinner  it was the custom in those days in the stately homes of england for the whole strength of the company to take their meals together the guests sat at the upper table the ladies in a gallery above them while the usual drove of menatarms archers malapert rogues varlets scurvy knaves scullions and pluguglies attached to all medieval households squashed in near the door wherever they could find room  the retinue of earl dorm was not strong numericallythe household being to judge from appearances one that had seen better days but it struck agravaine that what it lacked in numbers it made up in toughness among all those at the bottom of the room there was not one whom it would have been agreeable to meet alone in a dark alley of all those foreheads not one achieved a height of more than one point nought four inches a sinister collection indeed and one which agravaine felt should have been capable of handling without his assistance any dragon that ever came into the world to stimulate the asbestos industry  he was roused from his reflections by the voice of his host  i hope you are not tired after your journey sir agravaine my little girl did not bore you i trust we are very quiet folk here country mice but we must try to make your visit interesting  agravaine felt that the dragon might be counted upon to do that he said as much  ah yes the dragon said earl dorm i was forgetting the dragon i want to have a long talk with you about that dragon not now later on  his eye caught agravaines and he smiled that weak cunning smile of his and for the first time the knight was conscious of a curious feeling that all was not square and aboveboard in this castle a conviction began to steal over him that in some way he was being played with that some game was afoot which he did not understand thatin a wordthere was dirty work at the crossroads  there was a touch of mystery in the atmosphere which made him vaguely uneasy when a fiery dragon is ravaging the countryside to such an extent that the sos call has been sent out to the round table a knight has a right to expect the monster to be the main theme of conversation the tendency on his hosts part was apparently to avoid touching on the subject at all he was vague and elusive and the one topic on which an honest man is not vague and elusive is that of fiery dragons it was not right it was as if one should phone for the police and engage them on arrival in a discussion on the days football results  a wave of distrust swept over agravaine he had heard stories of robber chiefs who lured strangers into their strongholds and then held them prisoners while the public nervously dodged their anxious friends who had formed subscription lists to make up the ransom could this be such a case the man certainly had an evasive manner and a smile which would have justified any jury in returning a verdict without leaving the box on the other hand there was yvonne his reason revolted against the idea of that sweet girl being a party to any such conspiracy  no probably it was only the earls unfortunate manner perhaps he suffered from some muscular weakness of the face which made him smile like that  nevertheless he certainly wished that he had not allowed himself to be deprived of his sword and armour at the time it had seemed to him that the earls remark that the latter needed polishing and the former stropping betrayed only a kindly consideration for his guests wellbeing now it had the aspect of being part of a carefullyconstructed plot  on the other handhere philosophy came to his rescueif anybody did mean to start anything his sword and armour might just as well not be there any one of those mammoth lowbrows at the door could eat him armour and all  he resumed his meal uneasy but resigned  dinner at earl dorms was no lunchcounter scuffle it started early and finished late it was not till an advanced hour that agravaine was conducted to his room  the room which had been allotted to him was high up in the eastern tower it was a nice room but to one in agravaines state of suppressed suspicion a trifle too solidly upholstered the door was of the thickest oak studded with iron nails iron bars formed a neat pattern across the only window  hardly had agravaine observed these things when the door opened and before him stood the damsel yvonne pale of face and panting for breath  she leaned against the doorpost and gulped  fly she whispered  reader if you had come to spend the night in the lonely castle of a perfect stranger with a shifty eye and a rogues gallery smile and on retiring to your room had found the door kickproof and the window barred and if immediately after your discovery of these phenomena a whitefaced young lady had plunged in upon you and urged you to immediate flight wouldnt that jar you  it jarred agravaine  eh he cried  fly fly sir knight  another footstep sounded in the passage the damsel gave a startled look over her shoulder  and whats all this  earl dorm appeared in the dimlit corridor his voice had a nasty tinkle in it  youryour daughter said agravaine hurriedly was just telling me that breakfast would  the sentence remained unfinished a sudden movement of the earls hand and the great door banged in his face there came the sound of a bolt shooting into its socket a key turned in the lock he was trapped  outside the earl had seized his daughter by the wrist and was administering a paternal crossexamination  what were you saying to him  yvonne did not flinch  i was bidding him fly  if he wants to leave this castle said the earl grimly hell have to  father said yvonne i cant  cant what  i cant  his grip on her wrist tightened from the other side of the door came the muffled sound of blows on the solid oak oh said earl dorm you cant eh well listen to me youve got to do you understand i admit he might be betterlooking but  father i love him  he released her wrist and stared at her in the uncertain light  you love him  yes  then what why well i never did understand women he said at last and stumped off down the passage  while this cryptic conversation was in progress agravaine his worst apprehensions realized was trying to batter down the door after a few moments however he realized the futility of his efforts and sat down on the bed to think  at the risk of forfeiting the readers respect it must be admitted that his first emotion was one of profound relief if he was locked up like this it must mean that that dragon story was fictitious and that all danger was at an end of having to pit his inexperience against a ravening monster who had spent a lifetime devouring knights he had never liked the prospect though he had been prepared to go through with it and to feel that it was definitely cancelled made up for a good deal  his mind next turned to his immediate future what were they going to do with him on this point he felt tolerably comfortable this imprisonment could mean nothing more than that he would be compelled to disgorge a ransom this did not trouble him he was rich and now that the situation had been switched to a purely business basis he felt that he could handle it  in any case there was nothing to be gained by sitting up so he went to bed like a good philosopher  the sun was pouring through the barred window when he was awoken by the entrance of a gigantic figure bearing food and drink  he recognized him as one of the scurvy knaves who had dined at the bottom of the room the night beforea vast beetlebrowed fellow with a squint a mop of red hair and a genius for silence to agravaines attempts to engage him in conversation he replied only with grunts and in a short time left the room closing and locking the door behind him  he was succeeded at dusk by another of about the same size and ugliness and with even less conversational elan this one did not even grunt  smalltalk it seemed was not an art cultivated in any great measure by the lower orders in the employment of earl dorm  the next day passed without incident in the morning the strabismic plugugly with the red hair brought him food and drink while in the evening the nongrunter did the honours it was a peaceful life but tending towards monotony and agravaine was soon in the frame of mind which welcomes any break in the daily round  he was fortunate enough to get it  he had composed himself for sleep that night and was just dropping comfortably off when from the other side of the door he heard the sound of angry voices  it was enough to arouse him on the previous night silence had reigned evidently something out of the ordinary was taking place  he listened intently and distinguished words  who was it i did see thee coming down the road with  who was it thou didst see me coming down the road with  aye who was it i did see thee coming down the road with  who dost thou think thou art  who do i think that i am  aye who dost thou think thou art  agravaine could make nothing of it as a matter of fact he was hearing the first genuine crosstalk that had ever occurred in those dim premusichall days in years to come dialogue on these lines was to be popular throughout the length and breadth of great britain but till then it had been unknown  the voices grew angrier to an initiated listener it would have been plain that in a short while words would be found inadequate and the dagger that medieval forerunner of the slapstick brought into play but to agravaine all inexperienced it came as a surprise when suddenly with a muffled thud two bodies fell against the door there was a scuffling noise some groans and then silence  and then with amazement he heard the bolt shoot back and a key grate in the keyhole  the door swung open it was dark outside but agravaine could distinguish a female form and beyond a shapeless mass which he took correctly to be the remains of the two pluguglies  it is i yvonne said a voice  what is it what has been happening  it was i i set them against each other they both loved one of the kitchenmaids i made them jealous i told walt privily that she had favoured dickon and dickon privily that she loved walt and now  she glanced at the shapeless heap and shuddered agravaine nodded  no weddingbells for her he said reverently  and i dont care i did it to save you but come we are wasting time come i will help you to escape  a man who has been shut up for two days in a small room is seldom slow off the mark when a chance presents itself of taking exercise agravaine followed without a word and together they crept down the dark staircase until they had reached the main hall from somewhere in the distance came the rhythmic snores of scurvy knaves getting their eight hours  softly yvonne unbolted a small door and passing through it agravaine found himself looking up at the stars while the great walls of the castle towered above him  goodbye said yvonne  there was a pause for the first time agravaine found himself examining the exact position of affairs after his sojourn in the guarded room freedom looked very good to him but freedom meant parting from yvonne  he looked at the sky and he looked at the castle walls and he took a step back towards the door  im not so sure i want to go he said  oh fly fly sir knight she cried  you dont understand said agravaine i dont want to seem to be saying anything that might be interpreted as in the least derogatory to your father in any way whatever but without prejudice surely he is just a plain ordinary brigand i mean its only a question of a ransom and i dont in the least object  no no no her voice trembled he would ask no ransom  dont tell me he kidnaps people just as a hobby  you dont understand heno i cannot tell you fly  what dont i understand  she was silent then she began to speak rapidly very well i will tell you listen my father had six children all daughters we were poor we had to stay buried in this outoftheway spot we saw no one it seemed impossible that any of us should ever marry my father was in despair then he said if we cannot get to town the town must come to us so he sent my sister yseult to camelot to ask the king to let us have a knight to protect us against a giant with three heads there was no giant but she got the knight it was sir sagramore perhaps you knew him  agravaine nodded he began to see daylight  my sister yseult was very beautiful after the first day sir sagramore forgot all about the giant and seemed to want to do nothing else except have yseult show him how to play cats cradle they were married two months later and my father sent my sister elaine to camelot to ask for a knight to protect us against a wild unicorn  and who bit asked agravaine deeply interested  sir malibran of devon they were married within three weeks and my fatheri cant go on you understand now  i understand the main idea said agravaine but in my case  you were to marry me said yvonne her voice was quiet and cold but she was quivering  agravaine was conscious of a dull heavy weight pressing on his heart he had known his love was hopeless but even hopelessness is the better for being indefinite he understood now  and you naturally want to get rid of me before it can happen he said i dont wonder im not vain well ill go i knew i had no chance goodbye  he turned she stopped him with a sharp cry  what do you mean you cannot wish to stay now i am saving you  saving me i have loved you since the moment you entered the hall at camelot said agravaine  she drew in her breath  youyou love me  they looked at each other in the starlight she held out her hands  agravaine  she drooped towards him and he gathered her into his arms for a novice he did it uncommonly well  it was about six months later that agravaine having ridden into the forest called upon a wise man at his cell  in those days almost anyone who was not a perfect bonehead could set up as a wise man and get away with it all you had to do was to live in a forest and grow a white beard this particular wise man for a wonder had a certain amount of rude sagacity he listened carefully to what the knight had to say  it has puzzled me to such an extent said agravaine that i felt that i must consult a specialist you see me take a good look at me what do you think of my personal appearance you neednt hesitate its worse than that i am the ugliest man in england  would you go as far as that said the wise man politely  farther and everybody else thinks so everybody except my wife she tells me that i am a model of manly beauty you know lancelot well she says i have lancelot whipped to a custard what do you make of that and heres another thing it is perfectly obvious to me that my wife is one of the most beautiful creatures in existence i have seen them all and i tell you that she stands alone she is literally marooned in class a all by herself yet she insists that she is plain what do you make of it  the wise man stroked his beard  my son he said the matter is simple true love takes no account of looks  no said agravaine  you two are affinities therefore to you the outward aspect is nothing put it like this love is a thingummybob who whatdyoucallits  im beginning to see said agravaine  what i meant was this love is a wizard greater than merlin he plays odd tricks with the eyesight  yes said agravaine  or put it another way love is a sculptor greater than praxiteles he takes an unsightly piece of clay and moulds it into a thing divine  i get you said agravaine  the wise man began to warm to his work  or shall we say  i think i must be going said agravaine i promised my wife i would be back early  we might put it began the wise man perseveringly  i understand said agravaine hurriedly i quite see now goodbye  the wise man sighed resignedly  goodbye sir knight he said goodbye pay at ye desk  and agravaine rode on his way marvelling     the goalkeeper and the plutocrat   the main difficulty in writing a story is to convey to the reader clearly yet tersely the natures and dispositions of ones leading characters brevity brevitythat is the cry perhaps after all the playbill style is the best in this drama of love football association code and politics then the principals are as follows in their order of entry  isabel rackstraw an angel  the hon clarence tresillian a greek god  lady runnymede a proud old aristocrat  mr rackstraw a multimillionaire city man and radical politician  more about clarence later for the moment let him go as a greek god there were other sides too to mr rackstraws character but for the moment let him go as a multimillionaire city man and radical politician not that it is satisfactory it is too mild the radical politics of other radical politicians were as skimmilk to the radical politics of radical politician rackstraw where mr lloyd george referred to the house of lords as blithering backwoodsmen and asinine anachronisms mr rackstraw scorned to be so guarded in his speech he did not mince his words his attitude towards a member of the peerage was that of the terrier to the perambulating cat  it was at a charity bazaar that isabel and clarence first met isabel was presiding over the billiken teddybear and fancy goods stall there she stood that slim radiant girl bouncing ardent youth out of its fathers hardearned with a smile that alone was nearly worth the money when she observed approaching the handsomest man she had ever seen it wasthis is not one of those mystery storiesit was clarence tresillian over the heads of the bevy of gilded youths who clustered round the stall their eyes met a thrill ran through isabel she dropped her eyes the next moment clarence had made his spring the gilded youths had shredded away like a mist and he was leaning towards her opening negotiations for the purchase of a yellow teddybear at sixteen times its face value  he returned at intervals during the afternoon over the second teddybear they became friendly over the third intimate he proposed as she was wrapping up the fourth golliwog and she gave him her heart and the parcel simultaneously at six oclock carrying four teddybears seven photograph frames five golliwogs and a billiken clarence went home to tell the news to his parents  clarence when not at the university lived with his father and mother in belgrave square his mother had been a miss trotter of chicago and it was on her dowry that the runnymedes contrived to make both ends meet for a noble family they were in somewhat straitened circumstances financially they lived simply and without envy of their rich fellowcitizens on their hundred thousand pounds a year they asked no more it enabled them to entertain on a modest scale clarence had been able to go to oxford his elder brother lord staines into the guards the girls could buy an occasional new frock on the whole they were a thoroughly happy contented english family of the best sort mr trotter it is true was something of a drawback he was a rugged old tainted millionaire of the old school with a fondness for shirtsleeves and a tendency to give undue publicity to toothpicks but he had been made to understand at an early date that the deadline for him was the farther shore of the atlantic ocean and he now gave little trouble  having dressed for dinner clarence proceeded to the library where he found his mother in hysterics and his father in a state of collapse on the sofa clarence was too wellbred to make any comment a true runnymede he affected to notice nothing and picking up the evening paper began to read the announcement of his engagement could be postponed to a more suitable time  clarence whispered a voice from the sofa  yes father  the silverhaired old man gasped for utterance  ive lost my little veto he said brokenly at length  where did you see it last asked clarence ever practical  its that fellow rackstraw cried the old man in feeble rage that bounder rackstraw hes the man behind it all the robber  clarence  it was his mother who spoke her voice seemed to rip the air into a million shreds and stamp on them there are few things more terrible than a chicago voice raised in excitement or anguish  mother  never mind your pop and his old veto he didnt know he had one till the paper said hed lost it you listen to me clarence we are ruined  clarence looked at her inquiringly  ruined much he asked  bedrock said his mother if we have sixty thousand dollars a year after this its all we shall have  a low howl escaped from the stricken old man on the sofa  clarence betrayed no emotion  ah he said calmly how did it happen  ive just had a cable from chicago from your grandpop hes been trying to corner wheat he always was an impulsive old gazook  but surely said clarence a dim recollection of something he had heard or read somewhere coming to him isnt cornering wheat a rather profitable process  sure said his mother sure it is i guess dads try at cornering wheat was about the most profitable thing that ever happenedto the other fellows it seems like they got busy and clubbed fiftyseven varieties of hades out of your old grandpop hes got to give up a lot of his expensive habits and one of them is sending money to us thats how it is  and on top of that mind you moaned lord runnymede i lose my little veto its bitterbitter  clarence lit a cigarette and drew at it thoughtfully i dont see how were going to manage on twelve thousand quid a year he said  his mother crisply revised his pronouns  we arent she said youve got to get out and hustle  clarence looked at her blankly  me  you  work  work  clarence drew a deep breath  work well of course mind you fellows do work he went on thoughtfully i was lunching with a man at the bachelors only yesterday who swore he knew a fellow who had met a man whose cousin worked but i dont see what i could do dont you know  his father raised himself on the sofa  havent i given you the education of an english gentleman  thats the difficulty said clarence  cant you do anything asked his mother  well i can play footer by jove ill sign on as a pro ill take a new name ill call myself jones i can get signed on in a minute any club will jump at me  this was no idle boast since early childhood clarence had concentrated his energies on becoming a footballer and was now an exceedingly fine goalkeeper it was a pleasing sight to see him poised on one foot in the attitude of a salome dancer with one eye on the man with the ball the other gazing coldly on the rest of the opposition forward line uncurl abruptly like the mainspring of a watch and stop a hot one clarence in goal was the nearest approach to an indiarubber acrobat and society contortionist to be seen off the musichall stage he was in brief hot stuff he had the goods  scarcely had he uttered these momentous words when the butler entered with the announcement that he was wanted by a lady on the telephone  it was isabel disturbed and fearful  oh clarence she cried my precious angel wonderchild i dont know how to begin  begin just like that said clarence approvingly its topping you cant beat it  clarence a terrible thing has happened i told papa of our engagement and he wouldnt hear of it he ccalled you a a ppp  a what  a prprpr  hes wrong im nothing of the sort he must be thinking of someone else  a preposterous excrescence on the social cosmos he doesnt like your father being an earl  a man may be an earl and still a gentleman said clarence not without a touch of coldness in his voice  i forgot to tell him that but i dont think it would make any difference he says i shall only marry a man who works  i am going to work dearest said clarence i am going to work like a horse somethingi know not whattells me i shall be rather good at work and one day when i  goodbye said isabel hastily i hear papa coming                                       clarence as he had predicted found no difficulty in obtaining employment he was signed on at once under the name of jones by houndsditch wednesday the premier metropolitan club and embarked at once on his new career  the season during which clarence tresillian kept goal for houndsditch wednesday is destined to live long in the memory of followers of professional football probably never in the history of the game has there been such persistent and widespread mortality among the more distant relatives of officeboys and junior clerks statisticians have estimated that if all the grandmothers alone who perished between the months of september and april that season could have been placed end to end they would have reached from hyde park corner to the outskirts of manchester and it was clarence who was responsible for this holocaust previous to the opening of the season sceptics had shaken their heads over the wednesdays chances in the first league other clubs had bought up the best men in the market leaving only a mixed assortment of inferior scotsmen irishmen and northcountrymen to uphold the honour of the london club  and then like a meteor clarence tresillian had flashed upon the world of football in the opening game he had behaved in the goalmouth like a chinese cracker and exhibited an absolutely impassable defence and from then onward except for an occasional check houndsditch wednesday had never looked back  among the spectators who flocked to the houndsditch ground to watch clarence perform there appeared week after week a little grey driedup man insignificant except for a certain happy choice of language in moments of emotion and an enthusiasm far surpassing that of the ordinary spectator to the trained eye there are subtle distinctions between football enthusiasts this man belonged to the comparatively small class of those who have football on the cerebrum  fate had made daniel rackstraw a millionaire and a radical but at heart he was a spectator of football he never missed a match his library of football literature was the finest in the country his football museum had but one equal that of mr jacob dodson of manchester between them the two had cornered at enormous expense the curio market of the game it was rackstraw who had secured the authentic pair of boots in which bloomer had first played for england but it was dodson who possessed the painted indiarubber ball used by meredith when a boyprobably the first thing except a nurse ever kicked by that talented foot the two men were friends as far as rival connoisseurs can be friends and mr dodson when at leisure would frequently pay a visit to mr rackstraws country house where he would spend hours gazing wistfully at the bloomer boots buoyed up only by the thoughts of the meredith ball at home  isabel saw little of clarence during the winter months except from a distance she contented herself with clipping photographs of him from the sporting papers each was a little more unlike him than the last and this lent variety to the collection her father marked her newborn enthusiasm for the game with approval it had been secretly a great grief to the old gentleman that his only child did not know the difference between a linesman and an inside right and more did not seem to care to know he felt himself drawn closer to her an understanding as pleasant as it was new and strange began to spring up between parent and child  as for clarence how easy it would be to haul up ones slacks to practically an unlimited extent on the subject of his emotions at this time one can figure him after the game is over and the gay throng has dispersed creeping moodilybut whats the use brevitythat is the cry brevity let us on  the months sped by the cupties began and soon it was evident that the final must be fought out between houndsditch wednesday and mr jacob dodsons pet team manchester united with each match the wednesday seemed to improve clarence was a gibraltar among goalkeepers  those were delirious days for daniel rackstraw long before the fourth round his voice had dwindled to a husky whisper deep lines appeared on his forehead for it is an awful thing for a football enthusiast to be compelled to applaud in the very middle of the cupties purely by means of facial expression in this time of affliction he found isabel an everincreasing comfort to him side by side they would sit and the old mans face would lose its drawn look and light up as her clear young soprano pealed out over the din urging this player to shoot that to kick some opponent in the face or describing the referee in no uncertain terms as a reincarnation of the late mr dick turpin  and now the day of the final at the crystal palace approached and all england was alert confident of a recordbreaking contest but alas how truly does epictetus observe we know not what awaiteth us round the corner and the hand that counteth its chickens ere they be hatched ofttimes doth but step on the bananaskin the prophets who anticipated a struggle keener than any in football history were destined to be proved false  it was not that their judgement of form was at fault on the run of the seasons play houndsditch wednesday v manchester united should have been the two most evenlymatched teams in the history of the game forward the latter held a slight superiority but this was balanced by the inspired goalkeeping of clarence tresillian even the keenest supporters of either side were not confident they argued at length figuring out the odds with the aid of stubs of pencils and the backs of envelopes but they were not confident out of all those frenzied millions two men alone had no doubts mr daniel rackstraw said that he did not desire to be unfair to manchester united he wished it to be clearly understood that in their own class manchester united might quite possibly show to considerable advantage in some rural league for instance he did not deny that they might sweep all before them but when it came to competing with houndsditch wednesdayhere words failed mr rackstraw  mr jacob dodson interviewed by the manchester weekly football boot stated that his decision arrived at after a close and careful study of the work of both teams was that houndsditch wednesday had rather less chance in the forthcoming tourney than a stuffed rat in the battersea dogs home it was his carefullyconsidered opinion that in a contest with the second eleven of a village church lads brigade houndsditch wednesday might with an effort conceding them that slice of luck which so often turns the tide of a game scrape home but when it was a question of meeting a team like manchester unitedhere mr dodson shrugging his shoulders despairingly sank back in his chair and watchful secretaries brought him round with oxygen  throughout the whole country nothing but the approaching match was discussed wherever civilization reigned and in portions of liverpool one question alone was on every lip who would win octogenarians mumbled it infants lisped it tired city men trampled under foot in the rush for their tram asked it of the ambulance attendants who carried them to the hospital  and then one bright clear morning when the birds sang and all nature seemed fair and gay clarence tresillian developed mumps  london was in a ferment i could have wished to go into details to describe in crisp burning sentences the panic that swept like a tornado through a million homes a little encouragement the slightest softening of the editorial austerity and the thing would have been done but no brevity that was the cry brevity let us on  houndsditch wednesday met manchester united at the crystal palace and for nearly two hours the sweat of agony trickled unceasingly down the corrugated foreheads of the patriots in the stands the men from manchester freed from the fear of clarence smiled grim smiles and proceeded to pile up points it was in vain that the houndsditch backs and halfbacks skimmed like swallows about the field they could not keep the score down from start to finish houndsditch were a beaten side  london during that black period was a desert gloom gripped the city in distant brixton redeyed wives faced silentlyscowling husbands at the evening meal and the children were sent early to bed newsboys called the extras in a whisper  few took the tragedy more nearly to heart than daniel rackstraw leaving the ground with the air of a father mourning over some prodigal son he encountered mr jacob dodson of manchester  now mr dodson was perhaps the slightest bit shy on the finer feelings he should have respected the grief of a fallen foe he should have abstained from exulting but he was in too exhilarated a condition to be magnanimous sighting mr rackstraw he addressed himself joyously to the task of rubbing the thing in mr rackstraw listened in silent anguish  if we had had jones he said at length  thats what they all say whooped mr dodson jones whos jones  if we had had jones we should have he paused an idea had flashed upon his overwrought mind dodson he said look here wait till jones is well again and let us play this thing off again for anything you like a side in my private park  mr dodson reflected  youre on he said what side bet a million two million three  mr rackstraw shook his head scornfully  a million who wants a million ill put up my bloomer boot against your meredith ball does that go  i should say it did said mr dodson joyfully ive been wanting that boot for years its like finding it in ones christmas stocking  very well said mr rackstraw then lets get it fixed up  honestly it is but a dogs life that of the shortstory writer i particularly wished at this point to introduce a description of mr rackstraws country house and estate featuring the private football ground with its fringe of noble trees it would have served a double purpose not only charming the lover of nature but acting as a fine stimulus to the youth of the country showing them the sort of home they would be able to buy some day if they worked hard and saved their money but no you shall have three guesses as to what was the cry you give it up it was brevitybrevity let us on  the two teams arrived at mr rackstraws house in time for lunch clarence his features once more reduced to their customary finelychiselled proportions alighted from the automobile with a swelling heart presently he found an opportunity to slip away and meet isabel i will pass lightly over the meeting of the two lovers i will not describe the dewy softness of their eyes the catching of their breath their murmured endearments i could mind you it is at just such descriptions that i am particularly happy but i have grown discouraged my spirit is broken it is enough to say that clarence had reached a level of emotional eloquence rarely met with among goalkeepers of the first league when isabel broke from him with a startled exclamation and vanished and looking over his shoulder clarence observed mr daniel rackstraw moving towards him  it was evident from the millionaires demeanour that he had seen nothing the look on his face was anxious but not wrathful he sighted clarence and hurried up to him  jones he said ive been looking for you i want a word with you  a thousand if you wish it said clarence courteously  now look here said mr rackstraw i want to explain to you just what this game means to me dont run away with the idea ive had you fellows down to play an exhibition game just to keep me merry and bright if houndsditch wins today k means that i shall be able to hold up my head again and look my fellowman in the face instead of crawling round on my stomach and feeling like a blackbeetle under a steamroller do you get that  i do replied clarence  and not only that went on the millionaire theres more i have put up my bloomer boot against mr dodsons meredith hall as a side bet you understand what that means it means that either you win or my life is soured for ever see  i have got you said clarence  good then what i wanted to say was this today is your day for keeping goal as youve never kept goal before everything depends on you with you keeping goal like mother used to make it houndsditch are safe otherwise they are completely in the bouillon its one thing or the other its all up to you win and theres four thousand pounds waiting for you above what you share with the others  clarence waved his hand deprecatingly  mr rackstraw he said keep your dross i care nothing for money all i ask of you proceeded clarence is your consent to my engagement to your daughter  mr rackstraw looked sharply at him  repeat that he said i dont think i quite got it  all i ask is your consent to my engagement to your daughter  young man said mr rackstraw not without a touch of admiration i admire cheek but there is a limit that limit you have passed so far that youd need to look for it with a telescope  you refuse your consent  i never said you werent a clever guesser  why  mr rackstraw laughed one of those nasty sharp metallic laughs that hit you like a bullet  how would you support my daughter  i was thinking that you would help to some extent  you were were you  i was  oh  mr rackstraw emitted another of those laughs  well he said its off you can take that as coming from an authoritative source no weddingbells for you  clarence drew himself up fire flashing from his eyes and a bitter smile curving his expressive lips  and no meredith ball for you he cried  mr rackstraw started as if some strong hand had plunged an auger into him  what he shouted  clarence shrugged his superblymodelled shoulders in silence  come come said mr rackstraw you wouldnt let a little private difference like that influence you in a really important thing like this football match would you  i would  you would practically blackmail the father of the girl you love  every time  her whitehaired old father  the colour of his hair would not affect me  nothing would move you  nothing  then by george youre just the soninlaw i want you shall marry isabel and ill take you into partnership in my business this very day ive been looking for a good ablebodied bandit like you for years you make captain kidd look like a preliminary threeround bout my boy well be the greatest combination you and i that the city has ever seen shake hands  for a moment clarence hesitated then his better nature prevailed and he spoke  mr rackstraw he said i cannot deceive you  that wont matter said the enthusiastic old man i bet youll be able to deceive everybody else i see it in your eye my boy well be the greatest  my name is not jones  nor is mine what does that matter  my name is tresillian the hon tresillian i am the younger son of the earl of runnymede to a man of your political views  nonsense nonsense said mr rackstraw what are political views compared with the chance of getting a goalkeeper like you into the family i remember isabel saying something to me about you but i didnt know who you were then  i am a preposterous excrescence on the social cosmos said clarence eyeing him doubtfully  then ill be one too cried mr rackstraw i own ive set my face against it hitherto but circumstances alter cases ill ring up the prime minister on the phone tomorrow and buy a title myself  clarences last scruple was removed silently he gripped the old mans hand outstretched to meet his  little remains to be said but i am going to say it if it snows i am at my best in these tender scenes of idyllic domesticity  four years have passed once more we are in the rackstraw home a lady is coming down the stairs leading by the hand her little son it is isabel the years have dealt lightly with her she is still the same stately beautiful creature whom i would have described in detail long ago if i had been given half a chance at the foot of the stairs the child stops and points at a small round object in a glass case  wah he says  that said isabel that is the ball mr meredith used to play with when he was a little boy  she looks at a door on the left of the hall and puts a finger to her lip  hush she says we must be quiet daddy and grandpa are busy in there cornering wheat  and softly mother and child go out into the sunlit garden     in alcala   in alcala as in most of new yorks apartment houses the schedule of prices is like a badly rolled cigarettethick in the middle and thin at both ends the rooms halfway up are expensive some of them almost as expensive as if fashion instead of being gone for ever were still lingering the top rooms are cheap the groundfloor rooms cheaper still  cheapest of all was the hallbedroom its furniture was of the simplest it consisted of a chair another chair a worn carpet and a foldingbed the foldingbed had an air of depression and baffled hopes for years it had been trying to look like a bookcase in the daytime and now it looked more like a foldingbed than ever there was also a plain deal table much stained with ink at this night after night sometimes far into the morning rutherford maxwell would sit and write stories now and then it happened that one would be a good story and find a market  rutherford maxwell was an englishman and the younger son of an englishman and his lot was the lot of the younger sons all the world over he was by profession one of the numerous employees of the new asiatic bank which has its branches all over the world it is a sound trustworthy institution and steadygoing relatives would assure rutherford that he was lucky to have got a berth in it rutherford did not agree with them however sound and trustworthy it was not exactly romantic nor did it err on the side of overlavishness to those who served it rutherfords salary was small so were his prospectsif he remained in the bank at a very early date he had registered a vow that he would not and the road that led out of it for him was the uphill road of literature  he was thankful for small mercies fate had not been overkind up to the present but at least she had dispatched him to new york the centre of things where he would have the chance to try instead of to some spot off the map whether he won or lost at any rate he was in the ring and could fight so every night he sat in alcala and wrote sometimes he would only try to write and that was torture  there is never an hour of the day or night when alcala is wholly asleep the middle of the house is a sort of chorusgirl belt while in the upper rooms there are reporters and other nightbirds long after he had gone to bed rutherford would hear footsteps passing his door and the sound of voices in the passage he grew to welcome them they seemed to connect him with the outer world but for them he was alone after he had left the office utterly alone as it is possible to be only in the heart of a great city some nights he would hear scraps of conversations at rare intervals a name he used to build up in his mind identities for the owners of the names one in particular peggy gave him much food for thought he pictured her as bright and vivacious this was because she sang sometimes as she passed his door she had been singing when he first heard her name oh cut it out peggy a girls voice had said dont you get enough of that tune at the theatre he felt that he would like to meet peggy  june came and july making an oven of new york bringing close scorching days and nights when the pen seemed made of lead and still rutherford worked on sipping icewater in his shirtsleeves and filling the sheets of paper slowly but with a dogged persistence which the weather could not kill despite the heat he was cheerful things were beginning to run his way a little now a novelette an airy trifle conceived in days when the thermometer was lower and it was possible to think and worked out almost mechanically had been accepted by a magazine of a higher standing than those which hitherto had shown him hospitality he began to dream of a holiday in the woods the holiday spirit was abroad alcala was emptying itself it would not be long before he too would be able to get away  he was so deep in his thoughts that at first he did not hear the knocking at the door but it was a sharp insistent knocking and forced itself upon his attention he got up and turned the handle  outside in the passage was standing a girl tall and sleepyeyed she wore a picturehat and a costume the keynote of which was a certain aggressive attractiveness there was no room for doubt as to which particular brand of scent was her favourite at the moment  she gazed at rutherford dully like banquos ghost she had no speculation in her eyes rutherford looked at her inquiringly somewhat conscious of his shirtsleeves  did you knock he said opening as a man must do with the inevitable foolish question  the apparition spoke  say she said got a cigarette  im afraid i havent said rutherford apologetically ive been smoking a pipe im very sorry  what said the apparition  im afraid i havent  oh a pause say got a cigarette  the intellectual pressure of the conversation was beginning to be a little too much for rutherford combined with the heat of the night it made his head swim  his visitor advanced into the room arriving at the table she began fiddling with its contents the pen seemed to fascinate her she picked it up and inspected it closely  say what dyou call this she said  thats a pen said rutherford soothingly a fountainpen  oh a pause say got a cigarette  rutherford clutched a chair with one hand and his forehead with the other he was in sore straits  at this moment rescue arrived not before it was needed a brisk sound of footsteps in the passage and there appeared in the doorway a second girl  what do you think youre doing gladys demanded the newcomer you mustnt come butting into folks rooms this way whos your friend  my name is maxwell began rutherford eagerly  what say peggy said the seeker after cigarettes dropping a sheet of manuscript to the floor  rutherford looked at the girl in the doorway with interest so this was peggy she was little and trim of figure that was how he had always imagined her her dress was simpler than the others the face beneath the picturehat was small and wellshaped the nose delicately tiptilted the chin determined the mouth a little wide and suggesting goodhumour a pair of grey eyes looked steadily into his before transferring themselves to the statuesque being at the table  dont monkey with the mans inkwell gladys come along up to bed  what say got a cigarette  theres plenty upstairs come along  the other went with perfect docility at the door she paused and inspected rutherford with a grave stare  good night boy she said with haughty condescension  good night said rutherford  pleased to have met you good night  good night said rutherford  good night  come along gladys said peggy firmly  gladys went  rutherford sat down and dabbed his forehead with his handkerchief feeling a little weak he was not used to visitors   2  he had lit his pipe and was rereading his nights work preparatory to turning in when there was another knock at the door this time there was no waiting he was in the state of mind when one hears the smallest noise  come in he cried  it was peggy  rutherford jumped to his feet  wont you he began pushing the chair forward  she seated herself with composure on the table she no longer wore the picturehat and rutherford looking at her came to the conclusion that the change was an improvement  thisll do for me she said thought id just look in im sorry about gladys she isnt often like that its the hot weather  it is hot said rutherford  youve noticed it bully for you back to the bench for sherlock holmes did gladys try to shoot herself  good heavens no why  she did once but i stole her gun and i suppose she hasnt thought to get another shes a good girl really only she gets like that sometimes in the hot weather she looked round the room for a moment then gazed unwinkingly at rutherford what did you say your name was she asked  rutherford maxwell  gee thats going some isnt it wants amputation a name like that i call it mean to give a poor defenceless kid a cussword likewhats it rutherford i got itto go through the world with havent you got something shortertom or charles or something  im afraid not  the round grey eyes fixed him again  i shall call you george she decided at last  thanks i wish you would said rutherford  george it is then you can call me peggy peggy nortons my name  thanks i will  say youre english arent you she said  yes how did you know  youre so strong

educational rail i knowabout your writing what were you writing  a story  for a paper  for a magazine  what one of the fiction stories about the gibson hero and the girl whose life he saved like you read  thats the idea  she looked at him with a new interest  gee george whod have thought it fancy you being one of the highbrows you ought to hang out a sign you look just ordinary  thanks  i mean as far as the grey matter goes i didnt mean you were a bad looker youre not youve got nice eyes george  thanks  i like the shape of your nose too  i say thanks  and your hairs just lovely  i say really thanks awfully  she eyed him in silence for a moment then she burst out  you say you dont like the bank  i certainly dont  and youd like to strike some paying line of business  sure  then why dont you make your fortune by hiring yourself out to a museum as the biggest human clam in captivity thats what you are you sit there just saying thanks and bai jawve thanks awflly while a girls telling you nice things about your eyes and hair and you dont do a thing  rutherford threw back his head and roared with laughter  im sorry he said slowness is our national failing you know  i believe you  tell me about yourself you know all about me by now what do you do besides brightening up the dull evenings of poor devils of bankclerks  give you three guesses  stage  gee youre the human sleuth all right

half a smile so that you shant feel you havent got your moneys worth good night george  good night peggy  she jumped down from the table her eye was caught by the photographs on the mantelpiece she began to examine them  who are these willies she said picking up a group  that is the football team of my old school the lout with the sheepish smirk holding the ball is myself as i was before the cares of the world soured me  her eye wandered along the mantelpiece and she swooped down on a cabinet photograph of a girl  and whos this george she cried  he took the photograph from her and replaced it with a curious blend of shyness and defiance in the very centre of the mantelpiece for a moment he stood looking intently at it his elbows resting on the imitation marble  who is it asked peggy wake up george whos this  rutherford started  sorry he said i was thinking about something  i bet you were you looked like it well who is she  eh oh thats a girl  peggy laughed satirically  thanks awflly as you would say ive got eyes george  i noticed that said rutherford smiling charming ones too  gee what would she say if she heard you talking like that  she came a step nearer looking up at him their eyes met  she would say said rutherford slowly i know you love me and i know i can trust you and i havent the slightest objection to your telling miss norton the truth about her eyes miss norton is a dear good little sort one of the best in fact and i hope youll be great pals  there was a silence  shed say that would she said peggy at last  she would  peggy looked at the photograph and back again at rutherford  youre pretty fond of her george i guess arent you  i am said rutherford quietly  george  yes  george shes a pretty good long way away isnt she  she looked up at him with a curious light in her grey eyes rutherford met her glance steadily  not to me he said shes here now and all the time  he stepped away and picked up the sheaf of papers which he had dropped at peggys entrance peggy laughed  good night georgie boy she said i mustnt keep you up any more or youll be late in the morning and what would the bank do then smash or something i guess good night georgie see you again one of these old evenings  good night peggy  the door closed behind her he heard her footsteps hesitate stop and then move quickly on once more   3  he saw much of her after this first visit gradually it became an understood thing between them that she should look in on her return from the theatre he grew to expect her and to feel restless when she was late once she brought the cigaretteloving gladys with her but the experiment was not a success gladys was languid and rather overpoweringly refined and conversation became forced after that peggy came alone  generally she found him working his industry amazed her  gee george she said one night sitting in her favourite place on the table from which he had moved a little pile of manuscript to make room for her dont you ever let up for a second seems to me you write all the time  rutherford laughed  ill take a rest he said when theres a bit more demand for my stuff than there is at present when im in the twentycentsaword class ill write once a month and spend the rest of my time travelling  peggy shook her head  no travelling for mine she said seems to me its just cussedness that makes people go away from broadway when theyve got plunks enough to stay there and enjoy themselves  do you like broadway peggy  do i like broadway does a kid like candy why dont you  its all right for the time its not my ideal  oh and what particular sort of little old paradise do you hanker after  he puffed at his pipe and looked dreamily at her through the smoke  way over in england peggy theres a county called worcestershire and somewhere near the edge of that theres a grey house with gables and theres a lawn and a meadow and a shrubbery and an orchard and a rosegarden and a big cedar on the terrace before you get to the rosegarden and if you climb to the top of that cedar you can see the river through the apple trees in the orchard and in the distance there are hills and  of all the rube joints exclaimed peggy in deep disgust why a day of that would be about twentythree hours and a bit too long for me broadway for mine put me where i can touch fortysecond street without overbalancing and then you can leave me i never thought you were such a hayseed george  dont worry peggy itll be a long time i expect before i go there ive got to make my fortune first  getting anywhere near the john d class yet  ive still some way to go but things are moving i think do you know peggy you remind me of a little billiken sitting on that table  thank you george i always knew my mouth was rather wide but i did think i had billiken to the bad do you do that sort of candid friend stunt with her she pointed to the photograph on the mantelpiece it was the first time since the night when they had met that she had made any allusion to it by silent agreement the subject had been ruled out between them by the way you never told me her name  halliday said rutherford shortly  what else  alice  dont bite at me george im not hurting you tell me about her im interested does she live in the grey house with the pigs and chickens and all them roses and the rest of the rube outfit  no  be chummy george whats the matter with you  im sorry peggy he said im a fool its only that it all seems so damned hopeless here am i earning about half a dollar a year andstill its no use kicking is it besides i may make a homerun with my writing one of these days thats what i meant when i said you were a billiken peggy do you know youve brought me luck ever since i met you ive been doing twice as well youre my mascot  bully for me weve all got our uses in the world havent we i wonder if it would help any if i was to kiss you george  dont you do it one mustnt work a mascot too hard  she jumped down and came across the room to where he sat looking down at him with the round grey eyes that always reminded him of a kittens  george  yes  oh nothing  she turned away to the mantelpiece and stood gazing at the photograph her back towards him  george  hullo  say what colour eyes has she got  grey  like mine  darker than yours  nicer than mine  dont you think we might talk about something else  she swung round her fists clenched her face blazing  i hate you she cried i do i wish id never seen you i wish  she leaned on the mantelpiece burying her face in her arms and burst into a passion of sobs rutherford leaped up shocked and helpless he sprang to her and placed a hand gently on her shoulder  peggy old girl  she broke from him  dont you touch me dont you do it gee i wish id never seen you  she ran to the door darted through and banged it behind her  rutherford remained where he stood motionless then almost mechanically he felt in his pocket for matches and relit his pipe  half an hour passed then the door opened slowly peggy came in she was pale and her eyes were red she smileda pathetic little smile  peggy  he took a step towards her  she held out her hand  im sorry george i feel mean  dear old girl what rot  i do you dont know how mean i feel youve been real nice to me george thought id look in and say i was sorry good night george  on the following night he waited but she did not come the nights went by and still she did not come and one morning reading his paper he saw that the island of girls had gone west to chicago   4  things were not running well for rutherford he had had his vacation a golden fortnight of fresh air and sunshine in the catskills and was back in alcala trying with poor success to pick up the threads of his work but though the indian summer had begun and there was energy in the air night after night he sat idle in his room night after night went wearily to bed oppressed with a dull sense of failure he could not work he was restless his thoughts would not concentrate themselves something was wrong and he knew what it was though he fought against admitting it to himself it was the absence of peggy that had brought about the change not till now had he realized to the full how greatly her visits had stimulated him he had called her laughingly his mascot but the thing was no joke it was true her absence was robbing him of the power to write  he was lonely for the first time since he had come to new york he was really lonely solitude had not hurt him till now in his black moments it had been enough for him to look up at the photograph on the mantelpiece and instantly he was alone no longer but now the photograph had lost its magic it could not hold him always his mind would wander back to the little blackhaired ghost that sat on the table smiling at him and questioning him with its grey eyes  and the days went by unvarying in their monotony and always the ghost sat on the table smiling at him  with the fall came the reopening of the theatres one by one the electric signs blazed out along broadway spreading the message that the dull days were over and new york was itself again at the melody where ages ago the island of girls had run its lighthearted course a new musical piece was in rehearsal alcala was full once more the nightly snatches of conversation outside his door had recommenced he listened for her voice but he never heard it  he sat up waiting into the small hours but she did not come once he had been trying to write and had fallen as usual to broodingthere was a soft knock at the door in an instant he had bounded from his chair and turned the handle it was one of the reporters from upstairs who had run out of matches rutherford gave him a handful the reporter went out wondering what the man had laughed at  there is balm in broadway especially by night depression vanishes before the cheerfulness of the great white way when the lights are lit and the human tide is in full flood rutherford had developed of late a habit of patrolling the neighbourhood of fortysecond street at theatretime he found it did him good there is a gaiety a bonhomie in the atmosphere of the new york streets rutherford loved to stand on the sidewalk and watch the passersby weaving stories round them  one night his wanderings had brought him to herald square the theatres were just emptying themselves this was the time he liked best he drew to one side to watch and as he moved he saw peggy  she was standing at the corner buttoning a glove he was by her side in an instant  peggy he cried  she was looking pale and tired but the colour came back to her cheeks as she held out her hand there was no trace of embarrassment in her manner only a frank pleasure at seeing him again  where have you been he said i couldnt think what had become of you  she looked at him curiously  did you miss me george  miss you of course i did my works been going all to pieces since you went away  i only came back last night im in the new piece at the madison gee im tired george weve been rehearsing all day  he took her by the arm  come along and have some supper you look worn out by jove peggy its good seeing you again can you walk as far as rectors or shall i carry you  guess i can walk that far but rectors has your rich uncle died and left you a fortune george  dont you worry peggy this is an occasion i thought i was never going to see you again ill buy you the whole hotel if you like  just supperll do i guess youre getting quite the rounder george  you bet i am there are all sorts of sides to my character youve never so much as dreamed of  they seemed to know peggy at rectors paul the head waiter beamed upon her paternally one or two men turned and looked after her as she passed the waiters smiled slight but friendly smiles rutherford intent on her noticed none of these things  despite her protests he ordered an elaborate and expensive supper he was particular about the wine the waiter who had been doubtful about him was won over and went off to execute the order reflecting that it was never safe to judge a man by his clothes and that rutherford was probably one of these eccentric young millionaires who didnt care how they dressed  well said peggy when he had finished  well said rutherford  youre looking brown george  ive been away in the catskills  still as strong on the rube proposition as ever  yes but broadway has its points too  oh youre beginning to see that gee im glad to be back ive had enough of the wild west if anybody ever tries to steer you west of eleventh avenue george dont you go theres nothing doing how have you been making out at your writing stunt  pretty well but i wanted you i was lost without my mascot ive got a story in this months wilsons a long story and paid accordingly thats why im able to go about giving suppers to great actresses  i read it on the train said peggy its dandy do you know what you ought to do george you ought to turn it into a play theres a heap of money in plays  i know but who wants a play by an unknown man  i know who would want willie in the wilderness if you made it into a play and thats winfield knight ever seen him  i saw him in the outsider hes clever  hes it if he gets a part to suit him if he doesnt he dont amount to a row of beans its just a gamble this thing hes in now is no good the part doesnt begin to fit him in a month hell be squealing for another play sos you can hear him in connecticut  he shall not squeal in vain said rutherford if he wants my work who am i that i should stand in the way of his simple pleasures ill start on the thing tomorrow  i can help you some too i guess i used to know winfield knight i can put you wise on lots of things about him thatll help you work up willies character sos itll fit him like a glove  rutherford raised his glass  peggy he said youre more than a mascot you ought to be drawing a big commission on everything i write it beats me how any of these other fellows ever write anything without you there to help them i wonder whats the most expensive cigar they keep here i must have it whatever it is noblesse oblige we popular playwrights mustnt be seen in public smoking any cheap stuff                                       it was rutherfords artistic temperament which when they left the restaurant made him hail a taxicab taxicabs are not for young men drawing infinitesimal salaries in banks even if those salaries are supplemented at rare intervals by a short story in a magazine peggy was for returning to alcala by car but rutherford refused to countenance such an anticlimax  peggy nestled into the corner of the cab with a tired sigh and there was silence as they moved smoothly up broadway  he peered at her in the dim light she looked very small and wistful and fragile suddenly an intense desire surged over him to pick her up and crush her to him he fought against it he tried to fix his thoughts on the girl at home to tell himself that he was a man of honour his fingers gripping the edge of the seat tightened till every muscle of his arm was rigid  the cab crossing a rough piece of road jolted peggy from her corner her hand fell on his  peggy he cried hoarsely  her grey eyes were wet he could see them glisten and then his arms were round her and he was covering her upturned face with kisses  the cab drew up at the entrance to alcala they alighted in silence and without a word made their way through into the hall from force of habit rutherford glanced at the letterrack on the wall at the foot of the stairs there was one letter in his pigeonhole  mechanically he drew it out and as his eyes fell on the handwriting something seemed to snap inside him  he looked at peggy standing on the bottom stair and back again at the envelope in his hand his mood was changing with a violence that left him physically weak he felt dazed as if he had wakened out of a trance  with a strong effort he mastered himself peggy had mounted a few steps and was looking back at him over her shoulder he could read the meaning now in the grey eyes  good night peggy he said in a low voice she turned facing him and for a moment neither moved  good night said rutherford again  her lips parted as if she were about to speak but she said nothing  then she turned again and began to walk slowly upstairs  he stood watching her till she had reached the top of the long flight she did not look back   5  peggys nightly visits began afresh after this and the ghost on the table troubled rutherford no more his restlessness left him he began to write with a new vigour and success in after years he wrote many plays most of them good clearcut pieces of work but none that came from him with the utter absence of labour which made the writing of willie in the wilderness a joy he wrote easily without effort and always peggy was there helping stimulating encouraging  sometimes when he came in after dinner to settle down to work he would find a piece of paper on his table covered with her schoolgirl scrawl it would run somewhat as follows  he is proud of his arms they are skinny but he thinks them the limit better put in a shirtsleeve scene for willie somewhere  he thinks he has a beautiful profile couldnt you make one of the girls say something about willie having the goods in that line  he is crazy about golf  he is proud of his french accent couldnt you make willie speak a little piece in french  he being winfield knight                                       and so little by little the character of willie grew till it ceased to be the willie of the magazine story and became winfield knight himself with improvements the task began to fascinate rutherford it was like planning a pleasant surprise for a child hell like that he would say to himself as he wrote in some speech enabling willie to display one of the accomplishments real or imagined of the absent actor peggy read it and approved it was she who suggested the big speech in the second act where willie described the progress of his love affair in terms of the golflinks from her too came information as to little traits in the mans character which the stranger would not have suspected  as the play progressed rutherford was amazed at the completeness of the character he had built it lived willie in the magazine story might have been anyone he fitted into the story but you could not see him he had no real individuality but willie in the play he felt that he would recognize him in the street there was all the difference between the two that there is between a nameless figure in some cheap picture and a portrait by sargent there were times when the story of the play seemed thin to him and the other characters wooden but in his blackest moods he was sure of willie all the contradictions in the character rang true the humour the pathos the surface vanity covering a real diffidence the strength and weakness fighting one another  youre alive my son said rutherford admiringly as he read the sheets but you dont belong to me  at last there came the day when the play was finished when the last line was written and the last possible alteration made and later the day when rutherford bearing the brownpapercovered package under his arm called at the players club to keep an appointment with winfield knight  almost from the first rutherford had a feeling that he had met the man before that he knew him as their acquaintance progressedthe actor was in an expansive mood and talked much before coming to businessthe feeling grew then he understood this was willie and no other the likeness was extraordinary little turns of thought little expressionsthey were all in the play  the actor paused in a description of how he had almost beaten a champion at golf and looked at the parcel  is that the play he said  yes said rutherford shall i read it  guess ill just look through it myself wheres act i here we are have a cigar while youre waiting  rutherford settled himself in his chair and watched the others face for the first few pages which contained some tame dialogue between minor characters it was blank  enter willie he said am i willie  i hope so said rutherford with a smile its the star part  hm  he went on reading rutherford watched him with furtive keenness there was a line coming at the bottom of the page which he was then reading which ought to hit him an epigram on golf a whimsical thought put almost exactly as he had put it himself five minutes back when telling his golf story  the shot did not miss fire the chuckle from the actor and the sigh of relief from rutherford were almost simultaneous winfield knight turned to him  thats a dandy line about golf said he  rutherford puffed complacently at his cigar  theres lots more of them in the piece he said  bully for you said the actor and went on reading  threequarters of an hour passed before he spoke again then he looked up  its me he said its me all the time i wish id seen this before i put on the punk im doing now this is me from the drive off the tee its great say whatll you have  rutherford leaned back in his chair his mind in a whirl he had arrived at last his struggles were over he would not admit of the possibility of the play being a failure he was a made man he could go where he pleased and do as he pleased  it gave him something of a shock to find how persistently his thoughts refused to remain in england try as he might to keep them there they kept flitting back to alcala   6  willie in the wilderness was not a failure it was a triumph principally it is true a personal triumph for winfield knight everyone was agreed that he had never had a part that suited him so well critics forgave the blunders of the piece for the sake of its principal character the play was a curiously amateurish thing it was only later that rutherford learned craft and caution when he wrote willie he was a colt rambling unchecked through the field of playwriting ignorant of its pitfalls but with all its faults willie in the wilderness was a success it might as one critic pointed out be more of a monologue act for winfield knight than a play but that did not affect rutherford  it was late on the opening night when he returned to alcala he had tried to get away earlier he wanted to see peggy but winfield knight flushed with success was in his most expansive mood he seized upon rutherford and would not let him go there was supper a gay uproarious supper at which everybody seemed to be congratulating everybody else men he had never met before shook him warmly by the hand somebody made a speech despite the efforts of the rest of the company to prevent him rutherford sat there dazed out of touch with the mood of the party he wanted peggy he was tired of all this excitement and noise he had had enough of it all he asked was to be allowed to slip away quietly and go home he wanted to think to try and realize what all this meant to him  at length the party broke up in one last explosion of handshaking and congratulations and eluding winfield knight who proposed to take him off to his club he started to walk up broadway  it was late when he reached alcala there was a light in his room peggy had waited up to hear the news  she jumped off the table as he came in  well she cried  rutherford sat down and stretched out his legs  its a success he said a tremendous success  peggy clapped her hands  bully for you george i knew it would be tell me all about it was winfield good  he was the whole piece there was nothing in it but him he rose and placed his hands on her shoulders peggy old girl i dont know what to say you know as well as i do that its all owing to you that the piece has been a success if i hadnt had your help  peggy laughed  oh beat it george she said dont you come jollying me i look like a highbrow playwright dont i no im real glad youve made a hit george but dont start handing out any story about its not being your own i didnt do a thing  you did you did everything  i didnt but say dont lets start quarrelling tell me more about it how many calls did you take  he told her all that had happened when he had finished there was a silence  i guess youll be quitting soon george said peggy at last now that youve made a homerun youll be going back to that rube joint with the cows and hensisnt that it  rutherford did not reply he was staring thoughtfully at the floor he did not seem to have heard  i guess that girlll be glad to see you she went on shall you cable tomorrow george and then youll get married and go and live in the rube house and become a regular hayseed and she broke off suddenly with a catch in her voice gee she whispered halt to herself ill be sorry when you go george  he sprang up  peggy  he seized her by the arm he heard the quick intake of her breath  peggy listen he gripped her till she winced with pain im not going back im never going back im a cad im a hound i know i am but im not going back im going to stay here with you i want you peggy do you hear i want you  she tried to draw herself away but he held her  i love you peggy peggy will you be my wife  there was utter astonishment in her grey eyes her face was very white  will you peggy  he dropped her arm  will you peggy  no she cried  he drew back  no she cried sharply as if it hurt her to speak i wouldnt play you such a mean trick im too fond of you george theres never been anybody just like you youve been mighty good to me ive never met a man who treated me like you youre the only real white man thats ever happened to me and i guess im not going to play you a lowdown trick like spoiling your life george i thought you knew honest i thought you knew how did you think i lived in a swell place like this if you didnt know how did you suppose everyone knew me at rectors how did you think id managed to find out so much about winfield knight cant you guess  she drew a long breath  i  he interrupted her hoarsely  is there anyone now peggy  yes she said there is  you dont love him peggy do you  love him she laughed bitterly no i dont love him  then come to me dear he said  she shook her head in silence rutherford sat down his chin resting in his hands she came across to him and smoothed his hair  it wouldnt do george she said honest it wouldnt do listen when we first met ii rather liked you george and i was mad at you for being so fond of the other girl and taking no notice of menot in the way i wanted and i triedgee i feel mean it was all my fault i didnt think it would matter there didnt seem no chance then of your being able to go back and have the sort of good time you wanted and i thought youd just stay here and wed be pals andbut now you can go back its all different i couldnt keep you it would be too mean you see you dont really want to stop you think you do but you dont  i love you he muttered  youll forget me its all just a broadway dream george think of it like that broadways got you now but you dont really belong youre not like me its not in your blood sos you cant get it out its the chickens and roses you want really just a broadway dream thats what it is george when i was a kid i remember crying and crying for a lump of candy in the window of a store till one of my brothers up and bought it for me just to stop the racket gee for about a minute i was the busiest thing that ever happened eating away and then it didnt seem to interest me no more broadways like that for you george you go back to the girl and the cows and all of it itll hurt some i guess but i reckon youll be glad you did  she stooped swiftly and kissed him on the forehead  ill miss you dear she said softly and was gone                                       rutherford sat on motionless outside the blackness changed to grey and the grey to white he got up he felt very stiff and cold  a broadway dream he muttered  he went to the mantelpiece and took up the photograph he carried it to the window where he could see it better  a shaft of sunlight pierced the curtains and fell upon it
