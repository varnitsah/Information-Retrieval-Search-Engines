here perfect to a wish we offer not a dish but just the platter a book thats not a book a pamphlet in the look but not the matter  i own in disarray as to the flowers of may the frosts of winter to my poetic rage the smallness of the page and of the printer    poem  iii    as seamen on the seas with song and dance descry adown the morning breeze an islet in the sky in araby the dry as oer the sandy plain the panting camels cry to smell the coming rain  so all things over earth a common law obey and rarity and worth pass arm in arm away and even so today the printer and the bard in pressless davos pray their sixpenny reward    poem  iv    the pamphlet here presented was planned and printed by a printer unindented a bard whom all decry  the author and the printer with various kinds of skill concocted it in winter at davos on the hill  they burned the nightly taper but now the work is ripe  observe the costly paper remark the perfect type     moral emblems i     poem  i    see how the children in the print bound on the book to see whats in t o like these pretty babes may you seize and apply this volume too and while your eye upon the cuts with harmless ardour opes and shuts reader may your immortal mind to their sage lessons not be blind    poem  ii     reader your soul upraise to see in yon fair cut designed by me the pauper by the highwayside vainly soliciting from pride mark how the beau with easy air contemns the anxious rustics prayer and casting a disdainful eye goes gaily gallivanting by he from the poor averts his head    he will regret it when hes dead    poem  iiia peak in darien    broadgazing on untrodden lands see where adventurous cortez stands while in the heavens above his head the eagle seeks its daily bread how aptly fact to fact replies heroes and eagles hills and skies ye who contemn the fatted slave look on this emblem and be brave    poem  iv    see in the print how moved by whim trumpeting jumbo great and grim adjusts his trunk like a cravat to noose that individuals hat the sacred ibis in the distance joys to observe his bold resistance    poem  v     mark printed on the opposing page the unfortunate effects of rage a man who might be you or me hurls another into the sea poor soul his unreflecting act his future joys will much contract and he will spoil his evening toddy by dwelling on that mangled body     moral emblems ii    poem  i    with storms aweather rocks alee the dancing skiff puts forth to sea the lone dissenter in the blast recoils before the sight aghast but she although the heavens be black holds on upon the starboard tack for why although today she sink still safe she sails in printers ink and though today the seamen drown my cut shall hand their memory down     poem  ii    the careful angler chose his nook at morning by the lilied brook and all the noon his rod he plied by that romantic riverside soon as the evening hours decline tranquilly hell return to dine and breathing forth a pious wish will cram his belly full of fish    poem  iii    the abbot for a walk went out a wealthy cleric very stout and robin has that abbot stuck as the red hunter spears the buck the djavel or the javelin has you observe gone bravely in and you may hear that weapon whack bang through the middle of his back hence we may learn that abbots should never go walking in a wood    poem  iv    the frozen peaks he once explored but now hes dead and by the board how better far at home to have stayed attended by the parlour maid and warmed his knees before the fire until the hour when folks retire so if you would be spared to friends do nothing but for business ends    poem  v    industrious pirate see him sweep the lonely bosom of the deep and daily the horizon scan from hatteras or matapan be sure before that pirates old he will have made a pot of gold and will retire from all his labours and be respected by his neighbours you also scan your lifes horizon for all that you can clap your eyes on     a martial elegy for some lead soldiers     for certain soldiers lately dead our reverent dirge shall here be said them when their martial leader called no dread preparative appalled but leadenhearted leadenheeled i marked them steadfast in the field death grimly sided with the foe and smote each leaden hero low proudly they perished one by one the dread peacannons work was done o not for them the tears we shed consigned to their congenial lead but while unmoved their sleep they take we mourn for their dear captains sake for their dear captain who shall smart both in his pocket and his heart who saw his heroes shed their gore and lacked a shilling to buy more     the graver the pen  or scenes from nature with appropriate verses     poem  iproem    unlike the common run of men i wield a double power to please and use the graver and the pen with equal aptitude and ease  i move with that illustrious crew the ambidextrous kings of art and every mortal thing i do brings ringing money in the mart  hence in the morning hour the mead the forest and the stream perceive me wandering as the muses lead  or back returning in the eve  two muses like two maiden aunts the engraving and the singing muse follow through all my favourite haunts my devious traces in the dews  to guide and cheer me each attends each speeds my rapid task along one to my cuts her ardour lends one breathes her magic in my song    poem  iithe precarious mill    alone above the stream it stands above the iron hill the topsyturvy tumbledown yet habitable mill  still as the ringing saws advance to slice the humming deal all day the pallid miller hears the thunder of the wheel  he hears the river plunge and roar as roars the angry mob he feels the solid building quake the trusty timbers throb  all night beside the fire he cowers he hears the rafters jar o why is he not in a proper house as decent people are  the floors are all aslant he sees the doors are all ajam and from the hook above his head all crooked swings the ham  alas he cries and shakes his head i see by every sign there soon all be the deuce to pay with this estate of mine    poem  iiithe disputatious pines    the first pine to the second said my leaves are black my branches red i stand upon this moor of mine a hoar unconquerable pine  the second sniffed and answered  pooh i am as good a pine as you  discourteous tree the first replied the tempest in my boughs had cried the hunter slumbered in my shade a hundred years ere you were made  the second smiled as he returned i shall be here when you are burned  so far dissension ruled the pair each turned on each a frowning air when flickering from the bank anigh a flight of martens met their eye sometime their course they watched and then  they nodded off to sleep again    poem  ivthe tramps    now long enough had day endured or king apollo palinured seaward he steers his panting team and casts on earth his latest gleam  but see the tramps with jaded eye their destined provinces espy long through the hills their way they took long camped beside the mountain brook tis over now with rising hope they pause upon the downward slope and as their aching bones they rest their anxious captain scans the west  so paused alaric on the alps and ciphered up the roman scalps    poem  vthe foolhardy geographer    the howling desert miles around the tinkling brook the only sound  wearied with all his toils and feats the traveller dines on potted meats on potted meats and princely wines not wisely but too well he dines  the brindled tiger loud may roar high may the hovering vulture soar alas regardless of them all soon shall the empurpled glutton sprawl  soon in the deserts hushed repose shall trumpet tidings through his nose alack unwise that nasal song shall be the ounces dinnergong  a blemish in the cut appears alas it cost both blood and tears the glancing graver swerved aside fast flowed the artists vital tide and now the apologetic bard demands indulgence for his pard    poem  vithe angler and the clown    the echoing bridge you here may see the pouring lynn the waving tree the eager angler fresh from town  above the contumelious clown the angler plies his line and rod the clodpole stands with many a nod  with many a nod and many a grin he sees him cast his engine in  what have you caught the peasant cries  nothing as yet the fool replies     moral tales     poem  irobin and ben  or the pirate and the apothecary    come lend me an attentive ear a startling moral tale to hear of pirate rob and chemist ben and different destinies of men  deep in the greenest of the vales that nestle near the coast of wales the heaving main but just in view robin and ben together grew together worked and played the fool together shunned the sunday school and pulled each others youthful noses around the cots among the roses  together but unlike they grew robin was rough and through and through bold inconsiderate and manly like some historic bruce or stanley ben had a mean and servile soul he robbed not though he often stole he sang on sunday in the choir and tamely capped the passing squire  at length intolerant of trammels  wild as the wild bithynian camels wild as the wild seaeaglesbob his widowed dam contrives to rob and thus with great originality effectuates his personality thenceforth his terrorhaunted flight he follows through the starry night and with the early morning breeze behold him on the azure seas the master of a trading dandy hires robin for a go of brandy and all the happy hills of home vanish beyond the fields of foam  ben meanwhile like a tin reflector attended on the worthy rector opened his eyes and held his breath and flattered to the point of death and was at last by that good fairy apprenticed to the apothecary  so ben while robin chose to roam a rising chemist was at home tended his shop with learned air watered his drugs and oiled his hair and gave advice to the unwary like any sleek apothecary  meanwhile upon the deep afar robin the brave was waging war with other tarry desperadoes about the latitude of barbadoes he knew no touch of craven fear his voice was thunder in the cheer first from the maintogallan high the skulking merchantmen to spy  the first to bound upon the deck the last to leave the sinking wreck his hand was steel his word was law his mates regarded him with awe no pirate in the whole profession held a more honourable position  at length from years of anxious toil bold robin seeks his native soil wisely arranges his affairs and to his native dale repairs the bristol swallow sets him down beside the wellremembered town he sighs he spits he marks the scene proudly he treads the village green and free from pettiness and rancour takes lodgings at the crown and anchor  strange when a man so great and good once more in his homecountry stood strange that the sordid clowns should show a dull desire to have him go  his clinging breeks his tarry hat the way he swore the way he spat a certain quality of manner alarming like the pirates banner  something that did not seem to suit all  something o call it bluff not brutal  something at least howeer its called made robin generally blackballed  his soul was wounded proud and glum alone he sat and swigged his rum and took a great distaste to men till he encountered chemist ben bright was the hour and bright the day that threw them in each others way glad were their mutual salutations long their respective revelations before the inn in sultry weather they talked of this and that together ben told the tale of his indentures and rob narrated his adventures  last as the point of greatest weight the pair contrasted their estate and robin like a boastful sailor despised the other for a tailor  see he remarked with envy see a man with such a fist as me bearded and ringed and big and brown i sit and toss the stingo down hear the gold jingle in my bag  all won beneath the jolly flag  ben moralised and shook his head you wanderers earn and eat your bread the foe is found beats or is beaten and either how the wage is eaten and after all your pullyhauly your proceeds look uncommon smallly you had done better here to tarry apprentice to the apothecary the silent pirates of the shore eat and sleep soft and pocket more  than any red robustious ranger who picks his farthings hot from danger you clank your guineas on the board mine are with several bankers stored you reckon riches on your digits you dash in chase of sals and bridgets you drink and risk delirium tremens your whole estate a common seamans regard your friend and school companion soon to be wed to miss trevanion smooth honourable fat and flowery with heaven knows how much land in dowry look at meam i in good case look at my hands look at my face look at the cloth of my apparel try me and test me lock and barrel and own to give the devil his due i have made more of life than you yet i nor sought nor risked a life i shudder at an open knife the perilous seas i still avoided and stuck to land whateer betided i had no gold no marble quarry i was a poor apothecary yet here i stand at thirtyeight a man of an assured estate  well answered robinwell and how  the smiling chemist tapped his brow rob he replied this throbbing brain still worked and hankered after gain by day and night to work my will it pounded like a powder mill and marking how the world went round a theory of theft it found here is the key to right and wrong steal little but steal all day long and this invaluable plan marks what is called the honest man when first i served with doctor pill my hand was ever in the till now that i am myself a master my gains come softer still and faster as thus  on wednesday a maid came to me in the way of trade her mother an old farmers wife required a drug to save her life at once my dear at once i said patted the child upon the head bade her be still a loving daughter and filled the bottle up with water  well and the mother robin cried  o she said beni think she died  battle and blood death and disease upon the tainted tropic seas  the attendant sharks that chew the cud  the abhorred scuppers spouting blood  the untended dead the tropic sun  the thunder of the murderous gun  the cutthroat crewthe captains curse  the tempest blustering worse and worse  these have i known and these

in and laid his broad foundations down about a furlong out of town  early and late the work went on the carts were toiling ere the dawn the mason whistled the hodman sang early and late the trowels rang and thin himself came day by day to push the work in every way an artful builder patent king of all the local building ring who was there like him in the quarter for mortifying brick and mortar or pocketing the odd piastre by substituting lath and plaster with plan and twofoot rule in hand he by the foreman took his stand with boisterous voice with eagle glance to stamp upon extravagance for thrift of bricks and greed of guilders he was the buonaparte of builders  the foreman a desponding creature demurred to here and there a feature for surely sirwith your permeession  bricks here sir in

are crescents trade is trade pharaohs and emperors in their seasons built i believe for different reasons  charity glory piety pride  to pay the men to please a bride to use their stone to spite their neighbours not for a profit on their labours  they built to edify or bewilder i build because i am a builder crescent and street and square i build plaster and paint and carve and gild around the city see them stand these triumphs of my shaping hand with bulging walls with sinking floors with shut impracticable doors fickle and frail in every part and rotten to their inmost heart there shall the simple tenant find death in the falling windowblind death in the pipe death in the faucet death in the deadly watercloset a day is set for all to die caveat emptor what care i  as to amphions tuneful kit thebes rose with towers encircling it as to the mages brandished wand a spiry palace clove the sand to thins indomitable financing that phantom crescent kept advancing when first the brazen bells of churches called clerk and parson to their perches the worshippers of every sect already viewed it with respect a second sunday had not gone before the roof was rattled on and when the fourth was there behold the crescent finished painted sold  the stars proceeded in their courses nature with her subversive forces time too the irontoothed and sinewed and the edacious years continued thrones rose and fell and still the crescent unsanative and now senescent a plastered skeleton of lath looked forward to a day of wrath in the dead night the groaning timber would jar upon the ear of slumber and like dodonas talking oak of oracles and judgments spoke when to the music fingered well the feet of children lightly fell the sire who dozed by the decanters started and dreamed of misadventures the rotten brick decayed to dust the iron was consumed by rust each tabid and perverted mansion hung in the article of declension  so forty fifty sixty passed until when seventy came at last the occupant of number three called friends to hold a jubilee wild was the night the charging rack had forced the moon upon her back the wind piped up a naval ditty and the lamps winked through all the city before that house where lights were shining corpulent feeders grossly dining and jolly clamour hum and rattle fairly outvoiced the tempests battle as still his moistened lip he fingered the envious policeman lingered while far the infernal tempest sped and shook the country folks in bed and tore the trees and tossed the ships he lingered and he licked his lips lo from within a hush the host briefly expressed the evenings toast and lo before the lips were dry the deacon rising to reply here in this house which once i built papered and painted carved and gilt and out of which to my content i netted seventyfive per cent here at this board of jolly neighbours i reap the credit of my labours these were the daysi will say more  these were the grand old days of yore the builder laboured day and night he watched that every brick was right  the decent men their utmost did and the house rosea pyramid these were the days our provost knows when forty streets and crescents rose the fruits of my creative noddle all more or less upon a model neat and commodious cheap and dry a perfect pleasure to the eye i found this quite a country quarter i leave it solid lath and mortar in all i was the single actor  and am this citys benefactor since then alas both thing and name shoddy across the ocean came  shoddy that can the eye bewilder and makes me blush to meet a builder had this good house in frame or fixture been tempered by the least admixture of that discreditable shoddy should we today compound our toddy or gaily marry song and laughter below its sempiternal rafter not so the deacon cried  the mansion had marked his fatuous expansion the years were full the house was fated the rotten structure crepitated  a moment and the silent guests sat pallid as their dinner vests a moment more and root and branch that mansion fell in avalanche story on story floor on floor roof wall and window joist and door dead weight of damnable disaster a cataclysm of lath and plaster  siloam did not choose a sinner  all were not builders at the dinner
