                                samuel johnson  there is perhaps no one among our english writers who for so great a part of his life has been an object of curiosity to his contemporaries as johnson almost every thing he said or did was thought worthy of being recorded by some one or other of his associates and the public were for a time willing to listen to all they had to say of him a mass of information has thus been accumulated from which it will be my task to select such a portion as shall seem sufficient to give a faithful representation of his fortunes and character without wearying the attention of the reader that any important addition should be made to what has been already told of him will scarcely be expected  samuel johnson the elder of two sons of michael johnson who was of an obscure family and kept a booksellers shop at lichfield was born in that city on the 18th of september 1709 his mother sarah ford was sprung of a respectable race of yeomanry in worcestershire and being a woman of great piety early instilled into the mind of her son those principles of devotion for which he was afterwards so eminently distinguished at the end of ten months from his birth he was taken from his nurse according to his own account of himself a poor diseased infant almost blind and when two years and a half old was carried to london to be touched by queen anne for the evil being asked many years after if he had any remembrance of the queen he said that he had a confused but somehow a sort of solemn recollection of a lady in diamonds and a long black hood so predominant was this superstition relating to the kings evil that there was a form of service for the occasion inserted in the book of common prayer and bishop bull1 in one of his sermons calls it a relique and remainder of the primitive gift of healing the morbidness of constitution natural to him and the defect in his eyesight hindered him from partaking in the sports of other children and probably induced him to seek for distinction in intellectual superiority dame oliver who kept a school for little children in lichfield first taught him to read and as he delighted to tell when he was going to the university brought him a present of gingerbread in token of his being the best scholar her academy had ever produced his next instructor in his own language was a man whom he used to call tom browne and who he said published a  spelling book and dedicated it to the universe he was then placed with mr hunter the head master of the grammar school in his native city but for two years before he came under his immediate tuition was taught latin by mr hawkins the usher it is just that one who in writing the lives of men less eminent than himself was always careful to record the names of their instructors should obtain a tribute of similar respect for his own by mr price who was afterwards head master of the same school and whose name i cannot mention without reverence and affection i have been told that johnson when late in life he visited the place of his education shewed him a nook in the schoolroom where it was usual for the boys to secrete the translations of the books they were reading and at the same time speaking of his old master hunter said to him he was not severe sir a master ought to be severe sir he was cruel johnson however was always ready to acknowledge how much he was indebted to hunter for his classical proficiency at the age of fifteen by the advice of his mothers nephew cornelius ford a clergyman of considerable abilities but disgraced by the licentiousness of his life and who is spoken of in the life of fenton he was removed to the grammarschool of stourbridge of which mr wentworth was master here he did not remain much more than a twelvemonth and as he told dr percy learned much in the school but little from the master whereas with hunter he had learned much from the master and little in the school the progress he made was perhaps gained in teaching the other boys for wentworth is said to have employed him as an assistant his compositions in english verse indicate that command of language which he afterwards attained the two following years he accuses himself of wasting in idleness at home but we must doubt whether he had much occasion for selfreproach when we learn that hesiod anacreon the latin works of petrarch and a great many other books not commonly known in the universities were among his studies  his father though a man of strong understanding and much respected in his line of life was not successful in business he must therefore have had a firm reliance on the capacity of his son for while he chided him for his want of steady application he resolved on making so great an effort as to send him to the university and accompanying him thither placed him on the 31st of october 1728 a commoner at pembroke college oxford some assistance was indeed promised him from other quarters but this assistance was never given nor was his industry quickened by his necessities he was sometimes to be seen lingering about the gates of his college and at others sought for relief from the oppression of his mind in affected mirth and turbulent gaiety so extreme was his poverty that he was prevented by the want of shoes from resorting to the rooms of his schoolfellow taylor at the neighbouring college of christ church and such was his pride that he flung away with indignation a new pair that he found left at his door his scholarship was attested by a translation into latin verse of popes messiah which is said to have gained the approbation of that poet but his independent spirit and his irregular habits were both likely to obstruct his interest in the university and at the end of three years increasing debts together with the failure of remittances occasioned by his fathers insolvency forced him to leave it without a degree of pembroke college in his life of shenstone and of sir thomas browne he has spoken with filial gratitude from his tutor mr jorden whom he described as a worthy man but a heavy one he did not learn much what he read solidly he said was greek and that greek homer and euripides but his favourite study was metaphysics which we must suppose him to have investigated by the light of his own meditation for he did not read much in it with dr adams then a junior fellow and afterwards master of the college his friendship continued till his death  soon after his return to lichfield his father died and the following memorandum extracted from the little register which he kept in latin of the more remarkable occurrences that befel him proves at once the small pittance that was left him and the integrity of his mind 1732 julii 15 undecim aureos deposui quo die quicquid ante matris funus quod serum sit precor de paternis bonis sperare licet viginti scilicet libras accepi usque adeo mihi fortuna fingenda est interea ne paupertate vires animi languescant nec in flagitium egestas abigat cavendum1732 july 15 i laid down eleven guineas on which day i received the whole of what it is allowed me to expect from my fathers property before the decease of my mother which i pray may be yet far distant namely twenty pounds my fortune therefore must be of my own making meanwhile let me beware lest the powers of my mind grow languid through poverty or want drive me to evil on the following day we find him setting out on foot for market bosworth in leicestershire where he had engaged himself as an usher to the school of which mr crompton was master here he described to his old schoolfellow hector the dull sameness of his life in the words of the poet vitam continct una dies that it was as unvaried as the note of the cuckoo and that he did not know whether it were more disagreeable for him to teach or for the boys to learn the grammar rules to add to his misery he had to endure the petty despotism of sir wolstan dixie one of the patrons of the school the trial of a few months disgusted him so much with his employment that he relinquished it and removing to birmingham became the guest of his friend mr hector who was a chirurgeon in that town and lodged in the house of a bookseller having remained with him about six months he hired lodgings for himself by mr hector he was stimulated not without some difficulty to make a translation from the french of lobos voyage to abyssinia for which he received no more than five guineas from the bookseller who by an artifice not uncommon printed it at birmingham with the date of london in the titlepage to mr hector therefore is due the impulse which first made johnson an author the motion being once given did not cease for having returned to lichfield in 1735 he sent forth in august proposals for printing by subscription politians latin poems with a life of the author notes and a history of latin poetry from the age of petrarch to that of politian his reason for fixing on this era it is not easy to determine mussato preceded petrarch the interval between petrarch and politian is not particularly illustrated by excellence in latin poetry and politian was much surpassed in correctness and elegance if not in genius by those who came after himby flaminio navagero and fracastorio yet in the hands of johnson such a subject would not have been wanting in instruction or entertainment such as were willing to subscribe were referred to his brother nathaniel johnson who had succeeded to his fathers business in lichfield but the design was dropped for want of a sufficient number of names to encourage it a deficiency not much to be wondered at unless the inhabitants of provincial towns were more learned in those days than at present  in this year he made another effort to obtain the means of subsistence by an offer of his pen to cave the editor of the gentlemans magazine but the immediate result of the application is not known nor in what manner he supported himself till july 1736 when he married elizabeth porter the widow of a mercer at birmingham and daughter of william jervis esq of great peatling in leicestershire this woman who was twenty years older than himself and to whose daughter he had been an unsuccessful suitor brought him eight hundred pounds but according to garricks report of her was neither amiable nor handsome though that she was both in johnsons estimation appears from the epithets formosae cultae ingeniosae which he inscribed on her tombstone their nuptials were celebrated at derby and to that town they went together on horseback from birmingham but the bride assuming some airs of caprice on the road like another petruchio he gave her such effectual proofs of resolution as reduced her to the abjectness of shedding tears his first project after his marriage was to set up a school and with this intention he hired a very commodious house at the distance of about two miles from lichfield called edial hall which has lately been taken down and of which a representation is to be seen in the history of lichfield by mr harwood one of my friends who inhabited it for the same purpose has told me that an old countryman who lived near it and remembered johnson and his pupil garrick said to him that johnson was not much of a scholar to look at but that master garrick was a strange one for leaping over a stile it is amusing to observe the impressions which such men make on common minds unfortunately the prejudice occasioned by johnsons unsightly exterior was not confined to the vulgar insomuch that it has been thought to be the reason why so few parents committed their children to his care for he had only three pupils this unscholarlike appearance it must have been that made the bookseller in the strand to whom he applied for literary employment eye him archly and recommend it to him rather to purchase a porters knot but as an old philosopher has said every thing has two handles it was perhaps the contrast between the body and the mind between the incultum corpus and the ingenium which afterwards was one cause of his being received so willingly in those circles of what is called high life where any thing that is exceedingly strange and unusual is apt to carry its own recommendation with it failing in his attempt at edial he was disposed once more to engage in the drudgery of an usher and offered himself in that capacity to the rev william budworth master of the grammarschool at brewood in staffordshire celebrated for having been the place in which bishop hurd received his education under that master but here again nature stood in his way for budworth was fearful lest a strange motion with the head the effect probably of disease to which johnson was habitually subject might excite the derision of his scholars and for that reason declined employing him he now resolved on trying his fortune in the capital  among the many respectable families in lichfield into whose society johnson had been admitted none afforded so great encouragement to his literary talents as that of mr walmsley who lived in the bishops palace and was registrar of the ecclesiastical court and whom he has so eloquently commemorated in his lives of the poets by this gentleman he was introduced in a letter to the rev mr colson lucasian professor of mathematics in the university of cambridge and the master of an academy as a very good scholar and one who he had great hopes would turn out a fine dramatic writer who intended to try his fate with a tragedy and to get himself employed in some translation either from the latin or the french the tragedy on which mr walmsley founded his expectations of johnsons future eminence as a dramatic poet was the irene a shrewd sally of humour to which the reading of this piece gave rise evinces the terms of familiarity on which he was with his patron for on walmsleys observing when some part of it had been read that the poet had already involved his heroine in such distress that he did not see what further he could do to excite the commiseration of the audience johnson replied that he could put her into the ecclesiastical court garrick who was to be placed at colsons academy accompanied his former instructor on this expedition to london at the beginning of march 1737 it does not appear that mr walmsleys recommendation of him to colson whom he has described under the character of gelidus2 in the twentyfourth paper of the rambler was of much use he first took lodgings in exeterstreet in the strand but soon retired to greenwich for the sake of completing his tragedy which he used to compose walking in the park  from greenwich he addressed another letter to cave with proposals for translating paul sarpis history of the council of trent with the notes of le courayer before the summer was expired he returned for mrs johnson whom he had left at lichfield and remaining there three months at length finished irene on his second visit to london his lodgings were first in woodstockstreet near hanover square and then in castlestreet near cavendish square his tragedy which was brought on the stage twelve years after by garrick having been at this time rejected by the manager of the playhouse he was forced to relinquish his hopes of becoming a dramatic writer and engaged himself to write for the gentlemans magazine the debates in parliament were not then allowed to be given to the public with the same unrestricted and generous freedom with which it is now permitted to report them to elude this prohibition and gratify the just curiosity of the country the several members were designated by fictitious names under which they were easily discoverable and their speeches in both houses of parliament which was entitled the senate of lilliput were in this manner imparted to the nation in the periodical work abovementioned at first johnson only revised these reports but he became so dexterous in the execution of his task that he required only to be told the names of the speakers and the side of the question to be espoused in order to frame the speeches himself an artifice not wholly excusable which afterwards occasioned him some selfreproach and even at the time pleased him so little that he did not consent to continue it the whole extent of his assistance to cave is not known the lives of paul sarpi boerhaave admirals drake and blake barretier burman sydenham and roscommon with the essay on epitaphs and an essay on the account of the conduct of the duchess of marlborough were certainly contributed to his miscellany by johnson two tracts the one a vindication of the licenser of the stage from the aspersions of brooke author of gustavus vasa the other marmor norfolciense a pamphlet levelled against sir robert walpole and the hanoverian succession were published by him separately in 1739  for his version of sarpis history he had received from cave before the 21st of april in this year fifty pounds and some sheets of it had been committed to the press when unfortunately the design was stopped in consequence of proposals appearing for a translation of the same book by another person of the same name as our author who was curate of st martins in the fields and patronized by dr pearce the editor of longinus warburton 3 afterwards expressed a wish that johnson would give the original on one side and his translation on the other his next engagement was to draw up an account of the printed books in the earl of oxfords library for osborne the bookseller who had purchased them for thirteen thousand pounds such was the petulant impatience of osborne during the progress of this irksome task that johnson was once irritated so far as to beat him  in may 1738 appeared his london imitated from the third satire of juvenal for which he got ten guineas from dodsley the excellence of this poem was so immediately perceived that it reached a second edition in the course of a week pope having made some ineffectual inquiries concerning the author from mr richardson the son of the painter observed that he would soon be deterre in the august of 1739 we find him so far known to pope that at his intercession earl gower applied to a friend of swift to assist in procuring from the university the degree of master of arts that he might be enabled to become a candidate for the mastership of a school then vacant the application was without success  his own wants however pressing did not hinder him from assisting his mother who had lost her other son a letter to mr levett of lichfield on the subject of a debt for which he makes himself responsible on her account affords so striking a proof of filial tenderness that i cannot refuse myself the pleasure of transcribing it    december 1 1743    siri am extremely sorry that we have encroached so much upon your   forbearance with respect to the interest which a great perplexity of   affairs hindered me from thinking of with that attention that i ought   and which i am not immediately able to remit to you but will pay it   i think twelve pounds in two months i look upon this and on the   future interest of that mortgage as my own debt and beg that you   will be pleased to give me directions how to pay it and not mention   it to my dear mother if it be necessary to pay this in less time i   believe i can do it but i take two months for certainty and beg an   answer whether you can allow me so much time i think myself very much   obliged for your forbearance and shall esteem it a great happiness to   be able to serve you i have great opportunities of dispersing any   thing that you may think it proper to make public i will give a note   for the money payable at the time mentioned to any one here that you   shall appoint    i am sir your most obedient    and most humble servant    sam johnson    at mr osbornes bookseller in grays inn  in the following year 1744 he produced his life of savage a work that gives the charm of a romance to a narrative of real re in original events and which bearing the stamp of that eagerness ea  ness in original and rapidity with which it was thrown off the mind of the writer exhibits rather the fervour of an eloquent advocate than the laboriousness of a minute biographer the fortyeight octavo pages as he told mr nichols 4 were written in one day and night at its first appearance it was warmly praised in the champion probably either by fielding or by ralph who succeeded to him in a share of that paper and sir joshua reynolds when it came into his hand found his attention so powerfully arrested that he read it through without changing his posture as he perceived by the torpidness of one of his arms that had rested on a chimneypiece by which he was standing for the life of savage 5 he received fifteen guineas from cave about this time he fell into the company of collins with whom as he tells us in his life of that poet he delighted to converse  his next publication in 1745 was a pamphlet called miscellaneous observations on the tragedy of macbeth with remarks on sir th sir thomas hanmers edition of shakspeare to which were subjoined proposals for a new edition of his plays these observations were favourably mentioned by warburton in the preface to his edition and johnsons gratitude for praise bestowed at a time when praise was of value to him was fervent and lasting yet warburton with his usual intolerance of any dissent from his opinions afterwards complained in a private letter 6 to hurd that johnsons remarks on his commentaries were full of insolence and malignant reflections which had they not in them as much folly as malignity he should have had reason to be offended with  in 1747 he furnished garrick who had become jointpatentee and manager of drury lane with a prologue on the opening of the house this address has been commended quite as much as it deserves the characters of shakspeare and ben jonson are indeed discriminated with much skill but surely something might have been said if not of massinger and beaumont and fletcher yet at least of congreve and otway who are involved in the sweeping censure passed on the wits of charles  of all his various literary undertakings that in which he now engaged was the most arduous a dictionary of the english language his plan of this work was at the desire of dodsley inscribed to the earl of chesterfield then one of the secretaries of state dodsley in conjunction with six other booksellers stipulated fifteen hundred and seventyfive pounds as the price of his labour a sum from which when the expenses of paper and transcription were deducted a small portion only remained for the compiler in other countries this national desideratum has been supplied by the united exertions of the learned had the project for such a combination in queen annes reign been carried into execution the result might have been fewer defects and less excellence the explanation of technical terms would probably have been more exact the derivations more copious and a greater number of significant words now omitted 7 have been collected from our earliest writers but the citations would often have been made with less judgment and the definitions laid down with less acuteness of discrimination  from his new patron whom he courted without the aid of those graces so devoutly worshipped by that nobleman he reaped but small advantage and being much exasperated at his neglect johnson addressed to him a very cutting but it must be owned an intemperate letter renouncing his protection though when the dictionary was completed chesterfield had ushered its appearance before the public in two complimentary papers in the world but the homage of the client was not to be recalled or even his resentment to be appeased his great work is thus spoken of at its first appearance in a letter from thomas warton to his brother 8 the dictionary is arrived the preface is noble there is a grammar prefixed and the history of the language is pretty full but you may plainly perceive strokes of laxity and indolence they are two most unwieldy volumes i have written to him an invitation i fear his preface will disgust by the expressions of his consciousness of superiority and of his contempt of patronage in 1773 when he gave a second edition with additions and corrections he announced in a few prefatory lines that he had expunged some superfluities and corrected some faults and here and there had scattered a remark but that the main fabric continued the same i have looked into it he observes in a letter to boswell very little since i wrote it and i think i found it full as often better as worse than i expected  to trace in order of time the various changes in johnsons place of residence in the metropolis if it were worth the trouble would not be possible a list of them which he gave to boswell amounting to seventeen but without the correspondent dates is preserved by that writer for the sake of being near his printer while the dictionary was on the anvil he took a convenient house in gough square near fleetstreet and fitted up one room in it as an office where six amanuenses were employed in transcribing for him of whom boswell recounts in triumph that five were scotchmen in 1748 he wrote for dodsleys preceptor the preface and the vision of theodore the hermit to which johnson has been heard to give the preference over all his other writings in the january of the ensuing year appeared the vanity of human wishes being the tenth satire of juvenal imitated which he sold for fifteen guineas and in the next month his irene was brought on the stage not without a previous altercation between the poet and his former pupil concerning some changes which garricks superior knowledge of the stage made him consider to be necessary but which johnson said the fellow desired only that they might afford him more opportunity of tossing his hands and kicking his heels he always treated the art of a player with illiberal contempt but was at length by the intervention of dr taylor prevailed on to give way to the suggestions of garrick yet garrick had not made him alter all that needed altering for the first exhibition of irene shocked the spectators with the novel sight of a heroine who was to utter two verses with the bowstring about her neck this horror was removed from a second representation but after the usual course of ten nights the tragedy was no longer in request johnson thought it requisite on this occasion to depart from the usual homeliness of his habit and to appear behind the scenes and in the side boxes with the decoration of a goldlaced hat and waistcoat he observed that he found himself unable to behave with the same ease in his finery as when dressed in his plain clothes in the winter of this year he established a weekly club at the kings head in ivy lane near st pauls of which the other members were dr salter a cambridge divine hawkesworth mr ryland a merchant mr john payne the bookseller mr john dyer a man of considerable erudition and a friend of burkes doctors macghie baker and bathurst three physicians and sir john hawkins  he next became a candidate for public favour as the writer of a periodical work in the manner of the spectator and in march 1750 published the first number of the rambler which was continued for nearly two years but wanting variety of matter and familiarity of style failed to attract many readers so that the largest number of copies that were sold of any one paper did not exceed five hundred the topics were selected without sufficient regard to the popular taste the grievances and distresses of authors particularly were dwelt on to satiety and the tone of eloquence was more swelling and stately than he had hitherto adopted the papers allotted to criticism are marked by his usual acumen but the justice of his opinions is often questionable in the humourous pieces when our laughter is excited i doubt the author himself who is always discoverable under the masque of whatever character he assumes is as much the object as the cause of our merriment and however moral and devout his more serious views of life they are often defective in that most engaging feature of sound religion a cheerful spirit the only assistance he received was from richardson mrs chapone miss talbot and mrs carter the first of whom contributed the 97th number the second four billets in the 10th the next the 30th and the last the 44th and 100th numbers  three days after the completion of the rambler march 17 1752 he was deprived of his wife whom notwithstanding the disparity in their age and some occasional bickerings he had tenderly loved those who are disposed to scrutinize narrowly and severely into the human heart may question the sincerity of his sorrow because he was collected enough to write her funeral sermon but the shapes which grief puts on in different minds are as dissimilar as the constitution of those minds milton in whom the power of imagination was predominant soothed his anguish for the loss of his youthful friend in an irregular but most beautiful assemblage of those poetic objects which presented themselves to his thoughts and consecrated them to the memory of the deceased and johnson who loved to act the moralizer and the rhetorician alleviated his sufferings by declaiming on the instability of human happiness  during this interval he also wrote the prologue to comus spoken by garrick for the benefit of mrs elizabeth foster granddaughter to milton the prologue and postscript to landers impudent forgeries concerning that poet by which johnson was imposed on as well as the rest of the world a letter to dr douglas for the same impostor after he had been detected acknowledging and expressing contrition for the fraud and the life of cheynel in the student  soon after his wifes death he became intimate with beauclerk and langton two young men of family and distinction who were fellow collegians at oxford and much attached to each other and the latter of whom admiration of the rambler had brought to london with the express view of being introduced to the author their society was very agreeable to him and he was perhaps glad to forget himself by joining at times in their sallies of juvenile gaiety one night when he had lodgings in the temple he was roused by their knocking at his door and appearing in his shirt and nightcap he found they had come together from the tavern where they had supped to prevail on him to accompany them in a nocturnal ramble he readily entered into their proposal and having indulged themselves till morning in such frolics as came in their way johnson and beauclerk were so well pleased with their diversion that they continued it through the rest of the day while their less sprightly companion left them to keep an engagement with some ladies at breakfast not without reproaches from johnson for deserting his friends for a set of unidead girls  in 1753 he gave to dr bathurst the physician whom he regarded with much affection and whose practice was very limited several essays for the adventurer which hawkesworth was then publishing and wrote for mrs lenox a dedication to the earl of orrery of her shakspeare illustrated and in the following year inserted in the gentlemans magazine a life of cave its former editor  previously to the publication of his dictionary it was thought advisable by his friends that the degree of master of arts should be obtained for him in order that his name might appear in the title page with that addition and it was accordingly through their intercession conferred on him by the university of oxford the work was presented by the earl of orrery one of his friends then at florence to the delia crusca academy who in return sent their dictionary to the author the french academy paid him the same compliment but these honours were not accompanied by that indispensable requisite provision for the day that was passing over him he was arrested for debt and liberated by the kindness of richardson the writer of clarissa who became his surety to prevent such humiliation the efforts of his own industry were not wanting in 1756 he published an abridgement of his dictionary and an edition of sir thomas brownes christian morals to which he prefixed a life of that writer he contributed to a periodical miscellany called the universal visitor by christopher smart9 and yet more largely to another work of the same kind entitled the literary magazine and wrote a dedication and preface for paynes introduction to the game of draughts and an introduction to the newspaper called the london chronicle for the last of which he received a single guinea yet either conscientious scruples or his unwillingness to relinquish a london life induced him to decline the offer of a valuable benefice in lincolnshire which was made him by the father of his friend langton provided he could prevail on himself to take holy orders a measure that would have delivered him from literary toil for the remainder of his days but literary toil was the occupation for which nature had designed him in the april of 1758 he commenced the idler and continued to publish it for two years in the universal chronicle of these essays he was supplied with nos 33 93 and 96 by thomas warton with no 67 by langton and with nos 76 79 and 82 by reynolds boswell mentions twelve papers being given by his friends but does not say who were the contributors of the remaining five the essay on epitaphs the dissertation on popes epitaphs and an essay on the bravery of the english common soldiers were subjoined to this paper when it was collected into volumes it does not differ from the rambler otherwise than as the essays are shorter and somewhat less grave and elaborate  another wound was inflicted on him by the death of his mother who had however reached her ninetieth year his affection and his regret will best appear from the following letter to the daughter of his deceased wife    to miss porter in lichfield    you will conceive my sorrow for the loss of my mother of the best   mother if she were to live again surely i should behave better to   her   but she is happy and what is past is nothing to her and for me   since i cannot repair my faults to her i hope repentance will efface   them i return you and all those that have been good to her my   sincerest thanks and pray god to repay you all with infinite   advantage write to me and comfort me dear child i shall be glad   likewise if kitty will write to me i shall send a bill of twenty   pounds in a few days which i thought to have brought to my mother   but god suffered it not i have not power nor composure to say much   more god bless you and bless us all    i am dear miss    your affectionate humble servant    sam johnson  her attention to his mother as it is reported in the following words by miss seward ensured to johnson the sympathy of lucy porter  from the age of twenty till her fortieth year when affluence came to her by the death of her eldest brother she had boarded in lichfield with dr johnsons mother who still kept that little booksellers shop by which her husband had supplied the scanty means of existence meanwhile lucy porter kept the best company of our little city but would make no engagement on marketdays lest granny as she called mrs johnson should catch cold by serving in the shop there lucy porter took her place standing behind the counter nor thought it a disgrace to thank a poor person who purchased from her a penny battledore 10  to defray the expenses of his mothers funeral he had recourse to his pen and in the evenings of one week produced the rasselas for which he received one hundred pounds and was presented by the purchasers with twentyfive more on its reaching a second edition rasselas is a noble monument of the genius of its author reflections so profound and so forcible a draught of some of the great outlines of the human intellect and passions are to be found in few writers of any age or country the mind is seldom presented with any thing so marvellous as the character of the philosopher who has persuaded himself that he is entrusted with the management of the elements johnsons dread of insanity was perhaps relieved by embodying this mighty conception he had seen the shadowy form in the twilight and might have dissipated or eased his apprehensions by coming up to it more closely and examining into the occasion of his fears in this tale the censure which he has elsewhere passed on milton that he is a lion who has no skill in dandling the kid recoils upon himself his delineation of the female character is wanting in delicacy  in this year he supplied mr newbery with an introduction to the world displayed a collection of voyages and travels till the publication of his shakspeare in 1765 the only writings acknowledged by himself were a review of tytlers vindication of mary queen of scots in the gentlemans magazine an introduction to the proceedings of the committee for clothing the french prisoners the preface to bolts dictionary of trade and commerce a dedication to the king of kennedys complete system of astronomical chronology unfolding the scriptures and a dedication to the queen of hooles tasso  in the course of this period he made a short visit to lichfield and thus communicates his feelings on the occasion in a letter dated july 20 1762 to baretti his italian friend who was then at milan    last winter i went down to my native town where i found the streets   much narrower and shorter than i thought i had left them inhabited by   a new race of people to whom i was very little known my playfellows   were grown old and forced me to suspect that i am no longer young my   only remaining friend had changed his principles and was become the   tool of the predominant faction my daughterinlaw from whom i   expected most and whom i met with sincere benevolence had lost the   beauty and gaiety of youth without having gained much of the wisdom   of age i wandered about for five days and took the first convenient   opportunity of returning to a place where if there is not much   happiness there is at least such a diversity of good and evil that   slight vexations do not fix upon the heart    i think in a few weeks to try another excursion though to what end   let me know my baretti what has been the result of your return to   your own country whether time has made any alteration for the better   and whether when the first rapture of salutation was over you did   not find your thoughts confessed their disappointment  henceforward johnson had no longer to struggle with the evils of extreme poverty a pension of £300 was granted to him in 1762 by his majesty before his acceptance of it in answer to a question put by him to the earl of bute in these words pray my lord what am i to do for the pension he was assured by that nobleman that it was not given him for any thing he was to do but for what he had done the definition he had given of the word pension in his dictionary that in england it was generally understood to mean pay given to a state hireling for treason to his country raised some further scruples whether he ought himself to become a pensioner but they were removed by the arguments or the persuasion of mr reynolds to whom he had recourse for advice in this dilemma what advice reynolds would give him he must have known pretty well beforehand but this was one of the many instances in which men having first determined how to act are willing to imagine that they are going for clearer information where they in truth expect nothing but a confirmation of their own resolve the liberality of the nation could not have been extended to one who had better deserved it but he had a calamity yet more dreadful than poverty to encounter the depression of his spirits was now become almost intolerable i would have a limb amputated said he to dr adams to recover my spirits he was constantly tormented by harassing reflections on his inability to keep the many resolutions he had formed of leading a better life and complained that a kind of strange oblivion had overspread him so that he did not know what was become of the past year and that incidents and intelligence passed over him without leaving any impression  neither change of place nor the society of friends availed to prevent or to dissipate this melancholy in 1762 he made an excursion into devonshire with sir joshua reynolds the next year he went to harwich with boswell in the following when his malady was most troublesome the meeting which acquired the name of the literary club was instituted and he passed a considerable time in lincolnshire with the father of langton and in the year after visited cambridge in the company of beauclerk of the literary club first proposed by reynolds the other members at its first establishment were burke dr nugent beauclerk langton goldsmith chamier and sir john hawkins they met at the turks head in gerrardstreet soho one evening in the week and usually remained together till a late hour the society was afterwards extended so as to comprise a large number of those who were most eminent either for their learning or their station in life and the place of meeting has been since at different times changed to other parts of the town nearer to the parliament house or to the usual resorts of gaiety a club was the delight of johnson we lose some of our awe for him when we contemplate him as mimicked by his old scholar garrick in the act of squeezing a lemon into the punchbowl and asking as he looks round the company in his provincial accent of which he never got entirely rid whos for poonch if there was any thing likely to gratify him more than a new club it was the public testimony of respect from a learned body and this he received from trinity college dublin in a diploma for the degree of doctor of laws an honour the more flattering as it came without solicitation  at the beginning of 1766 his faithful biographer james boswell who had known him for three years found him in a good house in johnsons court fleetstreet to which he had removed from lodgings in the temple by the advice of his physician he had now begun to abstain from wine and drank only water or lemonade he had brought two companions into his new dwelling such as few other men would have chosen to enliven their solitude on the ground floor was miss anna williams daughter of zechariah williams a man who had practised physic in wales and having come to england to seek the reward proposed by parliament for the discovery of the longitude had been assisted by johnson in drawing up an account of the method he had devised this plan was printed with an italian translation which is supposed to be barettis on the opposite page and a copy of the pamphlet presented by johnson to the bodleian is deposited in that library miss williams had been a frequent visitor at johnsons before the death of his wife and having after that event come under his roof to undergo an operation for a cataract on her eyes with more convenience than could have been had in her own lodgings continued to occupy an apartment in his house whenever he had one till the time of her death her disease ended in total blindness which gave her an additional claim on his benevolence when he lived in the temple it was his custom however late the hour not to retire to rest until he had drunk tea with her in her lodgings in boltcourt one night when goldsmith and boswell were with him goldsmith strutted off in the company of johnson exclaiming with an air of superiority i go to miss williams while boswell slunk away in silent disappointment but it was not long as boswell adds before he himself obtained the same mark of distinction johnson prevailed on garrick to get her a benefit at the playhouse and assisted her in preparing some poems she had written for the press by both which means she obtained the sum of about £300 the interest of this added to some small annual benefactions probably hindered her from being any pecuniary burden to johnson and though she was apt to be peevish and impatient her curiosity the retentiveness of her memory and the strength of her intellect made her on the whole an agreeable companion to him the other inmate whose place was in one of his garrets was robert levett a practiser of physic among the lower people grotesque in his appearance formal in his manners and silent before company though little thought of by others this man was so highly esteemed for his abilities by johnson that he was heard to say he should not be satisfied though attended by all the college of physicians unless he had levett with him he must have been a useful assistant in the chemical processes with which johnson was fond of amusing himself and at one of which murphy on his first visit found him in a little room covered with soot like a chimneysweeper making aether beauclerk with his lively exaggeration used to describe johnson at breakfast throwing his crusts to levett after he had eaten the crumb the pathetic verses written by johnson on his death which happened suddenly three years before his own shew with what tenderness of affection he regarded levett some time after 1778 to this couple who did not live in much harmony together were added mrs desmoulins the daughter of dr swinfen his godfather and widow of a writingmaster miss carmichael and as boswell thought a daughter also of mrs desmoulins all of whom were lodged in his house to the widow he allowed halfaguinea a week the twelfth part as boswell observes of his pension it was sometimes more than he could do to reconcile so many jarring interests williams says he in a letter to mrs thrale hates every body levett hates desmoulins and does not love williams desmoulins hates them both poll loves none of them poll was miss carmichael of whom i do not find that any thing else is recorded boswell ventured to call this groupe the seraglio of johnson and escaped without a rebuke  from these domestic feuds he would sometimes withdraw himself to the house of mr thrale at streatham an opulent brewer with whom his acquaintance had begun in 1765 with this openhearted man he was always sure of a welcome reception for as long a time as he chose and the mistress of the house though after the death of her first husband and her subsequent marriage to an italian she somewhat ungraciously remembered the petty annoyances which johnsons untoward habits had occasioned her was evidently pleased by his hearty expressions of regard and flattered by his conversation on subjects of literature in which she was herself well able to take a part  in this year his long promised edition of shakspeare made its appearance in eight volumes octavo that by steevens was published the following year and a coalition between the editors having been effected an edition was put forth under their joint names in ten volumes 8vo 1773 for the first johnson received £375 and for the second £10011 at the beginning of the preface he has marked out the character of our great dramatist with such a power of criticism as there was perhaps no example of in the english language towards the conclusion he has i think successfully defended him from the neglect of what are called the unities the observation that a quibble was the cleopatra for which he lost the world and was content to lose it is more pointed than just shakspeare cannot be said to have lost the world for his fame has not only embraced the circle of his own country but is continually spreading over new portions of the globe nor is there any reason to conclude that he would have acquiesced in such a loss like most other writers he indulged himself in a favourite propensity aware probably that if it offended some it would win him the applause of others one avenue of knowledge that was open to shakspeare in common with the rest of mankind none of his commentators appear to have sufficiently considered we cannot conceive him to have associated frequently with men of larger acquirements than himself and not to have made much of their treasures his own the conversation of such a man as ben jonson alone supposing him to have made no more display of his learning than chance or vanity would occasionally produce must have supplied ample sources of information to a mind so curious watchful and retentive that it did not suffer the slightest thing to escape its grasp johnson is distinguished in his notes from the other commentators chiefly by the acute remarks on many of the characters and on the conduct of some of the fables which he has subjoined to the different plays in other respects he is not superior to the rest in some particularly in illustrating his author from antecedent or contemporary writers he is inferior to them a german critic of our own days schlegel has surpassed him even in that which he has done best  from boswell i have collected an account of the little journeys with which he from time to time relieved the uniformity of his life they will be told in order as they occur and i hope will not weary the reader the days of a scholar are frequently not distinguished by varieties even as unimportant as these johnson found his mind grow stagnant by a constant residence in the neighbourhood of charingcross itself where he thought human happiness at its flood and once when moving rapidly along the road in a carriage with boswell cried out to his fellowtraveller sir life has few things better than this in the winter of 1766 he went to oxford where he resided for a month and formed an intimacy with chambers afterwards one of the judges in india during this period no publication appeared under his own name but he furnished miss williams with a preface to her poems and adams with another for his treatise on the globes and wrote the dedication to the king prefixed to goughs london and westminster improved he seems to have been always ready to supply a dedication for a friend a task which he executed with more than ordinary courtliness in this way he told boswell that he believed he had dedicated to all the royal family round but in his own case either pride hindered him from prefixing to his works what he perhaps considered as a token of servility or his better judgment restrained him from appropriating by a particular inscription to one individual that which was intended for the use of mankind  of johnsons interview with george iii i shall transcribe the account as given by boswell with which such pains were taken to make it accurate that it was submitted before publication for the inspection of the king by one of his principal secretaries of state  in february 1767 there happened one of the most remarkable incidents in johnsons life which gratified his monarchical enthusiasm and which he loved to relate with all its circumstances when requested by his friends this was his being honoured by a private conversation with his majesty in the library at the queens house he had frequently visited those splendid rooms and noble collection of books which he used to say was more numerous and curious than he supposed any person could have made in the time which the king had employed mr barnard the librarian took care that he should have every accommodation that could contribute to his ease and convenience while indulging his literary taste in that place so that he had here a very agreeable resource at leisure hours  his majesty having been informed of his occasional visits was pleased to signify a desire that he should be told when dr johnson came next to the library accordingly the next time that johnson did come as soon as he was fairly engaged with a book on which while he sat by the fire he seemed quite intent mr barnard stole round to the apartment where the king was and in obedience to his majestys commands mentioned that dr johnson was then in the library his majesty said he was at leisure and would go to him upon which mr barnard took one of the candles that stood on the kings table and lighted his majesty through a suite of rooms till they came to a private door into the library of which his majesty had the key being entered mr barnard stepped forward hastily to dr johnson who was still in a profound study and whispered him sir here is the king johnson started up and stood still his majesty approached him and at once was courteously easy  his majesty began by observing that he understood he came sometimes to the library and then mentioning his having heard that the doctor had been lately at oxford asked him if he was not fond of going thither to which johnson answered that he was indeed fond of going to oxford sometimes but was likewise glad to come back again the king then asked him what they were doing at oxford johnson answered he could not much commend their diligence but that in some respects they were mended for they had put their press under better regulations and were at that time printing polybius he was then asked whether there were better libraries at oxford or cambridge he answered he believed the bodleian was larger than any they had at cambridge at the same time adding i hope whether we have more books or not than they have at cambridge we shall make as good use of them as they do being asked whether allsouls or christchurch library was the largest he answered allsouls library is the largest we have except the bodleian ay said the king that is the public library  his majesty inquired if he was then writing any thing he answered he was not for he had pretty well told the world what he knew and must now read to acquire more knowledge the king as it should seem with a view to urge him to rely on his own stores as an original writer and to continue his labours then said i do not think you borrow much from any body johnson said he thought he had already done his part as a writer i should have thought so too said the king if you had not written so welljohnson observed to me upon this that no man could have paid a handsomer compliment and it was fit for a king to pay it was decisive when asked by another friend at sir joshua reynoldss whether he made any reply to this high compliment he answered no sir when the king had said it it was to be so it was not for me to bandy civilities with my sovereign perhaps no man who had spent his whole life in courts could have shewn a more nice and dignified sense of true politeness than johnson did in this instance  his majesty having observed to him that he supposed he must have read a great deal johnson answered that he thought more than he read that he had read a great deal in the early part of his life but having fallen into ill health he had not been able to read much compared with others for instance he said he had not read much compared with dr warburton upon which the king said that he heard dr warburton was a man of such general knowledge that you could scarce talk with him on any subject on which he was not qualified to speak and that his learning resembled garricks acting in its universality his majesty then talked of the controversy between warburton and lowth which he seemed to have read and asked johnson what he thought of it johnson answered warburton has most general most scholastic learning lowth is the more correct scholar i do not know which of them calls names best the king was pleased to say he was of the same opinion adding you do not think then dr johnson that there was much argument in the case johnson said he did not think there was why truly said the king when once it comes to calling names argument is pretty well at an end  his majesty then asked him what he thought of lord lytteltons history which was then just published johnson said he thought his style pretty good but that he had blamed henry the second rather too much why said the king they seldom do these things by halves no sir answered johnson not to kings but fearing to be misunderstood he proceeded to explain himself and immediately subjoined that for those who spoke worse of kings than they deserved he could find no excuse but that he could more easily conceive how some might speak better of them than they deserved without any ill intention for as kings had much in their power to give those who were favoured by them would frequently from gratitude exaggerate their praises and as this proceeded from a good motive it was certainly excusable as far as errour could be excusable  the king then asked him what he thought of dr hill johnson answered that he was an ingenious man but had no veracity and immediately mentioned as an instance of it an assertion of that writer that he had seen objects magnified to a much greater degree by using three or four microscopes at a time than by using one now added johnson every one acquainted with microscopes knows that the more of them he looks through the less the object will appear why replied the king this is not only telling an untruth but telling it clumsily for if that be the case every one who can look through a microscope will be able to detect him  i now said johnson to his friends when relating what had passed began to consider that i was depreciating this man in the estimation of his sovereign and thought it was time for me to say something that might be more favourable he added therefore that dr hill was notwithstanding a very curious observer and if he would have been contented to tell the world no more than he knew he might have been a very considerable man and needed not to have recourse to such mean expedients to raise his reputation  the king then talked of literary journals mentioned particularly the journal des savans and asked johnson if it was well done johnson said it was formerly very well done and gave some account of the persons who began it and carried it on for some years enlarging at the same time on the nature and use of such works the king asked him if it was well done now johnson answered he had no reason to think that it was the king then asked him if there were any other literary journal published in this kingdom except the monthly and critical reviews and on being answered there was no other his majesty asked which of them was the best johnson answered that the monthly review was done with most care the critical upon the best principles adding that the authours of the monthly review were enemies to the church this the king said he was sorry to hear  the conversation next turned on the philosophical transactions when johnson observed that they had now a better method of arranging their materials than formerly ay said the king they are obliged to dr johnson for that for his majesty had heard and remembered the circumstance which johnson himself had forgot  his majesty expressed a desire to have the literary biography of this country ably executed and proposed to dr johnson to undertake it johnson signified his readiness to comply with his majestys wishes  during the whole of this interview johnson talked to his majesty with profound respect but still in his firm manly manner with a sonorous voice and never in that subdued tone which is commonly used at the levee and in the drawingroom after the king withdrew johnson shewed himself highly pleased with his majestys conversation and gracious behaviour he said to mr barnard sir they may talk of the king as they will but he is the finest gentleman i have ever seen and he afterwards observed to mr langton sir his manners are those of as fine a gentleman as we may suppose lewis the fourteenth or charles the second  nothing in this conversation betrays symptoms of that state which he complains of in his devotional record on the 2nd of august 1767 when he says that he had been disturbed and unsettled for a long time and had been without resolution to apply to study or to business half of this year he passed at a distance from the metropolis and chiefly at lichfield where he prayed fervently by the deathbed of the old servant of his family catherine chambers leaving her with a fond farewell and many tears there was no greater proof of the goodness of johnsons nature than his attachment to his domestics soon after this he placed francis barber a negro boy who waited on him at a school at hertfordshire and during his education there encouraged him to good behaviour by frequent and very kind letters it is on such occasions that we are ready to allow the justice of goldsmiths vindication of his friend that he had nothing of the bear but the skin  in the two succeeding years he continued to labour under the same restlessness and anxiety again sought for relief in a long visit to oxford and another to brighthelmstone with the thrales and produced nothing but a prologue to one of goldsmiths comedies  the repeated expulsion of wilkes from his seat by a vote of the house of commons had in 1770 thrown the nation into a ferment johnson was roused to take the side of the ministry and endeavoured in a pamphlet called the false alarm as much by ridicule as by argument to support a violent and arbitrary measure it appears both from his conversation and his writings that he thought there was a point at which resistance might become justifiable and surely it is more advisable to check the encroachments of power at their beginning than to delay opposition till it cannot be resorted to without greater hazard to the public safety the ministry were happily compelled to give way they were however glad to have so powerful an arm to fight their battles and in the next year 1771 employed him in a worthier cause in his tract on the falkland islands the materials for which were furnished him by government he appears to have much the better of the argument for he has to shew the folly of involving the nation in a war for a questionable right and a possession of doubtful advantage but his invective against his opponents is very coarse he does not perform the work of dissection neatly he mangles rather than cuts when he applies the word gabble to the elocution of chatham we are tempted to compare him to one of the baser fowl spoken of by an ancient poet that clamour against the bird of jove  not many copies of this pamphlet had been dispersed when lord north stopped the sale and caused some alterations to be made for reasons which the author did not himself distinctly comprehend johnsons own opinion of these two political essays was that there was a subtlety of disquisition in the first that was worth all the fire of the second when questioned by boswell as to the truth of a report that they had obtained for him an addition to his pension of 200l a year he answered that excepting what had been paid him by the booksellers he had not got a farthing for them  about this time there was a project for enabling him to take a more distinguished part in politics the proposition for bringing him into the house of commons came from strahan the printer who was himself one of the members boswell has preserved the letter in which this zealous friend to johnson represented to one of the secretaries of state the services which might reasonably be expected from his eloquence and fidelity the reasons which rendered the application ineffectual have not been disclosed to us but it may be questioned whether his powers of reasoning could have been readily called forth on a stage so different from any to which he had been hitherto accustomed whether so late in life he could have obtained the habit of attending to speakers sometimes dull and sometimes perplexed or whether that dictatorial manner which easily conquered opposition in a small circle might not have been borne down by resentment or scorn in a large and mixed assembly johnson would most willingly have made the experiment and when reynolds repeated what burke had said of him that if he had come early into parliament he would certainly have been the greatest speaker that ever was there exclaimed i should like to try my hand now that we may proceed without interruption to the end of johnsons political career it should here he told that he published in 1774 a short pamphlet in support of his friend mr thrale who at that time was one of the candidates in a contested election and a zealous supporter of the government but his devotion to the powers that be never led him to so great lengths as in the following year 1775 when he wrote taxation no tyranny an answer to the resolutions and address of the american congress now that we look back with impartiality and coolness to the subject of dispute between the mother country and her colonies there are few i believe who do not acknowledge the americans to have been driven into resistance by claims which if they were not palpably unlawful were at least highly inexpedient and unjust but johnson was no statist with the nature of man taken individually and in the detail he was well acquainted but of men as incorporated into society of the relations between the governors and the governed and of all the complicated interests of polity and of civil life his knowledge was very limited biography was his favourite study history his aversion sooner than hear of the punic war says murphy he would be rude to the person that introduced the subject and as he told mr thrale when a gentleman one day spoke to him at the club of catilines conspiracy he withdrew his attention and thought about tom thumb in his taxation no tyranny having occasion to notice a reference made by the american congress to a passage in montesquieu he calls him in contempt the fanciful montesquieu yet this is the man of whom burke when his just horror of every thing fanciful in politics was at its height has passed the noblest eulogium that one modern has ever made on another and which the reader will pardon me if in my veneration for a great name i place here as an antidote to the detraction of johnson  place before your eyes such a man as montesquieu think of a genius not born in every country or every time a man gifted by nature with a penetrating aquiline eye with a judgment prepared with the most extensive erudition with an herculean robustness of mind and nerves not to be broken with labour a man who could spend twenty years in one pursuit think of a man like the universal patriarch of milton who had drawn up before him in his prophetic vision the whole series of the generations which were to issue from his loins a man capable of placing in review after having brought together from the east the west the north and the south from the coarseness of the rudest barbarism to the most refined and subtle civilization all the schemes of government which had ever prevailed amongst mankind weighing measuring collating and comparing them all joining fact with theory and calling into council upon all this infinite assemblage of things all the speculations which have fatigued the understandings of profound reasoners in all times let us then consider that all these were but so many preparatory steps to qualify a man and such a man tinctured with no national prejudice with no domestic affection to admire and to hold out to the admiration of mankind the constitution of englandappeal from the nero to the old institutes at the end  it is to be feared that the diploma of doctor of laws which was sent to johnson in the same year 1775 at the recommendation of lord north at that time chancellor of the university and prime minister was in some measure intended to be the reward of his obsequiousness in this instrument he is called with an hyperbole of praise which the university would perhaps now he more cautious of applying to any individual in literarum republica princeps jam et primarius  he had long meditated a visit to scotland in the company of boswell and was at length in 1773 prevailed on to set out where he went and what he saw and heard is sufficiently known by the relation which he gave the world next year in his journey to the western islands of scotland and in his letters to mrs thrale it cannot be said of him as he has said of gray that whoever reads his narrative wishes that to travel and to tell his travels had been more of his employment he seems to have proceeded on his way with the view of finding something at every turn on which to exercise his powers of argument or of raillery his mind is scarcely ever passive to the objects it encounters but shapes them to his own moods after we lay down his book little impression is left of the places through which he has passed and a strong one of his own character with his fellowtraveller though kindness sometimes made him overofficious he was so well pleased as to project a voyage up the baltic and a visit to the northern countries of europe in his society he had before indulged himself with a visionary scheme of sailing to iceland with his friend bathurst in 1774 he went with the thrales to the extremity of north wales a few trifling memoranda of this journey which were found among his papers have been lately published but as he wrote to boswell he found the country so little different from england that it offered nothing to the speculation of a traveller such was his apathy in a land    where each old poetic mountain     inspiration breathes around   every shade and hallowd fountain     murmurs deep a solemn sound  in the following year 1775 he made his usual visit to the midland counties and accompanied the thrales in a tour to paris from whence they returned by way of rouen this was the only time he was on the continent it is to be regretted that he left only some imperfect notes of his journey for there could scarcely have failed to be something that would have gratified our curiosity in his observations on the manners of a foreign country we find him in the next year 1776 removing from johnsons court no 7 to bolt court fleetstreet no 8 from whence at different times he made excursions to lichfield and ashbourne to bath with the thrales and in the autumn to brighthelmstone where mr thrale had a house this gentleman had for some time fed his expectations with the prospect of a journey to italy a man said johnson who has not been in italy is always conscious of an inferiority from his not having seen what it is expected a man should see the grand object of travelling is to see the shores of the mediterranean all our religion almost all our law almost all our arts almost all that sets us above savages has come to us from the shores of the mediterranean much as he had set his heart on this journey and magnificent as his conceptions were of the promised land he was employed with more advantage to his own country at home for at the solicitation of the booksellers he now 1777 undertook to write the lives of the english poets the judicious selection of the facts which he relates the vivacity of the narrative the profoundness of the observations and the terseness of the style render this the most entertaining as it is perhaps the most instructive of his works his criticisms indeed often betray either the want of a natural perception for the higher beauties of poetry or a taste unimproved by the diligent study of the most perfect models yet they are always acute lucid and original that his judgment is often warped by a political bias can scarcely be doubted but there is no good reason to suspect that it is ever perverted by malevolence or envy the booksellers left it to him to name his price which he modestly fixed at 200 guineas though as mr malone says 1000 or 1500 would have been readily given if he had asked it as he proceeded the work grew on his hands in 1781 it was completed and another 100l was voluntarily added to the sum which had been at first agreed on in the third edition which was called for in 1783 he made several alterations and additions of which to shew the unreasonableness of murmurs respecting improved editions it is related in the biographical dictionary 12 on the information of mr nichols that though they were printed separately and offered gratis to the purchasers of the former editions scarcely a single copy was demanded  this was the last of his literary labours nor do we hear of his writing any thing for the press in the meanwhile except such slight compositions as a prologue for a comedy by mr hugh kelly and a dedication to the king of the posthumous works of pearce bishop of rochester  his body was weighed down with disease and his mind clouded with apprehensions of death he sought for respite from these sufferings in the usual meansin short visits to his native place or to brighthelmstone and in the establishment of new clubs in 1781 another of these societies was by his desire formed in the city it was to meet at the queens arms in st pauls churchyard and his wish was that no patriot should be admitted he now returned to the use of wine which when he did take it he swallowed greedily  about this time mr thrale died leaving johnson one of his executors with a legacy of 200l the death of levett in the same year and of miss williams in 1783 left him yet more lonely a few months before the last of these deprivations befel him he had a warning of his own dissolution which he could not easily mistake the night of the 16th of june on which day he had been sitting for his picture he perceived himself soon after going to bed to be seized with a sudden confusion and indistinctness in his head which seemed to him to last about half a minute his first fear was lest his intellect should be affected of this he made experiment by turning into latin verse a short prayer which he had breathed out for the averting of that calamity the lines were not good but he knew that they were not so and concluded his faculties to be unimpaired soon after he was conscious of having suffered a paralytic stroke which had taken away his speech i had no pain he observed afterwards and so little dejection in this dreadful state that i wondered at my own apathy and considered that perhaps death itself when it should come would excite less horror than seems now to attend it in hopes of stimulating the vocal organs he swallowed two drams and agitated his body into violent motion but it was to no purpose whereupon he returned to his bed and as he thought fell asleep in the morning finding that he had the use of his hand he was in the act of writing a note to his servant when the man entered he then wrote a card to his friend and neighbour mr allen the printer but not without difficulty his hand sometimes he knew not why making a different letter from that which he intended his next care was to acquaint dr taylor his old schoolfellow and now a prebendary of westminster with his condition and to desire he would come and bring dr heberden with him at the same time he sent in for dr brocklesby who was his near neighbour the next day his speech was restored and he perceived no deterioration either in his memory or understanding in the following month he was well enough to pass a week at rochester with mr langton and to appear again at the literary club and at the end of august to make a visit to mr bowles at heale near salisbury where he continued about three weeks  on his return to london he was confined to the house by a fit of the gout a disorder which had once attacked him but with less violence ten years before and to which he was now reconciled by being taught to consider it as an antagonist to the palsy to this was added a sarcocele which as it threatened to render excision necessary caused him more uneasiness though he looked forward to the operation with sufficient courage but the complaint subsided of itself  when he was able to go about again that society might be insured to him at least three days in the week another club was founded at the essex head in essex street where an old servant of mr thrales was the landlord its principles he said were to be laid in frequency and frugality and he drew up a set of rules which he prefaced with two lines from a sonnet of milton    today resolve deep thoughts with me to drench   in mirth that after no repenting draws  the number was limited to twentyfour each member present engaged himself to spend at least sixpence and to pay a forfeit of threepence if he did not attend but even here in the clubroom after his sixpence was duly laid down and the arm chair taken there was no security for him against the intrusion of those maladies which had so often assailed him on the first night of meeting 13th of december 1783 he was seized with a spasmodic asthma and hardly made his way home to his own house where the dropsy combined with asthma to hold him a prisoner for more than four months an occurrence during his illness which he mentioned to boswell deserves notice from the insight which it gives into his peculiar frame of mind he had shut himself up and employed a day in particular exercises of religionfasting humiliation and prayer on a sudden he obtained extraordinary relief for which he looked up to heaven with grateful devotion he made no direct inference from the fact but from his manner of telling it adds boswell i could perceive that it appeared to him as something more than an incident in the common course of events yet at this time with all his aspirations after a state of greater perfectness he was not able to bear the candour of langton who when johnson him desired to tell him sincerely wherein he had observed his life to be faulty brought him a sheet of paper on which were written many texts of scripture recommendatory of christian meekness  at the beginning of june he had sufficiently rallied his strength to set out with boswell for oxford where he remained about a fortnight with dr adams the master of pembroke his old college in his discourse there was the same alternation of gloominess and gaiety the same promptness of repartee and keenness of sarcasm as there had ever been  several of his friends were now anxious that he should escape the rigour of an english winter by repairing to italy a measure which his physicians recommended not very earnestly indeed and more i think in compliance with his known wishes than in expectation of much benefit to his health it was thought requisite however that some addition should previously be made to his income in order to his maintaining an appearance somewhat suitable to the character which he had established throughout europe by his writings for this purpose boswell addressed an application to the ministry through lord thurlow who was then chancellor after some accidental delay and some unsuccessful negotiation on the part of lord thurlow who was well disposed to befriend him during which time johnson was again buoyed up with the prospect of visiting italy an answer was returned which left him no reason to expect from government any further assistance than that which he was then receiving in the pension already granted him this refusal the chancellor accompanied with a munificent offer of supply out of his own purse which he endeavoured to convey in such a manner as should least alarm the independent spirit of johnson it would be a reflection on us all said thurlow if such a man should perish for want of the means to take care of his health the abilities of thurlow had always been held in high estimation by johnson who had been heard to say of him i would prepare myself for no man in england but lord thurlow when i am to meet with him i should wish to know a day before one day while this scheme was pending johnson being at the house of sir joshua reynolds was overcome by the tenderness of his friends and by the near view as he thought of this longhoped italian tour being effected and exclaimed with much emotion god bless you all and then after a short silence again repeating the words in a form yet more solemn was no longer able to command his feelings but hurried away to regain his composure in solitude  after all these efforts johnson was fated to disappointment and the authors of his disappointment have incurred the sentence denounced on them by the humanity of thurlow in this dr brocklesby the physician has no share for by him a noble offer of £100 a year was made to johnson during his life  in the meantime he had paid the summer visit which had now become almost an annual one to his daughterinlaw at lichfield from whence he made an excursion to dr taylors at ashbourne and to chatsworth still labouring under his asthma but willing to believe that as floyer the celebrated physician of his native city had been allowed to pant on till near ninety so he might also yet pant on a little longer whilst he was on this journey he translated an ode of horace and composed several prayers as he passed through birmingham and oxford he once more hailed his old schoolfellow hector and his fellow collegian adams it is delightful to see early intimacies thus enduring through all the accidents of life local attachments unsevered by time and the old age and childhood of man bound together by these natural charities the same willow tree which johnson had known when a boy was still his favourite and still flourishing in the meadow near lichfield hector whom i can remember several years after a man of erect form and grave deportment still met him with the same or perhaps more cordiality than in their first days and the virtues of adams which he had seen opening in their early promise had now grown up to full maturity to london he returned only to prove that death was not the terrible thing which he had fancied it he arrived there on the 15th of november in little more than a fortnight after when dr brocklesby with whom three other eminent physicians and a chirurgeon were in the habit of attending him gratuitously was paying him a morning visit he said that he had been as a dying man all night and then with much emphasis repeated the words of macbeth    canst thou not minister to a mind diseased   pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow   raze out the written troubles of the brain   and with some sweet oblivious antidote   cleanse the foul bosom of that perilous stuff   which weighs upon the heart  to which brocklesby promptly returned the answer which is made by the doctor in that play  therein the patient   must minister unto himself  he now committed to the flames a large mass of papers among which were two 4to volumes containing a particular account of his life from his earliest recollections  his few remaining days were occasionally cheered by the presence of such men as have been collected about a deathbed in few ages and countries of the worldlangton reynolds windham and burke of these none was more attentive to him than mr langton of whom he had been heard to say i could almost wish anima mea sit cum langtono and whom he now addressed in the tender words of tibullus    te teneam moriens deficiente manu  at another time burke who was sitting with him in the company of four or five others expressed his fear that so large a number might be oppressive to him no sir said johnson it is not so and i must be in a wretched state indeed when your company would not be a delight to me burkes voice trembled when he replied my dear sir you have always been too good to me these were the last words that passed between them mr windham having settled a pillow for him he thanked him for his kindness  this will do said he all that a pillow can do of sir joshua reynolds he made three requests which were readily granted to forgive him thirty pounds which he had borrowed of him to read the bible and never to use his pencil on a sunday the church service was frequently read to him by some clergyman of his acquaintance on one of these occasions when mr nichols was present he cried out to mr hoole who was reading the litany louder my dear sir louder i entreat you or you pray in vain and when the service was done he turned to a lady who had come to pray with him and said to her with much earnestness i thank you madam very heartily for your kindness in joining me in this solemn service live well i conjure you and you will not feel the compunction at the last which i now feel  he entreated dr brocklesby to dismiss any vain speculative opinions that he might entertain and to settle his mind on the great truths of christianity he then insisted on his writing down the purport of their conversation and when he had done made him affix his signature to the paper and urged him to keep it for the remainder of his life the following is the account communicated to boswell by this affectionate physician who was very free from any suspicion of fanaticism as indeed is well shewn by johnsons discourse with him  for some time before his death all his fears were calmed and absorbed by the prevalence of his faith and his trust in the merits and propitiation of jesus christ he talked often to me about the necessity of faith in the sacrifice of jesus as necessary beyond all good works whatever for the salvation of mankind he pressed me to study dr clarke and to read his sermons i asked him why he pressed dr clarke an arian because said he he is fullest on the propitiatory sacrifice this was the more remarkable because his prejudice against clarke on account of the arianism imputed to him had formerly been so strong that he made it a rule not to admit his name into his dictionary  he desired dr brocklesby to tell him whether he could recover charging him to give a direct answer the doctor having first asked whether he could bear to hear the whole truth told him that without a miracle he could not recover then said johnson i will take no more physic or even opiates for i have prayed that i may render up my soul to god unclouded he not only kept this resolution but abstained from all food excepting such as was of the weakest kind when mr windham pressed him to take something more generous lest too poor a diet should produce the effects which he dreaded i will take any thing said he but inebriating sustenance  mr strahan the clergyman who administered to him the comforts of religion affirmed that after having been much agitated he became tranquil and continued so to the last  on the eighth and ninth of december he made his will by which he bequeathed the chief of his property to francis barber his negro servant the value of this legacy is estimated by sir john hawkins at near £1500 from this time he languished on till the twelfth that night his bodily uneasiness increased his attendants assisted him every hour to raise himself in his bed and move his legs which were in much pain each time he prayed fervently the only support he took was cyder and water he said he was prepared but the time to his dissolution seemed long at six in the morning he inquired the hour and being told observed that all went on regularly and that he had but a few hours to live in two hours after he ordered his servant to bring him a drawer out of which he chose one lancet from amongst some others and pierced his legs and then seizing a pair of scissars that lay near him plunged them into both his calves no doubt with the hopes of easing them of the water for he had often reproached his medical attendants with want of courage in not scarifying them more deeply at ten he dismissed mr windhams servant who was one of those who had sat up with him thanking him and desiring him to bear his remembrance to his master afterwards a miss morris the daughter of one of his friends came into the room to beg his blessing of which being informed by his servant francis he turned round in his bed and said to her god bless you my dear about seven in the evening he expired so quietly that those about him did not perceive his departure his body being opened two of the valves of the aorta were found to be ossified the air cells of the lungs unusually distended one of the kidneys consumed and the liver schirrous a stone as large as a common gooseberry was in the gallbladder  on the 20th of december he was interred in westminster abbey

confidence suggested to him that he would be better employed in writing a life of spenser by which he might gratify the king who was known to be fond of that poet he replied that he would readily do it if he could obtain any new materials  his stature was unusually high and his person large and well proportioned but he was rendered uncouth in his appearance by the scars which his scrophulous disease had impressed upon him by convulsive motions and by the slovenliness of his garb his eyes of which the sight was very imperfect were of a light grey colour yet had withal a wildness and penetration and at times a fierceness of expression that could not be encountered without a sensation of fear he had a strange way of making inarticulate sounds or of muttering to himself in a voice loud enough to be overheard what was passing in his thoughts when in company thus one day when he was on a visit to davies the bookseller whose pretty wife is spoken of by churchill he was heard repeating part of the lords prayer and on his saying lead us not into temptation davies turned round and whispered his wife you are the occasion of this my dear  it is said by boswell that his temperament was so morbid that he never knew the natural joy of a free and vigorous use of his limbs when he walked it was the struggling gait of one in fetters when he rode he had no command or direction of his horse but was carried as if in a balloon his daily habits were exceedingly irregular he took his meals at unusual hours and either ate voraciously or abstained rigorously he studied by fits and starts but when he did read it was with such rapidity and eagerness that as some one said it seemed as if he would tear out the heart of the book he was upon he could with difficulty believe any one who spoke of having read any book from the beginning to the end his mode of composition was in like manner vigorous and hasty though his sentences have all the appearance of being measured but it was his custom to speak no less than to write with a studious attention to the numerousness of his phrase so that he was enabled to do that by habit which others usually accomplish by a particular effort  in matters of fact his regard to truth was so punctilious that it was observed he always talked as if he was talking upon oath and he was desirous of exacting the same preciseness from those over whom he had authority or influence he had however a practice that was not entirely consistent with this love of veracity for he would sometimes defend that side of a question which he thought wrong because it afforded him a more favourable opportunity of exhibiting his reasoning or his wit thus when he began why sir as to the good or evil of cardplaying garrick would make this arch comment on his proem now he is considering which side he shall take it may he urged that his hearers were aware of this propensity which he had  to make the worse appear   the better argument  and were therefore in no danger of being misled by it but an excuse of the same kind will serve for the common liar that he is known and therefore disbelieved it behoved him to be the more scrupulous in this particular because he knew that boswell took minutes of his ordinary conversation some of his idle sophisms which thus became current have i fear led to serious mischief such as the opinion that an author may be at liberty to deny his having written a book to which he has not affixed his name his extenuation of incontinence in the master of a family and the gloss he put on the crime of covetousness which last error was not confined to his conversation but mingled itself with his writings though no one could well be freer from any taint of the vice in his own life many a man may have indulged his inclinations to evil with much less compunction while he has imagined himself sheltered under the sanction of the moralist who watches one side of the entrance into the nave of st pauls  there was in his mind a strange mixture of credulity and doubtfulness he did not disbelieve either in the existence of ghosts or in the possibility of commuting other metals into gold but was very slow to credit any fact that was at all extraordinary he would tell of caves having seen an apparition without much apparent doubt and with more certainty of his having been himself addressed by the voice of his absent mother the deception practised by the girl in cock lane who was a ventriloquist is well known to have wrought on him so successfully as to make him go and watch in the church where she pretended the spirit of a young woman to be which had disclosed to her the manner of its having been violently separated from the body on this occasion boswell endeavours in vain to clear him from the imputation of a weakness which was but too agreeable to the rest of his character yet on humes argument against miracles that it is more probable witnesses should lie or be mistaken than that they should happen he remarked as i think very judiciously that hume taking the proposition simply is right but that the christian revelation is not proved by the miracles alone but as they are connected with prophecies and with the doctrines in confirmation of which the miracles were wrought  he was devout moral and humane frequent and earnest in his petitions for the divine succour anxious to sublime his nature by disengaging it from worldly soil and prompt to sympathise with the sorrows and out of his scanty means to relieve the necessities of others but such is the imperfection of man that his piety was apt to degenerate into superstition his abstinence yielded to slight temptations and his charity was often not proof against a discrepancy of opinion either in politics or literature  among his friends beauclerk seems most to have engaged his love langton his respect and burke his admiration the first was conspicuous for wit liveliness of feelings and gaiety the next for rectitude of conduct piety and learning the last for knowledge sagacity and eloquence his praise of reynolds that he was the most invulnerable of men one of whom if he had a quarrel with him he should find it the most difficult to say any ill was praise rather of the negative kind the younger warton he contrived to alienate from him as is related in the life of that poet there was indeed an entire harmony in their political principles but questions of literature touch an author yet more sensibly than those of state and the idem sentire de republica was an imperfect bond of amity between men who appreciated so differently the comus and lycidas of milton and the bucolics of theocritus to savage and goldsmith he was attached by similarity of fortunes and pursuits a yet closer bond of sympathy united him with collins as the reader will see in the following extracts from letters which he wrote to dr warton  how little can we exult in any intellectual powers or literary entertainments when we see the fate of poor collins i knew him a few years ago full of hopes and full of projects versed in many languages high in fancy and strong in retention this busy and forcible mind is now under the government of those who lately would not have been able to comprehend the least and most narrow of its designsmarch 8 1754  poor dear collins let me know whether you think it would give him pleasure that i should write to him i have often been near his state and therefore have it in great commisseration     what becomes of poor dear collins i wrote him a letter which he never answered i suppose writing is very troublesome to him that man is no common loss the moralists all talk of the uncertainty of fortune and the transitoriness of beauty but it is yet more dreadful to consider that the powers of the mind are equally liable to change that understanding may make its appearance and depart that it may blaze and expireapril 15 175614  difference of opinion respecting the american war did not separate him from burke and fox and when the nation was afterwards divided by the struggle between the court and populace on one side and the aristocracy on the other though his principles determined him to that party in which he found the person though perhaps not the interests of his sovereign yet his affections continued with the great leader in the house of commons who was opposed to it i am said he for the king against fox but i am for fox against pitt the king is my master but i do not know pitt and fox is my friend and to burke when he was a candidate for a seat in the new parliament he wished as he told him with a smile all the success that an honest man could wish him even towards wilkes his asperity was softened down into good humour by their meeting together over a plentiful table at the house of dilly the bookseller  when he had offended any by contradiction or rudeness it was seldom long before he sought to be reconciled and forgiven but though his private enmities were easily appeased yet where he considered the cause of truth to be concerned his resentment was vehement and unrelenting that imposture particularly which he with good reason supposed macpherson to have practised on the world with respect to the poems of ossian provoked him to vengeance such as the occasion seemed hardly to demand  of his dry pleasantry in conversation there are many instances recorded when one of his acquaintances had introduced him to his brother at the same time telling him that he would find him become very agreeable after he had been some time in his company he replied sir i can wait to a stupid justice of the peace who had wearied him with a long account of his having caused four convicts to be condemned to transportation he answered i heartily wish i were a fifth a repartee that calls to our mind horaces answer to the impertinent fellow    omnes composui felices mine ego resto  a physician endeavouring to bring to his recollection that he had been in his company once before mentioned among other circumstances his having that day worn so fine a coat that it could not but have attracted his notice sir said johnson had you been dipped in pactolus i should not have noticed you he could on occasion be more polite and complimentary when mrs siddons with whom in a letter to mrs thrale he expressed himself highly pleased paid him a visit there happened not to be any chair ready for her madam said he you who so often occasion the want of seats to others will the more readily excuse the want of one yourself  his scholarship was rather various than accurate or profound yet dr burney the younger supposed him capable of giving a greek word for almost every english one romances were always a favourite kind of reading with him felixmarte of hircania was his regular study during part of a summer which he spent in the country at the parsonagehouse of dr percy on a journey to derbyshire when he had in view his italian expedition he took with him il palermino dinghilterra to refresh his knowledge of the language to this taste he had been heard to impute his unsettled disposition and his averseness from the choice of any profession one of the most singular qualities of his mind was the rapidity with which it was able to seize and master almost any subject however abstruse or novel that was offered to its speculation to this quickness of apprehension was joined an extraordinary power of memory so that he was able to recall at pleasure most passages of a book which had once strongly impressed him in his sixtyfourth year he attempted to acquire the low dutch language he had a perpetual thirst of knowledge and six months before his death requested dr burney to teach him the scale of music teach me said johnson to him at least the alphabet of your language what he knew he loved to communicate according to that description of the stupossibly studentrest of words missing in original in chaucer    gladly would he teach and gladly learn  these endowments were accompanied with a copiousness of words in which it would be difficult to name any writer except barrow that has surpassed him yet his prose style is very far from affording a model that can safely be proposed for our imitation he seems to exert his powers of intellect and of language indiscriminately and with equal effort on the smallest and the most important occasions and the effect is something similar to that of a chinese painting in which though all the objects separately taken are accurately described yet the whole is entirely wanting in a proper relief of perspective what is observed by milton of the conduct of life may be applied to composition that there is a scale of higher and lower duties and he who confuses it will infallibly fall short of that proportion which is necessary to excellence no less in matters of taste than of morals  he was more intent in balancing the period than in developing the thought or image that was present to his mind sometimes we find that he multiplies words without amplifying the sense and that the ear is gratified at the expense of the understanding this is more particularly the case in the ramblers which being called for at short and stated intervals were sometimes composed in such haste that he had not leasure even to read them before they were printed nor can we wonder at the dissatisfaction he expressed some years afterwards when he exclaimed that he thought they had been better in the idler there is more brevity and consequently more compression  when johnson trusts to his own strong understanding in a matter of which he has the full command and does not aim at setting it off by futile decorations he is always respectable and sometimes great but when he attempts the ornamental he is heavy and inelegant and the awkwardness of his efforts is more perceptible from the hugeness of the body that is put in motion to produce them he is like the animal whom milton describes as making sport for our first parents in paradise               th unwieldy elephant   to make them mirth used all his might  it is a good beast for carrying a burden or trampling down a foe but a very indifferent one at a lavolta or a coranto  his swelling style is readily counterfeited our common advertisements have amply revenged themselves for his ridicule of their large promises in the idler by clothing those promises in language as magnificent as his own it is much less easy to catch the subtle graces of addison at the conclusion of the rambler he boasts that he has laboured to refine our language to grammatical purity and to clear it from colloquial barbarisms licentious idioms and irregular combinations  the result of his labour is awkward stateliness and irksome uniformity in his dread of incongruous idioms he writes almost without any idiom at all  he has sometimes been considered as having innovated on our tongue by introducing big words into it from the latin but he commonly does no more than revive terms which had been employed by our old writers and afterwards fallen into disuse nor does he like them employ even these terms in senses which scholars only would be likely to understand  at the time of writing the dictionary he had a notion that our language for almost a century had been departing from its original teutonic character and deviating towards a gallic structure and phraseology from which it ought to be our endeavour to recall it by making our ancient volumes the groundwork of style admitting among the additions of later times only such as may supply real deficiencies such as are readily adopted by the genius of our tongue and incorporate easily with our native idiom but a little reflection will shew us the vanity of this attempt since the age of chaucer at least that is for more than 400 years our language has been increased by continual transfusions from the french to these have been added from time to time similar accessions from other languages both ancient and modern thus a copiousness and a flexibility which in the instance of the greek seem to have arisen out of that subtilty of intellect which gave birth to endless subdivision and distinction have been in some measure compensated in our own by the influxes which it has received from the languages of many other people and have been yet further improved by that liberty which it is to be hoped we shall always retain each man of speaking his thoughts after his own guise without too much regard to any set mode or fashion  he had before said in this same preface that our knowledge of the northern literature is so scanty that of words undoubtedly teutonic the original is not always to be found in any ancient language and i have therefore he adds inserted dutch or german substitutes which i consider not as radical but parallel not as the parents but sisters of the english and in his history of the english language speaking of our saxon ancestors to whom we must i suppose go for that teutonic original which he so strongly recommends he observes that their speech having been always cursory and extemporaneous must have been artless and unconnected without any modes of transition or involution of clauses which abruptness and inconnection may be found even in their later writings of the additions which have been made to this our original poverty who shall say what ought to be rejected and what retained who shall say what deficiencies are real and what imaginary what the genius of our tongue may admit of and what it must refuse and in a word what that native idiom is a coalition with which is to be thus studiously consulted  throughout his lives of the poets he constantly betrays a want of relish for the more abstracted graces of the art when strong sense and reasoning were to be judged of these he was able to appreciate justly when the passions or characters were described he could to a certain extent decide whether they were described truly or no but as far as poetry has relation to the kindred arts of music and painting to both of which he was confessedly insensible it could not be expected that he should have much perception of its excellences of statuary he said that its value was owing to its difficulty and that a fellow will hack half a year at a block of marble to make something in stone that nearly resembles a man what shall be thought of his assertion that before the time of dryden there was no poetical diction no system of words at once refined from the grossness of domestic use and free from the harshness of terms appropriated to particular arts and that words too familiar or too remote defeat the purpose of a poet it might with more show of reason be affirmed that in proportion as our writers have adopted such a system as he speaks of and have rejected words for no other cause than that they were either too familiar or too remote we have been receding from the proper language of poetry one of the chief ornaments or more properly speaking the constituents of poetical language is the use of metaphors and metaphors never find their way to the mind more readily or affect it more powerfully than when they are clothed in familiar words even a naked sentiment will lose none of its force from being conveyed in the most homely terms which our mother tongue can afford they are the sounds which we have been used to from our infancy which have been early connected with our hopes and fears and still continue to meet us in our own homes and by our firesides that will most certainly awaken those feelings with which the poet is chiefly concerned as for the terms which johnson calls remote if i understand him rightly they too may be employed occasionally either when the attention is to be roused by something unusual or for the sake of harmony or it may be for no other reason than because the poet chooses thus to diversify his diction so as to give a stronger relief to that which is familiar and common by the juxtaposition of its contrary of this there can be no doubt that whoever lays down such arbitrary rules as johnson has here prescribed will find himself mocked at every turn by the power of genius which meets with nothing in art or nature that it cannot convert to its own use and which delights to produce the greatest effects by means apparently the most inadequate  he particularly valued himself on the life of cowley for the sake of those observations which he had introduced into it on the metaphysical poets here he has mistaken the character of marino whom he supposes to be at the head of them marino abounds in puerile conceits but they are not farfetched like those of donne and cowley they generally lie on the surface and often consist of nothing more than a mere play upon words so that if to be a punster is to be a metaphysician marino is a poetical heraclitus but johnson had caught the cant of the age in which it was usual to designate almost any thing absurd or extravagant by the name of metaphysical  it is difficult to suppose that he had read some of the works on which he passes a summary sentence the comedy of loves riddle which he says adds little to the wonders of cowleys minority deserved to be commended at least for the style which is a specimen of pure and unaffected english of congreves novel he tells us that he had rather praise it than read it judging from the letters of congreve his only writings in prose which it has been my good fortune to meet with and which as i remember contain some admirable remarks on the distinction between wit and humour i should conclude that one part of his character as a writer has yet to make its way to the public notice i have heard it observed by a lady that johnson in his life of milton is like a dog incensed and terrified at the presence of some superior creature at whom he snarls then runs away and then returns to snarl again if the comparison be a just one it may be added in extenuation of johnsons malignity that he is at least a dog who thinks himself to be attacking the inveterate foe of his master for miltons hostility to a kingly government was the crime which he could not forgive  the mention of milton and of his politics brings to my mind two sayings of johnsons that were related to me by mr price of lichfield after passing an evening together at mr sewards the father of the poetess where in the course of conversation the words me miserable in paradise lost had been commended as highly pathetic they had walked some way along the street in silence which the good man was not likely first to break when johnson suddenly stopped and turning round to him exclaimed sir dont you think that me miserable is miserable stuff on another occasion he thus whimsically described the different manner in which he felt himself disposed towards a whig and a tory if said he i saw a whig and a tory drowning i would first save the tory and when i saw that he was safe not till then i would go and help the whig but the dog should duck first the dog should duck laughing with pleasure at the thoughts of the whigs ducking  the principal charm of the lives of the poets is in the store of information which they contain he had been as he says somewhere of his own father no careless observer of the passages of the times in the course of a long life he had heard and read and seen much and this he communicates with such force and vivacity and illustrates by observations so pertinent and striking that we recur again and again to his pages as we would to so many portraits traced by the hand of a great master in spite of our belief that the originals were often misrepresented that some were flattered and the defects of others still more overcharged in his very errors as a critic there is often shewn more ability than in the right judgments of most other when he is most wrong he gives us some good reason for his being so he is often mistaken but never trivial and insipid it is more safe to trust to him when he commends than when he dispraises when he enlarges the boundaries of criticism which his predecessors had contracted than when he sets up new fences of his own the higher station we can take the more those petty limits will disappear which confine excellence to particular forms and systems the critic who condemns that which the generality of mankind or even the few of those more refined in their taste have long agreed in admiring may naturally conclude the fault to be in himself that there is in his mind or his organs some want of capacity for the reception of a certain species of pleasure when johnson rejected pastoral comedy as being representative of scenes adapted chiefly to please barbarians and children he might have suspected that his own eyesight rather than pastoral comedy was to blame when he characterized blank verse as verse only to the eye he might reasonably have questioned the powers of his own hearing but this and more than this we may forgive him for his successful vindication of shakspeare from the faults objected to him by the french critics  it is in his biographical works that johnson is most pleasing and most instructive his querulousness takes away much both from the agreeableness and the use of his moral writings addison has represented our nature in its most attractive forms but swift makes us turn with loathing from its deformities and johnson causes us to shudder at its misery  like most of the writers of that time he made use of his poetry only as the means of introducing himself to the public we cannot regret as in the case of goldsmith that he put it to no further service he took little delight in those appearances either of nature or art for which the poet ought to have the eye of a painter nor had he much more sense of the elegant in numbers and in sound there were indeed certain rounds of metrical arrangement which he loved to repeat but he could not go beyond them how very limited his perceptions of this kind were we may be convinced by reading his strictures on dionysius the halicarnassian in the rambler and the opinions on miltons versification which in the idler he has put into the mouth of a minute critic only to ridicule them though they are indeed founded in truth johnson was not one of those whom plato calls the greek philaekooi kai philotheamones who gladly acknowledge the beautiful wherever it is met with in sounds and colours and figures and all that is by art compounded from these much less had he ascended to that abstract notion of beauty which the same philosopher considers it so much more difficult to attain15  in his tragedy the dramatis personae are like so many statues stept from their pedestal to take the air they come on the stage only to utter pompous sentiments of morality turgid declamation and frigid similes yet there is throughout that strength of language that heavy mace of words with which as with the flail of talus johnson lays every thing prostrate before him this style is better suited to his imitations of the two satires of juvenal of the first of these the london gray in a letter to horace walpole says that to him it is one of those few imitations that has all the ease and all the spirit of an original the other is not at all inferior to it johnson was not insensible to such praise and could he have known how favourably gray had spoken of him would i doubt not have been more just to that poet whom besides the petulant criticism on him in his life he presumed in conversation to call a heavy fellow  in his shorter poems it appears as if nature could now and then thrust herself even into the bosom of johnson himself from whom we could scarcely have looked for such images as are to be found in the following stanzas    by gloomy twilight half reveald     with sighs we view the hoary hill   the leafless wood the naked field     the snowstoppd cot the frozen rill    no music warbles through the grove     no vivid colours paint the plain   no more with devious steps i rove     through verdant paths now sought in vain    aloud the driving tempest roars     congeald impetuous showers descend   haste close the window bar the doors    fate leaves me stella and a friend  sappho herself might have owned a touch of passionate tenderness that he has introduced into another of these little pieces              the queen of night   round us pours a lambent light   light that seems but just to show   breasts that beat and cheeks that glow  his latin poetry is not without a certain barbaric splendour but it discovers as might be expected no skill in the more refined graces of the augustan age the verse he quoted to thomas warton as his favourite from the translation of popes messiah    vallis aromaticas fundit saronica nubes  evinces that he could be pleased without elegance in a mode of composition of which elegance is the chief recommendation if we wished to impress foreigners with a favourable opinion of the taste which our countrymen have formed for the most perfect productions of the roman muse we should send them not to the pages of johnson but rather to those of milton gray warton and some of yet more recent date  it was the chance of johnson to fall upon an age that rated his great abilities at their full value his laboriousness had the appearance of something stupendous when there were many literary but few very learned men his vigour of intellect imposed upon the multitude an opinion of his wisdom from the solemn air and oracular tone in which he uniformly addressed them he would have been of less consequence in the days of elizabeth or of cromwell  footnotes 1 bulls fifth sermon 2 in a note to johnsons

armstrong  john armstrong the son of a scotch minister was born in the parish of castleton in roxburghshire the date of his birth has not been ascertained nor is there any thing known concerning the earlier part of his education the first we hear of it is that he took a degree in medicine at edinburgh on the fourth of february 1732 on which occasion he published his thesis as usual and chose de tabe purulenta for the subject of it a copy of a latin letter which he sent to sir hans sloane with this essay is said to be in the british museum in an advertisement prefixed to some verses which he calls imitations of shakspeare he informs the reader that the first of them was just finished when thomsons winter made its appearance this was in 1726 when he was he himself says very young thomson having heard of this production by a youth who was of the same country with himself desired to see it and was so much pleased with the attempt that he put it into the hands of aaron hill mallet and young with thomson further than in the subject there is no coincidence the manner is a caricature of shakspeares  in 1735 we find him in london publishing a humorous pamphlet entitled an essay for abridging the study of physic which though he did not profess himself the writer mr nichols says 1 he can on the best authority assert to be his in two years after he published a medical essay this was soon followed by a licentious poem which i have not seen and the title of which i do not think it necessary to record while thus employed it was not to be expected that he should rise to much eminence in his profession the dying man does not willingly see by his couch one who has recently disgraced himself by an open act of profligacy in january 1741 he solicited dr birch to use his influence with mead in recommending him to the appointment of physician to the forces which were then going to the west indies it does not appear that this application was successful but in five years more february 1746 he was nominated one of the physicians to the hospital for invalid soldiers behind buckingham house and in 1760 physician to the army in germany meantime in 1744 he had published his art of preserving health a didactic poem that soon made its way to notice and which by the judiciousness of the precepts might have tended to raise some opinion of his medical skill at the beginning he addresses mead              beloved by all the graceful arts   and long the favourite of the healing powers  he had now become intimate with thomson to whose castle of indolence he contributed the three stanzas which conclude the first canto one of the alterations made in them by thomson is not for the better he had written    and here the gout half tyger half a snake   raged with a hundred teeth a hundred stings  which was changed to    the sleepless gout here counts the crowing cocks   a wolf now gnaws him now a serpent stings  when thomson was seized with the illness of which he died armstrong was one of those who were sent for to attend him  in 1751 he published benevolence an epistle to eumenes and in 1753 taste an epistle to a young critic in the next year he wrote the forced marriage a tragedy which garrick did not think fitted for the stage it was printed in 1770 with such of his other writings as he considered worthy of being collected in this book which he entitled miscellanies in two volumes first appeared the second part of sketches or essays on various subjects by launcelot temple esq the former had been published in 1758 wilkes was supposed to have contributed something to these lively trifles which under an air of impertinent levity are sometimes marked by originality and discernment his poem called day an epistle which he had addressed to wilkes in 1761 was not admitted by the author to take its place among the rest for the dispute which gave rise to this omission he was afterwards sorry and in his last illness declared that what he had got in the army he owed to the kindness of wilkes and that although he had been rash and hasty he still retained a due sense of gratitude in attacking wilkes he contrived to exasperate churchill also who was not to be provoked with impunity and who revenged himself in the journey in 1771 he published a short ramble through some parts of france and italy in the neighbourhood of leghorn he passed a fortnight with smollett to whom he was always tenderly attached of his book i regret the more that i cannot speak from my own knowledge because the journey which it narrates is said to have been made in the society of mr fuseli with whom it is not easy to suppose that any one could have travelled without profiting by the elegance and learning of his companion i have no better means of bringing my reader acquainted with some medical essays which he published in 1773 but from the manner in which they are spoken of in the biographical dictionary 2 it is to be feared that they did not conduce to his reputation or advancement he died in september 1779 in consequence as it is said of a contusion which he received when he was getting into a carriage his friends were surprised to find he had laid by three thousand pounds which had been saved chiefly out of his halfpay  armstrong appears to have been goodnatured and indolent little versed in what is called the way of the world and with an eagerness of ostentation which looks like the result of mortified vanity a despiser of the vulgar whether found among the little or the great  his art of preserving health is the only production by which he is likely to be remembered the theme which he has chosen is one in which no man who lives long does not at some time or other feel an interest and he has handled it with considerable skill in the first book on air he has interwoven very pleasing descriptions both of particular places and of situations in general with reference to the effects they may be supposed to have on health the second which treats of diet is necessarily less attractive as the topic is less susceptible of ornament yet in speaking of water he has contrived to embellish it by some lines which are perhaps the finest in the poem    now come ye naiads to the fountains lead   now let me wander through your gelid reign   i burn to view th enthusiastic wilds   by mortals else untrod i hear the din   of waters thundring oer the ruind cliffs   with holy reverence i approach the rocks   whence glide the streams renownd in ancient song   here from the desart down the rumbling steep   first springs the nile here bursts the sounding po   in angry waves euphrates hence devolves   a mighty flood to water half the east   and there in gothic solitude reclind   the cheerless tanais pours his hoary urn   what solemn twilight what stupendous shades   enwrap these infant floods through every nerve   a sacred horror thrills a pleasing fear   glides oer my frame the forest deepens round   and more gigantic still th impending trees   stretch their extravagant arms athwart the gloom   are these the confines of another world   a land of genii say beyond these wilds   what unknown regions if indeed beyond   aught habitable lies  this has more majesty and more to fill the imagination than the corresponding paragraph in thomsons autumn    say then where lurk the vast eternal springs c771  yet it is inferior in beauty to some verses in a latin poem by a writer who is now living    quippe sub immensis terrae penetralibus altae   hiscunt in vastum tenebrae magnarum ibi princeps   labitur

the third book he once more breathes freely and in recounting the various kinds of exercise by which the human frame may be invigorated his poetic faculty again finds room to play joseph warton in his essay on pope has justly commended the episode on the sweating sickness with which it concludes in the fourth and last on the passions he seems to have grown weary of his task for he has here less compression and less dignity  his verse is much more compact than thomsons whom he resembles most in the turn of the expression although he has aimed now and then but with an illassured and timid hand at a miltonic boldness in the numbers or the phrase when he takes occasion to speak of the river with which his remembrances in early life were associated he has contrary to his usual custom indulged himself with enlarging on his prototype  thomson had mentioned incidentally the tweed and the jed    the tweed pure parent stream   whose pastoral banks first heard my doric reed   with sylvan jed thy tributary brookautumn 889   he has thus expanded it                           such the stream   on whose arcadian banks i first drew air   liddal till now except in doric lays   tund to her murmurs by

deeps calld forth the wanton swarms    b iii v 96  what he has here added of his love of fishing is from another passage in the seasons 3  but his imitations of other writers however frequent have no semblance of study or labour they seem to have been selfsuggested and to have glided tacitly and insensibly into the current of his thoughts this is evinced by the little pains he took to work upon and heighten such resemblances as he did not labour the details injudiciously so he had a clear conception of his matter as a whole the consequence is that the poem has that unity and just subordination of parts which renders it easy to be comprehended at one view and on that account more agreeable than the didactic poems of his contemporaries which having detached passages of much more splendour are yet wanting in those recommendations one objection to his subject is that it is least pleasing at that period of life when poetry is most so for it is not till the glow of youth is gone by and we begin to feel the infirmities and the coldness of age that we are disposed to bestow much attention on the art of preserving health  his tragedy is worth but little it appears from his essays that he had formed a contracted notion of nature as an object of imitation for the tragic poet and he has failed to give a faithful representation of nature even according to his own imperfect theory  the two short epistles on benevolence and taste have ease and vigour enough to shew that he could with a little practice have written as well in the couplet measure as he did in blank verse if armstrong cannot be styled a man of genius he is at least one of the most ingenious of our minor poets  footnotes 1 nicholss literary anecdotes vol ii p 307 c 2 chalmerss biographical dictionary vol

his mother was margaret daughter of wm parker a gentleman of henley in arden a neighbouring town in the same county he received the earlier part of his education at solihull under mr crumpton whom johnson in his life of shenstone calls an eminent schoolmaster here shenstone who was scarcely one year older and who according to johnson distinguished himself by the quickness of his progress imparted to jago his love of letters as the one in his schoolmistress has delivered to posterity the old dame who taught him to read the other has done the same for their common preceptor but with less ability and less kindness in his edgehill where he terms him pedagogue morose  at the usual time he was admitted a servitor of university college oxford his humble station in the university though it did not break off his intimacy with shenstone must have hindered them from associating openly together  in 1738 he took the degree of master of arts having been first ordained to the curacy of snitterfield a village near the benefice of his father who died two years after soon after that event he married dorothea susannah daughter of john fancourt rector of kimcote in leicestershire in 1746 he was instituted to harbury where he resided and about the same time was presented by lord willoughby de broke to chesterton which lay at a short distance both livings together amounting to about 100l a year in 1754 lord clare afterwards earl nugent obtained for him from dr madox bishop of worcester the vicarage of snitterfield worth about 140l after having inserted some small poems in dodsleys collection he published in 1767 edgehill for which he obtained a large subscription and in the following year the fable of labour and genius in 1771 his kind patron lord willoughby de broke added to his other preferment the rectory of kimcote worth nearly 300l in consequence of which he resigned harbury  his first wife died in 1751 leaving him seven children he had known her from childhood the attention paid her by shenstone shews her to have been an amiable woman in eight years after he married margaret daughter of james underwood esq of rugeley in staffordshire who survived him during the latter part of his life his infirmities confined him to the house he died after a short illness on the 8th of may 1781 and was buried in the church of snitterfield in his person he was above the middle stature his manner was reserved before strangers but easy even to sprightliness in the society of his friends he is said to have discharged blamelessly all the duties of his profession and of domestic life as a poet he is not entitled to very high commendation the distinguishing feature of his poetry is the ease of its diction johnson has observed that if blank verse be not tumid and gorgeous it is crippled prose to disprove this it would be sufficient to quote the greater part of that story from the tatler 1 of the young man restored to sight which jago has introduced into his edgehill nothing can be described more naturally than his feelings and behaviour on his first recovery    the friendly wound was given thobstructing film   drawn artfully aside and

poem is fertile and tame there was little left to him except to enlarge on its antiquities to speak of the habitations that were scattered over it and to compliment the most distinguished among their possessors every day must detract something from the interest such as it is that arises from these sources a poet should take care not to make the fund of his reputation liable to be affected by dilapidations or to be passed away by the hands of a conveyancer  it would seem as if he had never visited a tract of land much wilder than that in which he was bred and born in speaking of embattled walls raised on the mountain precipice he particularises beaudesert old montforts seat2a place which though it is pleasantly diversified with hill and dale has no pretensions of so lofty a kind this he tells us was the haunt of his youthful steps and here he met with somerville the poet of the chase to whom both the subject and the title of his poem might have been suggested by that extensive common known by the name of cannock chase3 on the border of which beaudesert is situated  the digressions with which he has endeavoured to enliven the monotony of his subject are sometimes very farfetched he has scarcely finished his exordium when he goes back to the third day of the creation and then passes on to the deluge this reminds one of the mock advocate in the plaideurs of racine

cambridge the son of a turkey merchant descended from a family long settled in gloucestershire was born in london on the fourteenth of february 1717 his father dying soon after his birth the care of his education devolved on his mother and his maternal uncle thomas owen esq a lawyer who had retired from practice to his seat in buckinghamshire and who having no children of his own adopted his nephew at an early age he was sent to eton where among his schoolfellows and associates were gray west jacob bryant the earl of orford and others eminent for wit or learning here he contracted not only a literary taste and habits of study but that preference for the quiet amusements of a country life which afterwards formed a part of his character in 1734 he was removed from eton to oxford and admitted a gentleman commoner of st johns college on the marriage of the prince of wales two years after he contributed some verses to the congratulatory poems from that university a ludicrous picture which he draws of academical festivity betrays the future author of the scribleriad    in flowing robes and squared caps advance   pallas their guide her everfavourd band   as they approach they join in mystic dance   large scrolls of paper waving in their hand   nearer they come i heard them sweetly sing  he left the university without taking a degree and in 1737 became a member of lincolns inn in four years after he married the second daughter of george trenchard esq of woolverton in dorsetshire who was member of parliament for poole and son of sir john trenchard secretary of state to king william retiring to his family mansion of whitminster in gloucestershire on the banks of the stroud he employed himself in making that stream navigable to its junction with the severn in improving his buildings and in ornamenting his grounds which lay pleasantly in the rich vale of berkeley here his happiness was interrupted by the death of one among his former playmates at eton whom he had most distinguished by his affection this was captain berkeley an officer who in those happy times when military men were not yet educated apart from scholars had added to his other accomplishments a love of letters and who fell in the battle of fontenoy this affliction discouraged him from proceeding in a poem on society which he had intended as a memorial of their friendship the opening does not promise well enough to make us regret its discontinuance  at whitminster he had the honour of entertaining the prince of wales with his consort and their daughter the late duchess dowager of brunswick then on a visit to lord bathurst at cirencester the royal guests were feasted in a vessel of his own constructing that was moored on a reach of the severn and the prince gratified him by declaring that he had often made similar attempts on the thames but never with equal success to the exercise of mechanical ingenuity in improving the art of boatbuilding he added uncommon skill in the use of the bow and arrow and had assembled all the varieties of those instruments that could be procured from different countries  he appears to have possessed in an unusual degree the power of suddenly ingratiating himself with those who conversed with him a gentleman who had never before seen him and who had reluctantly accompanied the prince in his aquatic expedition was so much pleased with cambridge as to be among the foremost to acknowledge his satisfaction and having been introduced by william whitehead then tutor to the earl of jerseys eldest son into the house of that nobleman he soon became a welcome guest and formed a lasting friendship with one of the family who was afterwards earl of clarendon in the number of his intimates he reckoned bathurst afterwards chancellor with whom an acquaintance begun at eton had been continued at lincolns inn carteret lyttelton grenville chesterfield yorke pitt and pulteney in order to facilitate his intercourse with such associates and perhaps in conformity with the advice of his departed friend berkeley who had recommended london as the proper stage for the display of his poetical talent he was induced to pass two of his winters in the capital but finding that the air of the town was injurious to his health in 1751 he purchased a residence at twickenham he had now another opportunity of showing his taste for rural embellishment in counteracting the effects of his predecessors formality in opening his lawns and grouping his trees with an art that wore the appearance of negligence an addition to his fortune by the decease of his uncle mr owen who left him his name together with his estate enabled him to gratify these propensities by some of his powerful friends he had been urged to obtain a seat in parliament and addict himself to a public life but he valued his tranquillity too highly to comply with their solicitations a sonnet addressed to him by his friend edwards author of the canons of criticism and which is not without elegance tended to confirm him in his resolve  in the year1 of his removal to twickenham the scribleriad was published a poem calculated to please the learned rather than the vulgar and with respect to which he had observed the rule of the nonum prematur in annum to the world the periodical paper undertaken soon after by moore and continued for four years he contributed twentyone numbers

attention  anson boscawen and indeed nearly all the distinguished seamen of his day were among his intimates or acquaintance and he assisted some of the principal navigators in drawing up the relations which they gave to the world of their discoveries in 1761 he was prompted by his apprehensions that the nation was not sufficiently on her guard against the endeavours making by the french to deprive her of her possessions in the east to publish a history of the war upon the coast of coromandel the great work undertaken by mr orme prevented him from pursuing the subject  continuing thus

youth to application by letting them see that a less degree of it than they apprehend judiciously directed and a very few books indeed well recommended will give them all the real information which they are to expect from human science the design was a laudable one in the poem itself we feel the want of some principal event on the development and issue of which the interest of the whole may turn as in those patterns of the mockheroic the secchia rapita the lutrin and the rape of the lock an advantage which these poems in some measure derive from having been founded in fact for however trifling the incident by which the imagination of the poet may have been first excited when once known or believed to be true it communicates something of its own reality to all the fictions that grow out of it the hero too is one of the greek amenaena karaena or rather is but the shadow of a shade for he has taken the character of martinus scriblerus as he found it in the memoirs of that unsubstantial personage the adventures indeed in which the author has engaged him though they did not require much power of invention are yet sufficiently ludicrous and we join perhaps more willingly

from writers ancient and modern to the purposes of a grave burlesque and for the application of these by a contrivance not very artificial it is sometimes necessary to recur to the notes the style if

                   tobias smollett  tobias smollett was born in the parish of cardross in dumbartonshire in the year 1721 his father archibald a scotch gentleman of small fortune was the youngest son of sir james smollett who was knighted on king williams accession represented the borough of dumbarton in the last scotch parliament and was of weight enough to be chosen one of the commissioners for framing the treaty of union between the two countries on his return from leyden where it was then the custom for young scotchmen to complete their education archibald married barbara the daughter of mr cunningham of gilbertfield near glasgow and died soon after the birth of our poet leaving him with another son and a daughter dependent on the bounty of their grandfather the place of smolletts nativity was endeared to him by its natural beauties insomuch that when he had an opportunity of comparing it with foreign countries he preferred the neighbouring lake of loch lomond to those most celebrated in switzerland and italy being placed at the school of dumbarton which was conducted by john love a man of some distinction as a scholar he is said to have exercised his poetical talents in writing satires on the other boys and in panegyrising his heroic countryman wallace from hence at the usual age he was removed to glasgow and there making choice of the study of medicine was apprenticed to mr john gordon a chirurgeon who afterwards took out a diploma and practised as a physician his irresistible propensity to burlesque did not suffer the peculiarities of this man whom he has represented under the character of potion in roderick random to escape him he made some amends for the indignity by introducing honourable mention of the name of dr gordon in the last of his novels a more overt act of contumacy to his superiors into which his vivacity hurried him trifling as it may appear is so characteristic that i cannot leave it untold a lad who was apprenticed to a neighbouring chirurgeon and with whom he had been engaged in frolic on a winters evening was receiving a severe reprimand from his master for quitting the shop and having alleged in his excuse that he had been hit by a snowball and had gone out in pursuit of the person who had thrown it was listening to the taunts of his master on the improbability of such a story how long said the son of aesculapius with the confident air of one fearless of contradiction might i stand here and such a thing not happen to me when smollett who stood behind the pillar of the shopdoor and heard what passed snatching up a snowball quickly delivered his playmate from the dilemma in which this question had placed him by an answer equally prompt and conclusive not content with this attack he afterwards made the offender sit for his wholelength portrait in the person as it is supposed of crab in the same novel  in the midst of these childish sallies he meditated greater things and the sound of the pestle and mortar did not prevent him from attending to the inspirations of melpomene at the age of eighteen he had composed a tragedy on the murder of james i the scottish monarch and about that time losing his grandfather by whom he had been supported and discovering that he must thenceforth rely on his own exertions for a maintenance he set forth with his juvenile production for london on his arrival there failing as might be expected to persuade the managers to bring his tragedy on the stage he solicited and obtained the place of a chirurgeons mate on board the fleet destined for the attack of carthagena of this illconducted and unfortunate expedition he not only made a sketch in his roderick random but afterwards inserted a more detailed account of it in the compendium of voyages after a short time he was so little pleased with his employment that he determined to relinquish it and remain in the west indies during his residence in jamaica he met with miss anne lascelles to whom after a few years he was married and with whom he expected to receive a fortune of three thousand pounds in the islands he probably depended for a subsistence on the exercise of his skill as a chirurgeon he returned to london in the year 1746 and though his family had distinguished themselves by their revolutionary principles testified his sympathy with the late sufferings of his countrymen in their expiring struggle for the house of stuart by some lines entitled the tears of scotland when warned of his indiscretion he added that concluding stanza of reproof to his timid counsellors    while the warm blood bedews my veins   and unimpaird remembrance reigns   resentment of my countrys fate   within my filial breast shall beat   and spite of her insulting foe   my sympathizing verse shall flow   mourn hapless caledonia mourn   thy banishd peace thy laurels torn  his first separate publication was advice a satire in the autumn of this year at the beginning of the next it was followed by a second part called reproof in which he took an occasion of venting his resentment against rich the manager of covent garden with whom he had quarrelled concerning an opera written by him for that theatre on the story of alcestis in consequence of their dispute the piece was not acted nor did he take the poets usual revenge by printing it  the fallacious prospects of his wifes possessions now encouraged him to settle himself in a better house and to live with more hospitality than his circumstances would allow him to maintain these difficulties were in some measure obviated by the sale of a new translation which he made of gil bias and still more by the success of roderick random which appeared in 1748 in none of his succeeding novels has he equalled the liveliness force and nature of this his first essay so just a picture of a seafaring life especially had never before met the public eye many of our naval heroes may probably trace the preference which has decided them in their choice of a profession to an early acquaintance with the pages of roderick random he has not indeed decorated his scenes with any seductive colours yet such is the charm of a highly wrought description that it often induces us to overlook what is disgusting in the objects themselves and transfer the pleasure arising from the mere imitation to the reality  strap was a man named lewis a bookbinder who came from scotland with smollett and who usually dined with him at chelsea on sundays in this book he also found a niche for the exhibition of his own distresses in the character of melopoyn the dramatic poet his applications to the directors of the theatre indeed continued so unavailing that he at length resolved to publish his unfortunate tragedy by subscription and in 1749 the regicide appeared with a preface in which he complained grievously of their neglect and of the faithlessness of his patrons among whom lord lyttelton particularly excited his indignation in the summer of this year his view of men and manners was extended by a journey to paris here he met with an acquaintance and countryman in doctor moore the author of zeluco who a few years after him had been also an apprentice to gordon at glasgow in his company smollett visited the principal objects of curiosity in the neighbourhood of the french metropolis  the canvas was soon stretched for a display of fresh follies and the result was his adventures of peregrine pickle in 1751 the success he had attained in exhibiting the characters of seamen led him to a repetition of similar delineations but though drawn in the same broad style of humour and if possible discriminated by a yet stronger hand the actors do not excite so keen an interest on shore as in their proper element the memoirs of a lady of quality the substance of which was communicated by the woman herself whose story they relate quickened the curiosity of his readers at the time and a considerable sum which he received for the insertion of them augmented the profits which he derived from a large impression of the work but they form a very disagreeable interruption in the main business of the narrative the pedantic physician was intended for a representation of akenside who had probably too much dignity to notice the affront for which some reparation was made by a compliment to his talents for didactic poetry in our authors history of england  on his return in 1749 he took his degree of doctor in medicine and settled himself at chelsea1 where he resided till 1763 the next effort of his pen an essay on the external use of water in a letter to dr with particular remarks upon the present method of using the mineral waters at bath in somersetshire c in 1752 was directed to views of professional advancement in his profession however he did not succeed and meeting with no encouragement in any other quarter he devoted himself henceforward to the service of the booksellers more novels translation historical compilation ephemeral criticism were the multifarious employments which they laid on him nothing that he afterwards produced quite came up to the raciness of his first performances in 1753 he published the adventures of ferdinand count fathom in the dedication of this novel he left a blank after the word doctor which may probably be supplied with the name of armstrong from certain phrases

charge of having intended to assassinate one of his countrymen whose name was peter gordon a few blows of the cane which after being provoked by repeated insolence he had laid across the shoulders of this man appeared to be the sole grounds for the accusation and he was therefore honourably acquitted by the jury a letter addressed to the prosecutors counsel who in smolletts opinion by the intemperance of his invective had abused the freedom of speech allowed on such occasions remains to attest the irritability and vehemence of his own temper the letter was either not sent or the lawyer had too much moderation to make it the subject of another action the consequences of which he could have ill borne for the expense incurred by the former suit was already more than he was able to defray at a time when pecuniary losses and disappointments in other quarters were pressing heavily upon him a person for whom he had given security in the sum of one hundred and eighty pounds had become a bankrupt and one remittance which he looked for from the east indies and another of more than a thousand pounds from jamaica failed him from the extremity to which these accidents reduced him he was extricated by the kindness of his friend doctor macaulay to which he had been before indebted and by the liberality of provost drummond who paid him a hundred pounds for revising the manuscript of his brother alexander drummonds travels through germany italy greece c which were printed in a folio volume in 1754 he had long anticipated the profits of his next work this was a translation of don quixote published at the beginning of 1755 lord woodhouselee in his essay on translation has observed that it is little else than an improvement of the version by jarvis on comparing a few passages with the original i perceive that he fails alike in representing the dignity of cervantes in the mockheroic and the familiarity of his lighter manner these are faults that might have been easily avoided by many a writer of much less natural abilities than smollett who wanted both the leisure and the command of style that were requisite for such an undertaking the time however which he gave to that great master was not thrown away he must have come back from the study with his mind refreshed and its powers invigorated by contemplating so nearly the most skilful delineation that had ever been made of human nature according to that view in which it most suited his own genius to look at it  on his return from a visit to scotland where a pleasant story is told of his being introduced to his mother as a stranger and of her discovery of him after some time with a burst of maternal affection in consequence of his smiling he engaged 1756 in an occupation that was not likely to make him a wiser and certainly did not make him a happier man the celebrity obtained by the monthly review had raised up a rival publication under the name of the critical the share which smollett had in the latter is left in some uncertainty doctor anderson tells us that he undertook the chief direction and mr nichols2 that he assisted archibald hamilton the printer whatever his part might be the performance of it was enough to waste his strength with ignoble labour to embitter his temper by useless altercation and to draw on him contempt and insult from those who however they surpassed him in learning could scarcely be regarded as his superiors in native vigour and fertility of mind sure i said gray in a letter to mason am something a better judge than all the manmidwives and presbyterian parsons that ever were born pray give me leave to ask you do you find yourself tickled with the commendations of such people for you have your share of these too i dare say not your vanity has certainly a better taste and can then the censure of such critics move you and warburton who had probably been exasperated in the same way called his history of england the nonsense of a vagabond scot  in the same year was published a compendium of authentic and entertaining voyages in seven volumes which was said to have been made under his superintendence we have his own word 3 that he had written a very small part of it in 1757 his reprisal or the tars of old england an entertainment in two acts in which the scene throughout is laid on board ship and which describes seamen in his usual happy vein was acted at drurylane with tolerable success in 1758 he published his history of england from the invasion of julius caesar to the treaty of aixlachapelle in 1748 four volumes of this work hasty as it was having been compiled in fourteen months ten thousand copies were speedily sold  some strictures in the critical review which in order to screen the printer of it he generously avowed himself to have written once more exposed him to a legal prosecution the offensive passages were occasioned by a pamphlet in which admiral knowles had vindicated himself from some reflections that were incidentally cast on him in the course of sir john mordaunts trial for the failure of a secret expedition on the coast of france near rochefort in his comments on the pamphlet smollett had stigmatized knowles the author of it as an admiral without conduct an engineer without knowledge an officer without resolution and a man without veracity it can scarcely be wondered if after such provocation the party injured was not deterred by menaces or diverted by proposals of agreement from seeking such reparation as the law would afford him this reparation the law did not fail to give and smollett was sentenced to pay a penalty of one hundred pounds and to be confined for three months in the prison of the kings bench cervantes wrote his don quixote in a gaol and smollett resolved since he was now in one that he would write a don quixote too it maybe said of the spaniard according to falstaffs boast that he is not only witty in himself but the cause that wit is in other men and among the many attempts at imitation to which the admirable original has given rise sir launcelot greaves is not one of the worst that a young man whose brain had been slightly affected by a disappointment in love should turn knighterrant at a time when books of chivalry were no longer in vogue is not indeed in the first instance very probable but we are contented to overlook this defect in favour of the many original touches of character and striking views of life particularly in the madhouse and the prison into which he leads his hero and which he has depicted with the force of hogarth if my recollection does not mislead me he will be found in some parts of this novel to have had before him the pharsamond of marivaux another copy of cervantes but it does not anywhere like count fathom betray symptoms of being a mere translation sir launcelot greaves was first printed piecemeal in the british magazine or monthly repository a miscellany to which goldsmith was also a contributor it has the recommendation of being much less gross and indelicate than any other of his novels  during the same period 1761 and 1762 he published in numbers four volumes of a continuation of his history of england and in 1765 a fifth which brought it down to that time  not contented with occupation under which an ordinary man would have sunk he undertook on the 29th of may 1762 to publish the briton a weekly paper in defence of the earl of bute on that day appointed first commissioner of the treasury and continued it till the 12th of february in the ensuing year about two months before the retirement of that nobleman from office by his patron he complained that he was not properly supported and he incurred the hostility of wilkes who had before been his staunch friend but who espoused the party in opposition to the minister by an attack the malignance of which no provocation could have justified  in 1763 his name was prefixed in conjunction with that of francklin the greek professor at cambridge and translator of sophocles and lucian to a version of the works of voltaire in twentyseven volumes to this he contributed according to his own account a small part including all the notes historical and critical to the modern universal history which was published about the same time he also acknowledged himself to be a contributor though of no very large portion  his life had hitherto been subjected to the toil and anxiety of one doomed to earn a precarious subsistence by his pen though designed by nature for the light and pleasant task of painting the humours and follies of men he had been compelled to undergo the work of a literary drudge though formed to enjoy the endearments of friendship his criticisms had made those who were before indifferent to him his enemies and his polities those whom he had loved the objects of his hatred the smile which the presence of his mother for a moment recalled had almost deserted his features still we may suppose it to have lightened them up occasionally in those hours of leisure when he was allowed to unbend himself in the society of a wife with whom he seems always to have lived happily and of an only daughter who was growing up to share with her his caresses and to whom both looked as the future support of their age    greek   tautae gegaetha kapilaethomai kakon   haed anti pollon esti moi

his distresses as an author but was now to feel calamity of a different kind this only daughter was taken from him by death in her fifteenth year henceforward he was with some short intervals a prey to querulousness and disease soon after this loss in june 1763 being resolved to try what change of climate would do for him he set out with his disconsolate partner on a journey through france and italy on quitting his own country he describes himself traduced by malice persecuted by faction abandoned by false patrons and overwhelmed by the sense of a private calamity which it was not in the power of fortune to repair the account which he published of this expedition on his return shews that he did not derive from it the relief which he had expected the spleen with which he contemplated every object that presented itself to him was ridiculed by sterne who gave him the name of smelfungus with this abatement the narration has much to interest and amuse and conveys some information by which a traveller might perhaps still profit when he brings before us the driver pointing to the gibbeted criminal whom he had himself betrayed and unconsciously discovering his own infamy to smollett we might suppose ourselves to be reading a highly wrought incident in one of his own fictions his prognostics of the approaching revolution in france are so remarkable that i am tempted to transcribe them the king of france in order to give strength and stability to his administration ought to have sense to adopt a sage plan of economy and vigour of mind sufficient to execute it in all its parts with the most rigorous exactness he ought to have courage enough to find fault and even to punish the delinquents of what quality soever they may be and the first act of reformation ought to be a total abolition of all the farms there are undoubtedly many marks of relaxation in the reins of the french government and in all probability the subjects of france will be the first to take the advantage of it there is at present a violent fermentation of different principles among them which under the reign of a very weak prince or during a long minority may produce a great change in the constitution in proportion to the progress of reason and philosophy which have made great advances in this kingdom kingfrom in original superstition loses ground ancient prejudices give way a spirit of freedom takes the ascendant all the learned laity of france detest the hierarchy as a plan of despotism founded on imposture and usurpation the protestants who are very numerous in the southern parts abhor it with all the rancour of religious fanaticism many of the commons enriched by commerce and manufacture grow impatient of those odious distinctions which exclude them from the honours and privileges due to their importance in the commonwealth and all the parliaments or tribunals of justice in the kingdom seem bent upon asserting their rights and independence in the face of the kings prerogative and even at the expense of his power and authority should any prince therefore be seduced by evil counsellors or misled by his own bigotry to take some arbitrary step that may be extremely disagreable to all those communities without having spirit to exert the violence of his power for the support of his measures he will become equally detested and despised and the influence of the commons will insensibly encroach upon the pretensions of the crown travels through france and italy c xxxvi smolletts works vol v p 536 this presentiment deserves to be classed with that prophecy of harrington in his oceana of which some were fond enough to hope the speedy fulfilment at the beginning of the revolution smollett passed the greater part of his time abroad at nice but proceeded also to rome and florence  about a year after he had returned from the continent in june 1766 he again visited his native country where he had the satisfaction to find his mother and sister still living at edinburgh he met with the two humes robertson adam smith blair and ferguson but the bodily ailments under which he was labouring left him little power of enjoying the society of men who had newly raised their country to so much eminence in literature to his friend dr moore then a chirurgeon at glasgow who accompanied him from that place to the banks of loch lomond he wrote in the february following that his expedition into scotland had been productive of nothing but misery and disgust adding that he was convinced his brain had been in some measure affected for that he had had a kind of coma vigil upon him from april to november without intermission he was at this time at bath where two chirurgeons whom he calls the most eminent in england and whose names were middleton and sharp had so far relieved him from some of the most painful symptoms of his malady particularly an inveterate ulcer in the arm that he pronounced himself to be better in health and spirits than during any part of the seven preceding years but the flattering appearance which his disorder assumed was not of long continuance a letter written to him by david hume on the 18th of july following shews that either the state of his health or the narrowness of his means or perhaps both these causes together made him desirous of obtaining the consulship of nice or leghorn but neither the solicitations of hume nor those of the duchess of hamilton could prevail on the minister lord shelburne to confer on him either of these appointments in the next year september 21 1768 the following paragraph in a letter from hume convinced him that he had nothing to expect from any consideration for his necessities in that quarter what is this you tell me of your perpetual exile and of your never returning to this country i hope that as this idea arose from the bad state of your health it will vanish on your recovery which from your past experience you may expect from those happier climates to which you are retiring after which the desire of revisiting your native country will probably return upon you unless the superior cheapness of foreign countries prove an obstacle and detain you there i could wish that means had been fallen on to remove this objection and that at least it might be equal to you to live anywhere except when the consideration of your health gave the preference to one climate above another but the indifference of ministers towards literature which has been long and indeed almost always is the case in england gives little prospect of any alteration in this particular  if ministers would in no other way conduce to his support he was determined to levy on them at least an involuntary contribution and accordingly in 1769 he published the adventures of an atom in which he laid about him to right and left and with a random humour somewhat resembling that of rabelais and swift made those whom he had defended and those whom he had attacked alike the subject of very gross merriment  but his sport and his suffering were now coming to a close the increased debility under which he felt himself sinking induced him again to try the influence of a more genial sky early in 1770 he set out with his wife for italy and after staying a short time at leghorn settled himself at monte nero near that port in a letter to caleb whitefoord dated the 18th of may he describes himself rusticated on the side of a mountain that overlooks the sea a most romantic and salutary situation one other flash broke from him in this retirement his novel called the expedition of humphry clinker which he sent to england to be printed in 1770 though abounding in portraitures of exquisite drollery and in situations highly comical has not the full zest and flavour of his earlier works the story does not move on with the same impetuosity the characters have more the appearance of being broad caricatures from real life than the creatures of a rich and teeming invention they seem rather the representation of individuals grotesquely designed and extravagantly coloured than of classes of men  his bodily strength now giving way by degrees while that of his mind remained unimpaired he expired at his residence near leghorn on the 21st of october 1771 in the 51st year of his age  his mother died a little before him his widow lived twelve years longer which she passed at leghorn in a state of unhappy dependence on the bounty of the merchants at that place and of a few friends in england out of her slender means she contrived to erect a monument to her deceased husband on which the following inscription from the pen of his friend armstrong was inscribed  hic ossa conduntur tobiae smollett scoti qui prosapia generosa et antiqua natus priscae virtutis exemplar emicuit aspectu ingenue corpore valido pectore animoso indole apprime benigna et fere supra facultates munifica insignis ingenio feraci faceto versatili omnigenae fere doctrinae mire capaci varia fabularum dulcedine vitam

also placed to commemorate him on the banks of his favourite leven near the house in which he was born by his kinsman mr smollett of bonhill  the person of smollett is described by his friend dr moore as stout and wellproportioned his countenance engaging and his manner reserved with a certain air of dignity that seemed to indicate a consciousness of his own powers  in his disposition he appears to have been careless improvident and sanguine easily swayed both in his commendation and censures of others by the reigning humour of the moment yet warm and when not influenced by the baneful spirit of faction steady in his attachments on his independence he particularly prided himself but that this was sometimes in danger from slight causes is apparent from an anecdote related by dr wooll in his life of joseph warton when huggins 4 had finished his translation of ariosto he sent a fat buck to smollett who at that time managed the critical review consequently the work was highly applauded but the history of the venison becoming public smollett was much abused and in a future number of the review retracted his applause perpetual employment of his pen left him little time for reflection or study hence though he acquired a greater readiness in the use of words his judgment was not proportionably improved nor did his manhood bear fruits that fully answered to the vigorous promise of his youth yet it may he questioned whether any other writer of english prose had before his time produced so great a number of works of invention when in addition to his novels we consider his various productions his histories his travels his two dramatic pieces his poems his translations his critical labours and other occasional publications we are surprised that so much should have been done in a life of no longer continuance  excepting congreve i do not remember that any of the poets whose lives have been written by johnson is said to have produced anything in the shape of a novel of the incognita of congreve that biographer observes not very satisfactorily that he would rather praise it than read it in the present series goldsmith smollett and johnson himself if his rasselas entitle him to rank in the number are among the most distinguished in this species of writing of whom modern europe can boast to these if there be added the names of de foe richardson fielding and sterne not to mention living authors we may produce such a phalanx as scarcely any other nation can equal indeed no other could afford a writer so wide a field for the exercise of this talent as ours where the fullest scope and encouragement are given to the human mind to expand itself in every direction and assume every shape and hue by the freedom of the government and by the complexity of civil and commercial interests no one has portrayed the whimsical varieties of character particularly in lower life with a happier vein of burlesque than smollett he delights indeed chiefly by his strong delineation of ludicrous incidents and grotesque manners derived from this source he does not hold our curiosity entangled by the involution of his story nor suspend it by any artful protraction of the main event he turns aside for no digression that may serve to display his own ingenuity or learning from the beginning to the end one adventure commonly rises up and follows upon another like so many waves of the sea which cease only because they have reached the shore    the billows float in order to the shore   the wave behind rolls on the wave before  admirable as the art of the novelist is we ought not to confound it with that of the poet nor to conclude because the characters of parson adams colonel bath and squire western in fielding and of strap morgan and pipes in smollett impress themselves as strongly on the memory and seem to be as really individuals whom we have seen and conversed with as many of those which are the most decidedly marked in shakspeare himself that therefore the powers requisite for producing such descriptions are as rare and extraordinary in one instance as in the other for the poet has this peculiar to himself that he communicates something from his own mind which at the same time that it does not prevent his personages from being kept equally distinct from one another raises them all above the level of our common nature shakspeare whom we appear not only to know personally but to admire and love as one superior to the cast of his kind     sweetest shakspeare fancys child  has left some trick of his own lineaments and features discoverable in the whole brood    igneus est ollis vigor et coelestis origo   seminibus  it is this which makes us willing to have our remembrance of his characters refreshed by constant repetition which gives us such a pleasure in summoning them before us as age cannot wither nor custom stale this is a quality which we do not find in fielding with all that consummate skill which he employs in developing his story nor in smollett with all that vivacity and heartiness of purpose with which he carries on his narrative  of smolletts poems much does not remain to be said the regicide is such a tragedy as might be expected from a clever youth of eighteen the language is declamatory the thoughts inflated and the limits of nature and verisimilitude transgressed in describing the characters and passions yet there are passages not wanting in poetical vigour  his two satires have so much of the rough flavour of juvenal as to retain some relish now that the occasion which produced them has passed away  the ode to independence which was not published till after his decease amid much of common place has some very nervous lines the personification itself is but an awkward one the term is scarcely abstract and general enough to be invested with the attributes of an ideal being  in the tears of scotland patriotism has made him eloquent and pathetic and the ode to leven water is sweet and natural none of the other pieces except the ode to mirth which has some sprightliness of fancy deserve to be particularly noticed   footnotes 1 he first settled at bathms addition ed 2 literary

killaloe prefixed to the edition of his poems published at oxford is drawn from sources so authentic and detailed with so much exactness that little remains to be added to the circumstances which it relates  thomas warton was descended from a very respectable family in yorkshire his grandfather anthony warton was rector of a village in hampshire and his father was a fellow of magdalen college and poetry professor in the university of oxford his mother daughter of joseph richardson who was also a clergyman gave birth to three childrenjoseph of whom some account will hereafter be given thomas and jane thomas was born at basingstoke in 1728 and very early in life afforded promise of his future excellence a letter addressed to his sister from school when he was about nine years of age containing an epigram on leander was preserved with affectionate regard by their brother dr warton what school it was that may claim the honour of contributing to the instruction of one who was afterwards so distinguished as a scholar has not been recorded  on the 16th of march 1743 he was admitted a commoner of trinity college oxford and about two years after lost his fathera volume of whose poems was soon after his death printed by subscription by his eldest son joseph with two elegiac poems to his memory one by the editor the other by his daughter abovementioned the latter of these tributes is termed by mr crowe in a note to one of his eloquent crewian orationsode tenera simplex venustatender simple and beautiful  in 1745 he published his pastoral eclogues which mr chalmers has added to the collection of his poems and in the same year he published without his name the pleasures of melancholy having perhaps been influenced in the choice of a subject thus sombre by the loss of his parent in this poem his imitations of milton are so frequent and palpable as to discover the timid flight of a young writer not daring to quit the track of his guide yet by some as appears from the letters between mrs carter and miss talbot it was ascribed to akenside in 1746 was produced his progress of discontentparaphrase on one of his own exercises made at the desire of dr huddesford the head of his college  his next effort attracted more general notice in consequence of some disgrace which the university had incurred with government by its supposed attachment to the stuart family mason had written his isis an elegy and in 1749 warton was encouraged by dr huddesford to publish an answer to it with the title of the triumph of isis it may naturally be supposed that so spirited a defence of oxford against the aspersions of her antagonist would be welcomed with ardour and among other testimonies of approbation which it received dr king whose character is eulogized in the poem coming into the booksellers shop and inquiring whether five guineas would be acceptable to the author left for him an order for that sum after an interval of twentyeight years his rival mason was probably sincere in the opinion he gavethat warton had much excelled him both in poetical imagery and in the correct flow of his versification  he now became a contributor to a monthly miscellany called the student in which besides his progress of discontent were inserted a panegyric on oxford ale a professed imitation of the splendid shilling the author confined to college and a version of the twentyninth chapter of job  his two degrees having been taken at about the usual intervals in 1751 he succeeded to a fellowship of his college where he found a peaceful and unenvied retreat for the remainder of his days without betraying any ambition of those dignitieswhich to the indignation of bishop warburton were not conferred upon him  at this time appeared his newmarket a satire an ode written for music performed in the university theatre and two copies of verses one in latin the other in english on the death of frederic prince of wales  in 1753 his ode on the approach of summerthe pastoral in the manner of spenserwhich has not much resemblance to that writer and verses inscribed on a beautiful grottowere printed in the union a poetical miscellany selected by him and edited at edinburgh  the next year we find him employed in drawing up a body of statutes for the radcliffe library by the desire of dr huddesford then vice chancellor in assisting colman and thornton in the connoisseur and in publishing his observations on the faerie queene of spenser which he afterwards enlarged from one to two volumes johnson complimented him for having shewn to all who should hereafter attempt the study of our ancient authors the way to success by directing them to the perusal of the books which their author had read a method of illustration which since certainly has not wanted imitators much of his time must have been now diverted from his favourite pursuits by his engagement in the instruction of college pupils during his excursions in the summer vacations to different parts of england he appears to have occupied himself in making remarks on such specimens of gothic and saxon architecture as came in his way his manuscript on this subject was in the possession of his brother since whose decease unfortunately it has not been discovered some incidental observations on our ancient buildings introduced into his book on the faerie queene are enough to make us regret the loss the poetical reader would have been better pleased if he had fulfilled an intention he had of translating the argonautics of apollonius rhodius  though it was not the lot of warton to attain distinction in his clerical profession yet literary honours more congenial to his taste and habits awaited him in 1756 he was elected professor of poetry at oxford and faithfully performed the duties of his office by recommending the purest models of antiquity in lectures which are said to have been remarkable for elegance of diction and justness of observation and interspersed with translations from the greek epigrammatists  to johnson he had already rendered a material service by his exertions to procure him the degree of master of arts by diploma and he increased the obligation by contributing some notes to his edition of shakspeare and three papers to the idler the imputation cast on one from whom such kindness had been received of his being the only man of genius without a heart must have been rather the effect of spleen in johnson than the result of just observation and if either these words or the verses in ridicule of his poems    endless labour all along   endless labour to be wrong   trickd in antique ruff and bonnet   ode and elegy and sonnet  had been officiously repeated to warton we cannot much wonder at what is told of his passing johnson in a booksellers shop without speaking or at the tears which johnson is related to have shed at that mark of alienation in his former friend  a description of winchester and a burlesque on the oxford guides or books professing to give an account of the university both anonymous are among the next publications attributed to his pen  in 1758 he made a selection of latin inscriptions in verse and printed it together with notes under the title of inscriptionum romanarum metricarum delectus and then first undertook at the suggestion it is said of judge blackstone the splendid edition of theocritus which made its appearance twelve years after the papers left by mr st amand1 formed the basis of this work to them were added some valuable criticisms by toup and though the arrangement of the whole may be justly charged with a want of clearness and order and dr gaisford has since employed much greater exactness and diligence in his edition of the same author yet the praise of a most entertaining and delightful variety cannot be denied to the notes of warton in a dissertation on the bucolic poetry of the greeks he shews that species of composition to have been derived from the ancient comedy and exposes the dream of a golden age    la bella eta dell or unqua non venne   nacque da nostre menti   entro il vago pensiero   e nel nostro desio chiaro divenne   guidi  the characters in theocritus are shewn to be distinguished into three classesherdsmen shepherds and goatherds the first of which was superior to the next as that in its turn was to the third and this distinction is proved to have been accurately observed as to allusions and images the discrimination seems to have been overlooked by virgil in which instance no less than in all the genuine graces of pastoral poetry he is inferior to the sicilian2 the contempt with which warton speaks of those eminent and unfortunate greek scholars who diffused the learning of their country over europe after the capture of constantinople and whom he has here termed graeculi famelici is surely reprehensible but for their labours britain might never have required an editor of theocritus  in 1760 he contributed to the biographia britannica a life of sir thomas pope twice subsequently published in a separate form with considerable enlargements in the two following years he wrote a life of dr bathurst and in his capacity of poetry professor composed verses on the death of george ii the marriage of his successor and the birth of the heir apparent which together with his complaint of cherwell made a part of the oxford collections several of his humorous pieces were soon after in 1764 published in the oxford sausage the preface to which he also wrote and in 1766 he edited the greek anthology of cephalas in 1767 he took the degree of bachelor in divinity and in 1771 was chosen a fellow of the antiquarian society and on the nomination of the earl of lichfield chancellor of the university was collated to the rectory of kiddington oxfordshire a benefice of small value ten years after he drew up a history of his parish and published it as a specimen of a parochial history of oxfordshire meanwhile he was engaged in an undertaking of higher interest to the national antiquities and literature  in illustrating the origin and tracing the progress of our vernacular poetry we had not kept pace with the industry of our continental neighbours to supply this deficiency a work had been projected by pope and was now contemplated and indeed entered on by gray and mason in conjunction we cannot but regret that gray relinquished the undertaking as he did on hearing into whose hands it had fallen since he would as the late publication of his papers by mr mathias has shewn have brought to the task a more accurate and extensive acquaintance with those foreign sources from whence our early writers derived much of their learning and would probably have adopted a better method and more precision in the general disposition of his materials yet there is no reason to complain of the way in which warton has acquitted himself as far as he has gone his history of english poetry is a rich mine in which if we have some trouble in separating the ore from the dross there is much precious metal to reward our pains the first volume of this laborious work was published in 1774 two others followed in 1778 and in 1781 and some progress had been made at his decease in printing the fourth in 1777 he increased the poetical treasure of his country by a volume of his own poems of which there was a demand for three other editions before his death in 1782 we find him presented by his college to the donative of hill farrance in somersetshire and employed in publishing an inquiry into the authenticity of the poems attributed to thomas rowley and verses on sir joshua reynoldss painted window at new college about the same time probably he was chosen a member of the literary club  in 1785 he edited miltons minor poems with very copious illustrations and in the year following was elected to the camden professorship of history and was appointed to succeed whitehead as poet laureate in his inaugural speech as camden professor subjoined to the edition of his poetical works by dr mant he has shewn that the public duties required at the first foundation of the professorship owing to the improvement in the course of academical studies are rendered no longer necessary from one who had already voluntarily done so much it would have been ungracious to exact the performance of public labours not indispensably requisite in the discharge of his function as laureate he still continued as he had long ago professed himself to be    too free in servile courtly phrase to fawn  and had the wish been gratifiedexpressed by himself before his appointment or by gibbon after itthat the annual tribute might be dispensed with we should have lost some of his best lyric effusions  till his sixtysecond year he had experienced no interruption to a vigorous state of health then a seizure of the gout compelled him to seek relief from the use of the bath waters and he returned from that place to college with the hope of a recovery from his complaint but on the 20th of may 1790 between ten and eleven oclock at night as he was sitting in the common room with two of the college fellows and in higher spirits than usual a paralytic affection deprived him of his speech some indistinct sounds only in which it was thought the name of his friend mr price the librarian of the bodleian was heard escaped him and he expired on the day but one after his funeral was honoured by the attendance of the vicechancellor and a numerous train of followers to the antechapel of his college where he is interred with a very plain inscription to his memory  his person was short and thick though in the earlier part of his life he had been thought handsome his face latterly became somewhat rubicund and his utterance so confused that johnson compared it to the gobbling of a turkey the portrait of him by reynolds besides the resemblance of the features is particularly characterized by the manner in which the hand is drawn so as to give it a great air of truth he was negligent in his dress and so little studious of appearances that having despatched his labours while others were yet in bed he might have been found at the usual hours of study loitering on the banks of his beloved cherwell or in the streets following the drum and fife a sound which was known to have irresistible attraction for his earsa spectator at a military parade or even one amongst a crowd at a public execution he retained to old age the amiable simplicity and unsuspecting frankness of boyhood his affection for his brother to whose society at winchester he latterly retired from college during the vacations in summer does not seem ever to have suffered any abatement and his manners were tranquil and unassuming the same amenity and candour of disposition which marked him in private life pervade his writings except on some few occasions when his mind is too much under the influence of party feelings this bias inclined him not only to treat the character of milton with a most undue asperity but even to extenuate the atrocities committed under the government of mary and somewhat to depreciate the worth of those divines whose attachment to the reformed religion led them to suffer death in her reign  the writer of this paper has been told by an italian who was acquainted with warton that his favourite book in the italian language of which his knowledge was far from exact was the gerusalemme liberata both the stately phrase and the theme of that poem were well suited to him  among the poets of the second class he deserves a distinguished place he is almost equally pleasing in his gayer and in his more exalted moods his mirth is without malice or indecency and his seriousness without gloom  in his lyrical pieces if we seek in vain for the variety and music of dryden the tender and moral sublime of gray or the enthusiasm of collins yet we recognize an attention ever awake to the appearances of nature and a mind stored with the images of classical and gothic antiquity though his diction is rugged it is like the cup in pindar which telamon stretches out to alcides greek chruso pephrkuan rough with gold and embost with curious imagery a lover of the ancients would perhaps be offended if the birthday ode beginning    within what fountains craggy cell   delights the goddess health to dwell  were compared as to its subject with that of the theban bard on the illness of hiero which opens with a wish that chiron were yet living in order that the poet might consult him on the case of the syracusan monarch and in its form with that in which he asks of his native city in whom of all her heroes she most delighted  among the odes some of which might more properly be termed idylliums the hamlet is of uncommon beauty the landscape is truly english and has the truth and tenderness of gainsboroughs pencil those to a friend on his leaving a village in hampshire and the first of april are entitled to similar praise the crusade the grave of king arthur and most of the odes composed for the court are in a higher strain in the ode written at vale royal abbey is a striking image borrowed from some lent verses written by archbishop markham and printed in the second volume of that collection    high oer the trackless heath at midnight seen   no more the windows ranged in long array   where the tall shaft and fretted arch between   thick ivy twines the taperd rites betray    prodidit areanas arcta fenestra faces  his sonnets have been highly and deservedly commended by no less competent a judge than mr coleridge they are alone sufficient to prove if any proof were wanting that this form of composition is not unsuited to our language one of our longest as it is one of our most beautiful poems the faerie queene is written in a stanza which demands the continual recurrence of an equal number of rhymes and the chief objection to our adopting the sonnet is the paucity of our rhymes  the lines to sir joshua reynolds are marked by the happy turn of the compliment and by the strength and harmony of the versification at least as far as the formal couplet measure will admit of those qualities they need not fear a comparison with the verses addressed by dryden to kneller or by pope to jervas  his latin compositions are nearly as excellent as his english the few hendecasyllables he has left have more of the vigour of catullus than those by flaminio but flaminio excels him in delicacy the mons catharinae contains nearly the same images as grays ode on a prospect of eton college in the word cedrinae which occurs in the verses on trinity college chapel he has we believe erroneously made the penultimate long dr mant has observed another mistake in his use of the word tempe as a feminine noun in the lines translated from akenside when in his sports with his brothers scholars at winchester he made their exercises for them he used to ask the boy how many faults he would haveone such would have been sufficient for a lad near the head of the school  his style in prose though marked by a character of magnificence is at times stiff and encumbered he is too fond of alliteration in prose as well as in verse and the cadence of his sentences is too evidently laboured  footnotes 1 there is a little memoir of james st amand in the preface that     will interest some readers he was of lincoln college oxford about     1705 where he had scarcely remained a year before his ardour for     greek literature induced him to visit italy chiefly with a view of     searching mss that might serve for an edition of theocritus in     italy before he had reached his twentieth year he was well known     to the learned world and had engaged the esteem of many eminent     men among others of vincenzo gravina niccolo valletto fontanini     quirino anton maria salvini and henry newton the english     ambassador to the duke of tuscany their letters to him are     preserved in the bodleian by his researches into the mss of     italian libraries he assisted his learned friends kuster le     clerc potter hudson and kennet and other literary characters of     that time in their several pursuits he then returned to england by     way of geneva and paris well laden with treasures derived from the     foreign libraries all which with a large collection of valuable     books he bequeathed to the bodleian he died about 1750 he     desisted from his intention of publishing theocritus either from     ill health or weariness of his work or some fear about its     success his preparations for this edition together with some notes     on pindar an edition of which he also meditated aristophanes the     argonautics of apollonius rhodius demosthenes and others remain     in the bodleian     dr shaw in his edition of apollonius rhodius has since made use     of his notes on that poet and pays a tribute to his critical     abilities in the preface 2 wartons distinction between them is well imagined     sinillis est theocritus amplo cuidam pascuo per se satis foecundo     herbis pluribus frugiferis floribusque pulchris abundanti dulcibus     etiam fluviis uvido similis virgilius horto distincto nitentibus     areolis ubi larga floruni copia sed qui studiose dispositi     curaque meliore nutriti atque exculti diligenter olim hue a pascuo     illo majore transferebantur                                         joseph warton  the memoirs of joseph warton by dr wooll the present headmaster of rugby school is a book which although it contains a faithful representation of his life and character by one who had been his pupil and though it is enriched with a collection of letters between some of the men most distinguished in literature during his time is yet so much less known than it deserves that in speaking of it to mr hayley who had been intimate with warton and to whom some of the letters are addressed i found him ignorant of its contents it will supply me with much of what i have to relate concerning the subject of it  there is no instance in this country of two brothers having been equally celebrated for their skill in poetry with joseph and thomas warton what has been already told of the parentage of the one renders it unnecessary to say more in this respect of the other he was born at dunsfold in surrey under the roof of his maternal grandfather in the beginning of 1722 like his brother he experienced the care of an affectionate parent who did the utmost his scanty means would allow to educate them both as scholars but with this difference that joseph being threeand twenty years old at the time of mr wartons decease whereas thomas was but seventeen was more capable of appreciating as it deserved the tenderness of such a father to what has been before said of this estimable man i have to add that his poems of which i had once a cursory view appeared to me to merit more notice than they have obtained and that his version of fracastorios pathetic lamentation on the death of his two sons particularly engaged my attention suavis adeo poeta ac doctus is the testimony borne to him by one1 who will himself have higher claims of the same kind on posterity  having been some time at new college school but principally taught by his father till he was fourteen years old joseph was then admitted on the foundation of winchester under dr sandby here together with two of his schoolfellows of whom collins was one he became a contributor to the gentlemans magazine johnson who then assisted in editing that miscellany had sagacity enough to distinguish from the rest a few lines that were sent by collins which though not remarkable for excellence ought now to take their place among his other poems  in 1740 warton being superannuated at winchester was entered of oriel college oxford and taking his bachelors degree in 1744 was ordained to his fathers curacy at basingstoke having lost his father about a year after he removed to the curacy of chelsea in february 1746 near this time i suppose a letter that is without date of time or place to have been written to his brother as it informs us of some particulars relating to collins of whom it is to be wished that more were known i am tempted to transcribe it    dear tomyou will wonder to see my name in an advertisement next   week so i thought i would apprize you of it the case was this   collins met me in surrey at guildford races when i wrote out for him   my odes and he likewise communicated some of his to me and being   both in very high spirits we took courage resolved to join our   forces and to publish them immediately i flatter myself that i   shall lose no honour by this publication because i believe these   odes as they now stand are infinitely the best things i ever wrote   you will see a very pretty one of collinss on the death of colonel   ross before tournay it is addressed to a lady who was rosss intimate   acquaintance and who by the way is miss bett goddard collins is   not to publish the odes unless he gets ten guineas for them    i returned from milford last night where i left collins with my   mother and sister and he sets out today for london i must now tell   you that i have sent him your imitation of horaces blandusian   fountain to be printed amongst ours and which you shall own or not   as you think proper i would not have done this without your consent   but because i think it very poetically and correctly done and will   get you honour                                         you will let me know what the oxford critics say adieu dear tom    i am your most affectionate brother    j warton  on this dr wooll founds a conjecture that warton published a volume of poems conjointly with his brother and collins but adds that after a diligent search he had not been able to discover it i think it more likely that the design was abandoned however this may be it is certain that he himself published a volume of odes in 1746 of which as i learn from a note to the present bishop of killaloes verses to his memory a second edition appeared in the following year to complete his recovery from the smallpox which he had taken at chelsea he went in may 1746 to chobham and then after officiating for a few months at chawton and droxford returned to his first curacy of basingstoke in the next year he was presented by the duke of bolton to the rectory of wynslade by which preferment he was enabled immediately to marry a young lady in that neighbourhood of the name of daman to whom he had been long attached of the country adjacent to wynslade thomas warton has given a very pleasing description in one of his sonnets and in an ode sent to a friend on his leaving a favourite village in hampshire both were written on the occasion of his brothers absence who had gone in the train of the duke of bolton to france one motive on which he went would not now be thought quite creditable to a clergyman it was that he might be at hand to join the duke in marriage to his mistress as soon as the duchess who was far gone in a dropsy should be no more warton set out reluctantly but with the hope that he might benefit his family by compliance he had not been away five months when the impatience for home came on him so strongly that he quitted montauban where the duke was residing and made his way towards england by such conveyances as he could meet with at one time in a couriers cart at another in the company of carriers who were travelling in britanny thus he scrambled on to bourdeaux and till he reached st malos where he took ship and landed at southampton when he had been returned a month the duchess died he then asked permission to go back and perform the marriage ceremony but the chaplain of the embassy at turin was already on his way for that purpose  he was now once more at wynslade restored to a domestic life and the uninterrupted pursuit of his studies before going abroad he had published in 1749 his ode on wests translation of pindar and after his return employed himself in writing papers chiefly on subjects of criticism for the adventurer and in preparing for the press an edition of virgil which in 1753 he published together with pitts translation of the aeneid his own of the eclogues and georgies his notes on the whole and several essays the book has been found useful for schools and was thought at the time to do him so much credit that it obtained for him the degree of master of arts by diploma from the university of oxford and no doubt was instrumental in recommending him to the place of second master of winchester school to which he was appointed in 1755 in the meantime he had been presented by the jervoise family to the rectory of tunworth and resided for a short time at that place  in 1756 appeared the first volume of his essay on the genius and writings of pope dedicated to young the name of the author was to have been concealed but he does not seem to have kept his own secret very carefully for it was immediately spoken of as his by akenside johnson and dr birch the second volume did not follow till after an interval of twentysix years the information contained in this essay which is better known than his other writings is such as the recollection of a scholar conversant in polite literature might easily have supplied he does not like his brother ransack the stores of antiquity for what has been forgotten but deserves to be recalled nor like hurd exercise on common materials a refinement that gives the air of novelty to that with which we have been long familiar he relaxes as johnson said of him the brow of criticism into a smile though no longer in his desk and gown he is still the benevolent and condescending instructor of youth a writer more capable of amusing and tempting onwards by some pleasant anticipations one who is a novice in letters than of satisfying the demands of those already initiated he deserves some praise for having been one of the first who attempted to moderate the extravagant admiration for pope whom he considered as the poet of reason rather than of fancy and to disengage us from the trammels of the french school some of those who followed have ventured much further with success but it was something to have broken the ice i do not know that he published anything else while he remained at winchester except2 an edition of sir philip sydneys defence of poesy and observations on eloquence and poetry from the discoveries of ben jonson in 1787 his literary exertions and the attention he paid to the duties of his school did not go unrewarded in 1766 he was advanced to the headmastership of winchester and took his two degrees in divinity in 1782 bishop lowth gave him a prebend of st pauls and the rectory of chorley which he was allowed to exchange for wickham in hants in 1788 through the intervention of lord shannon with mr pitt he obtained a prebend of winchester and soon after at the solicitation of lord malmesbury was presented by the bishop of that diocese to the rectory of easton which in the course of a twelvemonth he exchanged for upham  in his domestic relations he enjoyed as much happiness as prudence and affection could ensure him but not unembittered by those disastrous accidents to which every father of a family is exposed some years after his marriage 1763 his letters to his brother discover him struggling under his anguish for the loss of a favourite daughter who had died under inoculation but striving to conceal his feelings for the sake of a wife whom he tenderly loved in 1772 this wife was also taken from him leaving him with six children his second son thomas fellow of new college a man on whom the poetic spirit of the wartons had descended was found by him one day when he returned from the college prayers sitting in the chair in which he had left him after dinner without life it was the termination of a disease under which he had long laboured this happened in 1786 and before he had space to recover the blow in four years after his brother died in 1773 he had solaced himself by a second marriage with miss nicholas the daughter of robert nicholas esq in both his matrimonial connexions his sister described him as having been eminently fortunate  the latter part of his life was spent in retirement and tranquillity in 1793 he resigned the mastership of winchester and settled himself on his living of wickham he had intended to finish his brothers history of english poetry which wanted another volume to complete it and might now have found time enough to accomplish the task but an obstacle presented itself by which it is likely that he was discouraged from proceeding the description given by daniel prince a respectable old bookseller at oxford of the state in which his brothers rooms were found at his decease and of the fate that befell his manuscripts and his property may be edifying to some future fellow of a college who shall employ himself in similar pursuits3 poor thomas wartons papers were in a sad litter and his brother joe has made matters worse by confusedly cramming all together sending them to winchester c mr warton could not give so much as his old clothes his very shoes stockings and wigs laid about in abundance where could his money go it must lay in paper among his papers or be laid in a book he could not nor did not spend it and his brother on that score is greatly disappointed  a republication of popes works with notes offered him an easier occupation than the digesting of those scattered materials for the history of poetry which he had thus assisted in disarranging he was probably glad to escape from inaction and set himself to parcel out his essay into comments for this edition which in 1797 was published in nine volumes his indiscretion in adding to it some of popes productions which had been before excluded has been most bitterly censured that it would have been better to let them remain where they were can scarcely be questioned but i should be more willing to regard the insertion of them as proof of his own simplicity in suspecting no harm from what he had himself found to be harmless than of any design to communicate injury to others a long life passed without blame and in the faithful discharge of arduous duties ought to have secured him from this misconstruction at its close after all the pieces objected to are such as are more offensive to good manners than dangerous to morality there are some other of popes writings more likely to inflame the passions which yet no one scruples to read and dr wooll has suggested that it was inconsistent to set up the writer as a teacher of virtue and in the same breath to condemn his editor as a pander to vice  he bestowed on his censurers no more consideration than they deserved and went on to prepare an edition of dry den for the press two volumes with his notes were completed when his labours were finally broken off by a painful disease his malady was an affection of the kidneys which continued to harass him for some months and ended in a fatal paralysis on the twentythird of february 1800 in the seventyeighth year of his age  he was interred in the cathedral at winchester where by the contributions of his former scholars a monument executed by mr flaxman was raised to his memory of a design so elegant as the tomb of a poet has not often been honoured with it is inscribed with the following epitaph  hse josephus warton stp hujus ecclesiae prebendarius scolae wintoniensis per annos fere triginta informator poeta fervidus facilis expolitus criticus eruditus

resembled his brother but with more liveliness and more love of general society i have heard that in the carelessness of colloquial freedom he was apt to commit himself by hasty and undigested observations as he did not aim at being very oracular himself so he was unusually tolerant of ignorance in others of this a diverting instance is recorded by dr wooll meeting in company with a lady who was a kinswoman of popes he eagerly availed himself of the occasion offered for learning some new particulars concerning one by whom so much of his time and thoughts had been engaged pray sir began the lady did not you write a book about my cousin pope yes madam was the reply they tell me twas vastly clever he wrote a great many plays did not he was the next question i never heard but of one attempt madam said warton beginning perhaps to expect some discovery when his hopes were suddenly crushed by an oh no from the lady i beg your pardon sir that was mr shakspeare i always confound them he had the good breeding to conceal his disappointment and to take a courteous leave of the kinswoman of pope  he was regarded with great affection by those whom he had educated the opinions of a man so long experienced in the characters of children and in the best methods of instruction are on these subjects entitled to much notice he knew says his biographer and pupil that the human mind developed itself progressively but not always in the same consistent degrees or at periods uniformly similar he conjectured therefore that the most probable method of ensuring some valuable improvement to the generality of boys was not to exact what the generality are incapable of performing as a remedy for inaccurate construction arising either from apparent idleness or inability he highly approved and sedulously imposed translation modesty timidity or many other constitutional impediments may prevent a boy from displaying before his master and in the front of his class those talents of which privacy and a relief from these embarrassments will often give proof these sentiments were confirmed by that most infallible test experience as he declared within a few years of his death that the best scholars he had sent into the world were those whom whilst second master he had thus habituated to translation and given a capacity of comparing and associating the idiom of the dead languages with their own  it is pleasant to observe the impression which men who have engrossed to themselves the attention of posterity have made on one another when chance has brought them together of mason whom he fell in with at york he tells his brother that he is the most easy best natured agreeable man he ever met with in the next year he met with goldsmith and observed of him that of all solemn coxcombs he was the first yet sensible and that he affected to use johnsons hard words in conversation  soon after the first volume of his essay on pope had been published lyttleton then newly raised to the peerage gave him his scarf and submitted some of his writings before they were printed to his inspection  harris the author of hermes and lowth were others in whose friendship he might justly have prided himself  he was one of the few that did not shrink from a collision with johnson who could so ill endure a shock of this kind that on one occasion he cried out impatiently sir i am not used to contradiction  it would be better for yourself and your friends sir if you were was the natural retort their common friends interfered to prevent a ruder altercation  like johnson he delighted in london where he regularly indulged himself by passing the holidays at christmas his fondness for everything relating to a military life was a propensity that he shared with his brother and while the one might have been seen following a drum and fife at oxford the other by the sprightliness of his conversation had drawn a circle of red coats about him at the st jamess coffee house where he frequently breakfasted both of them were members of the literary club set on foot by sir joshua reynolds  this gaiety of temper did not hinder him from discharging his clerical office in a becoming manner his style of preaching we are told by mr wooll was unaffectedly earnest and impressive and the dignified solemnity with which he read the liturgy particularly the communion service was remarkably awful  his reputation as a critic and a scholar has preserved his poetry from neglect of his odes that to fancy written when he was very young is one that least disappoints us by a want of poetic feeling yet if we compare it with that by collins on the poetical character we shall see of how much higher beauty the same subject was capable in the ode to evening he has again tried his strength with collins there are some images of rural life in it that have the appearance of being drawn from nature and which therefore please   hail meekeyed maiden clad in sober grey whose soft approach the weary woodman loves as homeward bent to kiss his prattling babes he jocund whistles through the twilight groves                                                                         to the deep wood the clamorous rooks repair light skims the swallow oer the watery scene and from the sheepcotes and freshfurrowd field stout ploughmen meet to wrestle on the green  the swain that artless sings on yonder rock his nibbling sheep and lengthening shadow spies pleased with the cool the calm refreshful hour and the hoarse hummings of unnumberd flies  but these pretty stanzas are interrupted by the mention of phoebus the dryads old sylvan and pan the ode to content is in the same metre as his schoolfellows ode to evening but in the numbers it is very inferior both to that and to mrs barbaulds ode to spring  in his dying indian he has produced a few lines of extraordinary force and pathos the rest of his poems in blank verse are for the most part of an indifferent structure  in his translations from virgil he will probably be found to excel dryden as much in correctness as he falls short of him in animation and harmony  when his odes were first published gray perceived the author to be devoid of invention but praised him for a very poetical choice of expression and for a good ear and even thus perhaps a little overrated his powers but our lyric poetry was not then what it has since been made by gray himself the younger warton mason russell and one or two writers now living  if he had enjoyed more leisure it is probable that he might have written better for he was solicitous not to lose any distinction to be acquired by his poetry and took care to reclaim a copy of humorous verses entitled an epistle from thomas hearne which had been attributed by mistake to his brother among whose poems it is still printed  footnotes 1 mr crowe in one of his crewian orations 2 nicholss literary anecdotes vol ix 3 nicholss literary anecdotes vol ix                                         christopher anstey  an account of christopher anstey written by his second son is prefixed to the handsome edition of his works printed at london in 1808 he was born on the thirtyfirst of october 1724 and was the son of doctor anstey rector of brinkley in cambridgeshire a living in the gift of st johns college cambridge of which the doctor had formerly been fellow and tutor his mother was mary daughter of anthony thompson esq of trumpington in the same county they had no offspring but our poet and a daughter born some years before him  his father was afflicted with a total deafness for so considerable a portion of his life as never to have heard the sound of his sons voice and was thus rendered incapable of communicating to him that instruction which he might otherwise have derived from a parent endowed with remarkable acuteness of understanding he was therefore sent very early to school at bury st edmunds here he continued under the tuition of the rev arthur kinsman till he was removed to eton on the foundation of which school he was afterwards placed  his studies having been completed with great credit to himself under doctor george the headmaster of eton in the year 1742 he succeeded to a scholarship of kings college cambridge where his classical attainments were not neglected he was admitted in 1745 to a fellowship of his college and in the next year he took his degree of bachelor of arts he now resided chiefly in the university where his resistance to an innovation attempted to be introduced into kings college involved him in a dispute which occasioned the degree of master to be refused him that college had immemorially asserted for its members an exemption from the performance of those public exercises demanded of the rest of the university as a qualification for their degrees this right was now questioned and it was required of the bachelor fellows of kings that they should compose and pronounce a latin oration in the public schools such an infringement of privilege was not to be tamely endured after some opposition made by anstey in common with the other junior fellows the exercise in dispute was at lenth exacted but anstey who was the senior bachelor of the year and to whose lot it therefore fell first to deliver this obnoxious declamation contrived to frame it in such a manner as to cast a ridicule on the whole proceeding he was accordingly interrupted in the recitation of it and ordered to compose another in which at the same time that he pretended to exculpate himself from his former offence he continued in the same vein of raillery though his degree was withheld in consequence of this pertinacity yet it produced the desired effect of maintaining for the college its former freedom  while an undergraduate he had distinguished himself by his latin verses called the tripos verses and in 1748 by a poem in the same language on the peace printed in the cambridge collection  his quarrel with the senior part of the university did not deprive him of his fellowship he was still occasionally an inmate of the college and did not cease to be a fellow till he came into the possession of the family estate at his mothers death in 1754  in two years after he married anne third daughter of felix calvert esq of alburyhall in hertfordshire and the sister of john calvert esq one of his most intimate friends who was returned to that and many successive parliaments for the borough of hertford by this most excellent lady says his biographer with the amiable warmth of filial tenderness who was allowed to possess every endowment of person and qualification of mind and disposition which could render her interesting and attractive in domestic life and whom he justly regarded as the pattern of every virtue and the source of all his happiness he lived in uninterrupted and undiminished esteem and affection for nearly half a century and by her who for the happiness of her family is still living he had thirteen children of whom eight only survive him  this long period is little checquered with events having no taste for public business and his circumstances being easy and independent he passed the first fourteen years at his seat in cambridgeshire in an alternation of study and the recreations of rural life in which he took much pleasure but at the end of that time the loss of his sister gave a shock to his spirits which they did not speedily recover that she was a lady of superior talents is probable from her having been admitted to a friendship and correspondence with mrs montague then miss robinson the effect which this deprivation produced on him was such as to hasten the approach and perhaps to aggravate the violence of a bilious fever for the cure of which by doctor heberdens advice he visited bath and by the use of those waters was gradually restored to health  in 1766 he published his bath guide from the press of cambridge a poem which aiming at the popular follies of the day and being written in a very lively and uncommon style rapidly made its way to the favour of the public at its first appearance gray who was not easily pleased in a letter to one of his friends observed that it was the only thing in fashion and that it was a new and original kind of humour soon after the publication of the second edition he sold the copyright for two hundred pounds to dodsley and gave the profits previously accruing from the work to the general hospital at bath dodsley about ten years after his purchase candidly owned that the sale had been more productive to him than that of any other book in which he had before been concerned and with much liberality restored the copyright to the author  in 1767 he wrote a short elegy on the death of the marquis of tavistock and the patriot a pindaric epistle intended to bring into discredit the practice of prizefighting  not long after he was called to serve the office of highsheriff for the county of cambridge in 1770 he quitted his seat there for a house which he purchased in bath the greater convenience of obtaining instruction for a numerous family the education of which had hitherto been superintended by himself was one of the motives that induced him to this change of habitation  the heroic epistle to sir william chambers appearing soon after his arrival at bath and being by many imputed to a writer who had lately so much distinguished himself by his talent for satire he was at considerable pains to disavow that publication and by some lines containing a deserved compliment to his sovereign gave a sufficient pledge for the honesty of his disclaimer  in 1776 a poem entitled an election ball founded on a theme proposed by lady miller who held a sort of little poetical court at her villa at batheaston did not disappoint the expectations formed of the author of the bath guide it was at first written in the somersetshire dialect but was afterwards judiciously stripped of its provincialism  about 1786 he entertained a design of collecting his poems and publishing them together but the painful recollections which this task awakened of those friends and companions of his youth who had been separated from him by death during so long a period made him relinquish his intention he committed however to the press translations of some of gays fables which had been made into latin chiefly with a view to the improvement of his children an alcaic ode to doctor jenner on the discovery of the cowpock and several short poems in his own language his increasing years to use the words of his son stole inperceptibly on the even tenor of his life and gradually lessened the distance of his journey through it without obscuring the serenity of the prospect unimpeded by sickness and unclouded by sorrow or any serious misfortune his life was a life of temperance of selfdenial and of moderation in all things and of great regularity he rose early in the morning ante diem poscens chartas and was constant on horseback at his usual hour and in all seasons his summers were uniformly passed at cheltenham with his family during the latter part of his life and upon his return to bath in the autumn he fell habitually into the same unruffled scenes of domestic ease and tranquillity rendered every day more joyous and interesting to him by the increase of his family circle and the enlargement of his hospitable table and by many circumstances and occurrences connected with the welfare of his children which gave him infinite delight and satisfaction  at the beginning of 1805 he experienced a sudden and general failure of his bodily faculties and a correspondent depressure of mind the little confidence he placed in the power of medicine made him reluctantly comply with the wishes of his friends that he should take the opinion of doctor haygarth yet he was not without hope of alleviation to his complaints from change of air and therefore removed from bath to the house of his soninlaw mr bosanquet in wiltshire here having at first revived a little he soon relapsed and declining gradually expired in the eightyfirst year of his age without apparent suffering in the possession of his intellectual powers and according to the tender wish of pindar for one of his patrons  greek huion psaumi paristamenon  in the midst of his children  he was buried in the parish church of walcot in the city of bath in the same vault with his fourth daughter the wife of rearadmiral sotheby and her two infant children  a cenotaph has been erected to his memory among the poets of his country in westminster abbey by his eldest son the rev christopher anstey with the following inscription  ms christopheri anstey arm alumni etonensis et collegii regalis apud cantabrigienses olim socii poetae literis elegantioribus adprime ornati et inter principes poetarum qui in eodem genere floruerunt sedem eximiam tenentis ille annum circiter mdcclxx rus suum in agro cantabrigiensi

suae octogesimo primo  to this there is an encomium added which its prolixity hinders me from inserting  a painter and a poet were perhaps never more similar to each other in their talents than the contemporaries bunbury and anstey there is in both an admirable power of seizing the ludicrous and the grotesque in their descriptions of persons and incidents in familiar life and this accompanied by an elegance which might have seemed scarcely compatible with that power there is in both an absence of any extraordinary elevation or vigour which we do not regret because we can hardly conceive but that they would be less pleasing if they were in any respect different from what they are each possesses a perfect facility and command over his own peculiar manner which has secured him from having any successful imitator yet as they were both employed in representing the fortuitous and transient follies which the face of society had put on in their own day rather than in portraying the broader and more permanent distinctions of character and manners it may be questioned whether they can be much relished out of their own country and whether even there the effect must not be weakened as fatuity and absurdity shall discover new methods of fastening ridicule upon themselves they border more nearly on farce than comedy they have neither of them any thing of fancy that power which can give a new and higher interest to the laughable itself by mingling it with the marvellous and which has placed aristophanes so far above all his followers  when anstey ventures out of his own walk he does not succeed so well it is strange that he should have attempted a paraphrase of st pauls eulogium on charity after the same task had been so ably executed by prior if there is anything however that will bear repetition in a variety of forms it is that passage of scripture and his verses though not equal to priors may still be read with pleasure  the farmers daughter is a plain and affecting tale  his latin verses might well have been spared in the translation of grays elegy there is a more than usual crampness occasioned perhaps by his having rendered into hexameters the stanzas of four lines to which the elegiac measure of the romans would have been better suited the epistola poetica familiaris addressed to his friend mr bamfylde has more freedom his scholarship did him better service when it suggested to him passages in the poets of antiquity which he has parodied with singular happiness such is that imitated in one of simkins letters    do the gods such a noble ambition inspire   or a god do we make of each ardent desire  from virgils      dine hunc ardorem mentibus addunt     euryale an sua cuique deus fit dira cupido  a parody that is not the less diverting from its having been before gravely made by tasso        o dio linspira   o luom del suo voler suo dio si face  on the whole he has the rare merit of having discovered a mode of entertaining his readers which belongs exclusively to himself                                         william mason  it is to be regretted that no one of masons friends has thought fit to pay the same tribute of respect to his memory which he had himself paid to that of his two poetical friends gray and whitehead in this dearth of authentic biography we must be contented with such information concerning him as either his own writings or the incidental mention made of him by others will furnish  william mason was born on the 23rd of february 1725 at hull where his father who was vicar of st trinity resided whether he had any other preceptor in boyhood except his parent is not known  that this parent was a man of no common attainments appears from a poem which his son addressed to him when he had attained his twentyfirst year and in which he acknowledged with gratitude the instructions he had received from him in the arts of painting poetry and music in 1742 he was admitted of st johns college cambridge and there in 1744 the year in which pope died he wrote musaeus a monody on that poet and il bellicoso and il pacifico a very juvenile imitation as he properly calls it of the allegro and penseroso in 1745 he took his degree of bachelor of arts and in the ensuing year with a heavy heart and with some fear lest he should grow old in northern clime bade farewell to granta in an ode which commemorates the virtues of his tutor dr powell he soon however returned by his fathers permission visited london and removing from st johns college to pembroke hall was unexpectedly nominated fellow of that society in 1747 when by the advice of dr powell he published musaeus his fourth ode expresses his delight at the prospect of being restored to the banks of the cam in a letter to a friend written this year he boasts that his poem had already passed through three impressions at the same time he wrote his ode to a water nymph not without some fancy and elegance in which his passion for the new style of gardening first shewed itself as his political bias did the year after in isis a poem levelled against the supposed toryism of oxford and chiefly valuable for having called forth the triumph of isis by thomas warton to this he prefixed an advertisement declaring that it would never have appeared in print had not an interpolated copy published in a country newspaper scandalously misrepresented the principles of the author now commenced his intimacy with gray who was rather more than eight years his senior a disparity which at that period of life is apt to prevent men at college from uniting very closely his friend described him to dr wharton as having much fancy little judgment and a good deal of modesty i take him continued gray for a good and wellmeaning creature but then he is really in simplicity a child and loves every body he meets with he reads little or nothing writes abundance and that with a design to make his fortune by it on reviewing this character of himself twentyfive years after he confessed what cannot be matter of surprise that this interval had made a considerable abatement in his general philanthropy but denied having looked for more emolument from his publications than a few guineas to take him to a play or an opera grays next report of him after a years farther acquaintance is that he grows apace into his good graces as he knows him more that he is very ingenious with great good nature and simplicity a little vain but in so harmless and so comical a way that it does not offend one at all a little ambitious but withal so ignorant in the world and its ways that this does not hurt him in ones opinion so sincere and so undisguised that no mind with a spark of generosity would ever think of hurting him he lies so open to injury but so indolent that if he cannot overcome this habit all his good qualities will signify nothing at all at this time he published an ode on the installation of the duke of newcastle which his friend who was a laughing spectator of the ceremony considers the only entertainment that had any tolerable elegance and thinks it with some little abatements uncommonly well on such an occasion it was however very inferior to that which he himself composed when the duke of grafton was installed  his next production in 1751 was elfrida written on the model of the ancient greek tragedy a delicate exotic not made to thrive in our cold septentrion blasts and which when it was long after transferred to the theatre by colman was unable to endure the rough aspect of a british audience the poet complained of some trimming and altering that had been thought requisite by the manager on the occasion and colman it is said in return threatened him with a chorus of grecian washerwomen matters were no better when mason himself undertook to prepare it for the stage  in 1752 we find him recommended to lord rockingham by mr charles yorke who thought him said warburton likely to attach that lords liking to him as he was a young nobleman of elegance and loved painting and music in the following year he lost his father in the disposition of whose affairs he was less considered than he thought himself entitled to expect what the reason for this partiality was it would be vain to conjecture nor have we any means of knowing whether the disappointment determined him to the choice of a profession which he made soon after in 1754 when he entered into the church from the following passage in a letter of warburtons it appears that the step was not taken without some hesitation mr mason has called on me i found him yet unresolved whether he would take the living i said was the question about a mere secular employment i should blame him without reserve if he refused the offer but as i regarded going into orders in another light i frankly owned to him he ought not to go unless he had a call by which i meant i told him nothing fanatical or superstitious but an inclination and on that a resolution to dedicate all his studies to the science of religion and totally to abandon his poetry he entirely agreed with me in thinking that decency reputation and religion all required this sacrifice of him and that if he went into orders he intended to give it this was surely an absurd squeamishness in one of the same profession as warburton was who had begun his career by translations in prose and verse from latin writers had then mingled in the literary cabals of the day and afterwards did not think his time misemployed in editing and commenting on shakspeare and pope yet he was unreasonable enough to continue his expectations that mason should do what he had without any apparent compunction omitted to do himself for after speaking of brown the unfortunate author of barbarossa who was also an ecclesiastic he adds how much shall i honour one who has a stronger propensity to poetry and has got a greater name in it if he performs his promise to me of putting away these idle baggages after his sacred espousal after all this proved to be one of the vows at which jove laughs the sacred espousal did not lessen his devotion to the idle baggages and it is very doubtful whether he discharged his duties as kings chaplain or rector of aston for both which appointments he was indebted to the kindness of lord holdernesse at all the worse for this attachment which he was indeed barefaced enough to avow two years after by the publication of some of his odes at his rectory of aston in yorkshire he continued to live for great part of his remaining life with occasional absences in the metropolis at cambridge or at york where he was made precentor and canon of the cathedral and where his residence was therefore sometimes required i have not learnt whether he had any other preferment hurd in a letter written in 1768 mentions that the death of a dr atwell threw a good living into his hands be this as it might he was rich enough and had an annual income of about fifteen hundred pounds at his death lord orford says of him somewhere in his letters that he intended to have refused a bishopric if it had been offered him he might have spared himself the pains of coming to this resolution for mitres though they fell on many a critics head and on that of his friend hurd among the rest did not seem adapted to the brows of a poet when the death of cibber had made the laurel vacant he was informed that being in orders he was thought merely on that account less eligible for the office than a layman a reason said he so politely put i was glad to hear assigned and if i had thought it a weak one they who know me will readily believe that i am the last man in the world who would have attempted to controvert it of the laurel he probably was not more ambitious than of the mitre though he was still so obstinate as to believe that he might unite the characters of a clerk and a poet to which he would fain have superadded that of a statist also caractacus another tragedy on the ancient plan but which made a better figure on the stage appeared in 1759 and in 1762 three elegies in 1769 harris heard him preach at st jamess early prayers and give a fling at the french for the invasion of corsica thus politics added his hearer have entered the sanctuary the sermon is the sixth in his printed collection a fling at the french was at all times a favourite topic with him in the discourse delivered before george iii on the sunday preceding his coronation he has stretched the text a little that he may take occasion to descant on the blessings of civil liberty and has quoted montesquieus opinion of the british government in praising our religious toleration he is careful to justify our exception of the church of rome from the general indulgence nor was it in the pulpit only that he acted the politician he was one of those as we are told in the biographical dictionary who thought the decision of parliament on the middlesex election a violation of the rights of the people and when the counties began in 1779 to associate for parliamentary reform he took an active part in assisting their deliberations and wrote several patriotic manifestos in the same year appeared his ode to the naval officers of great britain on the trial of admiral keppel in which the poetry is strangled by the politics his harp was in better tune when in 1782 an ode to mr pitt declared the hopes he had conceived of the son of chatham for like many others who espoused the cause of freedom he had ranged himself among the partisans of the youthful statesman who was then doing all he could to persuade others as he had no doubt persuaded himself that he was one of the number  in the mean time gray who if he had lived longer might perhaps have restrained him from mixing in this turmoil was no more the office which he performed of biographer or rather of editor for his deceased friend has given us one of the most delightful books in its kind that our language can boast it is just that this acknowledgment should be made to mason although mr mathias has recently added many others of grays most valuable papers which his former editor was scarcely scholar enough to estimate as they deserved and mr mitford has shewn us that some omissions and perhaps some alterations were unnecessarily made by him in the letters themselves as to the task which the latter of these gentlemen imposed on himself few will think that every passage which he has admitted though there be nothing in any to detract from the real worth of gray could have been made public consistently with those sacred feelings of regard for his memory by which the mind of mason was impressed and that reluctance which he must have had to conquer before he resolved on the publication at all the following extract from a letter written by the rev edward jones brings us into the presence of mason and almost to an acquaintance with his thoughts at this time and on this occasion being at york in september 1771 gray died on the thirtieth of july preceding i was introduced to mr mason then in residence on my first visit he was sitting in an attitude of much attention to a drawing pinned up near the fireplace and another gentleman whom i afterwards found to be a mr varlet a miniature painter who has since settled at bath had evidently been in conversation with him about it my friend begged leave to ask whom it was intended to represent mr mason hesitated and looked earnestly at mr varlet i could not resist though i instantly felt a wish to have been silent saying surely from the strong likeness it must be the late mr gray mr mason at once certainly forgave the intrusion by asking my opinion as to his fears of having caricatured his poor friend the features were certainly softened down previously to the engraving1nicholss literary anecdotes vol ix p 718  in the next year 1772 appeared the first book of the english garden the other three followed separately in 1777 1779 and 1782 the very title of this poem was enough to induce a suspicion that the art which it taught if art it can be called was not founded on general and permanent principles it was rather a mode which the taste of the time and country had rendered prevalent and which the love of novelty is already supplanting in the neighbourhood of those buildings which man constructs for use or magnificence there is no reason why he should prefer irregularity to order or dispose his paths in curved lines rather than in straight homer when he describes the cavern of calypso covers it with a vine and scatters the alder the poplar and the cypress without any symmetry about it but near the palace of alcinous he lays out the garden by the rule and compass our first parents in paradise are placed by milton amidst     a happy rural seat of various view  but let the same poet represent himself in his pensive or his cheerful moods and he is at one time walking by hedgerow elms on hillocks green and at another in trim gardens when we are willing to escape from the tedium of uniformity nature and accident supply numberless varieties which we shall for the most part vainly strive to heighten and improve it is too much to say that we will use the face of the country as the painter does his canvas               take thy plastic spade   it is thy pencil take thy seeds thy plants   they are thy colours  the analogy can scarcely hold farther than in a parterre and even there very imperfectly mason could not hear to see his own system pushed to that excess into which it naturally led and bitterly resented the attempts made by the advocates of the picturesque to introduce into his landscapes more factitious wildness than he intended  in 1783 he published a translation from the latin of du fresnoys art of painting in which the precepts are more capable of being reduced to practice he had undertaken the task when young partly as an exercise in versification and partly to fix on his mind the principles of an art in which he had himself some skill sir joshua reynolds having desired to see it added some notes and induced him to revise and publish it the artist found in it the theory of ideal beauty which had been taught him by zachary mudge from the writings of plato and which enabled him to rise above the mere mechanism of his predecessors that masons version surpasses the original is not saying much in its praise in some prefatory lines addressed to reynolds he has described the character of dryden with much happiness  the last poem which he published separately was a secular ode on the revolution in 1688 it was formal and vapid but sufficed to shew that time though it had checked the lyric rapture had left him his ardour in the cause of freedom like the two leaders of the opposite parties pitt and fox he hailed with glad voice the dawn of french liberty it was only for the gifted eye of burke to foresee the storm that was impending  at the same time he recommended the cause of the enslaved negroes from the pulpit the abolition of the slave trade was one of the few political subjects the introduction of which seemed to be allowable in that place in 1788 appeared also his memoirs of william whitehead attached to the posthumous works of that writer a piece of biography as little to be compared in interest to the former as whitehead himself can be compared to gray  his old age glided on in solitude and peace amid his favourite pursuits at his rectory of aston where he had taught his two acres of garden to command the inequalities of hill and dale and to combine use with beauty the sonnet in which he dedicated his poems to his patron the earl of holdernesse describes in his best manner the happiness he enjoyed in this retreat he was not long permitted to add to his other pleasures the comforts of a connubial life in 1765 he had married mary daughter of william shermon esq of kingstonuponhull who in two years left him a widower her epitaph is one of those little poems to which we can always return with a melancholy pleasure i have heard that this lady had so little regard for the art in which her husband excelled that on his presenting her with a copy of verses after the wedding was over she crumpled them up and put them into her pocket unread when he had entered his seventieth year hurd who had been his first friend and the faithful monitor of his studies from youth confined him to a sonnet once a year or so warning him that age like infancy should forbear to play with pointed tools he had more latitude allowed in prose for in 1795 he published essays historical and critical on english church music in the former part of his subject he is said by those who have the best means of knowing to be well informed and accurate but in the latter to err on the side of a dry simplicity which in the present refined state of the art it would not answer any good purpose to introduce into the music of our churches in speaking of a wind instrument which william of malmsbury seems to describe as being acted on by the vapour arising from hot water he has unfortunately gone out of his way to ridicule the projected invention of the steamboat by lord stanhope the atrocities committed during the fury of the french revolution had so entirely cured him of his predilection for the popular part of our government that he could not resist the opportunity however illtimed of casting a slur on this nobleman who was accused of being overpartial to it in the third essay on parochial psalmody he gives the preference to merricks weak and affected version over the two other translations that are used in our churches the late bishop horsley in his commentary on the psalms was i believe the first who was hardy enough to claim that palm for sternhold to which with all its awkwardness his rude vigour entitles him  when he comes to speak of christianizing our hymns the apprehension which he expresses of deviating from the present practice of our establishment seems to have restrained him from saying something which he would otherwise have said the question surely is not so much what the practice of our present establishment is as what that of the first christians was there is perhaps no alteration in our service that could be made with better effect than this provided it were made with as great caution as its importance demands  his death which was at last sudden was caused by a hurt on his shin that happened when he was stepping out of his carriage on the sunday two days after he felt so little inconvenience from the accident as to officiate in his church at aston but on the next wednesday the 7th of april 1797 a rapid mortification brought him to his grave his monument of which bacon was the sculptor is placed in westminster abbey near that of gray with the following inscription  optimo viro gulielmo mason am poetae si quis alius culto casto pio sacrum ob 7 apr 1797 aet 72  mason is reported to have been ugly in his person his portrait by reynolds gives to features illformed and gross an expression of intelligence and benignity in the latter part of life his character appears to have undergone a greater change from its primitive openness and good nature than mere time and experience of the world should have wrought in it perhaps this was nothing more than a slight perversion which he had contracted in the school of warburton what was a coarse arrogance in the master himself assumed the form of nicety and superciliousness in the less confident and better regulated tempers of mason and hurd his harmless vanity cleaved to him longer as a proof of this it is related that several years after the publication of isis when he was travelling through oxford and happened to pass over magdalen bridge at a late hour of the evening he turned round to a friend who was riding with him and remarked that it was luckily grown dusk for they should enter the university unobserved when his friend with some surprise inquired into the reason of this caution what said he do you not remember my isis  he was very sensible to the annoyance of the periodical critics which gray was too philosophical or too proud to regard otherwise than as matter of amusement he was the butt for a long line of satirists or lampooners churchill lloyd colman the author of the probationary odes and if i remember right paul whitehead and wolcot all levelled their shafts at him in turn in the probationary odes his peculiarities were well caught when the writer of these pages repeated some of the lines in which he was imitated to anna seward whose admiration of mason is recorded in her letters she observed that what was meant for a burlesque was in itself excellent there is reason to suppose that he sometimes indulged himself in the same license under which he suffered from others if he was indeed the author of the heroic epistle to sir william chambers and of some other anonymous satires which have been imputed to him he must have felt hayleys intended compliment as a severe reproach    sublimer mason not to thee belong   the reptile beauties of invenomd song  of the epistle when it was remarked in the hearing of thomas warton that it had more energy than could have been expected from walpole to whom others ascribed it warton remarked that it might have been written by walpole and buckramed by mason indeed it is not unlikely that one supplied the venom and the other spotted the snake in a letter of expostulation to warton mason did not go the length of disclaiming the satire though he was angry enough that it should be laid at his door i have heard that he received with much apathy the praises offered him by hayley in the essay on epic poetry he has remarked that if rhyme does not condense the sense which passes through its vehicle it ceases to be good either as verse or rhyme2 this rule is laid down too broadly his own practice was not always consonant with it as hayleys never was with darwins poetry it is said that he was much pleased  his way of composing as we learn from grays remarks upon his poems was to cast down his first thoughts carelessly and at large and then clip them here and there at leisure this method as his friend observed will leave behind it a laxity a diffuseness the force of a thought otherwise wellinvented wellturned and wellplaced is often weakened by it he might have added that it is apt to give to poetry the air of declamation  mason wished to join what he considered the correctness of pope with the high imaginative power of milton and the lavish colouring of spenser in the attempt to unite qualities so heterogeneous the effect of each is in a great measure lost and little better than a caput mortuum remains with all his praises of simplicity he is generally much afraid of saying any thing in a plain and natural manner he often expresses the commonest thoughts in a studied periphrasis he is like a man who being admitted into better company than his birth and education have fitted him for is under continual apprehension lest his attitude and motions should betray his origin even his negligence is studied his muse resembles the prioresse in chaucer    that pained her to counterfete chere   of court and be stateliche of manere   and to been holden digne of reverence  yet there were happier moments in which he delivered himself up to the ruling inspiration so it was when he composed the choruses in the caractacus beginning    mona on snowdon calls   hail thou harp of phrygian frame  and    hark heard ye not yon footstep dread  of which it is scarcely too much to say that in some parts they remind us of the ancient tragedians  in each of his two tragedies the incidents are conducted with so much skill and there is so much power of moving the affections that one is tempted to wish he had pursued this line though he perhaps would never have done any thing much better in it one great fault is that the dramatis personae are too much employed in pointing out the claudes and salvator rosas with which they are surrounded they seem to want nothing but long poles in their hands to make them very good conductors over a gallery of pictures when earl orgar on seeing the habitation of his daughter begins    how nobly does this venerable wood   gilt with the glories of the orient sun   embosom yon fair mansion the soft air   salutes me with most cool and temperate breath   and as i tread the flowerbesprinkled lawn   sends up a cloud of fragance  and aulus didius opens the other play with a description somewhat more appropriate    this is the secret centre of the isle   here romans pause and let the eye of wonder   gaze on the solemn scene behold yon oak   how stern he frowns and with his broad brown arms   chills the pale plain beneath him mark yon altar   the dark stream brawling round its rugged base   these cliffs these yawning caverns this wide circus   skirted with unhewn stone they awe my soul   as if the very genius of the place   himself appeard and with terrific tread   stalkd through his drear domain  we could fancy that both these personages had come fresh from the study of the english garden the distresses of elfrida and the heroism of caractacus are in danger of becoming objects of secondary consideration while we are admiring the shades of harewood and the rocks of mona he has attempted to shelter himself under the authority of sophocles but though there are some exquisite touches of landscape painting in that drama the poet has introduced them with a much more sparing hand it is said that hurd pruned away a great deal more luxuriance of this kind with which the first draught of the elfrida was overrun and we learn from gray in his admirable letter of criticism on the caractacus that the opening of that tragedy was as it at first stood even much more objectionable than at present such descriptions are better suited to the masque a species of drama founded on some wild and romantic adventure and of which the interest does not depend on the manners or the passions it is therefore more in its place in argentile and curan which he calls a legendary drama written on the old english model he composed it after the other two and during the short time that his wife lived but like several of his poems it was not published till the year of his decease the beginning promises well and the language of our old writers is at first tolerably well imitated there is afterwards too much trick and too many prettinesses such is that of the nosegay which the princess finds and concludes from its tasteful arrangement to be the work of princely fingers the subordinate parts of the falconer and ralph his deputy are not sustained according to the authors first conception of them the story is well put together he has perhaps nothing else that is equal in expression to the following passage    thou

sweetness of dyer or the terseness of armstrong its characteristic is delicacy but it is a delicacy approaching nearer to weakness than to grace it has more resemblance to the rill that trickles over its fretted channel than to the stream that winds with a full tide and warbles as it flows the practice of cutting it into dialogue had perhaps crippled him as he has made the characters in his plays too attentive to the decorations of the scenepainter so in the last book of the english garden he has turned his landscape into a theatre for the representation of a play the story of nerina is too long and too complicated for an episode in a didactic poem he will seldom bear to be confronted with those writers whom he is found either by accident or design to resemble his picture of the callow

impassioned eloquence of jean jaques rousseau  in his shorter poems there is too frequent a recurrence of the same machinery and that such as it needed but little invention to create either the poet

son of charles and anne goldsmith was born in ireland on the 10th of november 1728 at pallas in the parish of forgany or forney in the county of longford by a mistake made in the note of his entrance in the college register he is represented to have been a native of the county of westmeath  his father who had before resided at smithhill in the county of roscommon which has by some been erroneously said to be the birthplace of his son oliver removed thence to pallas and afterwards to his rectory of kilkenny west in the county of westmeath and in the latter of these parishes at lissoy or auburn he built the house described as the villagepreachers modest mansion in the deserted village his mother was daughter of the rev oliver jones master of the diocesan school at elphin their family consisted of five sons and three daughters  in a letter from his elder sister catherine the wife of daniel hodson esq inserted in the life of goldsmith which an anonymous writer whom i suppose to have been cowpers friend mr rose from a passage in mr nichols literary anecdotes prefixed to his miscellaneous works wonders are told of his early predilection for the poetical art but those who have observed the amplification with which the sprightly sallies of childhood are related by domestic fondness will listen to such narrations with some abatement of confidence it seems probable that a desire of literary distinction might have been infused into his youthful mind by hearing of the reputation of his countryman parnell with whom as we learn from his life of that poet his father and uncle were acquainted  he received the first rudiments of learning from a schoolmaster who taught in the village where his parents resided and who had served as a quartermaster during the war of the succession in spain and from the romantic accounts which this man delighted to give of his travels goldsmith is supposed by his sister to have contracted his propensity for a wandering life from hence he was removed successively to the school at elphin of which the rev mr griffin was master and to that of athlone kept by the rev mr campbell and lastly was placed under the care of the rev patrick hughes of edgeworthstown in the county of longford to whose instruction he acknowledged himself to have been more indebted than to that of his other teachers  it was probably that untowardness in his outward appearance which never afterwards left him that made his schoolfellows consider him a dull boy fit only to be the butt of their ridicule  on his last return after the holidays to the house of his master an adventure befel him which afterwards was made the groundwork of the plot in one of his comedies journeying along leisurely and being inclined to enjoy such diversion as a guinea that had been given him for pocketmoney would afford him on the road he was overtaken by night at a small town called ardagh here inquiring for the best house in the place he was directed to a gentlemans habitation that literally answered that description under a delusion the opposite to that entertained by the knight of la mancha he rides up to the supposed inn and having given his horse in charge to the ostler enters without ceremony the master of the house aware of the mistake resolves to favour it and is still less inclined to undeceive his guest when he finds out from his discourse that he is the son of an acquaintance and a neighbour a good supper and a bottle or two of wine are called for of which the host with his wife and daughter are invited to partake and a hot cake is providently ordered for the morrows breakfast the young travellers surprise may be conceived when in calling for his bill he finds under what roof he has been lodged and with whom he had been putting himself on such terms of familiarity  in june 1745 he was sent a sizer to trinity college dublin and placed under the tuition of mr wilder one of the fellows who is represented to have been of a temper so morose as to excite the strongest disgust in the mind of his pupil he did not pass through his academical course without distinction dr kearney who was afterwards provost in a note on boswells life of johnson informs us that goldsmith gained a premium at the christmas examination which according to mr malone is more honourable than those obtained at the other examinations inasmuch as it is the only one that determines the successful candidate to be the first in literary merit this is enough to disprove what johnson is reported to have said of him that he was a plant that flowered late that there appeared nothing remarkable about him when he was young though when he had got into fame one of his friends began to recollect something of his being distinguished at college whether he took a degree is not known1 on one occasion he narrowly escaped expulsion for having been concerned in the rescue of a student who in violation of the supposed privileges of the university had been arrested for debt within its precincts but his superiors contented themselves with passing a public censure on him  having been deprived in 1747 by death of his father who had with difficulty supported him at college he became a dependant on the bounty of his uncle2 the rev thomas contarine and after fluctuating in his choice of an employment in life was at length established as a medical student at edinburgh in his twentyfifth year  dr strean mentions that he was at one time intended for the church but that appearing before the bishop when he went to be examined for orders in a pair of scarlet breeches he was rejected  from edinburgh when he had completed his attendance on the usual course of lectures he removed to leyden with the intention of continuing his studies at that university  johnson used to speak with coarse contempt of goldsmiths want of veracity noll said he to a lady of much distinction in literature who repeated to me his words noll madam would lie through an inch board in this instance johnsons known partiality to goldsmith fixes the stigma so deeply that we can place no reliance on the account he gave of what befel him when he imagined himself to be no longer within reach of detection in a letter to his uncle he relates that before going to holland he had embarked in a vessel for bordeaux that the ship was driven by a storm into newcastleupontyne that he was there seized on suspicion of being engaged with the rebels and thrown into prison that the vessel meanwhile proceeding on her voyage was wrecked at the mouth of the garonne where all the crew perished and that at the end of a fortnight being liberated he set sail in a vessel bound for holland and in nine days arrived safely at rotterdam after a residence of about a twelvemonth at leyden he was involved in difficulties occasioned by his love of gambling a ridiculous inclination that adhered to him for the remainder of his life he now set out with the resolution of visiting the principal parts of the continent on foot and according to his own report of himself made his way by a variety of stratagems sometimes recruiting his finances by the acquisition of small sums proposed in the foreign universities to public disputants at others securing himself a hospitable reception by the exercise of a moderate share of skill in playing the flutehis tuneless pipe as he calls it in that passage of the traveller where he alludes to this method of supplying his wants  thus if we are to believe him he passed through the netherlands france and germany into the swiss cantons and in that country so well suited to awaken the feelings of a poet he composed a part of the traveller and sent it to his elder brother a clergyman in ireland continuing his journey into italy he visited venice verona florence and padua and having spent six months at the university in the last mentioned city returned through france to england in 1756 from his inquiry into the present state of learning we collect that when at paris he attended the chemical lectures of rouelle  in the meantime his uncle had died and he found himself on his arrival in london so destitute even of a friend to whom he could refer for a recommendation that he with difficulty obtained first the place of an usher to a school and afterwards that of assistant in the laboratory of a chemist at last meeting with doctor sleigh formerly his fellowstudent at edinburgh he was enabled by the kindness of this worthy physician who appears in so amiable a light as the patron of barry in the memoirs of that painter to avail himself more effectually of his knowledge in medicine and to earn a subsistence however scanty by the practice of that art  the bankside in southwark and the temple or its vicinity were successively the places where he fixed his residence to his professional gains he soon added the emoluments arising from his exertions as an author in 1758 he took a share in the conduct of the literary journal called the monthly review and for the space of seven or eight months while the employment lasted lodged in the house of mr griffiths the proprietor of it the next year he contributed several papers to the ladys magazine and to the bee a collection of essays and published his inquiry into the present state of polite learning in which he speaks of the monthly review in terms not very respectful there is i doubt in this little essay more display than reality of erudition it would not be easy to say where he had discovered that dante was persecuted by the critics as long as he lived the complaints he made of the hard fate of authors and his censure of odes and of blank verse were well calculated to conciliate the good will and to excite the sympathy of johnson with whom he soon became intimate  poverty and indiscretion were other claims by which the benevolent commiseration of johnson could scarcely fail to be awakened and his acquaintance with goldsmith had not subsisted long when an occasion presented itself for rescuing him from the consequences of those evils one day calling on our poet at his lodgings in wineoffice court fleetstreet he found him under arrest for debt and engaged in violent altercation with his landlady taking from him the vicar of wakefield then just written johnson proceeded with it to newbery the bookseller from whom he obtained sixty pounds for his friend and goldsmiths good humour and the complaisance of his hostess returning with this accession of wealth they spent the remainder of the day together in harmony in this novel like fielding and smollett he exhibits a very natural view of familiar life inferior to the first in the artful management of his story and to the latter in the broader traits of comic character and not equal to either in variety and fertility he is nevertheless to be preferred to both for his power of passing from the ludicrous to the tender and for his regard to moral decency it was not printed till some years after in 1766 when his reputation had been in some degree established by the traveller meanwhile he published in a periodical work called the ledger his letters from a citizen of the world to his friend in the east in which under the character of a chinese philosopher he describes the customs and manners of europeans but this assumed personage is an awkward concealment for the goodhumoured irishman with his neverfailing succession of droll stories of these there are too many and the want of any thing like a continued interest is sensibly felt i do not know of any book on the same plan that is to be compared with the persian letters of montesquieu  in the spring of 1763 he had lodgings in islington and continuing there till the following year he revised several petty publications for newbery and wrote the letters on english history which from their being published as the letters of a nobleman to his son have been attributed by turns to the earl of orrery and lord lyttelton  his next removal was to the temple where he remained for the rest of his life not without indulging a project equally magnificent and visionary of making a journey into the east in order to bring back with him such useful inventions as had not found their way into britain he was ridiculed by johnson for fancying himself competent to so arduous a task when he was utterly unacquainted with our own mechanical arts he would have brought back a grinding barrow said johnson and thought that he had furnished a wonderful improvement the more feasible plan of returning with honour and advantage to his native country was held out to him through the patronage of the earl of northumberland that nobleman who was then the lord lieutenant of ireland sent for him and made him an offer of his protection goldsmith with his characteristic simplicity replied that he had a brother there a clergyman who stood in need of help that for himself he looked to the booksellers for support this reliance happily did not deceive him by the rewards of his literary labours he was placed in a comparative state of opulence in which his propensity for play alone occasioned a diminution  in 1765 appeared the hermit the traveller and the essays  about this time a club was formed at the proposal of reynolds which consisted besides that eminent painter and our poet of johnson burke burkes fatherinlaw doctor nugent sir john hawkins langton beauclerk and chamier who met and supped together every friday night at the turks head in gerardstreet soho the booksellers shop belonging to dr griffiths called the dunciad in the neighbourhood of catherinestreet was another of his favourite haunts  his comedy of the good natured man though it had received the sanction of burkes approval did not please garrick sufficiently to induce him to venture it on his theatre it was therefore brought forward by colman at covent garden on the 29th of january 1769 but having been represented for nine nights did not longer maintain its place on the stage though it is one of those comedies which afford most amusement in the closet for his conception of the character of croaker the author acknowledged that he was indebted to johnsons suspirius in the rambler that of honeywood in its undistinguishing benevolence hears some resemblance to his own  in the next year he published his deserted village and entered into an agreement with davies to compile a history of england in four octavo volumes for the sum of five hundred pounds in the space of two years before the expiration of which period he made a compact with the same bookseller for an abridgment of the roman history which he had before published the history of greece which has appeared since his death cannot with certainty be ascribed to his pen  in 1771 he wrote the life of bolingbroke prefixed to the dissertation on parties  the reception which his former play had met did not discourage him from trying his fate with a second but it was not till after much solicitation that colman was prevailed on to allow the mistakes of a night or she stoops to conquer to be acted at covent garden on the 15th of march 1773 a large party of zealous friends with johnson at their head attended to witness the representation and to lead the plaudits of the house a scheme which mr cumberland describes to have been preconcerted with much method but to have been near failing in consequence of some mistakes in the execution of the manoeuvres which aroused the displeasure of the audience that the piece is enlivened by such droll incidents as to be nearly allied to farce johnson with justice observed declaring however that he knew of no comedy for many years that had so much exhilarated an audience that had so much answered the great end of comedy that of making an audience merry  the history of the earth and animated nature in eight volumes closed the labours of goldsmith this compilation however recommended by the agreeableness of style usual to its author is but little prized for its accuracy in a summary of past events which are often differently related by writers of authority and credit nearly equal it is in vain to look for certainty but when we are presented with a description of natural objects that required only to be looked at in order to be known we are neither amused nor instructed without some degree of precision history partakes of the nature of romance physiology is more closely connected with science in the one we must often rest contented with probability in the other we know that truth is generally to be attained and therefore expect to find it  goldsmith had been for some time subject to attacks of strangury and having before experienced relief from jamess powders had again recourse to that popular medicine his medical attendants are said to have remonstrated with him on its unfitness in the stage to which his disorder had reached but he persevered and his fever increasing and some secret distress of mind under which he owned to dr turton that he laboured aggravating his bodily complaint he expired on the 4th of april in his fortyfifth year  he was privately interred in the temple burying ground a monument is erected to his memory in westminster abbey with the following epitaph by johnson written at the solicitation of their common friends  olivarii goldsmith poetae physici historici qui nullum fere scribendi genus non tetigit nullum quod tetigit non ornavit seu risus essent movendi sive lacrymae affectuum potens at lenis dominator ingenio sublimis vividus

by one whose opinion on such subjects is decisive that contigit would have better expressed the writers meaning  another epitaph composed by johnson in greek deserves notice as it shows how strongly his mind was impressed by goldsmiths abilities    greek   ton taphon eisoraas ton olibarioio koniaen   aphrosi mae semnaen xeine podessi patei   oisi memaele phusis metron charis erga palaion

deeds of ancient days weep for the historian the naturalist   the poet  goldsmiths stature was below the middle height his limbs sturdy his forehead more prominent than is usual and his face almost round pallid and marked with the smallpox  the simpleness almost approaching to fatuity of his outward deportment combined with the power which there was within brings to our recollection some part of the character of la fontaine whom a french lady wittily called the fable tree from his apparent unconsciousness or rather want of mental responsibility for the admirable productions which he was continually supplying his propriety and clearness when he expresses his thoughts with his pen and his confusion and inability to impart them in conversation well illustrated the observation of cicero that it is very possible for a man to think rightly on any subject and yet to want the power of conveying his sentiments by speech in fit and becoming language to others fieri potest ut recte quis sentiat sed id quod sentit polite eloqui non possit yet mr cumberland who was one of his associates has informed us that he had gleams of eloquence  johnson said of him that he was not a social man he never exchanged mind with you his prevailing foible was a desire of shining in those exterior accomplishments which nature had denied him vanity and benevolence had conspired to make him an easy prey to adulation and imposture  his complaints of the envy by which he found his mind tormented and especially on the occasion of johnsons being honoured by an interview with the king must have made those who heard him lose all sense of the evil passion in their amusement at a confession so novel and so pleasant  one day we are told he complained in a mixed company of lord camden i met him said he at lord clares house in the country and he took no more notice of me than if i had been an ordinary man the story of his peachcoloured coat will not soon be forgotten if                     in some men   their graces serve them but as enemies  goldsmith was one of those in whom their frailties are more likely to serve them as friends for they were such as could scarcely fail to assist in appeasing malevolence and conciliating kindness be this as it will he must with all his weaknesses be considered as one of the chief ornaments of the age in which he lived  comparisons have been made between the situation of the men eminent for literature in queen annes time and at the commencement of the reign of george the third in the former beginning to be disengaged from the court where they were more at home during the reign of the charleses they were falling under the influence of the nobility amongst whom they generally found their patrons and often their associates in the latter they had been insensibly shaken off alike by the court and the nobles and were come into the hands of the people and the booksellers i know not whether they were much the worse for this change if in the one instance they were rendered more studious of elegance and smartness in the other they attained more freedom and force in the former they were oftener imitators of the french in the latter they followed the dictates of a better sense and trusted more to their own resources they lost indeed the character of wits but they aspired to that of instructors yet in one respect and that a material one it must be owned that they were sufferers by this alteration in affairs for the quantity of their labours having become more important under their new masters than it was under their old ones they had less care of selection and their originality was weakened by diffusiveness they indulged themselves but sparingly in the luxury of composing verse which was too thriftless an occupation to be continued long they used it perhaps as the means of attracting notice to themselves at their first entrance on the world but not as the staple on which they were afterwards to depend when the song had drawn a band of hearers around them it had done its duty the crowd was to be detained and increased by expectations of advantage rather than of pleasure a writer consulted goldsmith on what subjects he might employ his pen with most profit to himself it will be better said the author of the traveller and the deserted village laughing indeed but in good earnest to relinquish the draggletail muses for my part i have found productions in prose more sought after and better paid for this is no doubt the reason that his verse bears so small a proportion to his other writings yet it is by the former added to the few works of imagination which he has left besides that he will be known to posterity his histories will probably be superseded by more skilful or more accurate compilations as they are now read by few who can obtain information nearer to its original sources  in the natural manner of telling a short and humorous story he is perhaps surpassed by no writer of prose except addison in his essays the style preserves a middle way between the gravity of johnson and the lightness of chesterfield but it may often be objected to them as to the moral writings of johnson that they present life to us under a gloomy aspect and leave an impression of despondence on the mind of the reader  in his poetry there is nothing ideal it pleases chiefly by an exhibition of nature in her most homely and familiar views but from these he selects his objects with due discretion and omits to represent whatever would occasion unmingled pain or disgust  his couplets have the same slow and stately march as johnsons and if we can suppose similar images of rural and domestic life to have arrested the attention of that writer we can scarcely conceive that he would have expressed them in different language  some of the lines in the deserted village are said to be closely copied from a poem by welsted called the greek oikographia but i do not think he will be found to have levied larger contributions on it than most poets have supposed themselves justified in making on the neglected works of their predecessors  the following particulars relating to this poem which i have extracted from the letter of dr strean before referred to cannot fail to gratify that numerous class of readers with whom it has been a favourite from their earliest years  the poem of the deserted village took its origin from the circumstance of general robert napper the grandfather of the gentleman who now lives in the house within half a mile of lissoy and built by the general having purchased an extensive tract of the country surrounding lissoy or auburn in consequence of which many families here called cottiers were removed to make room for the intended improvements of what was now to become the wide domain of a rich man warm with the idea of changing the face of his new acquisition and were forced with fainting steps to go in search of torrid tracts and distant climes  this fact alone might be sufficient to establish the seat of the poem but there cannot remain a doubt in any unprejudiced mind when the following are added viz that the character of the villagepreacher the abovenamed henry the brother of the poet is copied from nature he is described exactly as he lived and his modest mansion as it existed burn the name of the villagemaster and the site of his schoolhouse and catherine giraghty a lonely widow     the wretched matron forced in age for bread   to strip the brook with mantling cresses spread  and to this day the brook and ditches near the spot where her cabin stood abound with cresses still remain in the memory of the inhabitants and catherines children live in the neighbourhood the pool the busy mill the house where nutbrown draughts inspired are still visited as the poetic scene and the hawthornbush growing in an open space in front of the house which i knew to have three trunks is now reduced to one the other two having been cut from time to time by persons carrying away pieces of it to be made into toys c in honour of the bard and of the celebrity of his poem all these contribute to the same proof and the decent church which i attended for upwards of eighteen years and which tops the neighbouring hill is exactly described as seen from lissoy the residence of the preacher  i should have observed that elizabeth delap who was a parishioner of mine and died at the age of about ninety often told me she was the first who put a book into goldsmiths hand by which she meant that she taught him his letters she was allied to him and kept a little school  the hermit is a pleasing little tale told with that simplicity which appears so easy and is in fact so difficult to be obtained it was imitated in the ballad of a friar of orders grey in percys reliques of english poetry  his traveller was it is said pronounced by mr fox to be one of the finest pieces in the english language perhaps this sentence was delivered by that great man with some qualification which was either forgotten or omitted by the reporter of it otherwise such praise was surely disproportioned to its object  in this poem he professes to compare the good and evil which fall to the share of those different nations whose lot he contemplates his design at setting out is to shew that whether we consider the blessings to be derived from art or from nature we shall discover an equal portion dealt to all mankind and the conclusion which he draws at the end of the poem would be perfectly just if these premises were allowed him    in every government though terrors reign   though tyrant kings or tyrant laws restrain   how small of all that human hearts endure   that part which laws or kings can cause or cure   still to ourselves in every place consignd   our own felicity we make or find   with secret course which no loud streams annoy   glides the smooth current of domestic joy   the lifted axe the agonizing wheel   lukes iron crown and damiens bed of steel   to men remote from power but rarely known   leave reason faith and conscience all our own  that it matters little or nothing to the happiness of men whether they are governed well or ill whether they live under fixed and known laws or at the will of an arbitrary tyrant is a paradox the fallacy of which is happily too apparent to need any refutation nor is his inference warranted by those particular observations which he makes for the purpose of establishing it when of italy he tells us that sensual bliss is all this nation knows how is italy to be compared either with itself when it was prompted by those noble aims of which he speaks or with that country where he sees    the lords of human kind pass by   intent on high designs a thoughtful band   by forms unfashiond fresh from natures hand   fierce in their native hardiness of soul   true to imagined right above controul   while een the peasant learns these rights to scan   and learns to venerate himself as man  that good is every where balanced by some evil none will deny but that no effort of human courage or prudence can make one scale preponderate over the other and that a decree of fate has fixed them in eternal equipoise is an opinion which if it were seriously entertained must bind men to a tame and spiritless acquiescence in whatever disadvantages or inconveniences they may chance to find themselves involved and leave to them the exercise of no other public virtue than that of a blind submission  his poetry is happily better than his argument he discriminates with much skill the manners of the several countries that pass in review before him the illustrations with which he relieves and varies his main subject are judiciously interspersed and as he never raises his tone too far beyond his pitch at the first starting so he seldom sinks much below it the thought at the beginning appears to have pleased him for he has repeated it in the citizen of the world    whereer i roam whatever realms to see   my heart untraveld fondly turns to thee   still to my brother turns with ceaseless pain   and drags at each remove a lengthening chain  the further i travel i feel the pain of separation with stronger force those ties that bind me to my native country and you are still unbroken by every remove i only drag a greater length of chain  to the poetical compositions of goldsmith in general may be applied with justice that temperate commendation which he has given to the works of parnell in his life of that poet at the end of his course the reader regrets that his way has been so short he wonders that it gave him so little trouble and so resolves to go the journey over again there is much to solace fatigue and even to excite pleasure but nothing to call forth rapture we stay to contemplate and enjoy the objects on our road but we feel that it is on this earth we have been travelling and that the author is either not willing or not able to raise us above it no writer in the english language has combined such various excellences as a novelist a writer of comedies and a poet  footnotes 1 he took the degree of bachelor of arts feb 27 1749 priors life     of

robert darwin esq by his wife elizabeth hill was born at elston near newark in nottinghamshire on the 12th of december 1731 he was educated at the grammar school of chesterfield in derbyshire under the rev mr burrows and from thence sent to st johns college cambridge where he had for his tutor dr powell afterwards master of the college to whose learning and goodness mason another of his pupils has left a testimony in one of his earliest poems  after proceeding bachelor in medicine at cambridge darwin went to edinburgh in order to pursue his studies in that science to more advantage when he had been there long enough to entitle him to the degree of doctor in medicine he quitted edinburgh and began his practice at nottingham but soon after in 1756 removed to lichfield in the following year he married mary daughter of charles howard esq a proctor in the ecclesiastical court of lichfield he was very soon distinguished for his professional skill the first case which he treated with so much success as to attract the public notice was that of a young man of fortune who being in a fever was given over by his ordinary physician but whom darwin restored probably by one of those bold measures from which others would have shrunk but to which he wisely had recourse whenever a desperate malady called for a desperate cure his patient whose name was inge was i believe the same whom johnson in his life of ambrose phillips has termed a gentleman of great eminence in staffordshire part of the wealth that now flowed in upon him from an extensive and opulent circle was employed with that liberality which in this country is perhaps oftener exercised by men of his profession than by those of any other  at lichfield he formed an intimacy with several persons who afterwards rose to much distinction of these the most remarkable were mr edgeworth whose skill in mechanics made him acceptable to darwin mr day a man remembered to more advantage by his writings than by the singularities of his conduct and anna seward the female most eminent in her time for poetical genius the manner in which the first of these introduced himself shall be told in his own words as they convey a lively description of darwins person and habits of life at this time i wrote an account to the doctor of the reception which his scheme for preventing accidents to a carriage in turning had met with from the society of arts the doctor wrote me a very civil answer and though as i afterwards found out he took me for a coachmaker he invited me to his house an invitation which i accepted in the ensuing summer when i arrived at lichfield i went to inquire whether the doctor was at home i was shewn into a room where i found mrs darwin i told her my name she said the doctor expected me and that he intended to be at home before night there were books and prints in the room of which i took occasion to speak mrs darwin asked me to drink tea and i perceived that i owed to my literature the pleasure of passing the evening with this most agreeable woman we talked and conversed upon various literary subjects till it was dark when mrs darwin seeming to be surprised that the doctor had not come home i offered to take my leave but she told me that i had been expected for some days and that a bed had been prepared for me i heard some orders given to the housemaid who had destined a different room for my reception from that which her mistress had upon second thoughts appointed i perceived that the maid examined me attentively but i could not guess the reason when supper was nearly finished a loud rapping at the door announced the doctor there was a bustle in the hall which made mrs darwin get up and go to the door upon her exclaiming that they were bringing in a dead man i went to the hall i saw some persons directed by one whom i guessed to be doctor darwin carrying a man who appeared to be motionless he is not dead said doctor darwin he is only dead drunk i found him continued the doctor nearly suffocated in a ditch i had him lifted into my carriage and brought hither that we might take care of him tonight candles came and what was the surprise of the doctor and of mrs darwin to find that the person whom he had saved was mrs darwins brother who for the first time in his life as i was assured had been intoxicated in this manner and who would undoubtedly have perished had it not been for doctor darwins humanity during this scene i had time to survey my new friend doctor darwin he was a large man fat and rather clumsy but intelligence and benevolence were painted in his countenance he had a considerable impediment in his speech a defect which is in general painful to others but the doctor repaid his auditors so well for making them wait for his wit or his knowledge that he seldom found them impatient when his brother was disposed of he came to supper and i thought that he looked at mrs darwin as if he was somewhat surprised when he heard that i had passed the whole evening in her company after she withdrew he entered into conversation with me upon the carriage that i had made and upon the remarks that fell from some members of the society to whom i had shewn it i satisfied his curiosity and having told him that my carriage was in the town and that he could see it whenever he pleased we talked upon mechanical subjects and afterwards on various branches of knowledge which necessarily produced allusions to classical literature by these he discovered that i had received the education of a gentleman why i thought said the doctor that you were a coachmaker that was the reason said i that you looked surprised at finding me at supper with mrs darwin but you see doctor how superior in discernment ladies are even to the most learned gentlemen i assure you that i had not been in the room five minutes before mrs darwin asked me to tea  these endeavours to improve the construction of carriages were near costing him dear nor did he desist till he had been several times thrown down and at last broke the pan of the right knee which occasioned a slight but incurable lameness the amiable woman of whom mr edgeworth has here spoken died in 1770 of the five children whom she brought him two were lost in their infancy charles the eldest of the remaining three died at edinburgh in 1778 of a disease supposed to be communicated by a corpse which he was dissecting when one of his fingers was slightly wounded he had obtained a gold medal for pointing out a test by which pus might be distinguished from mucus and the essay in which he had stated his discovery was published by his father after his death together with another treatise which he left incomplete on the retrograde motions of the absorbent vessels of animal bodies in some diseases another of his sons erasmus who was a lawyer in a temporary fit of mental derangement put an end to his existence in 1799 robert waring a physician now in high reputation at shrewsbury is the only one of these children who survived him  a few years before he quitted lichfield in consequence of a second marriage he attempted to establish a botanical society in that city but his only associates were the present sir brooke boothby and a proctor whose name was jackson of this triumvirate miss seward who knew them well tells us that jackson admired sir brooke boothby and worshipped and aped dr darwin he became a useful drudge to each in their joint work the translation of the linnaean system of vegetation into english from the latin his illustrious coadjutors exacted of him fidelity to the sense of their author and they corrected jacksons inelegant english weeding it of its pompous coarseness darwin had already conceived the design of turning the linnaean system into a poem which after he had composed it was long handed about in manuscript and i believe frequently revised and altered with the most sedulous care the stage on which he has introduced his fancied queen of botany and her attendants from the rosicrusian world has the recommendation of being a real spot of ground within a mile of the place he inhabited a few years ago it retained many traces of the diligence he had bestowed on it and has probably not yet entirely lost them of this work called the botanic garden which he retained till he thought there was no danger of his medical character suffering from his being known as a poet he published in 1789 the second part containing the loves of the plants first believing it to be more level to the apprehension of ordinary readers it soon made its way to an almost universal popularity with the lovers of poetry the novelty of the subject and the high polish as it was then considered of the verse secured it many favourers and the curiosity of the naturalist was not less gratified by the various information and the fanciful conjectures which abounded in the notes the first part was given to the public in three years after  in 1795 and 1796 appeared the two volumes of zoonomia or laws of organic life the produce of long labour and much consideration what profit a physician may derive from this book i am unable to determine but i fear that the general reader will too often discover in it a hazardous ingenuity to which good sense and reason have been sacrificed when the writer of these pages who was then his patient ventured to intimate the sensuality of one part of it to its author he himself immediately referred to the passage which was likely to have raised the objection and on another occasion as if to counteract this prejudice in the mind of one whose confidence he might be desirous of obtaining he recommended to him the study of paleys moral philosophy  in 1781 he married his second wife the widow of colonel pole of radburne near derby with whom he appears to have lived as happily as he had done with his first by her persuasion he was induced to pass the latter part of his days at derby here his medical practice was not at all lessened and he had a second family to provide for out of the emolument which it brought him his other publications were a tract on female education a slight performance written for the purpose of recommending a school kept by some ladies in whose welfare his relation to them gave him a warm interest and a long book in 1800 on the philosophy of agriculture and gardening which he entitled phytologia  on lady day 1802 he took possession of an old house called the priory which had belonged to his son erasmus and was situated at a short distance from derby and on the 17th of the next month while he was writing to his friend mr edgeworth the following letter he was arrested by the sudden approach of death                                         priory near derby april 17 1802    dear edgeworthi am glad to find that you still amuse yourself with   mechanism in spite of the troubles of ireland    the use of turning aside or downwards the claw of a table i dont   see as it must be reared against a wall for it will not stand alone   if the use be for carriage the feet may shut up like the usual brass   feet of a reflecting telescope    we have all been now removed from derby about a fortnight to the   priory and all of us like our change of situation we have a pleasant   home a good garden ponds full of fish and a pleasing valley   somewhat like shenstonesdeep umbrageous and with a talkative   stream running down it our home is near the top of the valley well   screened by hills from the east and north and open to the south   where at four miles distance we see derby tower    four or more strong springs rise near the house and have formed the   valley which like that of petrarch may be called valchiusa as it   begins or is shut at the situation of the house i hope you like the   description and hope farther that yourself or any part of your   family will sometime do me the pleasure of a visit    pray tell the authoress that the waternymphs of our valley will be   happy to assist her next novel    my bookseller mr johnson will not begin to print the temple of   nature till the price of paper is fixed by parliament i suppose the   present duty is paid                                       to this imperfect sentence was added on the opposite side by another hand    sirthis family is in the greatest affliction i am truly grieved to   inform you of the death of the invaluable dr darwin dr darwin got   up apparently in good health about eight oclock he rang the library   bell the servant who went said he appeared fainting he revived   again mrs darwin was immediately called the doctor spoke often but   soon appeared fainting and died about one oclock    our dear mrs darwin and family are inconsolable their affliction is   great indeed there being few such husbands or fathers he will be   most deservedly lamented by all who had the honour of being known to   him    i remain sir    your obedient humble servant    sm    ps this letter was begun this morning by dr darwin himself  the complaint which thus suddenly terminated his life in his seventyfirst year was the angina pectoris  the temple of nature was printed in the year after his death but the public had either read enough of his writings or were occupied with other things for little attention was paid to this poetical bequest that ingenious burlesque of his manner the loves of the triangles probably contributed to loosen the spell by which he had for a while taken the general ear  his person is well described by his biographer miss seward as being above the middle size his form athletic and his limbs too heavy for exact proportion his countenance marked by the traces of a severe smallpox and when not animated by social pleasure rather saturnine than sprightly in youth his exterior was rendered agreeable by florid health and a smile that indicated goodhumour his portrait by wright of derby gives a very exact but inanimate representation of his form and features in justice to the painter it must be told that i believe the likeness to have been taken after death  in his medical practice he was by some accused of empiricism from this charge both miss seward and mr edgeworth have i think justly vindicated him the former has recorded a project which he suggested on the supposed authority of some old practitioners but which he did not execute for curing one of his consumptive patients by the transfusing of blood from the veins of a person in health i have been told that when a mother who seemed to be in the paroxysm of a delirium expressed an earnest wish to take her infant into her arms and her attendants were fearful of indulging her lest she should do some violence to the object of her affection he desired them to commit it to her without apprehension and that the result was an immediate abatement of her disorder this was an instance rather of strong sagacity than of extraordinary boldness for nothing less than a wellfounded confidence in the safety of the experiment could have induced him to hazard it  i know not whether it be worth relating that when sent for to a nobleman at buxton who conceived his health to have suffered by the use of tea to which he was immoderately addicted darwin rang the bell and ordered a pot of strong green tea to be brought up and filling both his patients cup and his own encouraged him to frequent and lavish draughts i have heard that he was impatient of inquiries which related to diet thinking i suppose that after the age of childhood in ordinary cases each person might regulate it best for himself but from an almost entire abstinence from fermented liquors he was both by precept and example a strenuous adviser he believed says miss edgeworth in her memoirs of her father that almost all the distempers of the higher classes of people arise from drinking in some form or other too much vinous spirit to this he attributed the aristocratic disease of gout the jaundice and all bilious or liver complaints in short all the family of pain this opinion he supported in his writings with the force of his eloquence and reason and still more in conversation by all those powers of wit satire and peculiar humour which never appeared fully to the public in his works but which gained him strong ascendancy in private society during his lifetime he almost banished wine from the tables of the rich of his acquaintance and persuaded most of the gentry in his own and the neighbouring counties to become waterdrinkers here i doubt miss edgeworth has a little overrated the extent of his influence partly in jest and partly in earnest he expressed his suspicions and carried his inferences on this subject to a preposterous excess when he heard that my father was bilious he suspected that this must be the consequence of his having since his residence in ireland and in compliance with the fashion of the country indulged too freely in drinking his letter i remember concluded withfarewell my dear friend god keep you from whiskeyif he can  his opinion respecting the safety of inoculating for the smallpox at a proper age as it was expressed in the following letter to the writer of these pages will be satisfactory to such parents as are yet unconvinced of the efficacy of vaccination and his opinion is the more valuable because it was given at a time when there was neither prejudice nor prepossession on the subject    derby oct 9 1797    dear siron the best inquiry i have been able to make today i   cannot hear that the smallpox is in derby i can only add that all   those who have died by inoculation whom i have heard of these last   twenty years have been children at the breast on which account it   may be safer to defer inoculation till four or five years old if   there be otherwise no hazard of taking the disease naturally    i am c    e darwin  on the accounts which his patients gave him of their own maladies he placed so little dependence that he thought it necessary to wring the truth from them as a lawyer would do from an unwilling witness his general distrust of others in all that related to themselves is well exemplified by a casual remark that has been lately repeated to me by a respectable dignitary of the church to whom when he was apologizing for his want of skill in the game of chess at which they were going to play darwin answered that he made it a rule not to believe either the good or the harm that men spoke of themselves  this want of reliance in the sincerity of those with whom he conversed has been attributed with some colour of reason to his habitual scepticism on matters of higher moment mr fellowes has observed of him that he dwelt so much and so exclusively on second causes that he seems to have forgotten that there is a first there is no solution of natural effects to which he was not ready to listen provided it would assist him in getting rid of what he considered an unnecessary intervention of the supreme being a fibre capable of irritability was with him enough to account not only for the origin of animal life but for its progress through all its stages he had thus involved himself in the grossest materialism but being endued with an active fancy he engendered on it theories so wild and chimerical that they might be regarded with the same kind of wonder as the fictions of romance if our pleasure were not continually checked by remembering the error in which they originate what more prodigious transformation shall we read of in ovid than that which he supposes the organs of his strange ens to have undergone during the change of our globe from moist to dry    as in dry air the seaborn stranger roves   each muscle quickens and each sense improves   cold gills aquatic form respiring lungs   and sounds aerial flow from slimy tongues    temple of nature c 1  the peculiarities of the shapes of animals which distinguished them from each other he supposes to have been gradually formed by these same irritable fibres and to have been varied by reproduction as to the faculties of sensation volition and association they come in afterwards as matters of course and in a manner so easy and natural that the only wonder is what had kept them waiting so long he mentions with something like approbation the hypothesis of buffon and helvetius who as he tells us seem to imagine that mankind arose from one family of monkeys on the banks of the mediterranean who accidentally had learned to use the adductor pollicis or that strong muscle which constitutes the ball of the thumb and draws the point of it to meet the points of the fingers which common monkeys do not and that this muscle gradually increased in size strength and activity in successive generations and that by this improved use of the sense of the touch monkeys acquired clear ideas and gradually became men  to this he gravely adds that perhaps all the productions of nature are in their progress to greater perfection an idea countenanced by modern discoveries and deductions concerning the progressive formation of the solid parts of this terraqueous globe and consonant of the dignity of the creator  his description of the way in which clear ideas were acquired is not much improved when he puts it into verse    nerved with fine touch above the bestial throngs   the hand first gift of heaven to man belongs   untipt with claws the circling fingers close   with rival points the bending thumbs oppose   trace the nice lines of form with sense refined   and clear ideas charm the thinking mind    temple of nature c 3  he tells us of a naturalist who had found out a shorter cut to the production of animal life who thought it not impossible that the first insects were the anthers and stigmas of flowers which had by some means loosened themselves from their parent plant and that other insects in process of time had been formed from these some acquiring wings others fins and others claws from their ceaseless efforts to procure food or to secure themselves from injury what hindered but these insects might have acquired hands and by those means clear ideas also is not explained to us  as great improvements however have certainly been made in some way or other he sees reason to hope that not less important ameliorations may in time succeed if our improved chemistry says he should ever discover the art of making sugar from fossile or aerial matter without the assistance of vegetation food for animals would then become as plentiful as water and they might live upon the earth without preying on each other as thick as blades of grass without restraint to their numbers but the want of local room no very comfortable prospect it must be owned especially to those who are aware of the alarming ratio in which according to later discoveries population is found to multiply itself a consummation that would scarcely produce that at which he thought it the chief duty of a philosopher to aim namely the greatest possible quantity of human happiness on being made acquainted with reveries such as these through the means of the press we are inclined to doubt the justice of his encomium on the art of printing since which discovery he tells us superstition has been much lessened by the reformation of religion and necromancy astrology chiromancy witchcraft and vampyrism have vanished from all classes of society though some are still so weak in the present enlightened times as to believe in the prodigies of animal magnetism and of metallic tractors what then is to be said of the prodigies of spontaneous vitality to a system which removes the author of all so far from our contemplation we might well prefer the faith of          the poor indian whose untutord mind   sees god in clouds and hears him in the wind  the father of english poetry who well knew what qualities and habits might with most probability be assigned to men of different professions has made it a trait in the character of his doctour of phisike that     his study was but little in the bible   though there are illustrious examples of the contrary yet it may sometimes be with the physician as shakspeare said of himself when complaining of the influence which the business of a player had on his mind that    his nature is subdued   to that it works in   a propensity to materialism had not however so subdued the mind of darwin as to prevent him from acknowledging the existence of what he terms the great cause of causes parent of parents ens entium nay he went the length of maintaining that his doctrine of spontaneous vitality was not inconsistent with scripture  but whatever may be thought of his creed it must be recorded of him that he discharged some of the best duties of religion in a manner that would have become its most zealous professors he was bountiful to the poor and hospitable to his equals to the inferior clergy when he resided at lichfield he gave his advice unfeed and he attended diligently to the health of those who were unable to requite him johnson is said when he visited his native city to have shunned the society of darwin cowper who certainly was as firm a believer as johnson thought it no disparagement to his orthodoxy to address some complimentary verses to him on the publication of his botanic garden  this poem ought not to be considered more than as a capriccio or sport of the fancy on which he has expended much labour to little purpose it does not pretend to anything like correctness of design or continuity of action it is like a picture of breughels where every thing is highly coloured and every thing out of order in the first part called the economy of vegetation the goddess of botany appears with her attendants the powers of the four elements for no other purpose than to describe to them their several functions in carrying on the operations of nature in the second which has no necessary connection with the first the botanic muse describes the loves of the plants here the fiction is puerile and built on a system which is itself in danger of vanishing into air at the end of the second canto the muse takes a dish of tea which i think is the only thing of any consequence that is done throughout the second part has been charged with an immoral tendency but miss seward has observed with much truth that it is a burlesque upon morality to make the amours of the plants responsible at its tribunal and that the impurity is in the imagination of the reader not in the pages of the poet for these amours he might have found a better motto than that which he has prefixed from claudian in the following stanza of marini    ne fior ne fiori istessi amor ha loco   ama il giglio il ligustro e lamaranto   e narciso e giacinto ajace e croco   e con la bella clitia il vago acanto   arde la rosa di vermiglio foco   lodor sospiro e la rugiada e pianto   ride la calta e pallida e essangue   vinta damor la violetta langue    adone canto 6  he was apt to confound the odd with the grotesque and to mistake the absurd for the fanciful by an excellent landscapepainter now living i was told that darwin proposed as a subject for his pencil a shower in which there should be represented a redbreast holding up an expanded umbrella in its claws  an italian critic following a division made by plotinus has distributed the poets into three classes which he calls the musical the amatorial and the philosophic in the first he places those who are studious of softness and harmony in their numbers in the second such as content themselves with describing accurately the outward appearances of real or fanciful objects and in the third those who penetrate to the qualities of things draw out their hidden beauties and separate what is really and truly fair from that which has only its exterior semblance among the second of these darwin might claim for himself no mean station it was indeed a notion he had taken up that as the ideas derived from visible objects to use his own words are more distinct than those derived from any other source the words expressive of those ideas belonging to vision make up the principal part of poetic language so entirely was he engrossed by this persuasion as too frequently to forget that the admirers of poetry have not only eyes but ears and hearts also and that therefore harmony and pathos are required of the poet no less than a faithful delineation of visible objects  yet there is something in his versification also that may be considered as his own his numbers have less resemblance to popes than popes to those of dryden whether the novelty be such as to reflect much credit on the inventor is another question his secret was i think to take those lines in pope which seemed to him the most diligently elaborated and to model his own upon them but with those forms of verse which he borrowed more particularly from pope in which one part is equally balanced by the other and of which each is complete in itself without reference to those which precede or follow it he has mingled one or two others that had been used by our elder poets but almost entirely rejected by the refiners of the couplet measure till the time of langhorne as where the substantive and its epithet are so placed that the latter makes the end of an iambic in the second and the former the beginning of a trochee in the third foot  and showers  the still  snow from  his hoary urns darwin botanic garden p i c 2 28  or

generally be reduced to a few of the first and simplest rules of syntax on these he rings what changes he may by putting the verb before its nominative or vocative case thus in the following verses from the temple of nature    on rapid feet oer hills and plains and rocks   speed the sacred leveret and rapacious fox   on rapid pinions cleave the fields above   the hawk descending and escaping

449  the last line or the middle of the last line in almost every sentence throughout his poems begins with a conjunction affirmative or negative and or nor and this last line is often so weak that it breaks down under the rest thus in this very pretty impression as it may almost be called of an ancient gem    so playful love on idas flowery sides   with ribbonrein the indignant lion guides

risguardanti   facean coi rosseggianti   vanni del tergo  but darwin could have known nothing of pindar and the word may perhaps he found with a similar application in one of our own poets  as the singularity of his poems caused them to be too much admired at first so are they now more neglected than they deserve there is about as much variety in them as in a bed of tulips of which the shape is the same in all except that some are a little more rounded at the points than others yet they are diversely streaked and freckled with a profusion of gay tints in which the bizarre as it is called by the fanciers of that flower prevails they are a sight for one half hour in the spring and no more and are utterly devoid of odour                                         william julius mickle  william julius mickle was born on the 29th of september 1734 at longholm in the county of dumfries of which place his father alexander meikle or mickle a minister of the church of scotland was pastor his mother was julia daughter of thomas henderson of ploughlands near edinburgh in his thirteenth year his love of poetry was kindled by reading spensers faery queen two years after his father who was grown old and infirm and had a large family to educate by an unusual indulgence obtained permission to reside in edinburgh where mickle was admitted a pupil at the high school here he remained long enough to acquire a relish for the greek and latin classics when he was seventeen years old his father unluckily embarking his capital in a brewery which the death of his wifes brother had left without a manager william was taken from school and employed as clerk under the eldest son in whose name the business was carried on at first he must have been attentive enough to his employment for on his coming of age the property was made over to him on the condition of paying his family a certain share of the profits arising from it afterwards he suffered himself to be seduced from business by the attractions of literature his father died in 1758 and in about three years he published without his name knowledge an ode and a night piece the former of which had been written in his eighteenth year in both there is more of seriousness and reflection than of that fancy which marks his subsequent productions beside these he had finished a drama called the death of socrates of which if we may judge from his other tragedy the loss is not to be lamented and he had begun a poem on providence the difficulties consequent on his trusting to servants the work of his brewery which he was too indolent to superintend himself and on his joining in security for a large sum with a printer who failed were now gathering fast upon him his creditors became clamorous and at candlemas one of the quarter days in scotland 1762 being equally unwilling to compound with them as his brother advised him to do and unable to satisfy their demands he prevailed on them to accept his notes of hand payable in four months when the time was expired he found himself as might have been expected involved in embarrassments from which he could devise no means of escaping his mind was harassed by bitter reflections on the distress which threatened those whom his parent had left to his protection and he was scared by the terrors of a jail but they with whom he had to reckon were again lenient he consoled himself with recollecting that his delinquency had proceeded from inadvertence not from design and resolved to be more sedulous in future but had still the weakness to trust for relief to his poem on providence this was soon after published by dodsley and that it might win for itself such advantages as patronage could give was sent to lord lyttelton under the assumed name of william moore with a representation that the author was a youth friendless and unknown and with the offer of a dedication if the poem should be again edited this proceeding did not evince much knowledge of mankind a poet has as seldom gained a patron as a mistress by solicitation to which no previous encouragement has been given it was more than half a year before he received an answer from lyttelton with just kindness enough to keep alive his expectations in the meantime the friendly offices of a carpenter in edinburgh whose name was good had been exerted to save his property from being seized for rent but the fear of arrest impelled him to quit that city in haste and embarking on board a coal vessel at newcastle he reached london pennyless in may 1763 his immediate necessities were supplied by remittances from his brothers and by such profits as he could derive from writing for periodical publications there is no reason to suppose that he was indebted to lyttelton for more than the commendation of his genius and for some criticism on his poems and even this favour was denied to the most beautiful among them his elegy on mary queen of scots the cause assigned for the exclusion was that poetry should not consecrate what history must condemn a sacred principle if it he applied to the characters of those yet living but of more doubtful obligation as it regards past times when euripides in one of his dramas chose to avail himself of a wild and unauthorized tradition and to represent helen as spotless he surely violated no sanction of moral truth and in the instance of mary mickle might have pleaded some uncertainty which a poet was at liberty to interpret to the better part  during his courtship of lyttelton he was fed at one time by hopes of being recommended in the west indies and at another of being served in the east till by degrees the great man waxed so cold that he wisely relinquished his suit his next project was to go out as a merchants clerk to carolina but some unexpected occurrences defeating this plan also he engaged himself as corrector of the clarendon press at oxford here he published in 1767 the concubine a poem in the manner of spenser to which when it was printed ten years after having in the meantime passed through several editions he gave the title of syr martyn  early in life his zeal for religion had shewn itself in some remarks on an impious book termed the history of the man after gods own heart and in 1767 the same feelings induced him to publish a vindication of the divinity of jesus christ in a letter to dr harwood and in the year following voltaire in the shades or dialogues on the deistical controversy  he was now willing to try his fortune with a tragedy and sent his siege of marseilles to garrick who observed to him that though abounding in beautiful passages it was deficient in dramatic art and advised him to model it anew in which task having been assisted by the author of douglas and having submitted the rifacciamento of his play to the two wartons by whom he was much regarded he promised himself better success but had the mortification to meet with a second rebuff an appeal from the manager to the public was his unquestioned privilege but not contented with seeking redress by these means he threatened garrick with a new dunciad the rejection which his drama afterwards underwent at each of the playhouses from the respective managers harris and sheridan perhaps taught him at least to suspect his own judgment  in 1772 being employed to edit pearchs collection of poems he inserted amongst them his hengist and mey and the elegy on mary about the same time he wrote for the whitehall evening post but his mind was now attracted to a more splendid project this was a translation of the great epic poem of portugal the lusiad of camoens which had as yet been represented to the english reader only through the inadequate version of fanshaw that nothing might hinder his prosecution of this labour he resigned his employment at oxford and retired to a farmhouse at forresthill about five miles from that city the village in which milton found his first wife and where mickle afterwards found his in the daughter of his landlord by the end of 1775 his translation was completed and published at oxford with a numerous list of subscribers experience had not yet taught him wariness in his approaches to his patron at the suggestion of his relative commodore johnstone in an unlucky moment he inscribed his book to the duke of buccleugh this nobleman had declared his acceptance of the dedication in a manner so gracious that mickle was once more decoyed with the hope of having found a powerful protector after an interval of some months he learnt that his incense had not been permitted to enter the nostrils of the new idol and that his offering lay where he left it without the slightest notice for this disappointment he might have considered it to be some compensation that his work had procured him the kindness of those who were more able to estimate it mr crowe assisted him in compiling the notes lowth offered to ordain him with the promise of making some provision for him in the church and one whose humanity and candour are among the chief ornaments of the bench on which lowth then sate doctor bathurst soothed him by those benevolent offices which he delights to extend to the neglected and the oppressed nor were the public insensible to the value of his translation a second edition was called for in 1778 and his gains amounted on the whole to near a thousand pounds a larger sum than was likely to fall to the share of an author who so little understood the art of making his way in the world it was not however considerable enough to last long against the calls made on it for the payment of old debts and for the support of his sisters and he was devising further means of supplying his necessities by a subscription for his poems when commodore johnstone in 1779 being appointed to head a squadron of ships nominated him his secretary on board the romney mickle had hitherto struggled through a life of anxiety and indigence but a gleam of prosperity came over the few years that remained a good share of prizemoney fell to his lot and the squadron having been fortunately ordered to lisbon he was there received with so much distinction that it would seem as if the portuguese had been willing to make some amends for their neglect of camoens by the deference which they shewed his translator prince john the uncle to the queen was ready on the quay to welcome him at landing and during a residence of more than six months he was gratified by the attentions of the principal men of the country at the first institution of the royal academy at lisbon he was enrolled one of the members here he composed almada hill an epistle from lisbon which was published in the next year and designing to write a history of portugal he brought together some materials for that purpose  when he had returned to england he was so much enriched by his agency for the disposal of the prizes which had been made during the cruise and by his own portion of the prizemoney that he was enabled to discharge honourably the claims which his creditors still had on him and to settle himself with a prospect of independence and ease he accordingly married mary the daughter of mr robert tompkins of forresthill and took a house at wheatley a little village about five miles from oxford some interruption to his tranquillity occurred from the failure of a banker with whom his agency had connected him and from a chancery suit in which he too hastily engaged to secure a part of his wifes fortune he then resumed his intention of publishing his poems by subscription and continued still to exercise his pen his remaining productions were a tract entitled the prophecy of queen emma an ancient ballad c with hints towards a vindication of the authenticity of the poems of ossian and rowley in 1782 and some essays called fragments of leo and some reviews of books both which he contributed to the european magazine he died after a short illness on the 25th of october 1788 at forresthill while on a visit at the house of his fatherinlaw and was buried at that place he left one son who was an extraclerk in the india house in 1806 when the life of mickle was written by the rev john sim a friend on whom he enjoined that task and who i doubt not has performed it with fidelity  mickle was a man of strong natural powers which he had not always properly under controul when he is satisfied to describe with little apparent effort what he has himself felt or conceived as in his ballads and songs he is at times eminently happy he has generally erred on the side of the too much rather than of the too little his defect is not so much want of genius as of taste his thoughts were forcible and vivid but the words in which he clothed them are sometimes illchosen and sometimes awkwardly disposed he degenerates occasionally into mere turgidness and verbosity as in the following lines    oh partner of my infant grief and joys     big with the scenes now past my heart oerflows   bids each endearment fair at once to rise     and dwells luxurious on her melting woes   when his stanza forced him to lop off this vain superfluity of words that the sense might be brought within a narrower compass he succeeded better who would suppose that these verses could have proceeded from the same man that had written the well known song beginning and are ye sure the news is true from which there is not a word that can he taken without injury and which seems so well to answer the description of a simple and popular song in shakspeare    it is old and plain   the songsters and the knitters in the sun   and the free maids that weave their threads with bone   do use to chaunt it it is silly sooth   and dallies with the innocence of love   like the old age  syr martyn is the longest of his poems he could not have chosen a subject in itself much less capable of embellishment but whatever the pomp of machinery or profuseness of description could contribute to its decoration has not been spared after an elaborate invocation of the powers that preside over the stream of mulla a reverend wizard is conjured up in the eye of the poet and the wizard in his turn conjures up scene after scene in which appear the hopeful young knight syr martyn possest of goodly baronie the dairymaid kathrin by whose wiles he is inveigled into an illicit amour the good aunt who soon dies of chagrin at this unworthy attachment the young brood who are the offspring of the illsorted match his brother an openhearted sailor who is hindered by the artifices of kathrin from gaining access to the house and lastly the fair nymph dissipation with whom syr martyn seeks refuge from his unpleasant recollections and who conspires with the lazy fiend selfimposition to conduct him to the dreary cave of discontent where the poet leaves him and the reverend wizard for aught we hear to the contrary in his company mean and familiar incidents and characters do not sort well with allegory which requires beings that are themselves somewhat removed from the common sphere of human nature to meet and join it a little beyond the limits of this world yet in this tale incongruous and disjointed as the dream of a sick man velut aegri somnia he has interspersed some lines and even whole stanzas to which the poet or the painter may turn again and again with delight though the common reader will scarce find them sufficient to redeem the want of interest that pervades the whole  his elegy on mary queen of scots is also a vision but it is better managed at once mournful and sweet he has thrown a pall of gorgeous embroidery over the bloody hearse of mary  wolfwold and ella of which the story was suggested by a picture of mortimers is itself a picture in which the fine colouring and spirited attitudes reconcile us to its horrors  his tragedy is a tissue of love and intrigue with sudden starts of passion and unprepared and improbable turns of resolution and temper towards the conclusion one of the female characters puts an end to herself for little apparent reason except that it is the fifth act and some blood must therefore be shed garricks refusal in all likelihood spared him the worse mortification of seeing it rejected on the stage yet there is here and there in it a masterly touch like the following    either my mind has lost its energy   or the unbodied spirits of my fathers   beneath the nights dark wings pass to and fro   in doleful agitation hovering round me   methought my father with a mournful look   beheld me sudden from unconscious pause   i wakd and but his marble bust was here  almada hill has some just sentiments and some pleasing imagery but both are involved in the mazes of an unskilful or ambitious phraseology from which it is a work of trouble to extricate them it was about this time that the laboured style in poetry had reached its height not to loiter into prose of which lyttelton bade him beware was the grand aim and in their eagerness to leave prose as far behind them as possible the poets were in danger of outstripping the understanding and feelings of their readers it was this want of ease and perspicuity in his longer pieces which prevented mickle from being as much a favourite with the public as many who were far his inferiors in the other qualities of a poet when a writer is obscure only because his reasoning is too abstruse his fancy too lively or his allusions too learned for the vulgar it is more just that we should complain of ourselves for not being able to rise to his level than of him for not descending to ours but let the difficulty arise from mere imperfections of language and the consciousness of having solved an involuntary enigma is scarcely sufficient to reward our pains  the translation of the lusiad is that by which he is best known in this as in his original poems the expression is sometimes very faulty but he is never flat or insipid in the numbers there is much sweetness and freedom and though they have somewhat of the masculine melody of dryden yet they have something also that is peculiarly his own he has in a few instances enriched the language of poetry by combinations unborrowed from any of his predecessors it is doubtful whether as much can be said for popes translation of homer almost all who have written much in the couplet measure since waller clipped it into uniformity have been at times reduced to the necessity of eking out their lines in some way or other so as to make the sense reach its prescribed bound most have done it by means of epithets which were always found to be friends in need mickle either breaks the lines with a freedom and spirit which were then unusual or repeats something of what has gone before a contrivance that ought to be employed sparingly and used chiefly when it is desirable to produce the effect of sweetness  the preference which he sometimes claims in the notes for his author above the other epic poets of ancient and modern times is less likely to conciliate the good opinion than to excite the disgust of his readers there is no artifice that a translator can resort to with less chance of success than this blowing of the showmans trumpet as he goes on exhibiting the wonders of his original there are some puerile hyperboles for which i know not whether he or camoens is responsible such as    the mountain echoes catch the big swoln sighs   the yellow sands with tears are silverd oer  johnson told him that he had once intended to translate the lusiad the version would have had fewer faults but it may be questioned whether the general result would have been as much animation and harmony as have been produced by mickle  in addition to the poems which were confessedly his there are no less than seventeen in mr evanss collection of ballads of which a writer in the quarterly review1 some years ago expressed his suspicion that they were from the pen of mickle it has been found on inquiry that the suggestion of this judicious critic is fully confirmed one of these has lately been brought into notice from its having formed the groundwork of one of those deservedly popular stories which have lately come to us from the north of the tweed it is to be wished that mickles right in all of them were formally recognized and that they should be no longer withheld from their place amongst his other poetical writings to which they would form so valuable an accession  footnote 1 for may 1810 no vi the title of the ballads are bishop thurston     and the king of scots battle of caton moor murder of prince     arthur

were supplied by the natural quickness of his pupil and by the attention of mr thomson the minister of laurencekirk who being a man of learning admitted young beattie to the use of his library and probably animated him by his encouragement he very early became sensible to the charms of english verse to which he was first awakened by the perusal of ogilbys virgil before he was ten years old he was as well acquainted with that writer and homer as the versions of pope and dryden could make him his schoolfellows distinguished him by the name of the poet  at the age of fourteen he was sent to marischal college aberdeen where he attended the greek class taught by dr blackwell author of the memoirs of the court of augustus and was by him singled out as the most promising of his scholars the slender pittance spared him by his mother would scarcely have sufficed for his support if he had not added to it one of the bursaries or pensions that were bestowed on the most deserving candidates of a discourse which he was called on to deliver at the divinity hall it was observed that he spoke poetry in prose thomson was censured for a similar impropriety in one of his youthful exercises but beattie gained the applause of his audience  his academical education being completed on the 1st of august 1753 he was satisfied with the humble appointment of parishclerk and schoolmaster at the village of fordoun about six miles distant from laurencekirk here he attracted the notice of mr garden at that time sheriff of the county and afterwards one of the scotch judges with the appellation of lord gardenstown in a romantic glen near his house he chanced to find beattie with pencil and paper in his hand and on questioning him discovered that he was engaged in the composition of a poem mr garden desired to see some of his other poems and doubting whether they were his own productions requested him to translate the invocation to venus at the opening of lucretius which beattie did in such a manner as to remove his incredulity in this retirement he also became known to lord monboddo whose family seat was in the parish and a friendly intercourse ensued which did not terminate till the death of that learned but visionary man in 1758 he was removed from his employment at fordoun to that of usher in the grammar school at aberdeen for which he had been an unsuccessful competitor in the preceding year but was now nominated without the form of a trial  at aberdeen his heart seems to have taken up its rest for no temptations could afterwards seduce him for any length of time to quit it the professorship of natural philosophy in the marischal college where he had lately been a student being vacant in 1760 mr arbuthnot one of his friends exerted himself with so much zeal in the behalf of beattie that he obtained that appointment although the promotion was such as his most sanguine wishes did not aspire to soon after he was further gratified by being permitted to exchange it for the professorship of moral philosophy and logic for which he thought himself better fitted in discharge of the duties belonging to his new function he immediately entered on a course of lectures which as appears from his diary in the possession of sir william forbes he repeated with much diligence for more than thirty years  this occupation could not have been very favourable to his poetical propensity he had since his twentieth year been occasionally a contributor of verse to the scots magazine and in 1760 he published a collection of poems inscribed to the earl of erroll to whose intervention he had been partly indebted for the office he held in the college though the number of these pieces was not considerable he omitted several of them in subsequent editions and among others a translation of virgils eclogues some specimens of which adduced in a letter written by lord woodhouselee author of the principles of translation will stand a comparison with the parallel passages in dryden and warton  in the summer of 1763 his curiosity led him for the first time to london where andrew millar the bookseller was almost his only acquaintance of this journey no particular is recorded but that he visited popes house at twickenham  in 1765 having sent a letter of compliment to gray then on a visit to the earl of strathmore he was invited to glammis castle the residence of that nobleman to meet the english poet in whom he found such a combination of excellence as he had hitherto been a stranger to this appears from a letter written to sir william forbes his faithful friend and biographer with whom his intimacy commenced about the same time    i am sorry you did not see mr gray on his return you would have been   much pleased with him setting aside his merit as a poet which   however in my opinion is greater than any of his contemporaries can   boast in this or in any other nation i found him possessed of the   most exact taste the soundest judgment and the most extensive   learning he is happy in a singular facility of expression his   conversation abounds in original observations delivered with no   appearance of sententious formality and seeming to arise   spontaneously without study or premeditation i passed two very   agreeable days with him at glammis and found him as easy in his   manners and as communicative and frank as i could have wished  gray could not have requited him with such excess of admiration but continued during the rest of his life to regard beattie with affection and esteem  it was not till the spring of this year when his judgment of paris was printed that he again appeared before the public as an author this piece he inserted in the next edition of his poems in 1766 but his more mature judgment afterwards induced him to reject it some satirical verses on the death of churchill at first published without his name underwent the same fate the wolf and the shepherds a fable and an epistle to the rev mr thomas blacklock which appeared in the second edition he also discarded from those subsequently published he now projected and began the minstrel the most popular of his poems had the original plan been adhered to it would have embraced a much wider scope  in 1767 he married mary the daughter of dr dun rector of the grammar school at aberdeen this union was not productive of the happiness which a long course of previous intimacy had entitled him to expect the object of his choice inherited from her mother a constitutional malady which at first shewed itself in capricious waywardness and at length broke out into insanity  from this misery he sought refuge in the exercise of his mind his residence at aberdeen had brought him into the society of several among his countrymen who were engaged in researches well suited to employ his attention to its utmost stretch of these the names of reid author of an inquiry into the human mind on the principles of common senseand campbell principal of marischal college author of an essay on miracles are the most distinguished his own correspondence with his friends about this time evinces deep concern at the progress of the sceptical philosophy diffused by the writings of hobbes hume mandeville and even in his opinion of locke and berkeley conceiving the study of metaphysics itself to be the origin of this mischief in order that the evil might be intercepted at its source he proposed to demonstrate the futility of that science and to appeal to the common sense and unsophisticated feelings of mankind as the only infallible criterion on subjects in which it had formerly been made the standard that his meaning was excellent no one can doubt whether he discovered the right remedy for the harm which he was desirous of removing is much more questionable to magnify any branch of human knowledge beyond its just importance may indeed tend to weaken the force of religious faith but many acute metaphysicans have been good christians and before the question thus agitated can be set at rest we must suppose a certain proficiency in those inquiries which he would proscribe as dangerous after all we can discover no more reason why sciolists in metaphysics should bring that study into discredit than that religion itself should be disparaged through the extravagance of fanaticism to have met the subject fully he ought to have shewn that not only those opinions which he controverts are erroneous but that all the systems of former metaphysicians were so likewise  the essay on truth in which he endeavoured to establish his own hypothesis being finished in 1769 he employed sir william forbes and mr arbuthnot to negotiate its sale with the booksellers they however refused to purchase it on any terms and the work would have remained unpublished if his two friends making use of a little pious fraud had not informed him that the manuscript was sold for fifty guineas a sum which they at the same time remitted him and that they had stipulated with the booksellers to be partakers in the profits the book accordingly appeared in the following year and having gained many admirers was quickly followed by a second impression which he revised and corrected with much pains  in the autumn of 1771 he again visited london where the reputation obtained by the essay and by the first book of the minstrel then recently published opened for him an introduction into the circles most respectable for rank and literature lord lyttelton declared that it seemed to him his once most beloved minstrel thomson was come down from heaven refined by the converse of purer spirits than those he lived with here to let him hear him sing again the beauties of nature and the finest feelings of virtue not with human but with angelic strains he added his wishes that it were in his power to do beattie any service from mrs montagu he on different occasions received more substantial tokens of regard  except the trifling emolument derived from his writings he had hitherto been supported merely by the small income appended to his professorship but the earl of dartmouth a nobleman to whom nothing that concerned the interests of religion was indifferent representing him as a fit object of the royal bounty a pension of two hundred pounds a year was now granted him previously to his obtaining this favour he was first presented to the king and was then honoured by an interview with both their majesties the particulars of this visit were minutely recorded in his diary after much commendation of his essay the sovereign pleasantly told him that he had never stolen but one book and that was his i stole it from the queen said his majesty to give it to lord hertford to read in the course of the conversation many questions were put to him concerning the scotch universities the revenues of the scotch clergy and their mode of preaching and praying when beattie replied that their clergy sometimes prayed a quarter or even half an hour without interruption the king observed that this practice must lead into repetitions and that even our own liturgy excellent as it is is faulty in this respect while the subject of his pension was under consideration the queen made a tender of some present to him through dr majendie but he declined to encroach on her majestys munificence unless the application made to the crown in his behalf should prove unsuccessful a mercenary spirit indeed was not one of his weaknesses being on a visit at bulstrode his noble hostess the duchess of portland would have had him take a present of a hundred pounds to defray the expenses of his journey into england but he excused himself as well as he was able for not accepting her graces bounty  with his pension his wishes appear to have been bounded temptation to enter into orders in our church was thrice offered him and as often rejected once in the shape of a general promise of patronage from dr drummond archbishop of york next of a small living in dorsetshire in the gift of mr john pitt and the third time of a much more valuable benefice which was at the disposal of dr thomas bishop of winchester in answer to dr porteus through whom the last of these offers came and whose friendship he enjoyed during the remainder of his life he represented in addition to other reasons for his refusal that he was apprehensive lest his acceptance of preferment might render the motives for his writing the essay on truth suspected he at the same time avowed that if he were to have become a clergyman the church of england would certainly have been his choice as he thought that in regard to churchgovernment and churchservice it had many great and peculiar advantages unwillingness to part from aberdeen was perhaps at the bottom of these stout resolutions it was confessedly one of the reasons for which he declined a proposition made to him in the year 1773 to remove to the chair of moral philosophy in edinburgh though he was urged by his friends not to neglect this opportunity of extending the sphere of his usefulness and the change would have brought him much pecuniary advantage his reluctance to comply was increased by the belief that there were certain persons at edinburgh to whom his principles had given offence and in whose neighbourhood he did not expect to live so quietly as he wished in the same year he was complimented with the honorary degree of doctor of laws by the university of oxford at the installation of lord north in the chancellorship  he now therefore lived on at aberdeen making occasionally brief visits to england where he was always welcome both at the court and by those many individuals of eminence to whom his talents and virtues had recommended him in the summers he usually indulged himself with passing some time at peterhead a town situated on the most easterly promontory of scotland and resorted to for its medicinal waters which he thought beneficial to his health for he had early in life been subject to a vertiginous disorder the recurrence of which at times incapacitated him for any serious application  the second book of the minstrel appeared in 1774 in 1776 he was prevailed on to publish by subscription in a more splendid form his essay on truth which was now accompanied by two other essays on poetry and music and on laughter and ludicrous composition and by remarks on the utility of classical learning this was succeeded in 1783 by dissertations moral and critical on memory and imagination on dreaming on the theory of language on fable and romance on the attachments of kindred and on illustrations of sublimity being as he states in the preface part of a course of prelections read to those young gentlemen whom it was his business to initiate in the elements of moral science in 1786 he published a small treatise entitled evidences of the christian religion at the suggestion of porteus who was now a bishop and in 1790 and 1793 two volumes of elements of moral science containing an abridgment of his public lectures on moral philosophy and logic  his only remaining publication was an edition of the juvenile works of the elder of his two sons who was taken off by a consumption november 1790 at the age of twentytwo to the education of this boy he had attended with such care and discernment as the anxiety of a parent only could dictate and had watched his unfolding excellence with fondness such as none but a parent could feel at the risque of telling my reader what he may perhaps well remember i cannot but relate the method which he had taken to impress on his mind when a child the sense of his dependence on a supreme being of which porteus well observed that it had all the imagination of rousseau without his folly and extravagance  the doctrines of religion said beattie i had wished to impress on his mind as soon as it might be prepared to receive them but i did not see the propriety of making him commit to memory theological sentences or any sentences which it was not possible for him to understand and i was desirous to make a trial how far his own reason could go in tracing out with a little direction the great and first principle of all religion the being of god the following fact is mentioned not as a proof of superior sagacity in him for i have no doubt that most children would in like circumstances think as he did but merely as a moral or logical experiment he had reached his fifth or sixth year knew the alphabet and could read a little but had received no particular information with respect to the author of his being because i thought he could not yet understand such information and because i had learned from my own experience that to be made to repeat words not understood is extremely detrimental to the faculties of a young mind in a corner of a little garden without informing any person of the circumstance i wrote in the mould with my finger the three initial letters of his name and sowing garden cresses in the furrows covered up the seed and smoothed the ground ten days after he came running to me and with astonishment in his countenance told me that his name was growing in the garden i smiled at the report and seemed inclined to disregard it but he insisted on my going to see what had happened yes said i carelessly on coming to the place i see it is so but there is nothing in this worth notice it is mere chance and i went away he followed me and taking hold of my coat said with some earnestness it could not be mere chance for that somebody must have contrived matters so as to produce it i pretend not to give his words or my own for i have forgotten both but i give the substance of what passed between us in such language as we both understoodso you think i said that what appears so regular as the letters of your name cannot be by chance yes said he with firmness i think so look at yourself i replied and consider your hands and fingers your legs and feet and other limbs are they not regular in their appearance and useful to you he said they were came you then hither said i by chance no he answered that cannot be something must have made me and who is that something i asked he said he did not know i took particular notice that he did not say as rousseau fancies a child in like circumstances would say that his parents made him i had now gained the point i aimed at and saw that his reason taught him though he could not so express it that what begins to be must have an intelligent cause i therefore told him the name of the great being who made him and all the world concerning whose adorable nature i gave him such information as i thought he could in some measure comprehend the lesson affected him greatly and he never forgot either it or the circumstance that introduced it  so great was the docility of this boy that before he had reached his twentieth year he had been thought capable of succeeding his father in his office of public professor when death had extinguished those hopes the comfort and expectation of the parent were directed to his only surviving child who with less application and patience had yet a quickness of perception that promised to supply the place of those qualities but this prospect did not continue to cheer him long in march 1796 the youth was attacked by a fever which in seven days laid him by the side of his brother he was in his eighteenth year the sole consolation with which this world could now supply beattie was that if his sons had lived he might have seen them a prey to that miserable distemper under which their mother whose state had rendered a separation from her family unavoidable was still labouring from this total bereavement he sometimes found a short relief in the estrangement of his own mind which refused to support the recollection of such a load of sorrow many times says sir william forbes he could not recollect what had become of his son and after searching in every room of the house he would say to his niece mrs glennie you may think it strange but i must ask you if i have a son and where he is that man must be a stern moralist who would censure him very severely for having sought as he sometimes did a renewal of this oblivion in his cups  he was unable any longer to apply himself to study and left most of the letters he received from his friends unanswered music in which he had formerly delighted he could not endure to hear from others after the loss of his first son though a few months before the death of the second he had begun to accompany him when he sang on his own favourite instrument which was the violoncello afterwards as may be supposed the sound of it was painful to him he still took some pleasure in books and in the company of a very few amongst his oldest friends this was his condition till the beginning of april 1799 when he was seized with a paralytic stroke which rendered his speech imperfect for several days during the rest of his life he had repeated attacks of the same malady the last which happened on the 5th of october 1802 entirely deprived him of motion he languished however till the 18th of august in the following year when nature being exhausted he expired without a struggle  he was interred according to his own desire by the side of his two sons in the churchyard of st nicholas at aberdeen with the following inscription from the pen of dr james gregory professor of physic at edinburgh  memoriae sacrum jacobi beattie lld ethices in academia marescallana hujus urbis per xliii annos professoris

periit anno aetatis xxiii geo et mar glennie hmp  in his person says sir william forbes doctor beattie was of the middle size though not elegantly yet not awkwardly formed but with something of a slouch in his gait his eyes were black and piercing with an expression of sensibility somewhat bordering on melancholy except when engaged in cheerful and social intercourse with his friends when they were exceedingly animated in a portrait of him taken in middle life by reynolds and given to him as a mark of his regard by the painter he is represented with his essay on truth under his arm at a little distance is introduced the allegorical figure of truth as an angel holding in one hand a balance and with the other thrusting back the visages of prejudice scepticism and folly  he is i believe the solitary instance of a poet having received so much countenance at the court of george the third and this favour he owed less to any other cause than to the zeal and ability with which he had been thought to oppose the enemies of religion the respect with which he was treated both at home and abroad was no more than a just tribute to those merits and the excellence of his private character his probity and disinterestedness the extreme tenderness with which he acquitted himself of all his domestic duties his attention to the improvement of his pupils for whose welfare his solicitude did not cease with their removal from the college his unassuming deportment which had not been altered by prosperity or by the caresses of the learned and the powerful his gratitude to those from whom he had received favours his beneficence to the poor the ardour of his devotion are dwelt on by his biographer with an earnestness which leaves us no room to doubt the sincerity of the encomium his chief defect was an irritability of temper in the latter part of his life which shewed itself principally towards those who differed from him on speculative questions  in his writings he is to be considered as a philosopher a critic and a poet his pretensions in philosophy are founded on his essay on truth this book was of much use at its first appearance as it contained a popular answer to some of the infidel writers who were then in better odour among the more educated classes of society than happily they now are if as i suspect to have been the case it has prevented men whose rank and influence make it most desirable that their minds should be raised above the common pitch from pursuing those studies by which they were most likely so to raise them the good which it may have done has been balanced by no inconsiderable evil one can scarcely examine it with much attention and not perceive that the writer had not ascended to the sources of that science which notwithstanding any thing he may say to the contrary it was evidently his aim to depreciate through great part of it he has the appearance of one who is struggling with some unknown power which he would fain comprehend and at which in the failure to comprehend it his terror is changed into anger the word metaphysics or as he oftener terms it metaphysic crosses him like a ghost call it pneumatology the philosophy of the mind the philosophy of human nature or what you will and he can bear it    take any shape but that and his firm nerves   shall never tremble  once indeed but it is not till he has reached the third and last division of the essay he screws up his courage so high as to question it concerning its name and the result of his inquiry is this he finds that to fourteen of the books attributed to aristotle which it seems had no general title andronicus rhodius who edited them prefixed the words ta meta ta physica that is the books placed posterior to the physics either because in the order of the former arrangement they happened to be so placed or because the editor meant that they should be studied next after the physics and this he concludes is said to be the origin of the word metaphysic this is not very satisfactory and if the reader thinks so he will perhaps be glad to hear those who having dealt longer in the black art are more likely to be conjurors in it harris who had given so many years of his life to the study of aristotle tells us that metaphysics are properly conversant about primary and internal causes1 those things which are first to nature are not first to man nature begins from causes and thence descends to effects human perceptions first open upon effects and thence by slow degrees ascend to causes2  his own definition might have been enough to satisfy him that it was something very harmless about which he had so much alarmed himself still he proceeds to impute to it i know not what mischief till at last in a paroxysm of indignation he exclaims exult o metaphysic at the consummation of thy glories more thou canst not hope more thou canst not desire fall down ye mortals and acknowledge the stupendous blessing  about aristotle himself he is scarce in less perplexity he sets out by defining truth according to aristotles description of it in these fourteen dreaded books of his metaphysics again he tells us he is most admired by those who best understand him and once more refers us to these fourteen books but afterwards it would seem as if he had not himself read them for speaking of metaphysics he calls it that which aristotle is said to have called theology and the first philosophy whereas aristotle has explicitly called it so in these fourteen books3 and when he is recommending the study of the ancients he adds of aristotle i say nothing we are assured by those who have read his works that no one ever understood human nature better than he what are we to infer from this but that he had not himself read them for his distinction between common sense and reason on which all his theory depends he sends the reader to the fourth book of aristotles metaphysics and to the first of his latter analytics and yet somewhere else he speaks of these as the most worthless of aristotles writings as for plato who on such a subject might have come in for some consideration we are told that he was as much a rhetorician as a philosopher and this i think is nearly all we hear of him  beattie is among the philosophers what the quaker is among religious sectaries the greek koinos nous or common sense is the spirit whose illapses he sits down and waits for and by whose whispers alone he expects to be made wise it has sometimes prompted him well for there are admirable passages in the essay the whole train of his argument or rather his invective in the second part against the sceptics is irresistible    scalda ogni fredda lingua ardente voglia   e di sterili fa lalme feconde   ne mai deriva altronde   soave finme deloquenza raracelio magno  what comes from the heart that alone goes to the heart says a great writer of our own day4 and there are few instances of this more convincing than the vehemence with which beattie dissipates the reveries of berkeley and refutes the absurdities of hume  in the second edition 1771 speaking of those writers of genius to whom he would send the student away from the metaphysicians he confined himself to shakespeare bacon montesquieu and rousseau few will think that other names might not well have replaced the last of these in the fourth edition we find johnson added to the list this compliment met with a handsome requital for johnson soon after having occasion to speak of beattie in his life of gray called him a poet a philosopher and a good man  in his essay he comforts himself with the belief that he had enabled every person of common sense to defeat the more important fallacies of the sceptical metaphysicians even though he should not possess acuteness or metaphysical knowledge sufficient to qualify him for a logical refutation of them it is lamentable to see at how great a cost to himself he had furnished every person of common sense with these weapons of proof in a letter to sir william forbes written not long after he makes the following remarkable confession how much my mind has been injured by certain speculations you will partly guess when i tell you a fact that is now unknown to all the world that since the essay on truth was printed in quarto in the summer of 1776 i have never dared to read it over i durst not even read the sheets and see whether there were any errors in the print and was obliged to get a friend to do that office for me  as he proceeded he seems to have become more afraid of the faculty of reason in the second edition he had said did not our moral feelings in concert with what our reason discovers of the deity evidence the necessity of a future state in vain should we pretend to judge rationally of that revelation by which life and immortality have been brought to light in the edition of 1776 he softened down this assertion so much as almost to deprive it of meaning did not our moral feelings in concert with what reason discovers of the deity evidence the probability of a future state and that it is necessary to the full vindication of the divine government we should be much less qualified than we now are to judge rationally of that revelation by which life and immortality have been brought to light there was surely nothing except perhaps the word necessity that was objectionable in the proposition as it first stood  it may be remarked of his prose style in general that it is not free from that constraint which he with much candour admitted was to be found in the writings of his countrymen  of his critical works i have seen only those appended to the edition of his essay in 1776 though not deficient in acuteness they have not learning or elegance enough to make one desirous of seeing more his remarks on the characters in homer are i think the best part of them he sometimes talks of what he probably knew little about as when he tells us that he had never been able to discover anything in aristophanes that might not he consigned to eternal oblivion without the least detriment to literature that his wit and humour are now become almost invisible and seem never to have been very conspicuous with more that is equally absurd to the same purpose  the few of his poems which he thought worthy of being selected from the rest and of being delivered to posterity have many readers to whom perhaps one recommendation of them is that they are few they have however and deservedly some admirers of a better stamp they soothe the mind with indistinct conceptions of something better than is met with in ordinary life the first book of the minstrel the most considerable amongst them describes with much fervour the enthusiasm of a boy smit with the love of song and wakened to a sense of rapture by all that is most grand or lovely in the external appearances of nature it is evident that the poet had felt much of what he describes and he therefore makes his hearers feel it yet at times it must be owned he seems as if he were lashing himself into a state of artificial emotion as in the following lines    o nature how in every charm supreme   whose votaries feast on raptures ever new   o for the voice and fire of seraphim   to sing thy glories with devotion due  we hear indeed too often of natures charms  even here he cannot let the metaphysicians rest they are in his mind the grievance that is most to be complained of in this vale of tears  there was one other thing that beattie detested nearly as much as metaphysic lore it was the crowing of a cock this antipathy he contrived to express in the minstrel and the reader is startled by the expression of it as by something out of its place  of the stanza beginning o how canst thou renounce gray told him that it was of all others his favourite that it was true poetry that it was inspiration and if i am not mistaken it is related of bishop porteus that when he was once with beattie looking down on a magnificent country that lay in prospect before them he broke out with much delight into the repetition of it gray objected to one word garniture as suggesting an idea of dress and what was worse of french dress and the author tried but tried in vain to substitute another it would perhaps be impossible to find a better for the place in which it stands there is no ground of censure which a writer should admit with more caution than that a particular word or phrase happens to suggest a ludicrous or unsuitable image to the mind of another person few probably would have thought of french dress on this occasion and to some a passage in our translation of the bible might have occurred where it is said that the lord garnished the heavens another of grays criticisms fell on the word infuriate as being a new one although as sir william forbes remarks it is found not only in thomsons seasons but in the paradise lost  the second book of the minstrel is not so pleasant as it is good the stripling wanders to the habitation of a hermit who has a harp not a very usual companion for a hermit to amuse his solitude and who directs him what studies to pursue the youth is pleased with no historian except plutarch he reads homer and virgil and learns to mend his song and the poet would have told us how he learnt to sing still better if sorrow for the death of a friend had not put a period to his own labours the poem thus comes abruptly to an end and we are not much concerned that there is no more of it his first intention was to have engaged the minstrel in some adventure of importance through which it may be doubted whether he could well have conducted him for he has not shewn much skill in the narrative part of the poem  the other little piece called the hermit begins with a sweet strain which always dwells on the ear and which makes us expect that something equally sweet is to follow this hermit too has his harp symphonious he makes the same complaint and finds the same comfort for it as edwin had done in the first book of the minstrel both are the christians comment on a wellknown passage in the idyllium of moschus on the death of bion of his ode on lord hays birthday grays opinion however favourable is not much beyond the truth that the diction is easy and noble the texture of the thoughts lyric and the versification harmonious to which he adds that the panegyric has nothing mean in it  the ode to hope looks like one of blairs sermons cast into a lyrical mould  there is i believe no allusion to any particular place that was familiar to him throughout his poems the description of the owl in the lines entitled retirement he used to say was drawn from nature it has more that appearance than any thing else he has written and pleases accordingly  between his systems in poetry and philosophy some exchange might have been made with advantage to each in the former he counted general ideas for nearly all in all see his essay on poetry and music p 431 in the latter he had not learnt to generalize at all but would have rested merely in fact and experience  footnotes 1 philosophical arrangements c xvii p 409

the memoirs though somewhat more copious than many readers might have wished them are yet far from being devoid of entertainment to the lovers of literary biography  william hayley was born at chichester on the 29th of october 1745 his father was a private gentleman son of one dean of chichester and nephew to another having enriched himself by an union with the daughter of an opulent merchant who died without leaving him any children he married for his second wife mary a daughter of colonel yates a representative in parliament for the city of chichester the mother of the poet  his father dying when he was three years old and his only brother soon after william became the sole care of a discreet and affectionate woman a similar lot will be found to have influenced the earlier years of many who have been most distinguished for their virtues or abilities in after life he was taught to read by three sisters of the name of russell who kept a girls school at chichester and pleased himself by relating that when in his 63rd year he presented to one of them who still continued in the same employment with her faculties unimpaired a recent edition of his triumphs of temper his first instructor in the learned languages was a master in the same city who appeared to be so incompetent to the task he had undertaken that mrs hayley removed her son to the school of a mr woodeson at kingston he had not been long here when he was seized with a violent fit of illness which obliged his mother who had now fixed her residence in london to take him home after having nursed him for some weeks at kingston with little hopes of life of the anxiety with which she watched over him he has left the following pathetic memorial in his essay on epic poetry    thou tender saint to whom he owes much more   than ever child to parent owed before   in lifes first season when the fevers flame   shrunk to deformity his shriveld frame   and turnd each fairer image in his brain   to blank confusion and her crazy train   twas thine with constant love through lingering years   to bathe thy idiot orphan with thy tears   day after day and night succeeding night   to turn incessant to the hideous sight   and frequent watch if haply at thy view   departed reason might not dawn anew  the first sign he gave of returning intellect was an exclamation on seeing a hare run across the road as they were taking an airing in richmond park on his recovery his mother provided him a private tutor in greek and latin of the name of ayles formerly a fellow of kings college cambridge while she herself and his nurse a faithful servant in the family for more than fifty years encouraged his early propensity for english literature the former by reading to him and the other by making him recite passages out of tragedies of which the good woman was passionately fond  in august 1757 his mother placed him at eton where he remained about six years at the end of which time he was removed to trinity hall cambridge like many others he acknowledges the illusion of considering our schoolboy days as the happiest of life the infirmities which his sickness had brought on made him extremely sensible to the jibes and rough treatment of the bigger boys and the accidental neglect of a greek lesson exposed him to a flogging which he never quite forgave one of his tutors at eton was dr roberts author of judah restored a poem in which the numbers of the paradise lost are happily imitated by him the young scholar was confirmed in that love of composing verse which he could trace hack to his ninth year there is little promise in the specimens he gives of his earlier attempts his english ode on the birth of the present king inserted in the cambridge collection is an indifferent performance even for a boy at the university he describes himself to have studied diligently to have given many of his hours to drawing and painting and to have formed friendships which were dissolved only by death on thornton a member of the same hall the most favoured of these associates whom he lost when a young man he wrote an elegy which is one of the best of his works with him he improved himself in the spanish and italian languages the latter of which they studied under isola a teacher at cambridge afterwards creditably known by an edition of the gerusalemme liberata hayley entered his name at the middle temple on the 13th of june 1766 and in the following year quitted cambridge without a degree he now made some ineffectual attempts towards fixing his choice of a profession in life but at last poetry and especially the drama were suffered to engross him in october 1769 he married eliza the daughter of dr ball dean of chichester this lady had been the confidant of his attachment to another the match was on his part entered on rather from disappointment than love and was made contrary to the advice of his surviving parent who represented to him the danger there was lest his wife should inherit an incurable insanity under which her mother long laboured many years after he put her away fancying himself no longer able to endure a waywardness of temper which as he thought amounted nearly to the calamity that had been apprehended in the summer of 1774 he retired with his wife and mother from great queenstreet where they had hitherto resided to his paternal estate at eartham in sussex but in the ensuing winter his mother went back to london for medical advice and there died  he had endeavoured but in vain to bring several of his tragedies on the stage garrick with some hollow compliments rejected one called the afflicted father of which the story appears to have been too shocking for representation it was that a father had supplied his son under sentence of death with poison and when too late found that he was pardoned another called the syrian queen which he had imitated from the rodogune of corneille was refused with more sincerity by colman a third met no better reception from harris persuaded as he says by his own sensations that he had a considerable portion of native poetic fire in his mind he resolved to display it in a composition less subject to the caprice of managers yet more arduous in its execution in short he determined to begin an epic poem he chose for his subject the extorting of magna charta from king john the death of his friend thornton in 1780 who had watched the progress of this essay with much solicitude for its success chiefly induced him to relinquish a design which was in truth ill fitted to his powers in the essay on epic poetry he recommended it to mason who was not much better able to accomplish it than himself i am unwilling to detain my reader by an account of the numerous poems which he either did not complete or did not commit to the press his unpublished verses as he told me a few years before his death amounted to six times the number of those in print  his first publication was the epistle on painting to romney in 1778 the two next in the following year were anonymous the one a congratulatory epistle to admiral keppel on his acquittal the other an essay on the ancient greek model as he called it to bishop lowth remonstrating against the contention which the bishop had entered into with warburton and which he thought unworthy so excellent a prelate in 1780 he produced besides the verses on the death of mr thornton an ode to howard and the epistles on history addressed to gibbon which gained him the intimacy of the historian and the philanthropist the success of these works encouraged him to project the triumphs of temper the most popular of all his poems which he published in 1781 the next year saw the publication of his essay on epic poetry in the notes to which he introduced much information on the poetry of italy and spain then less known among us than at present and he endeavoured to rouse the spirits of wright the painter at derby by an ode which was printed for private circulation in 1784 he published a volume of plays consisting of tragedies and comedies the latter of which were in rhyme the gratification of seeing his dramas represented on the stage which he had before solicited in vain was now offered by colman who proposed through the authors bookseller to bring out a tragedy and comedy lord russell and the two connoisseurs at the haymarket a comedy in rhyme the manager observed was a bold attempt but when so well executed as in the present instance he thought would be received with favour especially on a stage of a genius somewhat similar to that of a private theatre for which it was professedly written both tragedy and comedy were well received but with so little emolument to the poet that he had to pay for his own seat at the representation marcella the other tragedy was also acted in 1789 when it was condemned at one house and in three nights after applauded at the other the author accounted for this whimsical change of fortune by supposing the piece to have been played only on a few hours preparation by the manager at drurylane in order to get the start of harris and prevent his success by having the play damned before it appeared on his theatre  hayley was however now in great favour with the public the first edition of his plays was sold in a fortnight and through the intervention of his friend thomas payne the bookseller he repurchased for 500l from dodsley the copyright of all he had written it would have been well if his poetical career had closed here for whatever he did afterwards in this way met either with disregard or contempt such was the fate of a poem on the anniversary of the revolution in 1788 of an imitation of a german opera called the trial of the rovers which he sold to harris for 100l but which failed at coventgarden in 1789 of eudora a tragedy acted with no better success in 1790 of the national advocates intended to commemorate the triumph of erksine in his defence of horne tooke in 1795 of an elegy on sir william jones in the same year of an essay on sculpture in 1800 of ballads on animals the most empty of his productions that i have seen in 1802 of the triumphs of music in 1804 of stanzas to the patriots in spain in 1808 and of another volume of plays in 1811  yet he still continued to secure to himself some share of attention by several works in prose in the essay on old maids published in 1785 there is an agreeable combination of learning sprightliness and arch humour he now and then approaches to irreverence on sacred subjects but as i am persuaded without any ill intention the dedication of the book to mrs carter gave much offence to that lady his dialogues on johnson and chesterfield in 1787 contrast the character of these writers in a lively manner and with some power of discrimination but the partiality of the author is very evident he had himself sacrificed too successfully to the graces to be a fair umpire between the rough scholar and the polished nobleman the young widow or the history of cornelia sedley a novel was published without his name as the lastmentioned two books had also been in 1789 for this he received 200l from mr nichols the purchaser found his bargain a hard one for the novel had little to recommend it being deficient in probability of incident and character he made up for the loss by presenting his bookseller with another anonymous work entitled the eulogies of howard a vision in prose1 his life of milton was intended for an edition of the poet to be published by nichols the kings printer but an abridgement of it only was employed in 1794 for the purpose some passages being not thought courtly enough for the royal eye he afterwards published it without mutilation the design of this work to which he devoted two years of diligent application was to vindicate milton from the asperity of johnsona task which according to the general opinion has since been more ably executed by doctor symmons he had however reason to be satisfied with this undertaking as it led to an acquaintance and friendship with cowper who was at the same time engaged in writing notes to milton eight years after it fell to his lot to write a life of cowper himself this proved to him the most lucrative of all his literary engagements but its success was owing principally not to the narrative but to the private letters of cowper which accompanied them of the life and letters he added another volume in 1804 and in 1809 wrote the life of romney which having no such attraction did not recommend itself to the public notice  from the time that he left london in 1774 till his death a period of 46 years he was seldom long absent from his home first at eartham and afterwards at felpham a pleasant village on the seashore distant only a few miles from his former residence cowper who visited him at eartham in 1792 speaks of the house as the most elegant mansion he had ever inhabited surrounded by the most delightful pleasure grounds he had ever seen and observes he had no conception that a poet could be the owner of such a paradise the house was built and the pleasure grounds laid out by himself here i saw him in the next summer but one after cowpers visit his habits appeared to me such as they were long afterwards described by mrs opiethose of extreme retirement of abstemiousness and of family devotion he was at that time employed on his life of milton and in educating his son a promising boy who under the age of fourteen had began to translate the epistles of horace into tolerable blank verse on accompanying me the next morning out of paradise the lad spoke to me with some sorrow of his fathers refusal to let him join a pack of hounds in the neighbourhood he died in his 20th year a victim probably to the secluded life and the studious habits to which his parent had so early devoted him his mother a servant in the family as i was told by anna seward declared him to be the son of a young orphan named howell who having been benevolently received by hayley into his house and through his means promoted in the military service of the east india company soon after perished by shipwreck but the features of the boy told a different story and one more consonant to that of the poet by whom he was always acknowledged for his son he was for some time the pupil of mr flaxman who augured highly of his abilities and who if the young man had lived would certainly have done all that could be done by example and instruction to render him illustrious in his art and respectable as a man  considering his independence on any profession the ease of his manners his talents for conversation and his knowledge of modern languages it may be wondered that hayley did not mix more in society or visit other countries besides his own once indeed when a young man he made an excursion to scotland and in the summer of 1790 passed three weeks at paris with his friends carwardine and romney from whence much to the scandal of the neighbourhood he brought back a french governess for his son mrs hayley had then left him or rather had been gently forced out of his house and afterwards when she begged for leave to return was denied it from his own account of the matter and from the letters that passed between them some of which he has published in his memoirs it is difficult to acquit him of blame and not to wish that he had endured with more patience the foibles of a woman who though irreproachable in her own conduct was more indulgent than she need have been to his frailties he appears however to have been anxious for her happiness after they were separated she died in london in 1797 and received from her husband the empty honours of a funeral sermon and an epitaph he was loth to quit his home except on some errand of friendship when he was ever ready to run to the lands end i remember his quoting to me the following line out of aeschylus on the advantage of a masters presence in his own family  greek omma gar domon nomixo despton paronsian  he seems to have taken delight in the instruction of youth besides his own boy he undertook to educate gratuitously two sons of his friend mr carwardine and one of his neighbour lord egremont on the death of warton he declined some advances that were made him through his friends towards an offer of the laureatship nothing but a high sense of independence could have prompted this refusal for though no courtier he was not wanting in loyalty and the stipend would have been a welcome addition to an income which barely sufficed his own moderate wants and his liberal contributions to the necessities of others  he was not more fortunate in a second marriage than he had been in his first the vain confidence which he placed in his good stars on this occasion shall be told in his own words which are as follows  while he was deeply engaged in his biographical compositions he used to say i have not leisure to wander from my hermitage and look into the world in quest of a wife but i feel a strong persuasion that if it is really good for me to venture once more on marriage      that step   of deepest hazard and of highest hope  my kind stars will conduct to my cell some compassionate fair one fond of books and retirement who may be willing to enliven with the songs of tenderness the solitude of a poetical hermit  such was the frame of mind in the recluse when an incident occurred that gradually seemed to accomplish a completion of his prophecy this incident was a visit from an old ecclesiastical acquaintance attended by two young ladies mary and harriet welford daughters of an aged and retired merchant on blackheath  the countenance and musical talents of the elder sister made a strong impression on the sequestered poet their accidental visit gradually led to his second marriage on the 23d of march 1809 an event attended with much general exultation and delight though evidently like the usual steps of poets in the world rather a step of hasty affection than of deliberate prudence  in three years they were separated i know not for what reasons on shewing me some gaps in his library he said that they had been made by proceedings in doctors commons  to felpham where he passed the last twenty years of his life there retired also to end his days in privacy and quiet doctor cyril jackson who had been many years dean of christ church and in that time had refused some of the highest honours in the church it is said that when hayley waited on him the doctor declined entering upon an interchange of visits but said that he should be happy to establish an intercourse of a different kind and to send him occasionally books or anything else which he might happen to have and which hayley might be without and to receive from him the same neighbourly accommodations in return accordingly when the poet took a wife in his old age he sent the doctor a piece of the wedding cake with a message that he hoped at some future time to receive a neighbourly communication of the same sort in return  in 1818 he told me that his medical attendant was apprehensive of his becoming dropsical and had prescribed him a glass of port wine after his dinner his usual drink before this had been water in the october of the following year he wrote to me that he had been assailed by two of the most formidable enemies of the human frame and had been almost demolished by a fit of apoplexy and a fit of the stone the blow from the former he adds was so violent that my physician despaired of my revival but by the mercy of heaven i am so far revived that i can again enjoy a social and literary intercourse with my friends and even dabble again in rhyme but as i suspect that my rhymes like the homilies of gil blas archbishop may savour of apoplexy i think it right to keep them in utter privacy  his other complaint the stone terminated his life on the 12th of november 1820  under all his sufferings says his early friend mr sargent he was never heard to express a querulous word and if i had not seen it i could not have thought it possible for so much constant patience and resignation to have been exhibited under so many years of grievous pain of his severe disease he spoke with great calmness and when there seemed to be some doubt among his medical friends as to the existence of a stone in the bladder he said to me in a gentle tone i can settle the controversy between them i am sure there is for i distinctly feel it a very large stone was found after his decease an accidental fall from the slipping of his foot brought on his last illness and death when i came to him the day before he died he mentioned this circumstance and expressed a strong hope that god was in mercy about to put a period to his sufferings he had received the sacrament about a fortnight before from the rev mr hardy a minister in the neighbourhood towards whom he always expressed a most friendly regard  to this satisfactory account of hayleys latter days let me be allowed to add that which is given by the son of his friend the rev john sargent more perfect patience than hayley manifested under his excruciating tortures it never was my lot to witness his was not only submission but cheerfulness so far could he abstract himself from his intense sufferings as to be solicitous in a way that affected me tenderly respecting my comfort and accommodation as his guest a circumstance that might appear trivial to many but which to my mind was illustrative of that disinterestedness and affection which were so habitual to him in life as not to desert him in death that his patience emanated from principles far superior to those of manly and philosophical fortitude i feel a comfortable and confirmed persuasion not merely from the sentiments he expressed when his end was approaching but from the more satisfactory testimony of his declarations to his confidential servant in the season of comparative health again and again before his last seizure did he read over a little book i had given him corbetts selfexamination in secret and repeatedly did he make his servant read to him that most valuable little work of which surely no proud and insincere man can cordially approve and to her did he avow when recommending it for private perusal in the principles of that book i wish to die he also mentioned to her at the same time his approbation of the rev daniel wilsons sermons which had been kindly sent to him he permitted me frequently to pray with him as a friend and minister and when i used the confessional in the communion service of our church and some of the verses of the fiftyfirst psalm he appeared to unite devoutly in those acts of penitence and afterwards added i thank you heartily  with emphasis did i hear him utter the memorable words i know that my redeemer liveth c and on my reminding him that job exclaimed also behold i am vile he assented to the excellence of that language of repentance and humility indeed i well remember his heartily agreeing with me in an observation i made some months before that a progress in religion was to be discerned by a progressive knowledge of our own misery and sinfulness the last words almost i heard fall from him contained a sentiment i should wish living and dying to be my own christ have mercy upon me o my saviour look down upon me forsake me not  of his habits during the latter part of his life mrs opie who has the art of conferring an interest on whatever she relates has given this very pleasing account in a letter addressed to the editor of his memoirs in consequence of a previous correspondence with mr hayley the result of his flattering mention of me in the twelfth edition of the triumphs of temper i went to his house on a visit in the year 1814 nothing could exceed the regularity and temperance of mr hayleys habits we did not breakfast till a little before eight out of compliment to me i believe but as he always rose at six2 he breakfasted at halfpast seven when he was alone and as soon as he returned from his usual walk in the garden you remember how rapidly he walked spite of his lameness bearing on his stick on one side and his umbrella on the other3 during breakfast at which he drank cocoa only he always read and while i was with him he read aloud to me we then adjourned to his sitting room the upper library and he read to me or i to him till coffee was served in the dining room which was i think at eleven oclock that repast over we walked in the garden and then returned to our books or i sang to him till it was time for us to dress for dinnerwith him a very temperate meal he drank water only at dinner and took coffee instead of wine after it the coffee was served up with cream and fruit in the upper library  after dinner i read to him or he read to me till it was near teatime when we again walked in the garden and on our return to the house cocoa was served for him and tea for me after tea i read aloud or sang to him till nine oclock when the servants came in to prayers which were manuscript compositions or compilations of his own and which as you well know he read in a very impressive manner he then conversed for half an hour or i sang one or two of handels songs to him or a hymn of his own and then we retired for the night i think he had for some years been in the habit of waking at five oclock and composing a hymn but i do not remember to have heard him mention having been so employed while i was his guest  with the single exception of a drive to chichester and to lavant where we spent a day with mrs poole and of having one or two friends to tea three times there was no variety in the life which i have above described during the whole month i passed with mr hayley and i believe the years that followed to the time of his death were as little varied as the days i have detailed the honourable miss moncktons and their sister mrs milnes drank tea with us once as they were very ambitious of being presented to mr hayley and their conversation and great musical powers were justly appreciated by him  the next year i repeated my visit to felpham and found the moncktons at bognor with their brother and sister viscount and viscountess galway the latter were eager to make mr hayleys acquaintance and i easily obtained leave to introduce them at the same time the countess of mayo and mr and mrs thomas smith requested of me a similar introduction and this application drew from our friend the following remark i think my dear you had better show me at a shilling a head leave was granted me to present these new visitants and they afterwards i found introduced lord mayo that year mr hayley was unable to bear the motion of a carriage from the increased pain in his hipjoint and from that time he scarcely ever left his own precincts  the next year i went to scotland and did not see felpham till the year 1817 i found mr hayley was become fond of seeing occasional visitors and that earl and countess paulett and lady mary paulett as well as lord and lady mayo and mr and mrs t smith were frequent callers on him that year the miss godfreys were also his guests and with them i occasionally paid visits but for the most part our life was as unvaried as it was in 1814 and 1815  in 1818 i was unable to visit felpham but in 1819 i went down to bognor in considerable alarm on hearing of our poor friends illness and i was not certain that i should not arrive too late to see him but i found him out of danger and had the happiness of returning to london at the end of the week leaving him recovering but i saw him no more he died in november of the following year  you will wish to know what we read aloud chiefly manuscript poems and plays of mr hayleys and modern publications one of the former was a sensible just and as he read it an apparently wellwritten epistle to a socinian friend on the errors of his belief you know i suppose that our friend always read the bible and testament before he left his chamber in a morning hayleys memoirs vol ii p 204 the epistle of which mrs opie speaks was printed with a few other poems on serious and sacred subjects to be distributed among the friends of the author two years before his death  his person and character are well described by the rev doctor johnson in the following words he was considerably above the middle stature had a countenance remarkably expressive of intellect and feeling and a commanding air and deportment that reminded the beholder rather of a military officer than of the character he assumes in the close of his epistolary addresses he used to sign himself the hermit the deplorable infirmity however of his early years had left a perceptible lameness which attended him through life and induced a necessity of adventitious aid towards procuring him the advantage of a tolerably even walk  as to his personal qualities of a higher order these were cheerfulness and sympathy in a very eminent degree so eminent indeed that as no afflictions of his own could divest him of the former so neither could the afflictions of others find him destitute of the latter his temper also was singularly sweet and amiable being not only free from ebullitions of anger but from all those minor defects which it is needless to enumerate and to which social peace and harmony are so repeatedly sacrificed it was the most even in its exercise that the writer of this brief account of him ever witnessed whether this regular flow of good humour was owing to the native cheerfulness of his mind to the habit which he had contracted of viewing every adverse circumstance on its bright side to a course of self discipline which he did not avow to others or to the joint operation of all these it is not possible to say but certain it is that it was one of his most striking peculiarities  in all these respects there can be no doubt that the character of hayley was worthy of imitation and the editor feels that he should be deficient in a becoming attention to the expressed wish of the author in the close of his memoir if he did not briefly advert to the importance both to individual and social happiness of endeavouring to cultivate to the utmost those eminent ingredients of a beneficial life cheerfulness sympathy and good temper  closely connected with these was a rich assemblage of amiable qualities which the editor cannot do better than display in the following extract from the beforementioned sketch by the rev samuel greatheed hayley retained i believe throughout his life a high sense of honour inflexible integrity a warmth of friendship and overflowing benevolence the last was especially exerted for the introduction of meritorious young persons into useful and respectable situations and it was usually efficient as it never relaxed while they justified his patronage he did not indeed scruple while it was in his power to entrust them with large sums when there appeared a prospect of their future ability for repayment but as this prospect not seldom failed either through death or unavoidable impediments his property was greatly reduced by such beneficence  another distinctive mark of the character of hayley which few possess by nature and still fewer attain to by art was an eminently great conversational ability it was scarcely possible for any one to be in his company an hour how distinguished soever his own gifts or acquirements might be in the possession and exercise of colloquial powers without being conscious of his superiority in this respect it has been a subject of repeated astonishment to the editor that in a soil so unfavourable to the growth of this faculty as seclusion must necessarily be it should yet have arrived at such a pitch of exuberance in the case of the retired subject of this memoir as only an interchange of the best informed minds and that continually exercised could be supposed capable of producing he can only attempt to account for it from the opportunities which the author enjoyed through the advantage of one of the finest private libraries in the kingdom of conversing at all hours and in all conceivable frames of mind with the illustrious dead of every age and nation but the solution of the difficulty is still incomplete for although these literary pleiades could furnish as it were the sweet influences of rain and sunshine to foster his native talent yet breath being denied them its improvement is more than his friend cowper could have accounted for without violating his poetical axiom that                                evn the oak   thrives by the rude concussion of the storm  as to the defects of the character of hayley perhaps the most prominent feature was a pertinacity of determination with regard to his modes of action which has been seldom exemplified to the same extent in the case of others when in the contemplation of supposed advantage whether to himself or his friends he had once matured his purpose it was an attempt of no ordinary difficulty to divert him from the pursuit of it to this may perhaps be attributed the perpetual disappointments with which his life was chequered certain it is that his matrimonial infelicities may be traced to this source his first adventure of the kind alluded to had the warning voice of his surviving parent against it and it may naturally be supposed the dissuasive arguments of all his thinking and judicious friends and as to the similar connexion he formed in the decline of life he must have overcome obstacles both numerous and weighty with respect to his own situation and habits in accomplishing that object of his wishes instead of entering into a detail of these however it will be more profitable to secure the good effect that may arise from the contemplation of the former part of his character from the danger of being neutralized by the present exhibition of it this may perhaps be accomplished by reminding the reader of that principle of our lapsed nature which inclines us too often to confound evil with good the good in hayleys case appears to have been the viewing through his native cheerfulness every dispensation of providence on its bright side and the evil his applying this rule to what might be not improperly designated the dispensation of his own will there can be no doubt that his example in the first instance and his mistake in the last are equally to be followed and avoided  another failing observable in the character of hayley was the little attention he paid to public opinion in regard to his modes and habits of life during his long residence in his paternal seat of eartham though he occasionally received friends from a distance and especially the votaries of literature and the fine arts yet to the families in his vicinity he was not easily accessible he seems indeed to have been almost an insulated mortal among them and one who discharging himself from the obligation of what is commonly called etiquette made it impossible to maintain with him the reciprocities of intercourse it is true indeed that the attention of the possessor of eartham was considerably engrossed by meditation and study but this increased rather than lessened his adaptation to society and made the effect of his seclusion the more to be lamented hayleys memoirs vol ii p 220  as hayley was too much extolled at the beginning of his poetical course so was he undeservedly neglected or ridiculed at the close of it the excessive admiration he at first met with joined to that flattering selfopinion which a solitary life is apt to engender made him too easily satisfied with what he had done perhaps he wrote worse after his acquaintance with cowper for aiming at a simplicity which he had not power to support he became flat and insipid he had at no time much force of conception or language yet if he never elevates he frequently amuses his reader his chief attraction consists in setting off some plain and natural thought or observation by a sparkling and ingenious similitude such as we commonly find in the persian poets to this may be added a certain sweetness of numbers peculiar to himself without the spirit and edge of pope or the boldness of dryden and fashioned as i think to his own recitation which though musical was somewhat too pompous and monotonous he was desirous that all his rhymes should be exact but they are sometimes so only according to his own manner of pronouncing them he holds about the same rank among our poets that bertaut does among the french but differs from him in this that whereas bertaut was the earliest of a race analogous to the school of dryden and pope so hayley was the latest of the correspondent class amongst ourselves  in one respect he is deserving of most honourable notice during the course of a long literary life i doubt whether he was ever provoked to use a single word of asperity or sarcasm towards any of his contemporaries this was praise which alone ought to have exempted him from the harsh and unmerited censure of porson by whom he was called criticorum et poetarum pessimus he sometimes on the other hand indulged himself too much in a lavish and indiscriminate commendation of contemporary writers but from whatever might appear like flattery of the great he scrupulously abstained when the princess charlotte visited him at felpham he would not present some verses he had written on her lest he should be thought capable of that meanness  his essays on painting history and poetry contain much information that may be useful to young artists and students that on sculpture is very inferior to the rest as the triumph of music is to the triumphs of temper the last of these is a poem that still continues to interest a class of readers whose studies are intimately connected with the happiness and well being of society the design of it which is to shew the advantages of selfcontrol to the mind of a welleducated girl is much to be commended the machinery though it required no great effort in the production yet suffices to give some relief to the story it has been remarked that the trials of the heroine are too insignificant but of one of them at least the calumny in the newspaper this cannot properly be said nor would the purpose of the writer have been so well answered if he had been more serious and had uttered his oracles from behind a graver mask  the taste which has been lately excited amongst us for spanish and italian literature after having slept nearly since the age of elizabeth may be attributed in a great measure to the influence of his example gray hurd and the two wartons had done something towards awakening it but the spell was completed by him the decisive impulse was given by the copious extracts from the great poets in those languages which he inserted in the notes to his essay on epic poetry and which he accompanied by spirited translations lord holland the best informed and most elegant of our writers on the subject of the spanish theatre declared that he had been induced to learn that language by what hayley had written concerning the poet ercilla  i have heard his greek scholarship questioned in consequence of an error which in his epistles on history he has made in the quantity of the word olorus the name of the father of thucydides but from a casual mistake of this sort no decisive inference can be drawn  there is little knowledge of human life and character to be gained from his writings he had seen mankind chiefly through the medium of books and those such as did not represent them very faithfully to him that is in ordinary plays and novels indeed he appeared to consider the real affairs of life in which he was concerned much in the light of a romance and himself and his friends as so many personages acting in it all meeting with marvellous adventures at every turn and all endowed with admirable qualities to which their petty frailties served only as foils it is impossible in reading his memoirs to avoid smiling at the importance he attaches to very ordinary occurrences i am not sure whether it was not this propensity that led him to magnify his own distresses in living with his first wife that lady i well recollect to have been lively and elegant in her manners and much addicted to literary pursuits of which she gave a proof in translating madame de lamberts essay on friendship her excessive zeal for her husbands reputation as an author he has bantered with some humour in the play of the mausoleum where mrs rumble the wife of a poet is introduced    who crows oer her husbands poetical eggs  the character of rumble in the same play appeared so evidently designed for johnson though the author disclaimed that intention that boswell when he read it on its first coming out at

was but too appropriate the slender thread of his verse was hastily and slightly spun  his comedies are adapted to the entertainment of those readers only who have formed their taste on the french drama his tragedies are some of the most endurable we have in what a lively modern critic4 has termed the rhetorical style yet he had some skill in moving compassion  his diction both in poetry and prose is vitiated by the frequent recurrence of certain hyperbolical expressions which he applies on almost all occasions  he was particularly fond of composing epitaphs of which as i remember he shewed me a manuscript book full one of these on henry hammond the parish clerk at eartham is among the best in the language it is inserted in the memoirs which hayley wrote of his son    an active

referring to an earlier period it is stated that he usually rose     and took a dish of coffee at four am and that while dressing he     most frequently composed a few stanzas of a devotional turn this     practice of early rising he continued many years after the editor     became acquainted with him walking in his garden even in winter     and when the ground was covered with snow with a lantern in his     hand some hours before daylight and repeatedly throwing up the     sash of his friends sleeping room on the ground floor to give him     the benefit of the morning air note by doctor johnson 3 to the best of his recollection the editor never saw him abroad     without an umbrella which in fine weather he used as a parasol to     preserve his eyes he even rode with it on horseback a very awkward     operation considering the highspirited animals that composed his     stud and the constitutional malady in his hipjoint which in     addition to his weight for he was a remarkably strongbuilt man     and his never riding without military spurs reduced his danger of     falling almost to a certainty when he opened his umbrella without     due precaution but he was a stranger to fear in equestrian matters     and always mounted his horse again as soon as he could be caught     the editor was once riding gently by his side on the stony beach of     bognor when the wind suddenly reversing his umbrella as he     unfolded it his horse with a sudden but desperate plunge pitched     him on his head in an instant providentially he received no hurt     and some fishermen being at hand the plunging steed was stopped at     a gate and being once more subjected to his rider took him home in     safety on another occasion in the same visit of the editor he was     tost into the air on the downs at the precise moment when an     interesting friend whom they had just left being apprehensive of     what would happen was anxiously viewing him from her window through     a telescope      these anecdotes may serve to illustrate that determined feature of     his character which has been already noticed and which impelled     him contrary to the advice of his friends to persevere in a     favourite though perilous exercise even at the manifest hazard of     his life at length however they prevailed and for some years     before he died he gave up riding on horseback altogether note by     dr johnson 4 my friend mr darley ms additioned                                         sir william jones  the life of sir william jones has been written by his friend lord teignmouth with that minuteness which the character of so illustrious and extraordinary a man deserved he was born in london on the twentyeighth of september 1746 his father whose christian name he bore although sprung immediately from a race of yeomen in anglesea could yet like many a cambrobriton beside have traced his descent at least in a maternal line from the ancient princes of wales but what distinguished him much more was that he had attained so great a proficiency in the study of mathematics as to become a teacher of that branch of science in the english metropolis under the patronage of sir isaac newton and rose to such reputation by his writings that he attracted the notice and esteem of the powerful and the learned and was admitted to the intimacy of the earls of hardwicke and macclesfield lord parker president of the royal society halley mead and samuel johnson by his wife mary the daughter of a cabinetmaker in london he had two sons one of whom died an infant and a daughter in three years after the birth of the remaining son the father himself died and left the two children to the protection of their mother an extraordinary mark of her presence of mind sufficiently indicated how capable this mother was of executing the difficult duty imposed on her by his decease dr mead had pronounced his case which was a polypus on the heart to be a hopeless one and her anxious precautions to hinder the fatal intelligence from reaching him were on the point of being defeated by the arrival of a letter of condolence and consolation from an injudicious but wellmeaning friend when on discovering its purport she had sufficient address to substitute the lively dictates of her own invention for the real contents of the epistle and by this affectionate delusion not merely to satisfy the curiosity but to cheer the spirits of her dying husband  so great was her solicitude for the improvement of her son that she declined the pressing instances of the countess of macclesfield to reside under her roof lest she should be hindered from attending exclusively to that which was now become her main concern to the many inquiries which the early vivacity of the boy prompted him to put to her the invariable answer she returned was read and you will know this assurance added to the other means of instruction from which her fondness or more probably her discernment induced her to exclude every species of severity were so efficacious that in his fourth year he was able to read at sight any book in his own language two accidents occurred to hinder this rapid advancement from proceeding once he narrowly escaped being consumed by flames from having fallen into the fire while endeavouring to scrape down some soot from the chimney of a room in which he had been left alone and was rescued only in consequence of the alarm given to the servants by his shrieks at another time his eye was nearly put out by one of the hooks of his dress as he was struggling under the hands of the domestic who was putting on his clothes from the effects of this injury his sight never completely recovered  in his fifth year he received a strong impression from reading the twentieth chapter of the apocalypse the man must have a cold imagination who would deny that this casual influence might have first disclosed not only the lofty and ardent spirit but even that insatiable love of learning by which he was afterwards distinguished above all his contemporaries amidst the general proscription of reading adapted to excite wonder that germ of knowledge in the minds of our children it is lucky that the bible is still left them  at the end of his seventh year he was placed under the tuition of dr thackeray the master of harrow school but had not been there two years before a fracture of his thigh bone that happened in a scramble among his playfellows occasioned another suspension of his studies during the twelvemonth which he now passed at home with his mother he became so conversant with several writers in his own language especially dryden and pope that he set himself about making imitations of them  on his return to harrow no allowance was made for the inevitable consequences of this interruption he was replaced in the class with those boys whose classical learning had been progressive while his was stationary or rather retrograde and unmerited chastisement was inflicted on him for his inferiority to those with whom he had wanted the means of maintaining an equality impelled either by fear by shame or by emulation he laboured hard in private to repair his losses of his own accord recurred to the rudiments of the grammar and was so diligent that he speedily outstripped all his juvenile competitors  in his twelfth year he entered into a scheme for representing a play in conjunction with his schoolfellows but instead of seeking his dramatis personae among the heroes of homer as pope had done in his boyhood jones by a remarkable effort of memory committed to paper what he retained of shakspeares tempest which he had read at his mothers and himself sustained the part of prospero in that comedy meanwhile his poetical faculty did not lie dormant he turned into english verse all virgils eclogues and several of ovids epistles and wrote a tragedy on the fable of meleager which was acted during the holidays by himself and his comrades and in which he sustained the character of the hero a short specimen of the drama is preserved the language brings to our recollection that of the mock tragedy in hamlet  when the other boys were at their sports jones continued to linger over his book or if he mingled in their diversions his favourite objects were still uppermost in his thoughts he directed his playmates to divide the fields into compartments to which he gave the names of the several grecian republics allotted to each their political station and wielding at will the fierce democracies arranged the complicated concerns of peace and war attack and defence councils harangues and negociations dr thackeray was compelled to own that if his pupil were left naked and friendless on salisbury plain he would yet find his way to fame and riches  on the resignation of that master the management of the school devolved on dr sumner by whom jones then in his fifteenth year was particularly distinguished such was his zeal that he devoted whole nights to study and not contented with applying himself at school to the classical languages and during the vacations to the italian and french he attained hebrew enough to enable him to read the psalms in the original and made himself acquainted with the arabic character strangers who visited harrow frequently inquired for him by the appellation of the great scholar  some of his compositions from this time to his twentieth year which he collected and entitled limon1 in imitation of the ancients are printed among his works a young scholar who should now glance his eye over the first chapter containing speeches from shakspeare and addisons cato translated into greek iambics on the model of the three tragedians would put aside the remainder with a smile of complacency at the improvement which has since been made in this species of task under the auspices of porson  his mother was urged by several of the legal profession who interested themselves in his welfare to place him in the office of a special pleader but considerations of prudence which represented to her that the course of education necessary to qualify him for the practice of the law was exceedingly expensive and the advantages remote hindered her from acquiescing in their recommendation at the same time that his own inclination and the earnest wishes of his master concurred in favour of prosecuting his studies at college which of the two universities should have the credit of perfecting instruction thus auspiciously commenced was the next subject of debate but the advice of dr glasse then a private tutor at harrow prevailing over that of the head master who by a natural partiality for the place of his own education would have given the preference to cambridge he was in 1764 admitted of university college in oxford whither his mother determined to remove her residence either for the purpose of superintending his health and morals or of enjoying the society of so excellent a son  before quitting school he presented to his friend parnell nephew of the poet and afterwards chancellor of the exchequer in ireland a manuscript volume of english verses consisting among other pieces of that essay which some years after he moulded into his arcadia and of translations from sophocles theocritus and horace if the encouragement of dr sumner had not been overruled by the dissuasion of his more cautious friends he would have committed to the press his greek and latin compositions among which was a comedy in imitation of the style of aristophanes entitled mormo like many other lads whose talents have unfolded in all their luxuriance under the kindness of an indulgent master he experienced a sudden chill at his first transplantation into academic soil his reason was perplexed amid the intricacies of the school logic and his taste revolted by the barbarous language that enveloped it  on the 31st of october he was unanimously elected to one of the four scholarships founded by sir simon bennet but as he had three seniors his prospect of a fellowship was distant and he was anxious to free his mother from the inconvenience of contributing to his support his disgust for the university however was fortunately not of long continuance the college tutors relieved him from an useless and irksome attendance on their lectures and judiciously left the employment of his time at his own disposal he turned it to a good account in perusing the principal greek historians and poets together with the whole of lucian and of plato writing notes and exercising himself in imitations of his favourite authors as he went on in order to facilitate his acquisition of the arabic tongue more particularly with regard to its pronunciation he engaged a native of aleppo named mirza whom he met with in london to accompany him to oxford and employed him in retranslating the arabian nights entertainments into their original language whilst he wrote out the version himself as the other dictated and corrected the inaccuracies by the help of a grammar and lexicon the affinity which he discovered between this language and the modern persian induced him to extend his researches to the latter dialect and he thus laid the foundation of his extraordinary knowledge in oriental literature  during the vacations he usually resorted to london where he was assiduous in his attendance on the schools of angelo for the sake of accomplishing himself in the manly exercises of fencing and riding and at home directed his attention to modern languages and familiarised himself with the best writers in italian spanish and portuguese thus he observed with the fortune of a peasant he gave himself the education of a prince  the year after his entrance at college he accepted a proposal that was made him to undertake the education of lord althorpe then a child about seven years old and for that purpose spent much of his time at wimbledon where he composed many of his english poems and studied attentively the hebrew bible particularly the prophetical writings and the book of job  in the summer of 1766 a fellowship of university college unexpectedly became vacant and being conferred on jones secured him the enjoyment of that independence which he had so much desired with independence he seems to have been satisfied for on his return to wimbledon he declined an offer made him by the duke of grafton then first lord of the treasury of the place of interpreter for eastern languages the same answer which conveyed his refusal recommended in earnest terms his friend mirza as one fitted to perform the duties of the office but the application remained unnoticed and he regretted that his inexperience in such matters had prevented him from adopting the expedient of nominally accepting the employment for himself and consigning the profits of it to the syrian  in 1767 he began his treatise de poesi asiatica on the plan of lowths praelectiones and composed a persian grammar for the use of a schoolfellow who was about to go to india his usual course of study was for a short time interrupted by an attendance on earl spencer the father of his pupil to spa the ardour of his curiosity as a linguist made him gladly seize the opportunity afforded him by this expedition of obtaining some knowledge of german nor was he so indifferent to slighter accomplishments as not to avail himself of the instructions of a celebrated dancing master at aixlachapelle he had before taken lessons from gallini in that trifling art from a pensioner at chelsea he had learnt the use of the broadsword he afterwards made an attempt in which however he does not seem to have persevered to become a performer on the national instrument of his forefathers the harp ambition of such various attainments reminds us of what is related concerning the admirable crichton and pico of mirandola  christian the seventh king of denmark who in 1768 was on a visit to this country had brought with him a persian history of nadir shah in manuscript which he was desirous to have translated from that language into the french on this occasion jones was applied to by one of the under secretaries to the duke of grafton to gratify the wishes of the danish monarch the task was so little to his mind that he would have excused himself from engaging in it and he accordingly suggested major dow a gentleman already distinguished by his translations from the persic as one fit to be employed but he likewise pleading his other numerous occupations as a reason for not undertaking this and the application to jones being renewed with an intimation that it would be disgraceful to the country if the king should be compelled to take the manuscript into france he was at length stimulated to a compliance at the expiration of a twelvemonth during which interval it had been more than once eagerly demanded the work was accomplished the publication of it was completed in 1770 and forty copies were transmitted to the court of denmark to the history was appended a treatise on oriental poetry written also in french one of the chief difficulties imposed on the translator had been the necessity of using that language in the version of which it could not be expected that he should possess an entire command but to obviate this inconvenience he called in the aid of a frenchman who corrected the inaccuracies in the diction christian expressed himself well satisfied with the manner in which his intentions had been fulfilled but a diploma constituting the translator a member of the royal society at copenhagen together with an earnest recommendation of him to the regard of his own sovereign were the sole rewards of his labour of the history he afterwards published an abridgment in english  the predilection he had conceived for the muses of the east whom with the blind idolatry of a lover he exalted above those of greece and rome was further strengthened by his intercourse with an illustrious foreigner whom they had almost as much captivated the person with whom this similarity of taste connected him was charles reviczki afterwards imperial minister at warsaw and ambassador at the english court with the title of count their correspondence which turns principally on the object of their common pursuits and is written in the french and latin languages commenced in 1768 at this time he took his degree of bachelor of arts  in the summer of the ensuing year jones accompanied his pupil to the school at harrow during his residence there he transcribed his persian grammar he had already begun a dictionary of that language with illustrations of the principal words from celebrated writers a work of vast labour which he resolved not to prosecute without the assurance of an adequate remuneration from the east india company at the entreaty of dr glasse he now dedicated some portion of his time to religious inquiry the result was a conviction of the truth of christianity in his belief of which it is said he had hitherto been unconfirmed in the winter he made a second visit to the continent with the family of his noble patron after a longer stay at paris than was agreeable to him they passed down the rhine to lyons and thence proceeded by marseilles frejus and antibes to nice at the last of these places they resided long enough to allow of his returning to his studies which were divided between the arts of music and painting the mathematics and military tactics a science of which he thought no briton could without disgrace be ignorant he also wrote a treatise on education and begun a tragedy entitled soliman on the murder of the son of that monarch by the treachery of his stepmother of the latter although it appears from one of his letters that he had completed it no traces were found among his papers except a prefatory discourse too unfinished to meet the public eye the subject has been treated by champfort a late french writer and one of the best among racines school in a play called mustapha and zeangir i do not recollect and have not now the means of ascertaining whether that fine drama the solimano of prospero bonarelli is founded on the same tragic incident in the turkish history  an excursion which he had meditated to florence rome and naples he was under the necessity of postponing to a future occasion on his way back he diverged to geneva in hopes of seeing voltaire but was disappointed as the frenchman excused himself on account of age and sickness from conversing with a stranger at paris he succeeded by the help of some previous knowledge of the chinese character and by means of couplets version of the works of confucius in construing a poem by that writer from a selection in the kings library and sent a literal version of it to his friend reviczki from the french capital the party returned through spa to england during their short residence at spa he sketched the plan of an epic poem on the discovery of britain by the prince of tyre the suggestion and advice of his friends who thought that abilities and attainments like his required a more extensive sphere of action than was afforded him by the discharge of his duties as a private tutor strengthened probably by a consciousness of his own power induced him to relinquish that employment and henceforward to apply himself to the study and practice of the law an almost enthusiastic admiration of the legal institutions of his own country a pure and ardent zeal for civil liberty and an eminent independence and uprightness of mind were qualifications that rendered this destination of his talents not less desirable in a public view than it was with reference to his individual interests he accordingly entered himself a member of the temple on the 19th of september 1770 to faculties of so comprehensive a grasp the abandonment of his philological researches was not indispensable for the successful prosecution of his new pursuit variety was perhaps even a necessary aliment of his active mind which without it might have drooped and languished indeed the cultivation of eastern learning eventually proved of singular service to him in his juridical capacity  in 1771 he published in french a pamphlet in answer to anquetil du perrons attack on the university of oxford in the discourse prefixed to his zindavesta and entered on a history of the turks the introduction to which was printed but not made public till after his death he had a design to apply for the office of minister at constantinople in the event of a termination of the war with russia and looked forward with eagerness to an opportunity of contemplating the turkish manners at their source a small volume of his poems consisting chiefly of translations from the eastern languages with two prose dissertations annexed made their appearance in the following year when he was elected a fellow of the royal society from the preface to the poems it appears that his relish for the greek and roman writers had now returned and that he justly regarded them as the standard of true taste his terms not having been regularly kept in the university where his mother and sister had still continued to reside he did not take his degree of master of arts till the easter of 1773 in the january following he was called to the bar at the conclusion of the preface to his commentaries de poesi asiatica published at this period he announces his determination to quit the service of the muses and apply himself entirely to his professional studies in a letter to reviczki of february 1775 we find him declaring that he no longer intended to solicit the embassy to constantinople this year he attended the spring circuit and sessions at oxford and the next was appointed one of the commissioners of bankrupts and was to be found regularly as a legal practitioner in westminster hall at the same time that he might not lose sight of classical literature he was assiduous in his perusal of the grecian orators and employed himself in a version of the orations of isaeus nor does he appear to have broken off his correspondence with learned foreigners among whom were the youngest schultens and gs michaelis the translation of isaeus which appears to be executed with fidelity was published in 1778 with a dedication to lord bathurst in which he declares his lordship to have been his greatest his only benefactor his late appointment is the obligation to which he refers  a vacancy had now occurred on the bench at fort william in bengal and jones was regarded by his brethren at the bar as the fittest person to occupy that station the patronage of the minister however was requisite to this office and the violent measures which government had lately adopted with respect to the american colonies were far from being such as accorded with his notions of freedom and justice he was resolved that no consideration should induce him to surrender the independence of his judgment on this or any other national topic if the minister says he in one of his letters to his pupil lord althorpe be offended at the style in which i have spoken do speak and will speak of public affairs and on that account shall refuse to give me the judgeship i shall not be at all mortified having already a very decent competence without a debt or a care of any kind his patriotic feelings displayed themselves in a latin ode to liberty published in march 1780 under the title of julii melesigoni ad libertatem an assumed name formed by an anagram of his own in latin  the resignation of sir robert newdigate one of the members returned to parliament for the university of oxford in the meantime induced several members of that learned body who were friendly to jones to turn their eyes towards him as their future representative the choice of a candidate undistinguished by birth or riches and recommended solely by his integrity talents and learning would have reflected the highest honour on his constituents but many being found to be disinclined to his interest it was thought more prudent to relinquish the canvass he published in july a small pamphlet entitled an inquiry into the legal mode of suppressing riots with a constitutional plan of future defence the insurrection which had for some days disgraced the british metropolis at the beginning of june suggested the publication of this tract in the autumn of this year he made a journey to paris as he had done the preceding summer during a fortnights residence in that capital he attended some causes at the palais obtained access to a fine manuscript in the royal library which opened to him a nearer insight into the manners of the ancient arabians and mingled in the society of as many of the american leaders as he could fall in with purposing to collect materials for a future history of their unhappy contest with the mother country in the midst of this keen pursuit of professional and literary eminence he had the misfortune to lose his mother who had lived long enough to see her tenderness and assiduity in the conduct of his education amply rewarded  an essay on the law of bailments and the translation of an arabian poem on the mohammedan law of succession to the property of intestates to the latter of which undertakings he was incited by his views of preferment in the east testified his industry in the pursuit of his legal studies while on the other hand several short poems evinced from time to time his intended relinquishment of the tuneful art to be either impracticable or unnecessary  in the summer of 1782 the interests of one of his clients led him again to paris from whence he returned by the circuitous route of normandy and the united provinces in the spring of this year he had become a member of the society for constitutional information a more equal representation of the people in parliament was at this time the subject of general discussion and he did not fail to stand forward as the strenuous champion of a measure which seemed likely to infuse new spirit and vigour into our constitutional liberties his sentiments were publicly professed in a speech before the meeting assembled at the london tavern on the 28th of may and he afterwards gave a wider currency to them from the press he maintained that the representation ought to be nearly equal and universal an opinion in which few would now be found to coincide and which if he had lived a little longer he would probably himself have acknowledged to be erroneous at paris he had written a dialogue between a farmer and a country gentleman on the principles of government and it was published by the society a bill of indictment was found against the dean of st asaph whose sister he afterwards married for an edition printed in wales and jones avowed himself the author  in the beginning of 1783 appeared his translation of the seven arabian poems suspended in the temple at mecca about the commencement of the sixth century  in the march of this year he was gratified by the long desired appointment to the office of judge in the supreme court of judicature at fort william in bengal which was obtained for him through the interest of lord ashburton and he received the honour of knighthood usually conferred on that occasion the divisions among his political friends after the decease of that excellent nobleman the marquis of buckingham afforded him an additional motive for wishing to be employed at a distance from his country which he no longer hoped to see benefited by their exertions he was immediately afterwards united to anna maria shipley the daughter of the bishop of st asaph a learned and liberal prelate his attachment to this lady had been of long continuance and he had been waiting only for an honourable independence before he could resolve to join the fortunes of one so tenderly beloved to his own  sir william jones embarked for the east in april 1783 it is impossible not to sympathise with the feelings of a scholar about to visit places over which his studies had thrown the charm of a mysterious interest to explore treasures that had rested as yet in darkness to european eyes and to approach the imagined cradle of human science and art during his voyage he made the following memoranda of objects for his inquiry and of works to be begun or executed during his residence in asia  1 the laws of the hindus and mahommedans  2 the history of the ancient world  3 proofs and illustrations of scripture  4 traditions concerning the deluge c  5 modern politics and geography of hindustan  6 best mode of governing bengal  7 arithmetic and geometry and mixed sciences of the

letters  modeldemosthenes and plato  in the course of the voyage the vessel touched at madeira and in ten weeks after quitting cape verd islands arrived at that of hinzuan or joanna of which he has left a very lively and pleasing description  in september he landed at calcutta and before the conclusion of the year entered on the performance of his judicial function and delivered his first charge to the grand jury on the opening of the sessions this address was such as not to disappoint the high expectations that had been formed of him before his arrival  it was evident that the leisure or perhaps even the undivided attention and labour of no one man could have sufficed for prosecuting researches so extensive and arduous as those he had marked out for himself the association of others in this design was the obvious method of remedying the difficulty at his suggestion accordingly an institution was in january 1784 framed as closely as possible on the model of the royal society in london and the presidency was offered to mr hastings then governorgeneral in india who not only was a liberal encourager of persian and sanscrit literature but had made himself a proficient in the former of these languages at a time when its importance had not been duly appreciated and was familiarly versed in the common dialects of bengal that gentleman however declining the honour and recommending that it should be conferred on the proposer of the scheme he was consequently elected president the names of chambers gladwyn hamilton and wilkins among others evince that it was not difficult for him to find coadjutors how well the institution has answered the ends for which it was formed the public has seen in the asiatic researches  a thorough acquaintance with the religion and literature of india appeared to be attainable through no other medium than a knowledge of the sanscrit and he therefore applied himself without delay to the acquisition of that language it was not long before he found that his health would oblige him to some restriction in the intended prosecution of his studies in a letter written a few days after his arrival in india he informs one of his friends that as long as he stays in india he does not expect to be free from a bad digestion the morbus literatorum for which there is hardly any remedy but abstinence from too much food literary and culinary i rise he adds before the sun and bathe after a gentle ride my diet is light and sparing and i go early to rest yet the activity of my mind is too strong for my constitution though naturally not infirm and i must be satisfied with a valetudinarian state of health all these precautions however did not avail to secure him from violent and reiterated attacks in 1784 he travelled to the city of benares by the route of guyah celebrated as the birthplace of the philosopher boudh and the resort of hindu pilgrims from all parts of the east and returned by gour formerly the residence of the sovereigns of bengal during this journey he laboured for some time under a fit of illness that had nearly terminated his life yet no sooner did he become a convalescent than he applied himself to the study of botany and composed a metrical tale entitled the enchanted fruit or hindu wife and a treatise on the gods of greece italy and india the latter of which he communicated to the society he had not been many months settled after his return to calcutta when he found the demand made on him for his company by the neighbourhood of that place so frequent as to produce a troublesome interruption to the course of his literary engagements he therefore looked out for a situation more secluded to which he might betake himself during the temporary cessations of his official duties and made choice of chrishnanagur at the distance of about fifty miles which besides a dry soil and pure air possessed an additional recommendation in its vicinity to a hindu college indeed he omitted no means that could tend to facilitate his acquaintance with the learning and manners of the natives a considerable portion of his income was set aside for the purpose of supporting their scholars whom he engaged for his instruction  the administration of justice was frequently interrupted by the want of integrity in the pundits or expounders of the statutes to prevent the possibility of such deception this upright magistrate undertook to compile and translate a body of hindu and mohammedan laws and to form a digest of them in imitation of that of the roman law framed by the order of the emperor justinian the mind can scarcely contemplate a plan of utility more vast or splendid than one which aimed at preserving the fountain of right uncontaminated for twenty millions of people during the period of sessions and term when his attendance was required at calcutta he usually resided on the banks of the ganges five miles from the court  in 1785 a periodical work called the asiatic miscellany which has been erroneously attributed to the asiatic society was undertaken at calcutta and to the first two volumes which appeared in that and the following year he contributed six hymns addressed to hindu deities a literal version of twenty tales and fables of nizami expressly designed for the help of students in the persian language and several smaller pieces  a resolution which had passed the board of the executive government of bengal for altering the mode of paying the salaries of the judges produced from him a very spirited remonstrance the affair however seems to have been misconceived by himself and his brethren on the bench and on its being explained the usual harmony was restored at the commencement of 1786 while this matter was pending he made a voyage to chatigan the boundary of the british dominions in bengal towards the east in this indian montpelier where he describes the hillocks covered with pepper vines and sparkling with blossoms of the coffee tree in addition to his other literary researches he twice perused the poem of ferdausi consisting of above sixty thousand couplets this he considered to be an epic poem as majestic and entire as the iliad and thought the outline of it related to a single hero khosrau the cyrus of herodotus and xenophon whom as he says the asiaticks conversing with the father of european history described according to their popular traditions by his true name which the greek alphabet could not express a nearer acquaintance with the great epic bard of persia had now taught him therefore to retract the assertion he had made in his commentary on asiatic poetry that the hero as it is called of the poem was that well known hercules of the persians named rustem although there are several other heroes or warriors to each of whom their own particular glory is assigned at the time of writing this he had an intention if leisure should be allowed him of translating the whole work a version of ferdausi either in verse unfettered by rhyme or in such numerous prose as the prophetical parts of the bible are translated into would i think be the most valuable transfer that our language is now capable of receiving from foreign tongues  in 1787 he flattered himself that his constitution had overcome the climate but his apprehensions were awakened for the health of lady jones to which it had been yet more unfavourable and he resolved if some amendment did not appear likely to urge her return to her native country preferring he said the pang of separation for five or six years to the anguish which he should hardly survive of losing her  at the beginning of 1789 appeared the first volume of the societys researches selected by the president two other volumes followed during his lifetime and a fourth was ready for the press at the time of his decease  in the same year he published his version of an indian drama of calidas entitled sancontala or the fatal ring a wild and beautiful composition which makes us desire to see more by the same writer who has been termed the shakspeare of india and who lived in the last century before the christian era the doubts suggested by the critics in england concerning the authenticity of this work he considered as scarcely deserving of a serious reply  in his discourses delivered before the society he discusses the origin of the several nations which inhabit the great continent of asia together with its borderers mountaineers and islanders points out the advantages to be derived from the concurrent researches of the members of the society amongst which the confirmation of the mosaic account of the primitive world is justly insisted on as the most important and enlarges on the philosophy of the asiatics besides several other essays particular dissertations are allotted to the subjects of the indian chronology the antiquity of their zodiac which he maintains not to have been formed from the greek or arabs the literature of the hindus and the musical modes used by that people  in the course of the last two years he edited the persian poem by hatefi of laile and majnoon the petrarch and laura of the orientals the book was published at his own cost and the profits of the sale appropriated to the relief of insolvent debtors in the gaol at calcutta  in 1793 lady jones to whose constitution naturally a weak one the climate continued still unpropitious embarked for england the physicians had long recommended a return to europe as necessary for the restoration of her health or rather as the only means of preserving her life but her unwillingness to quit her husband had hitherto retained her in india his eagerness to accomplish his great object of preparing the code of laws for the natives would not suffer him to accompany her he hoped however that by the ensuing year he should have executed his design and giving up the intention he had had of making a circuit through persia and china on his return he determined to follow her then without any deviation from his course in the beginning of 1794 he published a translation of the ordinances of menu on which he had been long employed and which may be regarded as initiatory to his more copious pandect  the last twenty years of his life he proposed passing in a studious retreat after his return to england and had even commissioned one of his friends to look out for a pleasant countryhouse in middlesex with a garden and ground to pasture his cattle  but this prospect of future ease and enjoyment was not to be realized the event which put an unexpected end both to that and to his important scheme for the public advantage cannot be so well related as in the words of lord teignmouth on the 20th of april or nearly about that date after prolonging his walk to a late hour during which he had imprudently remained in conversation in an unwholesome situation he called upon the writer of these sheets and complained of agueish symptoms mentioning his intention of taking some medicine and repeating jocularly an old proverb that an ague in the spring is medicine for a king he had no suspicion at the time of the real nature of his indisposition which proved in fact to be a complaint common in bengal an inflammation in the liver the disorder was however soon discovered by the penetration of the physician who after two or three days was called in to his assistance but it had then advanced too far to yield to the efficacy of the medicines usually prescribed and they were administered in vain the progress of the complaint was uncommonly rapid and terminated fatally on the 27th of april 1794  on the morning of that day his attendants alarmed at the evident symptoms of approaching dissolution came precipitately to call the friend who has now the melancholy task of recording the mournful event not a moment was lost in repairing to his house he was lying on a bed in a posture of meditation and the only symptom of remaining life was a small degree of motion in the heart which after a few seconds ceased and he expired without a pang or groan his bodily suffering from the complacency of his features and the ease of his attitude could not have been severe and his mind must have derived consolation from those sources where he had been in the habit of seeking it and where alone in our last moments it can be found the funeral ceremony adds his noble biographer was performed on the following day with the honours due to his public station and the numerous attendance of the most respectable british inhabitants of calcutta evinced their sorrow for his loss and their respect for his memory the pundits who were in the habit of attending him when i saw them at a public durbar a few days after that melancholy event could neither restrain their tears for his loss nor find terms to express their admiration at the wonderful progress which he had made in the sciences which they professed  a domestic affliction of the severest kind was spared him by his removal from life eight years after that event his sister who was married to an opulent merchant retired from business perished miserably in consequence of her clothes having taken fire  his large collection of sanscrit arabic and other eastern manuscripts was presented by his widow to the royal society a catalogue of them compiled by mr wilkins is inserted in his works  the following list of desiderata was found among his papers after his decease  india  the ancient geography of india c from the puranas  a botanical description of indian plants from the cochas

purpose of being placed there in a proper situation  a monument has also been erected to his memory in the antichapel of university college oxford by lady jones with the following inscription  m s

which the abbe de lille has introduced into his lhomme des champs on this subject vidas poem is a surprising instance of difficulty overcome in the manner with which he has moulded the phraseology of the classics to a purpose apparently alien from it and he has made his mythology agreeable trivial as it is by the skill with which it is managed but i find that both the caissa and the arcadia which is taken from a paper in the guardian were done as the author says at the age of 16 or 17 years and were saved from the fire in preference to a great many others because they seemed more correctly versified than the rest it is therefore hardly fair to judge them very strictly  his latin commentary on asiatic poetry is more valuable for the extracts from the persian and arabic poets which he has brought together in it than to be commended for anything else that it contains or for the style in which it is written certain marks of hurry in the composition which his old schoolfellow doctor parr had intimated to him with the ingenuousness of a friend and a scholar are still apparent he takes up implicitly with that incomplete and partial though very ingenious system which burke had lately put forth in his essay on the sublime and beautiful he has supported that writers definition of beauty by a quotation from hermogenes a better confirmation of his theory might have been adduced from the philebus of plato in which socrates makes the same distinction as our eloquent countryman has taken so much pains to establish between that sensation which accompanies the removal of pain or danger and which he calls delightand positive pleasure2 as the work however of a young man the commentary was such as justly to raise high expectations of the writer  his style in english prose where he had most improved it that is in his discourses delivered in india on asiatic history and literature is opulent without being superfluous dignified yet not pompous or inflated he appears intent only on conveying to others the result of his own inquiries and reflections on the most important topics in as perspicuous a manner as possible and the embellishments of diction come to him unbidden and unsought his prolixity does not weary nor his learning embarrass the reader if he had been more elaborate he might have induced a suspicion of artifice if he had been less so the weightiness of his matter would seem to have been scarcely enough considered but he has higher claims to the gratitude of his country and of mankind than either prose or poetry can give his steady zeal in the cause of liberty and justice and truth is above all praise and will leave his name among the few    quos aequus amavit   jupiter aut ardens evexit ad aethera virtus   dis geniti  footnotes 1 greek leimhon a

                                 thomas chatterton  if it were allowable for one who professes to write the lives of english poets to pass the name of chatterton in silence i should think the literature of our country more honoured by the concealment of his fate than by the record of his genius yet from his brief story the young will learn that genius is likely to lead them into misery if it be not accompanied by something that is better than genius and men whom birth and station have rendered eminent may discover that they owe some duty to those whom nature has made more than their equals and who     beneath the good tho farare far above the great  thomas chatterton was born in the parish of st mary redcliffe at bristol on the twentieth of november 1752 his father who was of the same name and who died about three months before the birth of his son had been writingmaster to a classical school singingman in bristol cathedral and master of the freeschool in pylestreet in that city and is related to have been inclined to a belief in magic and deeply versed in cornelius agrippa his forefathers had borne the humble office of sexton to st mary redcliffe church for a century and a half till the death of john chatterton great uncle of the poet  from what is recorded of the infancy of chatterton parents may be satisfied that an inaptness to learn in childhood is far from being a prognostic of future dullness at the age of five years he was sent to the school of which his father had been master and was found so incorrigibly stupid that he was rejected by the teacher whose name was love as incapable of profiting by his instruction his mother as most mothers would have done in the like case bitterly lamented her sons untowardness when an old musical manuscript in french coming in his way he fell in love as she expressed it with the illuminated capitals of this fancy she eagerly availed herself to lead him on to an acquaintance with the alphabet and from hence proceeded to teach him to read in an old testament or bible in the black letter doctor gregory one of his biographers justly observes that it is not unreasonable to suppose his peculiar fondness for antiquities to have originated in this incident  it is related on the testimony of his sister as a mark of his early thirst for distinction that being offered a present of chinaware by a potter and asked what device he would have painted on it he replied paint me an angel with wings and a trumpet to trumpet my name about the world it is so usual with those who are fondly attached to a child to deceive themselves into a belief that what it has said on the suggestion of others has proceeded from its own mind that much credit is seldom due to such marvels  a little before he had attained his eighth year he was admitted into colstons charity school in bristol an institution in some respects similar to that excellent one of christs hospital in london the boys being boarded and clothed as well as instructed in the house in two years his dislike to reading was so thoroughly overcome that he spent the pocketmoney allowed him by his mother in hiring books from a circulating library he became reserved thoughtful and at times melancholy mixed little in childish sports and between his eleventh and twelfth years had made a catalogue of the books he had read to the number of seventy it is to be regretted that with a disposition thus studious he was not instructed in any language but his own the example of one of the assistants in the school named thomas phillips spread a poetical emulation among the elder boys of whom thistlethwaite cary and fowler figured in the periodical publications of the day chatterton did not escape the contagion and a pocketbook presented to him by his sister as a newyears gift was returned at the end of the year filled with his writing chiefly in verse phillips is probably the person whose skill in poetry is extolled by chatterton in an elegy on the death of his acquaintance of that name which has some stanzas of remarkable beauty  soon after his confirmation by the bishop at twelve years of age he was prompted by the serious reflections which the performance of that ceremony had awakened in him to compose some lines on the last day and a paraphrase of the ninth chapter of job and of some chapters in isaiah had his life been protracted there is every reason to believe from the process which usually takes place in minds constituted like his that after an interval of scepticism these feelings of piety would have returned in their full force at the same time he indulged himself in satirical effusions on his master and such of his schoolfellows as had provoked either his resentment or his ridicule  on the first of july 1767 he was taken from school and apprenticed for seven years to mr john lambert attorney of bristol to be instructed in the art of a scrivener the apprentice fee was only ten pounds he slept in the room with the footboy and was confined to the office from eight oclock in the morning with the usual interval for dinner till the same hour at night his conduct was such as left his master no room for blame he never exceeded the hours limited for his absence except on one occasion when he had been to spend an evening in the company of his mother and some friends once only he incurred correction his old schoolmaster had received an abusive anonymous letter and lambert having discovered from the handwriting which was ill disguised and by the paper which was the same as that used in his office that chatterton was the writer thought it necessary to check so mischievous a propensity by inflicting on him one or two blows though he was compelled to pass so large a portion of time in confinement he had much leisure left him as his masters business frequently did not occupy more than two hours in the day his chief employment was the copying of precedents with which he filled a folio book of 344 pages closely written  at the beginning of october 1768 the new bridge at bristol was completed and about the same time there appeared in the bristol journal a paper purporting to be a description of the fryars first passing over the old bridge taken from an ancient manuscript and signed dunhelmus bristoliensis by this the public curiosity was excited and the printer not being able to satisfy the inquiries that were made concerning the quarter from whence he had received the communication it was with some difficulty traced to chatterton to the menaces of those who first roughly demanded from him an account of the means by which the paper had come into his hands he refused to give any reply but on being more mildly questioned after some prevaricating said that he had got it together with several other manuscripts that had been in the possession of his father by whom they were found in a large box in an upper room over the chapel on the north side of redcliffe church that some old parchments had been seen by him in his mothers house is nearly certain nor is it at all improbable that they might have been discovered in a neglected coffer in the church according to the account he gave of them but that either the description of the fryars passage over the bridge or the most considerable of the poems attributed to rowley were among them can scarcely be credited the delusion supposed to have been practised on the public by macpherson and that acknowledged to have been so by walpole in passing off the castle of otranto for a translation from the italian were then recent and these examples might have easily engaged chatterton to attempt a fraud which did not seem likely to be more injurious in its consequences than either of them  about the same time he became known to a mr catrott and to a mr barrett a chirurgeon at bristol who intended to publish a history of that city and was then collecting materials for the purpose to the former he showed the bristowe tragedy the epitaph on robert canynge and some other short pieces to the latter several fragments some of considerable length affirming them to be portions of the original manuscripts which had fallen into his hands from both he received at different times some pecuniary reward for these communications and was favoured by the loan of some books among those which he borrowed of mr barrett there were several on medical subjects and from him he obtained also some instructions in chirurgery he is represented by one of his companions to have extended his curiosity at this time to many other objects of inquiry and to have employed himself not only in the lighter studies of heraldry and english antiquities but in the theory of music mathematics metaphysics and astronomy  he now became a contributor of prose and verse to the magazines among the acknowledgments to correspondents in the town and country magazine for november 1768 one of his letters appears to be noticed but nothing of his writing in that miscellany the first with which he is known to have corresponded has been discovered before the february of the following year  the attention he had drawn to himself in his native city soon induced him to aspire after higher notice in march he addressed the following letter to the honourable horace walpole    sirbeing versed a little in antiquities i have met with several   curious manuscripts among which the following may be of service to   you in any future edition of your truly entertaining anecdotes of   painting   in correcting the mistakes if any in the notes you will greatly   oblige    your most humble servant    thomas chatterton    bristol march 25th corn street  this was accompanied by a manuscript entitled the ryse of peyneteyne in englande wroten by t rowleie 1469 for mastre canynge to which chatterton had annexed his own remarks walpole returned a polite answer and asked for further communications on the receipt of a second letter from chatterton walpole repeated his wish to know more concerning rowley and his poems in reply to which chatterton took occasion to represent his own situation that he was the son of an indigent widow and clerk to an attorney but that his inclinations led him to more elegant pursuits and he intimated a hope that walpole would assist in placing him where he might be able to gratify such propensities his letter was accompanied by more of the rowleian poems and contained an assurance that the person who had lent them to him to transcribe possessed other valuable relics of ancient poetry some inquiries which walpole made confirmed the account given by chatterton of himself but in answer to his solicitation for patronage walpole declared that he had not the means of exerting it and recommended a sedulous attention to business as the most certain way of recompensing his mother for her care and of securing his own independence he mentioned that more competent judges than he pretended to be were not satisfied of the manuscripts being genuine and at the same time stated their reasons for concluding them to be of another age than that to which they were assigned shortly after chatterton wrote to him two letters which though querulous are not disrespectful in the first while he thanks his correspondent for the advice he had given him he professes his resolution to go a little beyond it by destroying all his useless lumber of literature and never using his pen again but in the law and in the other declaring his settled conviction that the papers of rowley were genuine he asks him to return the copy which had been sent him owing to the absence of walpole who was then in paris some time elapsed without any notice being taken of this request and on his return walpole found the following letter which he terms singularly impertinent  siri cannot reconcile your behaviour to me with the notions i once entertained of you i think myself injured sir and did you not know my circumstances you would not dare to treat me thus i have sent for a copy of the ms no answer from you an explanation or excuse for your silence would oblige  thomas chatterton  july 24th  the manuscripts and letters were all returned in a blank cover on the fourth of august and here the intercourse was at an end gray and mason were the friends whom walpole had consulted about the manuscripts and they had no hesitation in pronouncing them to be forgeries it may seem strange that with such men the uncommon beauty of the poetry they contained did not create some interest for the author but gray was now in a state of health that perhaps left him little power of being interested in anything or the wonder may resolve itself into that blindness which poets no less than patrons too frequently discover for the excellence of their contemporaries chatterton himself spoke with contempt of the productions of collins as to walpole he had no doubt more pleasure in petting the lapdog that was left to his care by the old blind lady at paris than he could ever have felt in nursing the wayward genius of chatterton  during his residence in lamberts house his constitutional reserve had assumed an air of gloomy sullenness he had repeatedly betrayed to the servants an intention of committing suicide and at length a paper entitled the last will and testament of thomas chatterton which was found lying on his desk manifested a design of perpetrating this act on the ensuing day easter sunday april 15th 1770 on so unequivocal a proof as this appeared to be of his desperate resolution his master no longer thought it safe to retain him  a few months before he had written letters to several booksellers and printers in london and from them received assurances of protection and employment if he should remove to the capital this decided him as to his future course when he was questioned by thistlethwaite as to the plan of life he intended to pursue if the prospect which was thus held out should fail him he answered the promises i have had are sufficient to dispel doubt but should i be deceived i will turn methodist preacher credulity is as potent a deity as ever and a new sect may easily be devised but if that too should fail me my last and final resource is a pistol it is almost unnecessary to observe that when he thus speculated on his future proceedings his mind had been strongly tainted with infidelitytowards the conclusion of april he set forth on his illomened journey he had never yet gone farther than a sundays walk from his native city and at the age of seventeen equally inexperienced and confident without a friend or a guide and with principles shaken and perverted he was about to enter on a new and perilous theatre nor could it have been difficult to divine what the event must soon be on the 26th of april 1770 immediately after his arrival in london he writes to his mother and speaks in high spirits of the encouragement he has met with from the booksellers to whom he has applied who says he all approve of my design on the sixth of the next month he informs her that he gets four guineas a month by one magazine and that he shall engage to write a history of england and other pieces which will more than double that sum mr wilkes had known him by his writings since he first corresponded with the booksellers he is to visit him the following week and by his interest would ensure mrs ballance the trinity house in short he is in raptures at the change in his condition and views and talks as if his fortune were already made he now inhabited the house of walmsley a plasterer in shoreditch where his kinswoman mrs ballance also lived  the other letters to his mother and sisters betray the same intoxication at the chapter coffeehouse he meets with a gentleman who would have introduced him as a companion to the young duke of northumberland in his intended general tour had he not been unluckily incapacitated for that office by his ignorance of any tongue but his own his present profession obliges him to frequent places of the best resort he employs his money in fitting himself fashionably and getting into good company this last article always brings him in good interest he has engaged to live with a gentleman the brother of a lord a scotch one indeed who is going to advance pretty deeply into the bookselling branches and is to have lodging and boarding genteel and elegant gratis besides no inconsiderable premium he is introduced to beckford the lord mayor to whom he had addressed an essay and who received him with all the politeness a citizen could assume and warmly invited him to come again he might have a recommendation to sir george colebrook an east india director as qualified for an office no ways despicable but he shall not take a step to the sea while he can continue on land if money flowed as fast upon him as honours he would give his sister a portion of £5000 the kindhearted boy did indeed find means out of the little profits arising from his writings to send her his mother and his grandmother several trifling presents in july he removed to lodgings at mrs angels a sackmaker in brook street holborn he assigned no reason for quitting those he had occupied in shoreditch but sir herbert croft supposes not without probability that it was in order to be nearer to the places of public entertainment to which his employment as a writer for ephemeral publications obliged him to resort on the 20th of july he acquaints his sister that he is engaged in writing an oratorio which when finished would purchase her a gown and that she might depend on seeing him before the first of january 1771 almost all the next town and country magazine he tells her is his he boasts that he has an universal acquaintance that his company is courted every where and could he humble himself to go behind a compter he could have had twenty places but that he must be among the great state matters suit him better than commercial besides his communications to the above mentioned miscellany he was a frequent contributor of essays and poems to several of the other literary journals as a political writer he had resolved to employ his pen on both sides essays he tells his sister on the patriotic side fetch no more than what the copy is sold for as the patriots themselves are searching for a place they have no gratuities to spare on the other hand unpopular essays will not be accepted and you must pay to have them printed but then you seldom lose by it courtiers are so sensible of their deficiency in merit that they generally reward all who know how to daub them with an appearance but all his visions of emolument and greatness were now beginning to melt away he was so tired of his literary drudgery or found the returns it made him so inadequate to his support that he condescended to solicit the appointment of a chirurgeons mate to africa and applied to mr barrett for a recommendation which was refused him probably on account of his incapacity it is difficult to trace the particulars of that sudden transition from good to bad fortune which seems to have befallen him that his poverty was extreme cannot be doubted the younger warton was informed by mr cross an apothecary in brook street that while chatterton lived in the neighbourhood he often called at his shop but though pressed by cross to dine or sup with him constantly declined the invitation except one evening when he was prevailed on to partake of a barrel of oysters and ate most voraciously a barbers wife who lived within a few doors of mrs angels gave testimony that after his death mrs angel told her that on the 24th of august as she knew he had not eaten anything for two or three days she begged he would take some dinner with her but he was offended at her expressions which seemed to hint that he was in want and assured her he was not hungry the stripling whose pride would not let him go behind a compter had now drunk the cup of bitterness to the dregs on that day he swallowed arsenic in water and on the following expired his room was broken into and found strewn over with fragments of papers which he had destroyed he was interred in the buryingground of shoe lane workhouse such was the end of one who had given greater proofs of poetical genius than perhaps had ever been shown in one of his years by johnson he was pronounced the most extraordinary young man that had ever encountered his knowledge and warton in the history of english poetry where he discusses the authenticity of the rowleian poems gives it as his opinion that chatterton would have proved the first of english poets if he had reached a maturer age  he was proud says his sister and exceedingly imperious but both she and his schoolfellow thistlethwaite vindicated him from the charge of libertinism which was brought against him by some who thought they could not sufficiently blacken his memory on the contrary his abstemiousness was uncommon he seldom used animal food or strong liquors his usual diet being a piece of bread and a tart and some water he fancied that the full of the moon was the most propitious time for study and would often sit up and write the whole night by moonlight his spirits were extremely uneven and he was subject to long and frequent fits of absence insomuch that he would look stedfastly in a persons face without speaking or seeming to see him for a quarter of an hour or more there is said to have been something peculiarly pleasing in his manner and address his person was marked by an air of manliness and dignity that bespoke the superiority of his mind his eyes one of which was more remarkable than the other were of a grey colour keen and brilliant especially when any thing occurred to animate him  of all the hypotheses concerning those papers which have been the subject of so much controversy none seems more probable than that suggested by warton who in the history of english poetry admits that some of the poems attributed to rowley might have been preserved in canynges chest and in another publication allows that chatterton might have discovered parchments of humble prose containing local memoirs and authentic deeds illustrating the history of bristol and biographical diaries or other notices of the lives of canynge ischam and gorges but that many of the manuscripts were not genuine is proved not only by the dissimilitude of the style to any composition of the age of henry vi and edward iv and by the marked resemblance to several passages in modern poets but by certain circumstances which leave little or no doubt of their having been fabricated by chatterton himself one of his companions at the time that he was an apprentice to lambert affirms that he one day produced a piece of parchment on which he wrote several words if not lines in a character that appeared to his companion totally unlike english that he then held it over a candle to give it the appearance of antiquity which changed the colour of the ink and made the parchment appear black and contracted another person declares that he saw him rub a piece of parchment in several places in streaks with yellow ochre and then rub it on the ground which was dirty and afterwards crumple it in his hand having concluded the operation he said it would do pretty well but he could do it better at home the first part of the battle of hastings he confessed to mr barrett that he had written himself  some anachronisms as to particular allusions have been pointed out the irregular or pindaric measure as it has been called used in the song to aella in the verses on the mynster and in the chorus in goddwyn was not employed till a much later aera there are also in the aella some lines in blank verse not introduced among us till the time of surrey who adopted it from the italian  another criterion of a more general nature which has not yet at least that i am aware been applied to those compositions is i think very strongly against the antiquity of them and that is that the intention and purpose of the writer in the longer pieces is not sufficiently marked and decisive for the remoter ages to which they are ascribed in the early stages of a language before conventional phrases have been formed and a stock of imagery as it were provided for the common use we find that the plan of a work is often rude and simple indeed but that it almost always bears evident signs of having subsisted anteriorly in the mind of the writer as a whole if we try aella the longest of the poems by this test we shall discover strong evidence of its being modern a certain degree of uniformity is the invariable characteristic of the earlier productions of art but here is as much desultoriness and incoherence as can well he possible in a work that makes any pretensions to a plan on this internal proof alone i should not hesitate in assigning it to chatterton rather than to rowley to the one who luxuriated in an abundance of poetic materials poured out before him for his use or his imitation rather than to the other who had comparatively but a few meagre models to work upon  where he is much inspirited by his subject being thrown off his guard he forgets himself and becomes modern as in these lines from which i have removed nothing but the old spelling   first dane   fly fly ye danes magnus the chief is slain   the saxons come with aella at their head   lets strive to get away to yonder green   fly fly this is the kingdom of the dead  second dane    o gods have romans at my anlace bled   and must i now for safety fly away   see far besprenged all our troops are spread   yet i will singly dare the bloody fray   but no ill fly and murder in retreat   death blood and fire shall mark the going of my feet  the following repetitions are if i mistake not quite modern    now aella lookd and looking did exclaim  and    he falls and falling rolleth thousands down  as is also this antithetical comparison of the qualities of a warhorse to the mental affections of the rider    bring me a steed with eaglewings for fight   swift as my wish and as my love is strong  there are sometimes single lines that bear little relation to the place in which they stand and seem to be brought in for no other purpose than their effect on the ear this is the contrivance of a modern and a youthful poet    thy words be high of din but nought beside  is a line that occurs in aella and may sometimes be applied to the author himself  nothing indeed is more wonderful in the rowley poems than the masterly style of versification which they frequently display few more exquisite specimens of this kind can be found in our language than the minstrels song in aella beginning    o sing unto my roundelay  a young poet may be expected to describe warmly and energetically whatever interests his fancy or his heart but a command of numbers would seem to be an art capable of being perfected only by longcontinued and diligent endeavours it must be recollected however that much might be done in the time which was at chattertons disposal when that time was undivided by the study of any other language but his own we see in the instance of miltons juvenile poems in latin not to mention others to what excellence this species of skill may be brought even in boyhood where the organs are finely disposed for the perception of musical delight and if examples of the same early perfection be rarer in our own tongue it may be because so much labour is seldom or ever exacted at that age in the use of it  tyrwhitt whose critical acumen had enabled him to detect a supposititious passage in a tragedy of euripides was at first a dupe to the imposture of chatterton and treated the poems as so decidedly genuine that he cited them for the elucidation of chaucer but seeing good grounds for changing his opinion as mr nichols1 informs us he cancelled several leaves before his volume was published walpole was equally deceived though his vanity afterwards would not suffer him to own that he had been so mr tyson in a letter to dr glynn2 well observed that he could as soon believe that hogarth painted the cartoons as that chatterton wrote rowleys poems yet he adds they are as unlike any thing ancient as sir joshuas flowing contour is unlike the squares and angles of albert durer  the poems that were written after his arrival in london when his mind was agitated by wild speculations and thrown off its balance by noise and bustle were as might be expected very unequal to those which he had produced in the retirement of his native place yet there is much poignancy in the satires the three african eclogues have a tumid grandeur heccar and gaira is the best of them  the following verses are strong and impassioned    the children of the wave whose pallid race   views the faint sun display a languid face   from the red fury of thy justice fled   swifter than torrents from their rocky bed   fear with a sickend silver tinged their hue   the guilty fear where vengeance is their due   many of the pieces confessedly his own furnish descriptions of natural objects equally happy with those so much admired in the rowleian poems    when golden autumn wreathd in ripend corn   from purple clusters pourd the foamy wine   thy genius did his sallow brows adorn   and made the beauties of the season thine   with rustling sound the yellow foliage flies   and wantons with the wind in rapid whirls   the gurgling rivulet to the vallies hies   whilst on its bank the spangled serpent curls                                       pale rugged winter bending oer his tread   his grizzled hair bedropt with icy dew   his eyes a dusky light congeald and dead   his robe a tinge of bright ethereal blue    his train a motleyd sanguine sable cloud   he limps along the russet dreary moor   whilst rising whirlwinds blasting keen and loud   roll the white surges to the sounding shore    the lofty elm the oak of lordly look   the willow shadowing the babbling brook   the hedges blooming with the sweets of may   with double pleasure markd the gladsome way  in resignation from which these lines are taken there is a fine personification of hope though the application of it is designedly ludicrous    see hope arrayd in robes of virgin white   trailing an archd variety of light   comes showering blessings on a ruind realm   and shows the crownd director of the helm  with him poetry looks best when she is    all deftly maskd as hoar antiquity  scarcely any of these later poems are free from grammatical incorrectness or ambiguity of expression some are debased by the more serious fault of ribaldry and profaneness his irreligion however seems to have been rather the fluctuating of a mind that had lost its hold on truth for a time than the scepticism of one confirmed in error he acknowledges his dependence on a creator though he casts off his belief in a redeemer his incredulity does not appear so much the offspring of viciousness refusing the curb of moral restraint as of pride unwilling to be trammelled by the opinions of the multitude we cannot conceive that with a faculty so highly imaginative he could long have continued an unbeliever or perhaps that he could ever have been so in his heart but he is a portentous example of the dangers to which an inexperienced youth highly gifted by nature is exposed when thrown into the midst of greedy speculators intent only on availing themselves of his resources for their own advantage and without any care for his safety or his peace  some years ago the present laureat southey undertook the office of editing his works for the benefit of his sister mrs newton it is to be lamented that a project so deserving of encouragement does not appear to have been successful   footnotes 1 illustrations of literature vol i p 158

his mother mary neville was of a respectable family in staffordshire of the schoolmistress who taught him to read and whose name was garrington he has drawn a pleasing picture in his verses entitled childhood at about six years of age he began to learn writing arithmetic and french from the rev john blanchard and when out of school was employed in carrying about the butchers basket some lines on being confined to school one pleasant summer morning written at the age of thirteen by which time he had been placed under the tuition of a mr shipley are nearly equal to any he afterwards produced next year he was made to work at a stockingloom preparatively to his learning the business of a hosier but his mother seeing the reluctance with which he engaged in an employment so illsuited to his temper and abilities prevailed on his father though not without much difficulty to fix him in the office of messrs coldham and endfield attorneys in nottingham as his parents could not afford to pay a fee he was in 1799 engaged to serve for two years and at the end of that term he was articled most of his time that could be spared from the duties of the office was at the recommendation of his masters spent in learning latin to which of his own accord he added greek italian spanish and portuguese some knowledge of chemistry astronomy electricity and some skill in music and drawing were among his other voluntary acquirements white was one of those who feel an early and importunate craving for distinction he had already been chosen member of a literary society in his native town and soon after his election as mr southey relates he lectured upon genius and spoke extempore for about two hours in such a manner that he received the unanimous thanks of the society and they elected this young roscius of oratory their professor of literature he next became a writer in several of the monthly miscellanies and in 1803 put forth a volume of poems a few words of unfortunate criticism in one of the reviews which in a few years more he would have learned to smile at had nearly crushed his hopes as an author when mr southey into whose hands both the review and the poems themselves chanced to fall generously came to his relief the protection of one so deservedly eminent could not fail of affording him some comfort though he still complained that the review went before him where ever he turned his steps that it haunted him incessantly and that he was persuaded it was an instrument in the hands of satan to drive him to distraction  it is not usual to hear a poet much less a young poet complaining that satan is busied about his concerns but his mind which had before been disposed to scepticism was now determined with such force to an extreme of devotional feeling as scarcely to retain its due balance in what manner the change was effected it is not very material to inquire but the different accounts which mr southey has given of the matter according to the information he received at different times may serve to shew how little dependance is to be placed on relations of this kind at first he tells us that mr pigott the curate of st marys nottingham hearing what was the bent of his religious opinions sent him by a friend scotts force of truth and requested him to peruse it attentively which he promised to do having looked at the book he told the person who brought it to him that he would soon write an answer to it but about a fortnight afterwards when this friend inquired how far he had proceeded in his answer to mr scott henrys reply was in a very different tone and temper he said that to answer that hook was out of his power and out of any mans for it was founded upon eternal truth that it had convinced him of his error and that so thoroughly impressed was he with a sense of the importance of his makers favour that he would willingly give up all acquisitions of knowledge and all hopes of fame and live in a wilderness unknown till death so he could ensure an inheritance in heaven in a subsequent correction of this statement mr southey informs us that scotts force of truth was put into his hands by his friend and fellowpupil mr almond since rector of st peters nottingham with an entreaty that he would peruse it at his leisure that the book produced little effect and was returned with disapprobation but that afterwards in a conversation with mr almond he declared his belief with much vehemence and agitation this was soon after he had reached his eighteenth year maturer judgment convinced him that zeal was to be tempered with discretion that the service of christ was a rational service that a strong assurance was not to be resorted to as the touchstone of our acceptance with god that it was not even the necessary attendant of religious life as more experience of his spiritual associates discovered to him that their professions of zeal were too frequently accompanied by want of charity and that in matters of religion as in every thing else they who feel the most generally talk the least  that even before his conversion as it is rather improperly called he was not without a sense of religious duty may be inferred from his having already chosen the church as a profession in preference to the law to this alteration in his plan of life he might have been directed by a love of study or by the greater opportunities held out to him of gratifying his literary ambition but it is unreasonable to suppose that he would have voluntarily taken such a measure if his own conviction had run counter to it the attorneys to whom he was bound were ready enough to release him since though well satisfied with his conduct and attention to their concerns they perceived him to be troubled with a deafness which would incapacitate him for the practice of the law the means of supporting him at the university were accordingly supplied by the liberality of the friends whom he had gained and after passing a twelvemonth with the rev mr grainger of winteringham in lincolnshire to prepare himself he was in 1805 entered a sizar of st johns cambridge here his application to books was so intense that his health speedily sank under it he was indeed declared to be the first man of his year but the honour was dearly purchased at the expense of dreadful palpitations in the heart nights of sleeplessness and horrors and spirits depressed to the very depths of wretchedness in july 1806 his laundress on coming into his room at college saw him fallen down in a convulsive fit bleeding and insensible his great anxiety was to conceal from his mother the state to which he was reduced at the end of september he went to london in search of relaxation and amusement and in the next month returned to college with a cough and fever which this effort had encreased his brother on being informed of his danger hastened to cambridge and found him delirious he recovered sufficiently to know him for a few moments but the next day sank into a stupor and on the 19th of october expired it was the opinion of his medical attendants that if he had lived his intellect would have failed him  he was buried in allsaints church cambridge where his monument sculptured by chantrey has been placed by mr francis boott a stranger from boston in america  after his death all his papers were consigned to the hands of mr southey their contents were multifarious they comprised observations on law electricity the greek and latin languages from their rudiments to the higher branches of critical study on history chronology and divinity he had begun three tragedies on boadicea ines de castro and a fictitious story several poems in greek and a translation of samson agonistes the selection which mr southey has made consists of copious extracts from his letters poems and essays  mr southey has truly said of him that what he is most remarkable for is his uniform good sense to chatterton with whom this zealous friend and biographer has mentioned him he is not to be compared chatterton has the force of a young poetical titan who threatens to take parnassus by storm white is a boy differing from others more in aptitude to follow than in ability to lead the one is complete in every limb active selfconfident and restless from his own energy the other gentle docile and animated rather than vigorous he began as most youthful writers have begun by copying those whom he saw to be the objects of popular applause in his own day he has little distinct character of his own we may trace him by turns to goldsmith chatterton and coleridge his numbers sometimes offend the ear by unskilful combinations of sound as in these lines    but for the babe she bore beneath her breast  and    while every bleaching breeze that on her blows  and sometimes though more rarely they gratify it by unexpected sweetness he could occasionally look abroad for himself and describe what he saw in his clifton grove there are some little touches of landscapepainting which are as i think unborrowed    what rural objects steal upon the sight                                       the brooklet branching from the silver trent   the whispering birch by every zephyr bent   the woody island and the naked mead   the lowly hut half hid in groves of reed   the rural wicket and the rural stile   and frequent interspersed the woodmans pile  among his poems of later date there is one unfinished fragment in this manner of yet higher beauty    or should the day be overcast   well linger till the showr be past   where the hawthorns branches spread   a fragrant cover oer the head   and list the raindrops beat the leaves   or smoke upon the cottage eaves   or silent dimpling on the stream   convert to lead its silver gleam   the end
