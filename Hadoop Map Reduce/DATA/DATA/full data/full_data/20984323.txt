20984323	the water of life and other sermons by charles kingsley     sermon i  the water of life preached at westminster abbey    revelation xxii 17  and the spirit and the bride say come  and let him that heareth say come  and let him that is athirst come  and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely   this text is its own witness  it needs no man to testify to its origin  its own words show it to be inspired and divine  but not from its mere poetic beauty great as that is  greater than we in this wet and cold climate can see at the first glance  we must go to the far east and the far south to understand the images which were called up in the mind of an old jew at the very name of wells and watersprings and why the scriptures speak of them as special gifts of god lifegiving and divine  we must have seen the treeless waste the blazing sun the sickening glare the choking dust the parched rocks the distant mountains quivering as in the vapour of a furnace we must have felt the lassitude of heat the torment of thirst ere we can welcome as did those old easterns the well dug long ago by pious hands whither the maidens come with their jars at eventide when the stone is rolled away to water the thirsty flocks or the living fountain under the shadow of a great rock in a weary land with its grove of trees where all the birds for many a mile flock in and shake the copses with their song its lawn of green on which the longdazzled eye rests with refreshment and delight its brook wandering awayperhaps to be lost soon in burning sand but giving as far as it flows life a water of life to plant to animal and to man  all these images which we have to call up in our minds one by one presented themselves to the mind of an eastern whether jew or heathen at once as a wellknown and daily scene and made him feel at the very mention of a waterspring that the speaker was telling him of the good and beautiful gift of a beneficent being  and yetso do extremes meetlike thoughts though not like images may be called up in our minds here in the heart of london in murky alleys and foul courts where there is too often as in the poets rotting sea    water water everywhere yet not a drop to drink   and we may bless godas the easterns bless him for the ancestors who digged their wellsfor every pious soul who now erects a drinking fountain for he fulfils the letter as well as the spirit of scripture by offering to the bodies as well as the souls of men the water of life freely  but the text speaks not of earthly water  no doubt the words water of life have a spiritual and mystic meaning  yet that alone does not prove the inspiration of the text  they had a spiritual and mystic meaning already among the heathens of the eastgreeks and barbarians alike  the eastand indeed the west likewisewas haunted by dreams of a water of life a fount of perpetual youth a cup of immortality dreams at which only the shallow and the ignorant will smile for what are they but tokens of mans right to immortalityof his instinct that he is not as the beaststhat there is somewhat in him which ought not to die which need not die and yet which may die and which perhaps deserves to die  how could it be kept alive how strengthened and refreshed into perpetual youth  and waterwith its lifegiving and refreshing powers often with medicinal properties seemingly miraculouswhat better symbol could be found for that which would keep off death  perhaps there was some reality which answered the symbol some actual cup of immortality some actual fount of youth  but who could attain to them  surely the gods hid their own special treasure from the grasp of man surely that water of life was to be sought for far away amid trackless mountainpeaks guarded by dragons and demons  that fount of youth must be hidden in the rich glades of some tropic forest that cup of immortality must be earned by years by ages of superhuman penance and self torture  certain of the old jews it is true had had deeper and truer thoughts  here and there a psalmist had said with god is the well of life or a prophet had cried ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters and buy without money and without price  but the jews had utterly forgotten if the mass of them ever understood the meaning of the old revelations and above all the pharisees the most religious among them  to their minds it was only by a proud asceticismby being not as other men were only by doing some good thingby performing some extraordinary religious featthat man could earn eternal life  and bitter and deadly was their selfish wrath when they heard that the water of life was within all mens reach then and for ever that the eternal life was in that christ who spoke to them that he gave it freely to whomsoever he wouldbitter their wrath when they heard his disciples declare that god had given to men eternal life that the spirit and the bride said  come  they had indeed a graceful ceremony handed down to them from better times as a sign that those words of the old psalmists and prophets had once meant something  at the feast of tabernaclesthe harvest feastat which god was especially to be thanked as the giver of fertility and life their priests drew water with great pomp from the pool of siloam connecting it with the words of the prophet with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation  but the ceremony had lost its meaning  it had become mechanical and empty  they had forgotten that god was a giver  they would have confessed of course that he was the lord of life  but they expected him to prove that not by giving life but by taking it away  not by saving the many but by destroying all except a favoured few  but bitter and deadly was their wrath when they were told that their ceremony had still a living meaning and a meaning not only for them but for all men for that mob of common people whom they looked on as accursed because they knew not the law bitter and deadly was their selfish wrath when they heard one who ate and drank with publicans and sinners stand up in the very midst of that grand ceremony and cry if any man thirst let him come to me and drink  he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of him shall flow rivers of living water  a god who said to all come was not the god they desired to rule over them  and thus the very words which prove the text to be divine and inspired were marked out as such by those bigots of the old world who in them saw and hated both christ and his father  the spirit and the bride say come  come and drink freely  those words prove the text and other texts like it in holy scripture to be an utterly new gospel and good news an utterly new revelation and unveiling of god and of the relations of god to man  for the old legends and dreams in whatsoever they differed agreed at least in this that the water of life was far away infinitely difficult to reach the prize only of some extraordinary favourite of fortune or of some being of superhuman energy and endurance  the gods grudged life to mortals as they grudged them joy and all good things  that god should say come that the water of life could be a gift a grace a boon of free generosity and perfect condescension never entered into their minds  that the gods should keep their immortality to themselves seemed reasonable enough  that they should bestow it on a few heroes and far away above the stars give them to eat of their ambrosia and drink of their nectar and so live for ever that seemed reasonable enough likewise  but that the god of gods the maker of the universe should say come and drink freely that he should stoop from heaven to bring life and immortality to lightto tell men what the water of life was and where it was and how to attain it much more that that god should stoop to become incarnate and suffer and die on the cross that he might purchase the water of life not for a favoured few but for all mankind that he should offer it to all without condition stint or drawbackthis this never entered into their wildest dreams  and yet when the strange news was told it looked so probable although so strange to thousands who had seemed mere profligates or outcasts it agreed so fully with the deepest voices of their own heartswith their thirst for a nobler purer more enduring life with their highest idea of what a perfect god should be if he meant to show his perfect goodness it seemed at once so human and humane and yet so superhuman and divinethat they accepted it unhesitatingly as a voice from god himself a revelation of the eternal author of the universe as god grant you may accept it this day  and what is life  and what is the water of life  what are they indeed my friends  you will find many answers to that question in this as in all ages  but the one which scripture gives is this  life is none other according to the scripture than god himself jesus christ our lord who bestows on man his own spirit to form in him his own character which is the character of god  he is the one eternal life and it has been manifested in human form that human beings might copy it and behold it was full of grace and truth  the life of grace and truth that is the life of christ and therefore the life of god  the life of graceof graciousness love pity generosity usefulness selfsacrifice the life of truthof faithfulness fairness justice the desire to impart knowledge and to guide men into all truth  the life in one word of charity which is both grace and truth both love and justice in one eternal essence  that is the life which god lives for ever in heaven  that is the one eternal life which must be also the life of god  for as there is but one eternal even god so is there but one eternal life which is the life of god and of his christ  and the spirit by which it is inspired into the hearts of men is the spirit of god who proceedeth alike from the father and from the son  have you not seen men and women in whom these words have been literally and palpably fulfilled  have you not seen those who though old in years were so young in heart that they seem to have drunk of the fountain of perpetual youthin whom though the outward body decayed the soul was renewed day by day who kept fresh and pure the noblest and holiest instincts of their childhood and went on adding to them the experience the calm the charity of age persons whose eye was still so bright whose smile was still so tender that it seemed that they could never die  and when they died or seemed to die you felt that they were not dead but only their husk and shell that they themselves the character which you had loved and reverenced must endure on beyond the grave beyond the worlds in a literally everlasting life independent of nature and of all the changes of the material universe  surely you have seen such  and surely what you loved in them was the spirit of god himselfthat love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness which the natural savage man has not  has not i say look at him where you will from the tropics to the pole because it is a gift above man the gift of the spirit of god the eternal life of goodness which natural birth cannot give to man nor natural death take away  you have surely seen such personsif you have not i have thank god full many a timebut if you have seen them did you not see thisthat it was not riches which gave them this life if they were rich or intellect if they were clever or science if they were learned or rank if they were cultivated or bodily organization if they were beautiful and strong  that this noble and gentle life of theirs was independent of their body of their mind of their circumstances  nay have you not seen thisi have thank god full many a timethat not many rich not many mighty not many noble are called  but that gods strength is rather made perfect in mans weaknessthat in foul garrets in lonely sickbeds in dark places of the earth you find ignorant people sickly people ugly people stupid people in spite of in defiance of every opposing circumstance leading heroic livesa blessing a comfort an example a very fount of life to all around them and dying heroic deaths because they know they have eternal life  and what was that which had made them different from the mean the savage the drunken the profligate beings around them  this at least  that they were of those of whom it is written let him that is athirst come  they had been athirst for life  they had had instincts and longings very simple and humble but very pure and noble  at times it may be they had been unfaithful to those instincts  at times it may be they had fallen  they had said why should i not do like the rest and be a savage  let me eat and drink for tomorrow i die and they had cast themselves down into sin for very weariness and heaviness and were for a while as the beasts which have no law  but the thirst after the noble life was too deep to be quenched in that foul puddle  it endured and it conquered and they became more and more true to it till it was satisfied at last though never quenched that thirst of theirs in him who alone can satisfy itthe god who gave it for in them were fulfilled the lords own words blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled  there are those i fear in this churchthere are too many in all churcheswho have not felt as yet this divine thirst after a higher life who wish not for an eternal but for a merely endless life and who would not care greatly what sort of life that endless life might be if only it was not too unlike the life which they live now who would be glad enough to continue as they are in their selfish pleasure selfish gain selfish content for ever who look on death as an unpleasant necessity the end of all which they really prize and who have taken up religion chiefly as a means for escaping still more unpleasant necessities after death  to them as to all it is said come and drink of the water of life freely  but the life of goodness which christ offers is not the life they want wherefore they will not come to him that they may have life meanwhile they have no right to sneer at the fountain of youth or the cup of immortality  well were it for them if those dreams were true in their heart of hearts they know it  would they not go to the ends of the earth to bathe in the fountain of youth  would they not give all their gold for a draught of the cup of immortality and so save themselves once and for all the trouble of becoming good  but there are those here i doubt not who have in them by grace of god that same divine thirst for the higher life who are discontented with themselves ashamed of themselves who are tormented by longings which they cannot satisfy instincts which they cannot analyse powers which they cannot employ duties which they cannot perform doctrinal confusions which they cannot unravel who would welcome any change even the most tremendous which would make them nobler purer juster more loving more useful more clear headed and soundminded and when they think of death say with the poet    tis life not death for which i pant tis life whereof my nerves are scant more life and fuller that i want   to them i sayfor god has said it long agobe of good cheer  the calling and gifts of god are without repentance  if you have the divine thirst it will be surely satisfied  if you long to be better men and women better men and women you will surely be  only be true to those higher instincts only do not learn to despise and quench that divine thirst only struggle on in spite of mistakes of failures even of sinsfor every one of which last your heavenly father will chastise you even while he forgives in spite of all falls struggle on  blessed are you that hunger and thirst after righteousness for you shall be filled  to youand not in vain the spirit and the bride say come  and let him that heareth say come  and let him that is athirst come  and whosoever will let him drink of the water of life freely    sermon ii  the physicians calling preached at whitehall for st georges hospital    st matthew ix 35  and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people   the gospels speak of disease and death in a very simple and human tone  they regard them in theory as all are forced to regard them in fact as sore and sad evils  the gospels never speak of disease or death as necessities never as the will of god  it is satan not god who binds the woman with a spirit of infirmity  it is not the will of our father in heaven that one little one should perish  indeed we do not sufficiently appreciate the abhorrence with which the whole of scripture speaks of disease and death  because we are in the habit of interpreting many texts which speak of the disease and death of the body in this life as if they referred to the punishment and death of the soul in the world to come  we have a perfect right to do that for scripture tells us that there is a mysterious analogy and likeness between the life of the body and that of the soul and therefore between the death of the body and that of the soul  but we must not forget in the secondary and higher spiritual interpretation of such texts their primary and physical meaning which is thisthat disease and death are uniformly throughout scripture held up to the abhorrence of man  moreoverand this is noteworthythe gospels and indeed all scripture very seldom palliate the misery of disease by drawing from it those moral lessons which we ourselves do  i say very seldom  the bible does so here and there to tell us that we may do so likewise  and we may thank god heartily that the bible does so it would be a miserable world if all that the clergyman or the friend might say by the sickbed were this is an inevitable evil like hail and thunder  you must bear it if you can  and if not then not  a miserable world if he could not say with full belief my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him  for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth  thou knowest not now why thou art afflicted perhaps thou wilt never know in this life  but a day will come when thou wilt know  when thou wilt find that this sickness came to thee at the exact right time in the exact right way when thou wilt find that god has been keeping thee in the secret place of his presence from the provoking of men and hiding thee privately in his tabernacle from the spite of tongues when thou wilt discover that thou hast been learning precious lessons for thy immortal spirit while thou didst seem to thyself merely tossing with clouded intellect on a bed of useless pain when thou wilt find that god was nearest to thee at the very moment when he seemed to have left thee most utterly  thank god we can say that and more and we will say it  but we must bear in mind that the gospels which are the very parts of scripture which speak most concerning disease omit almost entirely that cheering and comforting view of it  and why  only to force upon our attention i believe a view even more cheering and comforting  a view deeper and wider because supplied not merely to the pious sufferer but to all sufferers not merely to the christian but to all mankind  and that is i believe none other than this  that god does not only bring spiritual good out of physical evil but that he hates physical evil itself  that he desires not only the salvation of our souls but the health of our bodies and that when he sent his only begotten son into the world to do his will part of that will was that he should attack and conquer the physical evil of diseaseas it were instinctively as his natural enemy and directly for the sake of the body of the sufferer  many excellent men seeing how the healing of disease was an integral part of our lords mission and of the mission of his apostles have wished that it should likewise form an integral part of the mission of the church  that the clergy should as much as possible be physicians the physician as much as possible a clergyman  the plan may be useful in exceptional casesin that for instance of the missionary among the heathen  but experience has decided that in a civilized and christian country it had better be otherwise  that the great principle of the division of labour should be carried out  that there should be in the land a body of men whose whole mind and time should be devoted to one part only of our lords workthe battle with disease and death  and the effect has been not to lower but to raise the medical profession  it has saved the doctor from one great dangerthat of abusing for the purposes of religious proselytizing the unlimited confidence reposed in him  it has freed him from many a superstition which enfeebled and confused the physicians of the middle ages  it has enabled him to devote his whole intellect to physical science till he has set his art on a sound and truly scientific foundation  it has enabled him to attack physical evil with a singlehearted energy and devotion which ought to command the respect and admiration of his fellow countrymen  if all classes did their work half as simply as bravely as determinedly as unselfishly as the medical men of great britainand i doubt not of other countries in europethis world would be a far fairer place than it is likely to be for many a year to come  it is good to do one thing and to do it well  it is good to follow christ in one thing and to follow him utterly in that and the medical man has set his mind to do one thingto hate calmly but with an internecine hatred disease and death and to fight against them to the end  the medical man is complained of at times as being too materialistic as caring more for the bodies of his patients than for their souls do not blame him too hastily  in his exclusive care for the body he may be witnessing unconsciously yet mightily for the soul for god for the bible for immortality  is he not witnessing for god when he shows by his acts that he believes god to be a god of life not of death of health not of disease of order not of disorder of joy and strength not of misery and weakness  is he not witnessing for christ when like christ he heals all manner of sickness and disease among the people and attacks physical evil as the natural foe of man and of the creator of man  is he not witnessing for the immortality of the soul when he fights against death as an evil to be postponed at all hazards and by all means even when its advent is certain  surely it is so  how often have we seen the doctor by the dying bed trying to preserve life when he knew well that life could not be preserved  we have been tempted to say to him let the sufferer alone  he is senseless  he is going  we can do nothing more for his soul you can do nothing more for his body  why torment him needlessly for the sake of a few more moments of respiration  let him alone to die in peace  how have we been tempted to say that  we have not dared to say it for we saw that the doctor and not we was in the right that in all those little efforts so wise so anxious so tender so truly chivalrous to keep the failing breath for a few moments more in the body of one who had no earthly claim upon his care that doctor was bearing a testimony unconscious yet most weighty to that human instinct of which the bible approves throughout that death in a human being is an evil an anomaly a curse against which though he could not rescue the man from the clutch of his foe he was bound in duty and honour to fight until the last simply because it was death and death was the enemy of man  but if the medical man bears witness for god and spiritual things when he seems exclusively occupied with the body so does the hospital  look at those noble buildings which the generosity of our fellowcountrymen have erected in all our great cities  you may find in them truly sermons in stones sermons for rich alike and poor they preach to the rich these hospitals that the sickbed levels all alike that they are the equals and brothers of the poor in the terrible liability to suffer  they preach to the poor that they are through christianity the equals of the rich in their means and opportunities of cure  i say through christianity  whether the founders so intended or not and those who founded most of them st georges among the rest did so intend these hospitals bear direct witness for christ  they do this and would do it even ifwhich god forbidthe name of christ were never mentioned within their walls  that may seem a paradox but it is none  for it is a historic fact that hospitals are a creation of christian times and of christian men  the heathen knew them not  in that great city of ancient rome as far as i have ever been able to discover there was not a single hospitalnot even i fear a single charitable institution  fearful thoughta city of a million and a half inhabitants the centre of human civilization  and not a hospital there  the roman dives paid his physician the roman lazarus literally lay at his gate full of sores till he died the death of the street dogs which licked those sores and was carried forth to be thrust under ground awhile till the same dogs came to quarrel over his bones  the misery and helplessness of the lower classes in the great cities of the roman empire till the church of christ arose literally with healing in its wings cannot i believe be exaggerated  eastern piety meanwhile especially among the hindoos had founded hospitals in the old meaning of that wordnamely almshouses for the infirm and aged  but i believe there is no record of hospitals like our modern ones for the cure of disease till christianity spread over the western world  and why  because then first men began to feel the mighty truth contained in the text  if christ were a healer his servants must be healers likewise  if christ regarded physical evil as a direct evil so must they  if christ fought against it with all his power so must they with such power as he revealed to them  and so arose exclusively in the christian mind a feeling not only of the nobleness of the healing art but of the religious duty of exercising that art on every human being who needed it and hospitals are to be counted as a historic fact among the many triumphs of the gospel  if there be any oneespecially a working manin this church this day who is inclined to undervalue the bible and christianity let him know that but for the bible and christianity he has not the slightest reason to believe that there would have been at this moment a hospital in london to receive him and his in the hour of sickness or disabling accident and to lavish on him there unpaid as the light and air of god outside every resource of science care generosity and tenderness simply because he is a human being  yes truly catholic are these hospitalscatholic as the bounty of our heavenly fatherwithout respect of persons giving to all liberally and upbraiding not like him in whom all live and move and have their being witnesses better than all our sermons for the universal bounty and tolerance of that heavenly father who causes the sun to shine on the evil and the good and his rain to fall upon the just and on the unjust and is perfect in this that he is good to the unthankful and the evil  and therefore the preacher can urge his countrymen let their opinions creed tastes be what they may to support hospitals with especial freedom earnestness and confidence  heaven forbid that i should undervalue any charitable institution whatever  may gods blessing be on them all  but this i have a right to saythat whatever objections suspicions prejudices there may be concerning any other form of charity concerning hospitals there can be none every farthing bestowed on them must go toward the direct doing of good  there is no fear in them of waste of misapplication of funds of private jobbery of ulterior and unavowed objects  palpable and unmistakeable good is all they do and all they can do  and he who gives to a hospital has the comfort of knowing that he is bestowing a direct blessing on the bodies of his fellowmen and it may be on their souls likewise  for i have said that these hospitals witness silently for god and for christ and i must believe that that silent witness is not lost on the minds of thousands who enter them  it sinks inall the more readily because it is not thrust upon themand softens and breaks up their hearts to receive the precious seed of the word of god many a man too ready from bitter experience to believe that his fellowmen cared not for him has entered the wards of a hospital to be happily undeceived  he finds that he is cared for that he is not forgotten either by god or man that there is a place for him too at gods table in his hour of utmost need and angels of god in human form ready to minister to his necessities and softened by that discovery he has listened humbly perhaps for the first time in his life to the exhortations of a clergyman and has taken in in the hour of dependence and weakness the lessons which he was too proud or too sullen to hear in the day of independence and sturdy health  and so do these hospitals it seems to me follow the example and practice of our lord himself who by ministering to the animal wants and animal sufferings of the people by showing them that he sympathised with those lower sorrows of which they were most immediately conscious made them follow him gladly and listen to him with faith when he proclaimed to them in words of wisdom that father in heaven whom he had already proclaimed to them in acts of mercy  and now i have to appeal to you for the excellent and honourable foundation of st georges hospital  i might speak to you and speak too with a personal reverence and affection of many years standing of the claims of that noble institution of the illustrious men of science who have taught within its walls of the number of able and honourable young men who go forth out of it year by year to carry their blessed and truly divine art not only over great britain but to the islands of the farthest seas  but to say that would be merely to say what is true thank god of every hospital in london  one fact only therefore i shall urge which gives st georges hospital special claims on the attention of the rich  situated as it is in the very centre of the west end of london it is the special refuge of those who are most especially of service to the dwellers in the westend  those who are used upfairly or unfairlyin ministering to the luxuries of the highborn and wealthy  the groom thrown in the park the housemaid crippled by lofty stairs the workman fallen from the scaffolding of the great mans palace the footman or coachman who has contracted disease from long hours of nightly exposure while his master and mistress have been warm and gay at rout and ball and those too whose number i fear are very great who contract disease themselves their wives and children from actual want when they are thrown suddenly out of employ at the end of the season and london is said to be emptyof all but two million of living souls the great majority of these crowd into st georges hospital to find there relief and comfort which those to whom they minister are solemnly bound to supply by their contributions  the rich and wellborn of this land are very generous  they are doing their duty on the whole nobly and well let them do their dutythe duty which literally lies nearest them by st georges hospital and they will wipe off a stain not on the hospital but on the rich people in its neighbourhoodthe stain of that hospitals debts  the deficiency in the funds of the hospital for the year 18623 caused be it remembered by no extravagance or sudden change but simply by the necessity for succouring those who would otherwise have been destitute of succourthe deficiency i say on an expenditure of 15000l amounts to more than 3200l which has had to be met by selling out funded property and so diminishing the capital of the institution  ought this to be i ask  ought this to be while more wealth is collected within half a mile of that hospital than in any spot of like extent in the globe  my friends this is the time of lent the time whereof it is writtenis not this the fast which i have chosen to deal thy bread to the hungry and bring the poor that is cast out to thine house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh  if thou let thy soul go forth to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noonday  and the lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul and make fat thy bones and thou shalt be like a watered garden and as a spring that doth not fail  let us obey that command literally and see whether the promise is not literally fulfilled to us in return    sermon iii  the victory of life preached at the chapel royal    isaiah xxxviii 18 19  the grave cannot praise thee death cannot celebrate thee  they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth  the living the living he shall praise thee   i may seem to have taken a strange text on which to speaka mournful a seemingly hopeless text  why i have chosen it i trust that you will see presently certainly not that i may make you hopeless about death  meanwhile let us consider it for it is in the bible and like all words in the bible was written for our instruction  now it is plain i think that the man who said these wordsgood king hezekiahknew nothing of what we call heaven of a blessed life with god after death  he looks on death as his end  if he dies he says he will not see the lord in the land of the living any more than he will see man with the inhabitants of the world  gods mercies he thinks will end with his death  god can only show his mercy and truth by saving him from death  for the grave cannot praise god death cannot celebrate him those who go down into the pit cannot hope for his truth  the living the living shall praise god as hezekiah praises him that day because god has cured him of his sickness and added fifteen years to his life  no language can be plainer than this  a man who had believed that he would go to heaven when he died could not have used it  in many of the psalms likewise you will find words of exactly the same kind which show that the men who wrote them had no clear conception if any conception at all of a life after death  solomons words about death are utterly awful from their sadness with him that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts as one dieth so dieth the other  yea they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence over a beast and all is vanity  all go to one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth  he knows nothing about it  all he knows is that the spirit shall return to god who gave itand that a man will surely find in this life a recompence for all his deeds whether good or evil  remember therefore thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them  fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man  for god shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil  this is the doctrine of the old testament that god judges and rewards and punishes men in this life  but as for death it is a great black cloud into which all men must enter and see and be seen no more  only twice or thrice perhaps a gleam of light from beyond breaks through the dark  david the noblest and wisest of all the jews can say once that god will not leave his soul in hell neither suffer his holy one to see corruption job says that though after his skin worms destroy his body yet in his flesh he shall see god and isaiah again when he sees his countrymen slaughtered and his nation all but destroyed can say thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they arise  awake and sing ye that dwell in dust  for thy dew is as the dew of the morning which brings the parched herbs to life and freshness againgreat and glorious sayings all of them  but we cannot tell how far either david or job or isaiah were thinking of a life after death  we can think of a life after death when we use them for we know how they have been fulfilled in jesus christ our lord and we can see in them more than the jews of old could do for like all inspired words they mean more than the men who wrote them thought of but we have no right to impute our christianity to them  the only undoubted picture perhaps of the next life to be found in the old testament is that grand one in isaiah xiv where he paints to us the tyrant king of babylon going down into hell  hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming it stirreth up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the earth it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations all they shall speak and say unto thee art thou also become weak as we art thou become like unto us  thy pomp is brought down to the grave and the noise of thy viols  the worm is spread under thee and the worms cover thee  how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nationsawful and grand enough  but quite different you will observe from the notions of hell which are common nowadays and much more like those which we read in the old greek poets and especially in the necyomanteia of the odyssey  when it was that the jews gained any fuller notions about the next life it is very difficult to say  certainly not before they were carried away captive to babylon  after that they began to mix much with the great nations of the east  with greeks persians and indians and from them most probably they learned to believe in a heaven after death to which good men would go and a fiery hell to which bad men would go  at least the heathen nations round them and our forefathers likewise believed in some sort of heaven and hell hundreds of years before the coming of our blessed lord  the jews had learned alsoat least the phariseesto believe in the resurrection of the dead  martha speaks of it and st paul when he tells the pharisees that having been brought up a pharisee he was on their side against the sadduceesi am a pharisee he says the son of a pharisee for the hope of the resurrection of the dead i am called in question  but if it be soif st paul and the apostles believed in heaven and hell and the resurrection of the dead before they became christians what more did they learn about the next life when they became christians  something they did learn most certainlyand that most important  st paul speaks of what our lord and our lords resurrection had taught him as something quite infinitely grander and more blessed than what he had known before  he talks of our lord as having abolished death and brought life and immortality to light of his having conquered death and of his destroying death at last  he speaks at moments as if he did not expect to die at all and when he does speak of the death of the christian it is merely as a falling asleep  when he speaks of his own death it is merely as a change of place  he longs to depart and to be with christ  death had looked terrible to him once when he was a jew  death had had a sting and the grave a victory which seemed ready to conquer him but now he cries o death where is thy sting  o grave where is thy victory and then he declares that the terrors of death and the grave are taken away not by anything which he knew when he was a pharisee but through our lord jesus christ  all his old jewish notions of the resurrection though they were true as far as they went seemed poor and paltry beside what christ had taught him  he was not going to wait till the end of the world perhaps for thousands of yearsin darkness and the shadow of death he knew not where or how  his soul was to pass at once into life into joy and peace and bliss in the presence of his saviour till it should have a new body given to it in the resurrection of life at the last day  this i think is what st paul learned and what the jews had not learned till our blessed lord came  they were still afraid of death it looked to them a dark and ugly blank and no wonder  for would it not be dark and ugly enough to have to wait we know not where it may be a thousand it may be tens of thousands of years till the resurrection in the last day before we entered into joy peace activity or anything worthy of the name of life  would not death have a sting indeed the grave a victory indeed if we had to be as good as dead for ten thousands of years  what then  remember this that death is an enemy an evil thing an enemy to man and therefore an enemy to christ the king and head and saviour of man  men ought not to die and they feel it  it is no use to tell them everything that is born must die and why not you all other animals died  they died just as they die now hundreds of thousands of years before man came upon this earth and why should man expect to have a different lot  why should you not take your death patiently as you take any other evil which you cannot escape the heart of man as soon as he begins to be a man and not a mere savage as soon as he begins to think reasonably and feel deeply the heart of man answers  no i am not a mere animal  i have something in me which ought not to die which perhaps cannot die  i have a living soul in me which ought to be able to keep my body alive likewise but cannot and therefore death is my enemy  i hate him and i believe that i was meant to hate him  something must be wrong with me or i should not die something must be wrong with all mankind or i should not see those i love dying round me  yes my friends death is an enemya hideous hateful thing  the longer one looks at it the more one hates it  the more often one sees it the less one grows accustomed to it  its very commonness makes it all the more shocking  we may not be so much shocked at seeing the old die  we say they have done their work why should they not go  that is not true  they have not done their work there is more work in plenty for them to do if they could but live and it seems shocking and sad at least to him who loves his country and his kind that just as men have grown old enough to be of use when they have learnt to conquer their passions when their characters are formed when they have gained sound experience of this world and what man ought and can do in itjust as in fact they have become most able to teach and help their fellowmenthat then they are to grow old and decrepit and helpless and fade away and die just when they are most fit to live and the world needs them most  sad i say and strange is that  but sadder and more strange and more utterly shocking to see the young die to see parents leaving infant children children vanishing early out of the world where they might have done good work for god and man  what arguments will make us believe that that ought to be  that that is gods will  that that is anything but an evil an anomaly a disease  not the bible certainly  the bible never tells us that such tragedies as are too often seen are the will of god  the bible says that it is not the will of our father that one of these little ones should perish  the bible tells us that jesus when on earth went about fighting and conquering disease and death even raising from the dead those who had died before their time  to fight against death and to give life wheresoever he wentthat was his work by that he proclaimed the will of god his father that none should perish who sent his son that men might have life and have it more abundantly  by that he declared that death was an evil and a disorder among men which he would some day crush and destroy utterly that mortality should be swallowed up of life  and yet we die and shall die  yes  the body is dead because of sin  mankind is a diseased race and it must pay the penalty of its sins for many an age to come and die and suffer and sorrow  but not for ever  for what mean such words as thesefor something they must mean   if a man keep my saying he shall never see death  and again he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die  do such words as these mean only that we shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day  surely not  our lord spoke them in answer to that very notion  martha said to him i know that my brother shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day  jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life and then showed what he meant by bringing back lazarus to life unchanged and as he had been before he died  surely if that miracle meant anything if these words meant anything it meant this  that those who die in the fear of god and in the faith of christ do not really taste death that to them there is no death but only a change of place a change of state that they pass at once and instantly into some new life with all their powers all their feelings unchangedpurified doubtless from earthly stains but still the same living thinking active beings which they were here on earth  i say active  the bible says nothing about their sleeping till the day of judgment as some have fancied  rest they may rest they will if they need rest  but what is the true rest  not idleness but peace of mind  to rest from sin from sorrow from fear from doubt from carethis is the true rest  above all to rest from the worst weariness of allknowing ones duty and yet not being able to do it  that is true rest the rest of god who works for ever and yet is at rest for ever as the stars over our heads move for ever thousands of miles each day and yet are at perfect rest because they move orderly harmoniously fulfilling the law which god has given them  perfect rest in perfect work that surely is the rest of blessed spirits till the final consummation of all things when christ shall have made up the number of his elect  i hope that this is so  i trust that this is so  i think our lords great words can mean nothing less than this  and if it be so what comfort for us who must die  what comfort for us who have seen others die if death be but a new birth into some higher life if all that it changes in us is our bodythe mere shell and husk of us such a change as comes over the snake when he casts his old skin and comes out fresh and gay or even the crawling caterpillar which breaks its prison and spreads its wings to the sun as a fair butterfly  where is the sting of death then if death can sting and poison and corrupt nothing of us for which our friends have loved us nothing of us with which we could do service to men or god where is the victory of the grave if so far from the grave holding us down it frees us from the very thing which holds us downthe mortal body  death is not death then if it kills no part of us save that which hindered us from perfect life  death is not death if it raises us in a moment from darkness into light from weakness into strength from sinfulness into holiness  death is not death if it brings us nearer to christ who is the fount of life  death is not death if it perfects our faith by sight and lets us behold him in whom we have believed  death is not death if it gives us to those whom we have loved and lost for whom we have lived for whom we long to live again  death is not death if it joins the child to the mother who is gone before  death is not death if it takes away from that mother for ever all a mothers anxieties a mothers fears and lets her see in the gracious countenance of her saviour a sure and certain pledge that those whom she has left behind are safe safe with christ and in christ through all the chances and dangers of his mortal life  death is not death if it rids us of doubt and fear of chance and change of space and time and all which space and time bring forth and then destroy  death is not death for christ has conquered death for himself and for those who trust in him  and to those who say you were born in time and in time you must die as all other creatures do time is your king and lord as he has been of all the old worlds before this and of all the races of beasts whose bones and shells lie fossil in the rocks of a thousand generations then we can answer them in the words of the wise man and in the name of christ who conquered death   fly envious time till thou run out thy race and glut thyself with what thy womb devours which is no more than what is false and vain and merely mortal dross so little is our loss so little is thy gain for when as each bad thing thou hast entombed and last of all thy greedy self consumed then long eternity shall greet our bliss with an individual kiss and joy shall overtake us as a flood when everything that is sincerely good and perfectly divine and truth and peace and love shall ever shine about the supreme throne of him unto whose happymaking sight alone when once our heavenlyguided soul shall climb then all this earthly grossness quit attired with stars we shall for ever sit triumphant over death and chance and thee o time    sermon iv  the wages of sin chapel royal june 1864    rom vi 2123  what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed for the end of those things is death  but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life  for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord   this is a glorious text if we will only believe it simply and take it as it stands  but if in place of st pauls words we put quite different words of our own and sayby the wages of sin is death st paul means that the punishment of sin is eternal life in torture then we say something which may be true but which is not what st paul is speaking of here  for wages are not punishment and death is not eternal life in torture any more than in happiness  that one would think was clear  it is our duty to take st pauls words if we really believe them to be inspired simply as they stand and if we do not quite understand them to explain them by st pauls own words about these matters in other parts of his writings  st paul was an inspired apostle  let him speak for himself  surely he knew best what he wished to say and how to say it  now st pauls opinions about death and eternal life are very clear for he speaks of them often and at great length  he considered that the great enemy of god and man the last enemy christ would destroy was death and that after death was destroyed the end would come when god would be all in all  then came the question which has puzzled men in all ageshow death came into the world  st paul answers by sin  he says as the author of the third chapter of genesis says that adam became subject to death by his fall  by one man he says sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned and thus he says death reigned even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of adams transgression  that he is speaking of bodily death is clear because he is always putting it in contrast to the resurrection to lifenot merely to a spiritual resurrection from the death of sin to the life of righteousness but to the resurrection of the bodyto our lords being raised from the dead that he might die no more  then he speaks of eternal life  he always speaks of it as an actual life in a spiritual body into which our mortal bodies are to be changed  nothing can be clearer from what he says in 1 cor xv that he means an actual rising again of our bodies from bodily death an actual change in them an actual life in them for ever  but he says again and againas sin caused the death of the body so righteousness is to cause its life  when ye were the servants of sin he says to the romans what fruit had ye in those things whereof ye are now ashamed  for the end of those things is death  but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life  for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord  this is st pauls opinion  and we shall do well to believe it and to learn from it this day and all days  the wages of sin and the end of sin is death  not the punishment of sin but something much worse  the wages of sin and the end of sin  and how is that worse news  my friends every sinner knows so well in his heart that it is worse news more terrible news for him that he tries to persuade himself that death is only the arbitrary punishment of his sin or quite as often that the punishment of his sin is not even death but eternal torment in the next life  and why  because as long as he can believe that death or hell are only punishments arbitrarily fixed by god against his sins he can hope that god will let him off the punishment  die he knows he must because all men die and so he makes up his mind to that  but being sent to hell after he dies is so very terrible a punishment that he cannot believe that god will be so hard on him as that  no he will get off and be forgiven at last somehow for surely god will not condemn him to hell  and so he finds it very convenient and comfortable to believe in hell just because he does not believe that he is going there whoever else may be  but it is a very terrible heartrending thought for a man to find out that what he will receive is not punishment but wages not punishment but the end of the very road which he is travelling on that the wages of sin and the end of sin to which it must lead are death that every time he sins he is earning those wages deserving them meriting them and therefore receiving them by the just laws of the world of god  that does torment him that does terrify him if he will look steadfastly at the broad plain factyou need not dream of being let off respited reprieved pardoned in any way  the thing cannot be done  it is contrary to the laws of god and of gods universe  it is as impossible as that fire should not burn or water run up hill  it is not a question of arbitrary punishment which may be arbitrarily remitted but of wages which you needs must take weekly daily and hourly and those wages are death  a question of travelling on a certain road whereon if you travel it long enough you must come to the end of it and the end is death  your sins are killing you by inches all day long they are sowing in you the seeds of disease and death  every sin which you commit with your body shortens your bodily life  every sin you commit with your mind every act of stupidity folly wilful ignorance helps to destroy your mind and leave you dull silly devoid of right reason  every sin you commit with your spirit each sin of passion and temper envy and malice pride and vanity injustice and cruelty extravagance and selfindulgence helps to destroy your spiritual life and leave you bad more and more unable to do the right and avoid the wrong more and more unable to discern right from wrong and that last is spiritual death the eternal death of your moral being  there are three parts in youbody mind and spirit and every sin you commit helps to kill one of these three and in many cases to kill all three together  so sinner dream not of escaping punishment at the last  you are being punished now for you are punishing yourself and you will continue to be punished for ever for you will be punishing yourself for ever as long as you go on doing wrong and breaking the laws which god has appointed for body mind and spirit  you can see that a drunkard is killing himself body and mind by drink  you see that he knows that poor wretch as well as you  he knows that every time he gets drunk he is cutting so much off his life and yet he cannot help it  he knows that drink is poison and yet he goes back to his poison  then know habitual sinner that you are like that drunkard  that every bad habit in which you indulge is shortening the life of some of your faculties and that god himself cannot save you from the doom which you are earning deserving and working out for yourself every day and every hour  oh how men hate that messagethe message that the true wrath of god necessary inevitable is revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness of men  how they writhe under it  how they shut their ears to it and cry to their preachers no  tell us of any wrath of god but that  tell us rather of the torments of the damned of a frowning god of absolute decrees to destruction of the reprobation of millions before they are born any doctrine however fearful and horrible  because we dont quite believe it but only think that we ought to believe it  yes tell us anything rather than that news which cuts at the root of all our pride of all our comfort and all our superstitionthe news that we cannot escape the consequences of our own actions that there are no back stairs up which we may be smuggled into heaven that as we sow so we shall reap that we are filled with the fruits of our own devices every man his own poisoner every man his own executioner every man his own suicide that hell begins in this life and death begins before we die do not say that  because we cannot help believing it for our own consciousness and our own experience tell us it is true  no wonder that the preacher who tells men that is hated is called a rationalist a pantheist a heretic and what not just because he does set forth such a living god such a justice of god such a wrath of god as would make the sinner tremble if he believed in it not merely once in a way when he hears a stirring sermon about the endless torments  but all day long going out and coming in lying on his bed and walking by the way always haunted by the shadow of himself knowing that he is bearing about in him the perpetually growing death of sin  and still more painful would this message be to the sinner if he had any kindly feeling for others and thank god there are few who have not that  for st pauls message to him is that the wages of his sin is death not merely to himself but to othersto his family and children above all  so st paul declares in what he says of his doctrine of original or birth sin by which as the article says every man is very far gone from original righteousness and is of his own nature inclined to evil so that the flesh lusteth against the spirit  st pauls doctrine is simple and explicit  death he says reigned over adams children even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of adams transgression agreeing with moses who declares god to be one who visits the sins of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate him  but how the sinner will shrink from this messageand shrink the more the more feeling he is the less he is wrapped up in selfishness  yes that message gives us such a view of the sinfulness of sin as none other can  it tells us why god hates sin with so unextinguishable a hatred just because he is a god of love  it is not that mans sin injures god insults god as the heathen fancy  who is god that man can stir him up to pride or wound or disturb his everlasting calm his selfsufficient perfectness  god is tempted of no man says st james  no  god hates sin  he loves all and sin harms all and the sinner may be a torment and a curse not only to himself not only to those around him but to children yet unborn  this is bad news and yet sinners must hear it  they must hear it not only put into words by moses or by st paul or by any other inspired writer but they must hear it likewise in that perpetual voice of god which we call facts  let the sinner who wishes to know what original sin means and how actual sin in one man breeds original sin in his descendants look at the world around him and see  let him see how st pauls doctrine and the doctrine of the ten commandments are proved true by experience and by fact  how the past and how the present likewise show us whole families whole tribes whole aristocracies whole nations dwindling down to imbecility misery and destruction because the sins of the fathers are visited on the children  physicians who see children born diseased born stupid or even idiotic born thwartnatured or passionate or false or dishonest or brutalthey know well what original sin means though they call it by their own name of hereditary tendencies  and they know too how the sins of a parent or of a grand parent or even a great grandparent are visited on the children to the third and fourth generation and they say it is a law of nature and so it is  but the laws of nature are the laws of god who made her  and his law is the same law by which death reigns even over those who have not sinned after the likeness of adam the law by which even though if christ be in us the spirit is life because of righteousness the body nevertheless is dead because of sin  parents parents who hear my words bewareif not for your own sakes at least for the sake of your children and your childrens childrenlest the wages of your sin should be their death  and by this time surely some of you will be asking what has he said  that there is no escape that there is no forgiveness  none whatsoever my friends though you were to cry to heaven for ever and ever save the one old escape of which you hear in the church every sunday morning  when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive  what does not the blood of christ cleanse us from all sin  yes from all sin  but not necessarily from the wages of all sin  judge for yourselves my friends again  listen to the voice of god revealed in facts  if you being a drunkard have injured your constitution by drink and then are converted and repent and turn to god with your whole soul and become as you may if you will a truly penitent good and therefore sober manwill that cure the disease of your body  it will certainly palliate and ease it because instead of being drunken you will have become sober  but still you will have shortened your days by your past sins and in so far even though the lord has put away your sin its wages still remain as death  so it is my friends if you will only believe it or rather see it with your own eyes with every sin and every sort of sin  you will see if you look that the article speaks exact truth when it says that the infection of nature doth remain even in those that are regenerate  it says that of original sin  but it is equally true of actual sin  would to god that all men would but believe this and give up the too common and too dangerous notion that it is no matter if they go on wrong for a while provided they come right at last  no matter  i ask for facts again  is there a man or woman in this church twenty years old who does not know that it matters  who does not know that if they have done wrong in youth their own wrong deeds haunt them and torment themthat they are perhaps the poorer perhaps the sicklier perhaps the more ignorant perhaps the sillier perhaps the more sorrowful this day for things which they did twenty thirty years ago  is there any one in this church who ever did a wrong thing without smarting for it  if there is which i question let him be sure that it is only because his time is not come  do not fancy that because you are forgiven you may not be actually less good men all your lives by having sinned when young  i know it is sometimes said the greater the sinner the greater the saint  i do not believe that  because i do not see it  i see and i thank god for it that men who have been very wrong at one time come very right afterwards that having found out in earnest that the wages of sin are death they do repent in earnest and receive the gift of eternal life through jesus christ  but i see too that the bad habits bad passions bad methods of thought which they have indulged in youth remain more or less and make them worse men sillier men less useful men less happy men sometimes to their lives end  and they if they be true christians know it and repent of their early sins not once for all only but all their lives long because they feel that they have weakened and worsened themselves thereby  it stands to reason my friends that it should be so  if a man loses his way and finds it again he is so much the less forward on his way surely by all the time he has spent in getting back into the road  if a child has a violent illness it stops growing because the life and nourishment which ought to have gone towards its growth are spent in curing its disease  and so if a man has indulged in bad habits in his youth he is but too likely let him do what he will to be a less good man for it to his lifes end because the spirit of god which ought to have been making him grow in grace freely and healthily to the stature of a perfect man to the fulness of the measure of christ is striving to conquer old bad habits and cure old diseases of character and the man even though he does enter into life enters into it halt and maimed and the wages of his sin have been as they always will be death to some powers some faculties of his soul  think over these things my friends and believe that the wages of sin are death and that there is no escaping from gods just and everlasting laws  but meanwhile let us judge no man  this is a great and a solemn reason for observing with fear and trembling our lords command for it is nothing less judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned  for we never can know how much of any mans misconduct is to be set down to original and how much to actual sinhow much disease of mind and heart he has inherited from his parents how much he has brought upon himself  therefore judge no man but yourselves  search your own hearts to see what manner of men you really wish to be judge yourselves lest god should judge you  do you wish to go on as you like here on earth right or wrong in the hope that somehow or other the punishment of your sins will be forgiven you at the last day  then know that that is impossible  as a man sows so shall he reap and if you sow to the flesh of the flesh you will reapcorruption the wages of sin are death  those wages will be paid you and you must take them whether you like or not  but do you wish to be good  do you see i trust in god that many of you do that goodness is the only wise safe prudent life for you because it is the only path the end of which is not death  do you see that goodness is the only right and honourable life for you because it is the only path by which you can do your duty to man or to god the only method by which you can show your gratitude to god for all his goodness to you and can please him in return for all that he has done by his grace and free love to bless you  do you in a word repent you truly of your former sins and purpose to lead a new life  then know that all beyond is the free grace the free gift of god  you have to earn nothing to buy nothing  the will is all god asks  eternal life is the gift of god through jesus christ  freely he forgives you all your past sins for the sake of that precious blood which was shed on the cross for the sins of the whole world  freely he takes you back as his child to your fathers house  freely he gives you his holy spirit the spirit of goodness the spirit of life to put into your mind good desires and enable you to bring those desires to good effect that you may live the eternal life of grace and goodness for ever whether in earth or heaven  yes it is the gift of god which raises you from the death of sin to the life of righteousness and if you have that gift you will not murmur surely though you have to bear more or less the just and natural consequences of your former sins though you be through your own guilt a sadder man to your dying day  be content  you are forgiven  you are cleansed from your sin is not that mercy enough why are you to demand of god that he should over and above cleanse you from the consequences of your sin  he may leave them there to trouble and sadden you just because he loves you and desires to chasten you and keep you in mind of what you were and what you would be again at any moment if his spirit left you to yourself you may have to enter into life halt and maimed  yet be content you have a thousand times more than you deserve for at least you enter into life    sermon v  night and day preached at the chapel royal    romans xiii 12  the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of light   certain commentators would tell us that st paul wrote these words in the expectation that the end of the world and the second coming of christ were very near  the night was far spent and the day of the lord at hand  salvationdeliverance from the destruction impending on the world was nearer than when his converts first believed  shortly the lord would appear in glory and st paul and his converts would be caught up to meet him in the air  no doubt st pauls words will bear this meaning  no doubt there are many passages in his writings which seem to imply that he thought the end of the world was near and that christ would reappear in glory while he paul was yet alive on the earth  and there are passages too which seem to imply that he afterwards altered that opinion and no longer expecting to be caught up to meet the lord in the air desired to depart himself and be with christ in the consciousness that he was ready to be offered up and the time of his departure was at hand  i say that there are passages which seem to imply such a change in st pauls opinions  i do not say that they actually imply it  if i had a positive opinion on the matter i should not be hasty to give it  these questions of criticism as they are now called are far less important than men fancy just now  a generation or two hence it is to be hoped men will see how very unimportant they are and will find that they have detracted very little from the authority of scripture as a whole and that they have not detracted in the least from the gospel and good news which scripture proclaims to menthe news of a perfect god who will have men to become perfect even as he their father in heaven is perfect who sent his only begotten son into the world that the world through him might be saved  in this case i verily believe it matters little to us whether st paul when he wrote these words wrote them under the belief that christs second coming was at hand  we must apply to his words the great rule that no prophecy of scripture is of any private interpretationthat is does not apply exclusively to any one fact or event  but fulfils itself again and again in a hundred unexpected ways because he who wrote it was moved by the holy spirit who revealed to him the eternal and everworking laws of the kingdom of god  therefore i say the words are true for us at this moment  to us though we have as far as i can see not the least reasonable cause for supposing the end of the world to be more imminent than it was a thousand years agoto us nevertheless and to every generation of men the night is always far spent and the day is always at hand  and this surely was in the mind of those who appointed this text to be read as the epistle for the first sunday in advent  year after year though christ has not returned to judgment though scoffers have been saying where is the promise of his coming for all things continue as they were at the beginningyear after year i say are the clergy bidden to tell the people that the night is far spent that the day is at hand and to tell them so because it is true  whatsoever st paul meant or did not mean by the words a few years after our lords ascension into heaven they are there for ever written by one who was moved by the holy ghost and hence they have an eternal moral and spiritual significance to mankind in every age  whatever these words may or may not have meant to st paul when he wrote them first in the prime of life we may never know and we need not know  but we can guess surely enough what they must have meant to him in after years when he could sayas would to god we all might be able to sayi have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith  henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day  and not to me only but unto all them that love his appearing  to him then the night would surely mean this mortal life on earth the day would mean the immortal life to come  for is not this mortal life compared with that life to come as night compared with day  i do not mean to speak evil of it  god forbid that we should do anything but thank god for this life  god forbid that we should say impiously to him why hast thou made me thus  no  god made this mortal life and therefore like all things which he has made it is very good  but there are good nights and there are bad nights and there are happy lives and unhappy ones but what are they at best  what is the life of the happiest man without the holy spirit of god  a night full of pleasant dreams what is the life of the wisest man  a night of darkness through which he gropes his way by lanthornlight slowly and with many mistakes and stumbles  when we compare mans vast capabilities with his small deeds when we think how much he might knowhow little he does know in this mortal lifecan we wonder that the highest spirits in every age have looked on death as a deliverance out of darkness and a dungeon  and if this is life at the best what is life at the worst  to how many is life a night not of peace and rest but of tossing and weariness pain and sickness anxiety and misery till they are ready to cry when will it be over  when will kind death come and give me rest  when will the night of this life be spent and the day of god arise  out of the depths have i cried unto thee o lord  lord hear my voice  my soul doth wait for the lord more than the sick man who watches for the morning  yes thinkfor it is good at times however happy one may be oneself to thinkof all the misery and sorrow that there is on earth and how many there are who would be glad to hear that it was nearly over glad to hear that the night was far spent and the day was at hand  and even the happiest ought to know the time  to know that the night is far spent and the day at hand  to know too that the night at best was not given us to sleep it all through from sunset to sunrise  no industrious man does that  either he works after sunset and often on through the long hours and into the short hours before he goes to rest  or else he rises before daybreak and gets ready for the labours of the coming day  the latter no man can do in this life  for we all sleep away more or less the beginning of our life in the time of childhood  there is no sin in thatgod seems to have ordained that so it should be  but to sleep away our manhood likewiseis there no sin in that  as we grow older must we not awake out of sleep and set to work to be ready for the day of god which will dawn on us when we pass out of this mortal life into the world to come  as we grow older and as we get our share of the cares troubles experiences of life it is high time to wake out of sleep and ask christ to give us lightlight enough to see our way through the night of this life till the everlasting day shall dawn  knowing the timethe time of this our mortal life  how soon it will be over at the longest  how short the time seems since we were young  how quickly it has gone  how every year as we grow older seems to go more and more quickly and there is less time to do what we want to think seriously to improve ourselves  so soon and it will be over and we shall have no time at all for we shall be in eternity  and what then  what then  that depends on what now  on what we are doing now  are we letting our short span of life slip away in sleep fancying ourselves all the while wide awake as we do in dreamstill we wake really and find that it is daylight and that all our best dreams were nothing but useless fancy  how many dream away their lives  some upon gain some upon pleasure some upon petty selfinterest petty quarrels petty ambitions petty squabbles and jealousies about this person and that which are no more worthy to take up a reasonable human beings time and thoughts than so many dreams would be  some too dream away their lives in sin in works of darkness which they are forced for shame and safety to hide lest they should come to the light and be exposed  so people dream their lives away and go about their daily business as men who walk in their sleep wandering about with their eyes open and yet seeing nothing of what is really around them  seeing nothing  though they think that they see and know their own interest and are shrewd enough to find their way about this world but they know nothingnothing of the very world with which they pride themselves they are so thoroughly acquainted  none know less of the world than those who pride themselves on being men of the world  for the true light which shines all round them they do not see and therefore they do not see the truth of things by that light if they did then they would see that of which now they do not even dream  they would see that god was around them about their path and about their bed and spying out all their ways and in the light of his presence they dare not be frivolous dare not be ignorant dare not be mean dare not be spiteful dare not be unclean  they would see that christ was around them knocking at the door of their hearts that he may enter in and dwell there and give them peace crying to their restless fretful confused unhappy souls come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest  take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart  and ye shall find rest unto your souls  they would see that duty was around them  dutythe only thing really worth living for  the only thing which will really pay a man either for this life or the next  the only thing which will give a man rest and peace manly and quiet thoughts a good conscience and a stout heart in the midst of hard labour anxiety sorrow and disappointment  because he feels at least that he is doing his duty that he is obeying god and christ that he is working with them and for them and that therefore they are working with him and for him  god christ and dutythese and more will a man see if he will awake out of sleep and consider where he is by the light of gods holy spirit  then will that man feel that he must cast away the works of darkness whether of the darkness of foul and base sins or the darkness of envy spite and revenge or the mere darkness of ignorance and silliness thoughtlessness and frivolity  he must cast them away he will see  they will not succeedthey are not safein such a serious world as this  the term of this mortal life is too short and too awfully important to be spent in such dreams as these  the man is too awfully near to god and to christ to dare to play the fool in their divine presence  this earth looks to him now that he sees it in the true light one great temple of god in which he dare not for very shame misbehave himself  he must cast away the works of darkness and put on the armour of light now in the time of this mortal life lest when christ comes in his glory to judge the quick and the dead he be found asleep dreaming useless unfit for the eternal world to come  then let him awake and cry to christ for light  and christ will give him lightenough at least to see his way through the darkness of this life to that eternal life of which it is written they need no candle there nor light of the sun  for the lord god and the lamb are the light thereof  and he will find that the armour of light is an armour indeed  a defence against all enemies a helmet for his head and breastplate for his heart against all that can really harm his mind our soul  if a man in the struggle of life sees god and christ and duty all around him that thought will be a helmet for his head  it will keep his brain and mind clear quiet prudent to perceive and know what things he ought to do  it will give him that divine wisdom of which solomon says in his proverbs that the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the lord  the light will give him i say judgment and wisdom to perceive what he ought to do and it will give him too grace and power faithfully to fulfil the same  for it will be a breastplate to his heart  it will keep his heart sound as well as his head  it will save him from breaking his good resolutions and from deserting his duty out of cowardice or out of passion  the light of christ will keep his heart pure unselfish forgiving ready to hope all things believe all things endure all things by that divine charity which god will pour into his soul  for when he looks at things in the light of christ what does he see christ hanging on the cross praying for his murderers dying for the sins of the whole world  and what does the light which streams from that cross show him of christ  that the likeness of christ is summed up in one wordselfsacrificing love  what does the light which streams from that cross show him of the world and mankind in spite of all their sins  that they belong to him who died for them and bought them with his own most precious blood  beloved herein is love indeed  not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation of our sins  beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another  after that sight a man cannot hate cannot revenge  he must forgive he must love  from hence he is in the light and sees his duty and his path through life  for he that hateth his brother walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth  because darkness has blinded his eyes  but he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is no occasion of stumbling in him  for he who dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him  therefore cast away the works of darkness and put you on the armour of light and be good men and true  for of this the holy ghost prophesies by the mouth of st paul and of all apostles and prophets  not of times and seasons which god the father has kept in his own hand  not of that day and hour of which no man knows no not the angels in heaven neither the son but the father only  not of these does the holy ghost testify to men  not of chronology past or future  but of holiness because he is a holy spirit  for this purpose god the holy father sent his son into the world for this god the holy son died upon the cross  for this god the holy ghostproceeding from both the father and the soninspired prophets and apostles that they might teach men to cast away the works of darkness and put on the armour of light and become holy as god is holy pure as god is pure true as god is true and good as god is good    sermon vi  the shaking of the heavens and the earth preached at the chapel royal whitehall    hebrews xii 2629  but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven  and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain  wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear  for our god is a consuming fire   this is one of the royal texts of the new testament  it declares one of those great laws of the kingdom of god which may fulfil itself once and again at many eras and by many methods which fulfilled itself especially and most gloriously in the first century after christ which fulfilled itself again in the fifth century and again at the time of the crusades and again at the great reformation in the sixteenth century and is fulfilling itself again at this very day  now in our fathers time and in our own unto this day is the lord christ shaking the heavens and the earth that those things which are made may be removed and that those things which cannot be shaken may remain  we all confess this fact in different phrases  we say that we live in an age of change of transition of scientific and social revolution  our notions of the physical universe are rapidly altering with the new discoveries of science and our notions of ethics and theology are altering as rapidly  the era looks differently to different minds just as the first century after christ looked differently according as men looked with faith towards the future or with regret towards the past  some rejoice in the present era as one of progress  others lament over it as one of decay  some say that we are on the eve of a reformation as great and splendid as that of the sixteenth century  others say that we are rushing headlong into scepticism and atheism  some say that a new era is dawning on humanity others that the world and the church are coming to an end and the last day is at hand  both parties may be right and both may be wrong  men have always talked thus at great crises  they talked thus in the first century in the fifth in the eleventh in the sixteenth  and then both parties were right and yet both wrong  and why not now  what they meant to say and what they mean to say now is what he who wrote the epistle to the hebrews said for them long ago in far deeper wider more accurate wordsthat the lord christ was shaking the heavens and the earth that those things which can be shaken may be removed as things which are madecosmogonies systems theories fashions prejudices of mans invention  while those things which cannot be shaken may remain because they are eternal the creation not of man but of god  yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven  not merely the physical world and mans conceptions thereof but the spiritual world and mans conceptions of that likewise  how have our conceptions of the physical world been shaken of late with everincreasing violence  how simple and easy and certain it all looked to our forefathers  how complex how uncertain it looks to us  with increased knowledge has comenot increased doubtthat i deny but increased reverence increased fear of rash assertions increased awe of facts as the acted words and thoughts of god  once for all i deny that this age is an irreverent one  i say that an irreverent age is an age like the middle age in which men dared to fancy that they could and did know all about earth and heaven and set up their petty cosmogonies their petty systems of doctrine as measures of the ways of that god whom the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain  it was simple enough their theory of the universe  the earth was a flat plain for did not the earth look flat  or if some believed the earth to be a globe yet the existence of antipodes was an unscriptural heresy  above were the heavens  first the lower heavens in which the stars were fixed and moved and above them heaven after heaven each peopled of higher orders up to that heaven of heavens in which deityand by him the mother of deitywere enthroned  and belowwhat could be more clear more certain than thisthat as above the earth was the kingdom of light and joy and holiness so below the earth was the kingdom of darkness and torment and sin what could be more certain  had not even the heathens said so by the mouth of the poet virgil  what could be more simple rational orthodox than to adopt as they actually did virgils own words and talk of tartarus styx and phlegethon as indisputable christian entities  they were not aware that the buddhists of the far east had held much the same theory of endless retribution several centuries before and that dante with his various bolge tenanted each by its various species of sinners was merely reechoing the horrors which are to be seen painted on the walls of any buddhist temple as they were on the walls of so many european churches during the middle ages when men really believed in that same tartarology with the same intensity with which they now believe in the conclusions of astronomy or of chemistry  to them indeed it was all an indisputable or physical fact as any astronomic or chemical fact would have been for they saw it with their own eyes  virgil had said that the mouth of tartarus was there in italy by the volcanic lake of avernus and after the first eruption of vesuvius in the first century nothing seemed more probable  etna stromboli hecla must be likewise all mouths of hell and there were not wanting holy hermits who had heard within those craters shrieks and clanking chains and the shouts of demons tormenting endlessly the souls of the lost  and now how has all this been shaken  how much of all this does any educated man though he be pious though he desire with all his heart to be orthodoxand is orthodox in fact how much of all this does he believe as he believes that the earth is round or that if he steals his neighbours goods he commits a crime  for since these days the earth has been shaken and with it the heavens likewise in that very sense in which the expression is used in the text  our conceptions of them have been shaken  the copernican system shook them when it told men that the earth was but a tiny globular planet revolving round the sun  geology shook them when it told men that the earth has endured for countless ages during which whole continents have been submerged whole seas become dry land again and again  even now the heavens and the earth are being shaken by researches into the antiquity of the human race and into the origin and the mutability of species which issue in what results they may will shake for us meanwhile theories which are venerable with the authority of nearly eighteen hundred years and of almost every great doctor since st augustine  and as our conception of the physical universe has been shaken the old theory of a tartarus beneath the earth has been shaken also till good men have been glad to place tartarus in a comet or in the sun or to welcome the possible but unproved hypothesis of a central fire in the earths core not on any scientific grounds but if by any means a spot may be found in space corresponding to that of which virgil dante and milton sang  and meanwhileas was to be expected from a generation which abhors torture labours for the reformation of criminals and even doubts whether it should not abolish capital punishmenta shaking of the heavens is abroad of which we shall hear more and more as the years roll ona general inclination to ask whether holy scripture really endorses the middleage notions of future punishment in endless torment  men are writing and speaking on this matter not merely with ability and learning but with a piety and reverence for scripture which rightly or wrongly employed must and will command attention  they are saying that it is not those who deny these notions who disregard the letter of scripture but those who assert them that they are distorting the plain literal text in order to make scripture fit the writings of dante and milton when they translate into endless torments after death such phrases as the outer darkness the undying worm the gehenna of firewhich manifestly say these men if judged by fair rules of interpretation refer to this life and specially to the fate of the jewish nation  or when they tell us that eternal death means really eternal life only in torments  we demand they say not a looser but a stricter not a more metaphoric but a more literal not a more careless but a more reverent interpretation of scripture and whether this demand be right or wrong it will not pass unheard  and even more severely shaken meanwhile is that mediaeval conception of heaven and hell by the question which educated men are asking more and more heaven and hellthe spiritual worldare they merely invisible places in space which may become visible hereafter or are they not rather the moral worldthe world of right and wrong  love and righteousnessis not that the heaven itself wherein god dwells  hatred and sinis not that hell itself wherein dwells all that is opposed to god  and out of that thought right or wrong other thoughts have sprung of ethics of moral retributionnot new at all say these men but to be found in scripture and in the writings of all great christian divines when they have listened not to systems but to the voice of their own hearts  we do not deny they say that the wages of sin are death  we do not deny the necessity of punishmentthe certainty of punishment we see it working awfully enough around us in this life we believe that it may work in still more awful forms in the life to come  only tell us not that it must be endless and thereby destroy its whole purpose and as we think its whole morality  we too believe in an eternal fire but we believe its existence to be not a curse but a gospel and a blessing seeing that that fire is god himself who taketh away the sins of the world and of whom it is therefore written our god is a consuming fire  questions too have arisen ofwhat is moral retribution  should punishment have any end but the good of the offender  is god so controlled that he must needs send into the world beings whom he knows to be incorrigible and doomed to endless misery  and if not so controlled then is not the other alternative as to his character more fearful still  does he not bid us copy him his justice his love  then is that his justice is that his love which if we copied we should be unjust and unloving utterly  are there two moralities one for god and quite another for man made in the image of god can these dark dogmas be true of a father who bids us be perfect as he is in that he sends his sun to shine on the evil and the good and his rain on the just and unjust  or of a son who so loved the world that he died to save the world and surely not in vain  these questionsbe they right or wrongeducated men and women of all classes and denominationsorthodox be it remembered as well as unorthodoxare asking and will ask more and more till they receive an answer  and if we of the clergy cannot give them an answer which accords with their conscience and their reason if we tell them that the words of scripture and the integral doctrines of christianity demand the same notions of moral retribution as were current in the days when men racked criminals burned heretics alive and believed that every mussulman whom they slaughtered in a crusade went straight to endless tormentsthen evil times will come both for the clergy and the christian religion for many a yeas henceforth  what then are we to believe  what are we to do amid this shaking of the earth and heaven  are we to degenerate into a lazy and heartless scepticism which under pretence of liberality and charity believes that everything is a little true everything is a little falsein one word believes nothing at all  or are we to degenerate into unmanly and faithless wailings crying out that the flood of infidelity is irresistible that the last days are come and that christ has deserted his church  not if we will believe the text  the text tells us of something which cannot be moved though all around it reel and crumbleof a firm standingground which would endure though the heavens should pass away as a scroll and the earth should be removed and cast into the midst of the sea  we have a kingdom the scripture says which cannot be moved even the kingdom of him whom it calls shortly after jesus christ the same yesterday today and for ever  an eternal and unchangeable kingdom ruled by an eternal and unchangeable king  that is what cannot be moved  scripture does not say that we have an unchangeable cosmogony an unchangeable theory of moral retribution an unchangeable system of dogmatic propositions  whether we have or have not it is not of them that scripture reminds the jews when the heavens and the earth were shaken when their own nation and worship were in their death agony and all the beliefs and practices of men were in a whirl of doubt and confusion of decay and birth side by side such as the world had never seen before  not of them does it remind the jews but of the changeless kingdom and the changeless king  my friends lay it seriously to heart once and for all  do you believe that you are subjects of that kingdom and that christ is the living ruling guiding king thereof  whatsoever scripture does not say scripture speaks of that again and again in the plainest terms  but do you believe it  these are days in which the preacher ought to ask every man whether he believes it and bid him of whatever else he repents of to repent at least of not having believed this primary doctrine i may almost say of scripture and of christianity  but if you do believe it will it seem strange to you to believe this alsothat considering who christ is the coeternal and coequal son of god he may be actually governing his kingdom and if so that he may know better how to govern it than such poor worms as we  that if the heavens and the earth be shaken christ himself may be shaking them if opinions be changing christ himself may be changing them if new truths and facts are being discovered christ himself may be revealing them  that if those truths seem to contradict the truths which he has already taught us they do not really contradict them any more than those reasserted in the sixteenth century  that if our god be a consuming fire he is now burning up to use st pauls parable the chaff and stubble which men have built on the one foundation of christ that at last nought but the pure gold may remain  is it not possible  is it not most probable if we only believe that christ is a real living king an active practical kingwho with boundless wisdom and skill love and patience is educating and guiding christendom and through christendom the whole human race  if men would but believe that how different would be their attitude toward new facts toward new opinions  they would receive them with grace gracefully courteously fairly charitably and with that reverence and godly fear which the text tells us is the way to serve god acceptably  they would say  christ so the scripture tells us has been educating man through abraham through moses through david through the jewish prophets through the greeks through the romans then through himself as man as well as god and after his ascension through his apostles especially through st paul to an ever increasing understanding of god and the universe and themselves and even after their time he did not cease his education  why should he  how could he who said of himself all power is given to me in heaven and earth lo i am with you alway to the end of the world and again my father worketh hitherto and i work  at the reformation in the sixteenth century he called on our forefathers to repentthat is to change their mindsconcerning opinions which had been undoubted for more than a thousand years why should he not be calling on us at this time likewise  and if any answer that the reformation was only a return to the primitive faith of the apostleswhy should not this shaking of the hearts and minds of men issue in a still further return in a further correction of errors a further sweeping away of additions which are not integral to the christian creeds but which were left behind through natural and necessary human frailty by our great reformers  wise they weregood and greatas giants on the earth while we are but as dwarfs but as the hackneyed proverb tells us the dwarf on the giants shoulders may see further than the giant himself  ah that men would approach new truth in that spirit in the spirit of godly fear which is inspired by the thought that we are in the kingdom of god and that the king thereof is christ both god and man once crucified for us now living for us for ever  ah that they would thus serve god waiting as servants before a lord for the slightest sign which might intimate his will  then they would look at new truths with caution in that truly conservative spirit which is the duty of all christians and the especial strength of the englishman  with cautionlest in grasping eagerly after what is new we throw away truth which we have already  but with awe and reverence for christ may have sent the new truth and he who fights against it may haply be found fighting against god  and so would they indeed obey the apostolic injunctionprove all things hold fast that which is goodthat which is pure fair noble tending to the elevation of men to the improvement of knowledge justice mercy wellbeing to the extermination of ignorance cruelty and vice  that at least must come from christ unless the pharisees were right when they said that evil spirits could be cast out by beelzebub prince of the devils  how much more christian reverent faithful as well as more prudent rational and philosophical would such a temper be than that which condemns all changes a priori at the first hearing or rather too often without any hearing at all in rage and terror like that of the animal who at the same moment barks at and runs away from every unknown object  at least that temper of mind will give us calm faith patience hope charity though the heavens and the earth are shaken around us for we have received a kingdom which cannot be moved and in the king thereof we have the most perfect trust  for us he stooped to earth was born and died on the cross and can we not trust him  let him do what he will let him teach us what he will let him lead us whither he will  wherever he leads we shall find pasture  wherever he leads must be the way of truth and we will follow and say as socrates of old used to say let us follow the logos boldly whithersoever it leadeth  if socrates had courage to say it how much more should we who know what he good man knew not that the logos is not a mere argument train of thought necessity of logic but a personperfect god and perfect man even jesus christ the same yesterday today and for ever who promised of old and therefore promises to us and our children after us to lead those who trust him into all truth    sermon vii  the battle of life    galatians v 16 17  i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh  for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh  so that ye cannot do the things that ye would   a great poet speaks of happiness our beings end and aim and he has been reproved for so doing  men have said and wisely the end and aim of our being is not happiness but goodness  if goodness comes first then happiness may come after  but if not something better than happiness may come even blessedness  this it is i believe which our lord may have meant when he said he that saveth his life or soul for the two words in scripture mean exactly the same thing shall lose it  and he that loseth his life shall save it  for what is a man profited if he gain the whole world and lose his own life  how is this  it is a hard saying  difficult to believe on account of the natural selfishness which lies deep in all of us  difficult even to understand in these days when religion itself is selfish and men learn more and more to think that the end and aim of religion is not to make them good while they live but merely to save their souls after they die  but whether it be hard to understand or not we must understand it if we would be good men  and how to understand it the epistle for this day will teach us  walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh the spirit which is the spirit of god within our hearts and conscience saysbe good  the flesh the animal savage nature which we all have in common with the dumb animals saysbe happy please yourself  do what you like  eat and drink for tomorrow you die  but happily for us the spirit lusts against the flesh  it draws us the opposite way  it lifts us up instead of dragging us down  it has nobler aims higher longings  it as st paul puts it will not let us do the things that we would  it will not let us do just what we like and please ourselves  it often makes us unhappy just when we try to be happy  it shames us and cries in our heartsyou were not meant merely to please yourselves and be as the beasts which perish  but how few listen to that voice of gods spirit within their hearts though it be just the noblest thing of which they will ever be aware on earth  how few listen to it till the lusts of the flesh are worn out and have worn them out likewise and made them reap the fruit which they have sowedsowing to the selfish flesh and of the selfish flesh reaping corruption  the young man saysi will be happy and do what i like and runs after what he calls pleasure  the middleaged man grown more prudent saysi will be happy yet and runs after money comfort fame and power  but what do they gain  the works of the flesh the fruit of this selfish lusting after mere earthly happiness are manifest which are thesenot merely that open vice and immorality into which the young man falls when he craves after mere animal pleasure but hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresiesie factions in church or stateenvyings murders and such like  thus men put themselves under the law  not under moses law of course but under some law or other  for why has law been invented  why is it needed with all its expense  law is meant to prevent if possible men harming each other by their own selfishness by those lusts of the flesh which tempt every man to seek his own happiness careless of his neighbours happiness interest morals by all the passions which make men their own tormentors and which make the history of every nation too often a history of crime and folly and faction and war sad and shameful to read all those passions of which st paul says once and for ever that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god  these are the sad consequences of giving way to the flesh the selfish animal nature within us  and most miserable would man be if that were all he had to look to  miserable were there not a kingdom of god into which he could enter all day long and be at peace and a spirit of god who would raise him up to the spiritual life of love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance and a son of god the king of that kingdom the giver of that spirit who cries for ever to every one of uscome unto me ye that are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke on you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly of heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls  love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance these are the fruits of the spirit  the spirit of unselfishness the spirit of charity the spirit of justice the spirit of purity the spirit of god  against them there is no law he who is guided by this spirit and he only may do what he would for he will wish to do nought but what is right  he is not under the law but under grace and full of grace will he be in all his words and works  he has entered into the kingdom of god and is living therein as gods subject obeying the royal law of libertythou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh so that ye cannot do the things that ye would says st paul  my friends this is the battle of life  in every one of us more or less this battle is going on a battle between the flesh and the spirit between the animal nature and the divine grace  in every one of us i say who is not like the heathen dead in trespasses and sins in every one of us who has a conscience excusing or else accusing us  there are thosea very few i hopewho are sunk below that state who have lost their sense of right and wrong who only care to fulfil the lusts of the flesh in pleasure ease and vanity  there are those in whom the voice of conscience is lead for a while silenced by selfconceit who say in their prosperity like the foolish laodiceans i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know not that in fact and reality and in the sight of god they are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked  happy happy for any and all of usif ever we fall into that dream of pride and false securityto be awakened again however painful the awakening may be  happy for every man that the battle between the spirit and the flesh should begin in him again and again as long as his flesh is not subdued to his spirit  if he be wrong the greatest blessing which can happen to him is that he should find himself in the wrong  if he have been deceiving himself the greatest blessing is that god should anoint his eyes that he may seesee himself as he is see his own inbred corruption see the sin which doth so easily beset him whatever it may be  whatever anguish of mind it may cost him it is a light price to pay for the inestimable treasure which true repentance and amendment brings the fine gold of solid selfknowledge tried in the fire of bitter experience the white raiment of a pure and simple heart the eye salve of honest selfcondemnation and noble shame  if he have but theseand these god will give him in answer to prayer the prayer of a broken and a contrite heartthen he will be able to carry on the battle against the corrupt flesh with its affections and lusts in hope  in the assured hope of final victory  for greater is he that is with us than he that is against us  he that is against us is our self our selfish self our animal nature and he that is with us is god god and none other  and who can pluck us out of his hand  my friends the bread and the wine on that table are gods own sign to us that he will not leave us to be like the savage the slaves of our own animal natures that he will feed not merely our bodies with animal but our souls with spiritual food giving us strength to rise above our selfish selves and so subdue the flesh to the spirit that at last however long and weary the fight however sore wounded and often worsted we may be we shall conquer in the battle of life    sermon viii  free grace preached before the queen at windsor march 12 1865    isaiah iv  1  ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price   every one who knows his bible as he should knows well this noble chapter  it seems to be one of the separate poems or hymns of which the book of isaiah is composed  it is certainly one of the most beautiful of them and also one of the deepest  so beautiful is it that the good men of old who translated the bible into english could not help catching the spirit of the words as they went on with their work and making the chapter almost a hymn in english as it is a hymn in hebrew  even the very sound of the words as we listen to them is a song in itself and there is perhaps no more perfect piece of writing in the english language than the greater part of this chapter  this may not seem a very important matter and yet those good men of old must have felt that there was something in this chapter which went home especially to their hearts and would go home to the hearts of us for whose sake they translated it  and those good men judged rightly  the care which they bestowed on isaiahs words has not been in vain  the noble sound of the text has caught many a mans ears in order that the noble meaning of the text might touch his heart and bring him back again to god to seek him while he may be found and call on him while he is near that so the wicked might forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and return to god for he will have compassion and to our god for he will abundantly pardon and that he might find that gods thoughts are not as mans thoughts nor his ways as mans ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are his ways and thoughts higher than ours  yesi believe that the beauty of this chapter has made many a man listen to it who had perhaps never cared to listen to any good before and learn a precious lesson from it which he could learn nowhere save in the bible  for this text is one of those which have been called the evangelical prophecies in which the prophet rises far above moses old law and the letter of it which as st paul says is a letter which killeth and the spirit of it which is a spirit which as st paul says gendereth to bondage and slavish dread of god  an utterance in which the prophet sees by faith the lord jesus christ and his free grace revealeddimly of course and in a figurebut still revealed by the spirit of god who spake by the prophets  as st paul says moses law made nothing perfect and therefore had to be disannulled for its unprofitableness and weakness and a better hope brought in by which we draw near to god  and here in this text we see the better hope coming in and as it were dawning upon menthe dawn of the sun of righteousness jesus christ our lord who was to rise afterwards to be a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of his people israel  and what was this better hope  one st paul says by which we could draw nigh to god come near to him as to a father a saviour a comforter a liege lordnot a tyrant who holds us against our will as his slaves but a liege lord who holds us with our will as his tenants his vassals his liege men as the good old english words were one who will take his vassals into his counsel and inform them with his spirit and teach them his mind that they may do his will and copy his example and be treated by him as his friendsin spite of the infinite difference of rank between them and him which they must never forget  but though the difference of rank be infinite and boundlessfor it is the difference between sinful man and god perfect for everyet still man can now draw near to god  he is not commanded to stand afar off in fear and trembling as the old jews were at sinai  we have not come says st paul to a mount which burned with fire and blackness and darkness and storm and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which those who heard entreated that they should not be spoken to them any more  for they could not endure that which was commanded  but we are come to the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling  we are come to god the judge of all and to christnot bidden to stand afar off from them  that is the point to which i wish you to attend  for this agrees with the words of the text ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters  this message it is which made this chapter precious in the eyes of the good men of old  this message it is which has made it precious in all times to thousands of troubled hardworked weary afflicted hearts  this is what has made it precious to thousands who were wearied with the burden of their sins and longed to be made righteous and good and knew bitterly well that they could not make themselves good but that god alone could do that and so longed to come to god that they might be made good  but did not know whether they might come or not or whether if they came god would receive them and help them and convert them  this message it is which has made the text an evangelical prophecy to be fulfilled only in christa message which tells men of a god who says come  of a god whom moses law saying merely thou shalt not did not reveal to us divine and admirable as it was and is and ever will be  of a god whom natural religion such as even the heathen st paul says may gain from studying gods works in this wonderful world around us of a god i say whom natural religion does not reveal to us divine and admirable as it is  but of a god who was revealed step by step to the psalmists and the prophets more and more clearly as the years went on of a god who was fully and utterly revealed not merely by but in jesus christ our lord who was himself that god very god of very god begotten being the brightness of his fathers glory and the express image of his person whose message and call from the first day of his ministry to his glorious ascension was come  come unto me ye that are weary and heavy laden and i will refresh you  come unto me and take my yoke on you  for my yoke is easy and my burden is light  i am the bread of life  he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth in me shall never thirst  all that the father hath given me shall come unto me  and he that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out  nay the very words of this prophecy christ took to himself again and again speaking of himself as the fountain of life health and light when he stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come to me and drink  come unto me that ye may have life is the message of jesus christ both god and man  come that you may have forgiveness of your sins come that you may have the holy spirit by which you may sin no more but live the life of the spirit the everlasting life of goodness by which the spirits of just men and angels and archangels live for ever before god  and what says st paul  see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven  yes  the goodness of god the condescension of god instead of making it more easy for sinners to escape makes it if possible more difficult  there are those who fancy that because god is mercifulbecause it is written in this very chapter let a man return to the lord and he will have mercy and to our god for he will abundantly pardonthat therefore god is indulgent and will overlook their sins forgetting that in the verse before it is said let the wicked forsake his ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts and thenbut not till thenlet him return to god to be received with compassion and forgiveness  too many know not as st paul says that the goodness of god leads men not to sin freely and carelessly without fear of punishment but leads them to repentance  and yet do not our own hearts and consciences tell us that it is so  that it is more base and more presumptuous likewise to turn away from one who speaks with love than one who speaks with sternness from one who calls us to come to him with boundless condescension than from one who bids us stand afar off and tremble  those jews of old when they refused to hear god speaking in the thunders of sinai committed folly  we if we refuse to hear god speaking in the tender words of jesus crucified for us commit an equal folly  but we commit baseness and ingratitude likewise  they rebelled against a master  we rebel against a father  but though we deny him he cannot deny himself  we may be false to him false to our better selves false to our baptismal vows  but he cannot be false  he cannot change  he is the same yesterday to day and for ever  what he said on earth that he says eternally in heaven  if any man thirst let him come to me and drink  eternally and for ever in heaven says st john christ says and is and does what isaiah prophesied that he would say and be and doi am the root and offspring of david and the bright and morning star  and the spirit and the bride his spirit and his church say come  and let him that is athirst come  and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely  for ever he calls to every anxious soul every afflicted soul every weary soul every discontented soul to every man who is ashamed of himself and angry with himself and longs to live a soberer gentler nobler purer truer more useful lifecome  let him who hungers and thirsts after righteousness come to the waters and he that hath no silver nothing to give to god in return for all his bountylet him buy without silver and eat and live for ever that eternal life of righteousness holiness and peace and joy in the holy spirit which is the one true and only salvation bought for us by the precious blood of christ our lord    sermon ix  ezekiels vision preached before the queen at windsor june 16 1864    ezekiel i 1 26  now it came to pass as i was among the captives by the river of chebar that the heavens were opened and i saw visions of god  and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man   ezekiels vision may seem to some a strange and unprofitable subject on which to preach  it ought not to be so in fact  all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for teaching for correction for reproof for instruction in righteousness  and so will this vision be to us if we try to understand it aright  we shall find in it fresh knowledge of god a clearer and fuller revelation made to ezekiel than had been up to his time made to any man  i am well aware that there are some very difficult verses in the text  it is difficult if not impossible to understand exactly what presented itself to ezekiels mind  ezekiel saw a whirlwind come out of the north a whirling globe of fire four living creatures coming out of the midst thereof  so far the imagery is simple enough and grand enough  but when he begins to speak of the living creatures the cherubim his description is very obscure  all that we discover is a vision of huge creatures with the feet and as some think the body of an ox with four wings and four facesthose of a man an ox a lion and an eagle ezekiel seems to discover afterwards that these are the cherubim the same which overshadowed the ark in moses tabernacle and solomons templeonly of a more complex form for moses and solomons cherubim are believed to have had but one face each while ezekiels had four  now concerning the cherubim and what they meant we know very little  the jews at the time of the fall of jerusalem had forgotten their meaning  josephus indeed says they had forgotten their very shape  some light has been thrown lately on the figures of these creatures by the sculptures of those very assyrian cities to which ezekiel was a captivethose huge winged oxen and lions with human heads and those huge human figures with four wings each let down and folded round them just as ezekiel describes and with heads sometimes of the lion and sometimes of the eagle  none however have been found as yet i believe with four faces like those of ezekiels vision they are all of the simpler form of solomons cherubim  but there is little doubt that these sculptures were standing there perfect in ezekiels time and that he and the jews who were captive with him may have seen them often  and there is little doubt also what these figures meant  that they were symbolic of royal spiritsthose thrones dominations princedoms powers of which milton speaksthe powers of the earth and heaven the royal archangels who as the chaldaeans believed governed the world and gave it and all things life symbolized by them under the types of the four royal creatures of the world according to the eastern nations the ox signifying labour the lion power the eagle foresight and the man reason  so with the wheels which ezekiel sees  we find them in the assyrian sculptureswheels with a living spirit sitting in each a human figure with outspread wings and these seem to have been the genii or guardian angels who watched over their kings and gave them fortune and victory  for these chaldaeans were specially worshippers of angels and spirits and they taught the jews many notions about angels and spirits which they brought home with them into judaea after the captivity  of them of course we read little or nothing in holy scripture but there is much and too much about them in the writings of the old rabbis the scribes and pharisees of the new testament  now ezekiel inspired by the spirit of god rises far above the old chaldaeans and their dreams  perhaps the captive jews were tempted to worship these cherubim and genii as the chaldaeans did and it may be that ezekiel was commissioned by god to set them right and by his vision to give a type pattern or picture of gods spiritual laws by which he rules the world  be that as it may  in the first place ezekiels cherubim are far more wonderful and complicated than those which he would see on the walls of the assyrian buildings  and rightly so for this world is far more wonderful more complicated more cunningly made and ruled than any of mans fancies about it as it is written in the book of jobwhere wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understanding  whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy  next and this is most important these different cherubim were not independent of each other each going his own way and doing his own will  not so  ezekiel had found in them a divine and wonderful order by which the services of angels as well as of men are constituted  orderly and harmoniously they worked together  out of the same fiery globe from the same throne of god they came forth all alike  they turned not when they went whithersoever the spirit was to go they went and ran and returned like a flash of lightning nay in one place he speaks as if all the four creatures were but one creature  this is the living creature which i saw by the river of chebar  and so it is we may be sure in the world of god whether in the earthly or in the heavenly world  all things work together praising god and doing his will  angels and the heavenly host sun and moon stars and light fire and hail snow and vapour wind and storm  all fulfil his word  he hath made them fast for ever and ever  he hath given them a law which shall not be broken  for before all things under all things and through all things is a divine unity and order all things working towards one end because all things spring from one beginning which is the bosom of god the father  and so with the wheels the wheels of fortune and victory and the fate of nations and of kings  they were so high ezekiel said that they were dreadful  but he saw no human genius sitting one in each wheel of fortune each protecting his favourite king and nation  these too did not go their own way and of their own will they were parts of gods divine and wonderful order and obeyed the same laws as the cherubim  and when the living creatures went the wheels went with them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels  everywhere was the same divine unity and order the same providence the same laws of god presided over the natural world and over the fortunes of nations and of kings  victory and prosperity was not given arbitrarily by separate genii each genius protecting his favourite king each genius striving against the other on behalf of his favourite  fortune came from the providence of one being of him of whom it is written god standeth in the congregation of princes  he is the judge among gods  and again the lord is king be the people never so impatient  he sitteth between the cherubim be the earth never so unquiet  and is this all  god forbid  this is more than the chaldaeans saw who worshipped angels and not godthe creature instead of the creator  but where the chaldaean vision ended ezekiels only began his prophecy rises far above the imaginations of the heathen  he hears the sound of the wings of the cherubim like the tramp of an army like the noise of great waters like the roll of thunder the voice of almighty god  but above their wings he sees a firmament which the heathen cannot see clear as the flashing crystal and on that firmament a sapphire throne and round that throne a rainbow the type of forgiveness and faithfulness and on that throne a man  and the cherubim stand and let down their wings in submission waiting for the voice of one mightier than they  and ezekiel falls upon his face and hears from off the throne a human voice which calls to him as human likewise son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak to thee  this this is ezekiels vision  not the fiery globe merely nor the cherubim nor the wheels nor the powers of nature nor the angelic hostdominions and principalities and powersbut the man enthroned above them all the lord and guide and ruler of the universe he who makes the winds his angels and the flames of fire his ministers and that lord speaking to him not through cherubim not through angels not through nature not through mediators angelic or human but speaking direct to him himself as man speaks to man  as man speaks to man  this is the very pith and marrow of the old testament and of the new which gradually unfolds itself from the very first chapter of genesis to the last of revelationthat man is made in the likeness of god and that therefore god can speak to him and he can understand gods words and inspirations  man is like god and therefore god in some inconceivable way is like man  that is the great truth set forth in the first chapter of genesis which goes on unfolding itself more clearly throughout the old testament till here in ezekiels vision it comes to perhaps its clearest stage save one  that human appearance speaks to ezekiel the hapless prisoner of war far away from his native land  and he speaks to him with human voice and claims kindred with him as a human being saying son of man  that is very deep and wonderful  the lord upon his throne does not wish ezekiel to think how different he is to him but how like he is to him  he says not to ezekielcreature infinitely below me  dust and ashes unworthy to appear in my presence  worm of the earth as far below me and unlike me as the worm under thy feet is to thee but son of man creature made in my image and likeness be not afraid  stand on thy feet and be a man and speak to others what i speak to thee  after that great revelation of god there seems but one step more to make it perfect and that step was made in gods good time in the incarnation of our lord jesus christ  forasmuch as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also he whom ezekiel saw in human form enthroned on highhe took part of flesh and blood likewise and was not ashamed yea rather rejoiced to call himself what he called ezekiel the son of man  and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory  and why  for many reasons but certainly for this one  to make men feel more utterly and fully what ezekiel was made to feel  that god could thoroughly feel for man and that man could thoroughly trust god  that god could thoroughly feel for man  for we have a high priest who has been made perfect by sufferings tempted in all points like as we are and we can   look to him who not in vain experienced every human pain he sees our wants allays our fears and counts and treasures up our tears   againthat man could utterly trust god  for when st john and his companions simple fishermen beheld the glory of jesus the incarnate word what was it like  it was full of grace and truth the perfection of human graciousness of human truthfulness which could win and melt the hearts of simple folk and make them see in him who was called the carpenters son the beauty of the glory of the godhead  he is the judge of all the earth  and why  let him himself tell us  he says that the father has given the son authority to execute judgment  and why once more  because he is the son of god  our lord says morebecause he says he is the son of man who knows what is in man who can feel understand discriminate pity make allowances judge fair and righteous and merciful judgment among creatures whose weakness he has experienced whose temptations he has felt whose pains and sorrows he has borne in mortal flesh and blood  oh gospel and good news for the weak the sorrowful the oppressed for those who are wearied with the burden of their sins or wearied also by the burden of heavy responsibilities and awful public duties  when all mortal counsellors fail them when all mortal help is too weak let them but throw themselves on the mercy of him who sits upon the throne and remember that he though immortal and eternal is still the son of man who knows what is in man  there are times in which we are all tempted to worship other things than god  not perhaps to worship cherubim and genii angels and spirits like the old chaldees but to worship the laws of political economy the laws of statesmanship the powers of nature the laws of physical science those lower messengers of gods providence of which st paul says he maketh the winds his angels and flames of fire his ministers  in such times we have need to remember ezekiels lesson that above them all ruling and guiding sits he whose form is as the son of man  we are not to say that any powers of nature are evil or the laws of any science false  heaven forbid  ezekiel did not say that the cherubim were evil or meaningless or that the belief in angels ministering to man was false  he said the very opposite  but he said all these obey one whose form is that of a man  he rules them and they do his will  they are but ministering spirits before him  therefore we are not to disbelieve science nor disregard the laws of nature or we shall lose by our folly  but we are to believe that nature and science are not our gods  they do not rule us our fortunes are not in their hands  above nature and above science sits the lord of nature and the lord of science  above all the counsels of princes and the struggles of nations and the chances and changes of this world of man sits the judge of princes and of peoples the lord of all the nations upon earth he by whom all things were made and who upholdeth all things by the word of his power and he is man of the substance of his mother most human and yet most divine full of justice and truth full of care and watchfulness full of love and pity full of tenderness and understanding a friend a guide a counsellor a comforter a saviour to all who trust in him  he is nearer to us than nature and science  and he should be dearer to us for they speak only to our understanding but he speaks to our human hearts to our inmost spirits  nature and science cannot take away our sins give peace to our hearts right judgment to our minds strength to our wills or everlasting life to our souls and bodies but there sits one upon the throne who can  and if nature were to vanish away and science were to be proved however correct as far as it went a mere childs guess about this wonderful world which none can understand save he who made itif all the counsels of princes and of peoples however just and wise were to be confounded and come to nought still after all and beyond all and above all christ would abide for ever with human tenderness yearning over human hearts with human wisdom teaching human ignorance with human sympathy sorrowing with human mourners for ever saying come unto me ye that are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest  cherubim and seraphim angels and archangels dominions and powers whether of nature or of gracethese all serve him and do his work he has constituted their services in a wonderful order  but he has not taken their nature on him  our nature he has taken on him that we might be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh able to say to him for ever in all the chances and changes of this mortal life    thou o christ art all i want    more than all in thee i find raise me fallen cheer me faint    heal me sick and lead me blind thou of life the fountain art    freely let me drink of thee spring thou up within my heart    rise to all eternity    sermon x  ruth    ruth ii 4  and behold boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reapers the lord be with you  and they answered him the lord bless thee   most of you know the story of ruth from which my text is taken and you have thought it no doubt a pretty story  but did you ever think why it was in the bible  every book in the bible is meant to teach us as the article of our church says something necessary to salvation  but what is there necessary to our salvation in the book of ruth  no doubt we learn from it that ruth was the ancestress of king david and that she was therefore an ancestress of our blessed lord jesus christ  but curious and interesting as that is we can hardly call that something necessary to salvation  there must be something more in the book  let us take it simply as it stands and see if we can find it out  it begins by telling us how a man of bethlehem has been driven out of his own country by a famine he and his wife naomi and his two sons and has gone over the border into moab among the heathen how his two sons have married heathen women and the name of the one was ruth and the name of the other orpah  then how he dies and his two sons and how naomi his widow hears that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread how the people of judah were prosperous again and she is there all alone among the heathen so she sets out to go back to her own people and her daughtersinlaw go with her  but she persuades them not to go  why do they not stay in their own land  and they weep over each other and orpah kisses her motherin law and goes back but ruth cleaves unto her  then follows that famous speech of ruths which for its simple beauty and poetry has become a proverb and even a song among us to this day  and ruth said intreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee  for whither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge  thy people shall be my people and thy god my god  where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried  the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and me  so when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go to her she left speaking to her  and they come to bethlehem and all the town was moved about them and they said is this naomi  and she said unto them call me not naomi call me mara  for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me  i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty  why then call ye me naomi seeing the lord hath testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me  and they came to bethlehem about the passover tide at the beginning of barley harvest and ruth went out into the fields to glean and she lighted on a part of the field which belonged to boaz who was of her husbands kindred  and boaz was a mighty man of wealth according to the simple fashions of that old land and old time  not like one of our great modern noblemen or merchants but rather like one of our wealthy yeomen  a man who would not disdain to work in his field with his own slaves after the wholesome fashion of those old times when a royal prince and mighty warrior would sow the corn with his own hands while his man opened the furrow with the plough before him  there boaz dwelt with other yeomen up among the limestone hills in the little walled village of bethlehem which was afterwards to become so famous and so holy and had we may suppose his vineyard and his olivegarden on the rocky slopes and his cornfields in the vale below and his flock of sheep and goats feeding on the downs while all his wealth besides lay probably after the eastern fashion in one great chest full of rich dresses and gold and silver ornaments and coins all foreign got in exchange for his corn and wine and oil from assyrian or egyptian or phoenician traders for the jews then had no money and very little manufacture of their own  and he would have had hired servants too and slaves in his house treated kindly enough as members of the family eating and drinking at his table and faring nearly as well as he fared himself  a stately godfearing man he plainly was respectable courteous and upright and altogether worthy of his wealth and he went out into the field looking after his reapers in the barley harvest about our eastertide  and he said to his reapers the lord be with you  and they answered the lord bless thee  then he saw ruth who had happened to light upon his field gleaning after the reapers and found out who she was and bid her glean without fear and abide by his maidens for he had charged the young men that they shall not touch her  and boaz said unto her at mealtime come thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar  and she sat beside the reapers  and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left  and when she was risen up to glean boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not  so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she had gleaned  and it was about an ephah of barley  then follows the simple story after the simple fashion of those days  how naomi bids ruth wash and anoint herself and put on her best garments and go down to boaz floor his barn as we should call it now where he is going to eat and drink and sleep and there claim his protection as a near kinsman  and how ruth comes in softly and lies down at his feet and how he treats her honourably and courteously and promises to protect her but there is a nearer kinsman than he and he must be asked first if he will do the kinsmans part and buy his cousins plot of land and marry his cousins widow with it  and how boaz goes to the towngate next day and sits down in the gate for the porch of the gate was a sort of townhall or vestry room in the east wherein all sorts of business was done and there he challenges the kinsmanwill he buy the ground and marry ruth and he will not  he cannot afford it  then boaz calls all the town to witness that day that he has bought all that was elimelechs and ruth the moabitess to be his wife  and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we are witnesses  the lord make the woman that is come into thine house like rachel and like leah which two did build the house of israel and do thou worthily in ephratah and be famous in bethlehem  and in due time ruth had a son  and the women said unto naomi blessed be the lord which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman that his name may be famous in israel  and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age  for thy daughterinlaw which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons hath born him  and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became nurse unto it  and the women her neighbours gave it a name saying there is a son born to naomi and they called his name obed  he is the father of jesse the father of david  and so ends the book of ruth  now my friends can you not answer for yourselves the question which i asked at firstwhy is the story of ruth in the bible and what may we learn from it which is necessary for our salvation  i think at least that you will be able to answer itif not in words still in your heartsif you will read the book for yourselves  for does it not consecrate to god that simple country life which we lead here  does it not tell us that it is blessed in the sight of him who makes the grass to grow and the corn to ripen in its season  does it not tell us that not only on the city and the palace on the cathedral and the college on the assemblies of statesmen on the studies of scholars but upon the meadow and the cornfield the farmhouse and the cottage is written by the everlasting finger of godholiness unto the lord  that it is all blessed in his sight that the simple dwellers in villages the simple tillers of the ground can be as godly and as pious as virtuous and as highminded as those who have nought to do but to serve god in the offices of religion  is it not an honour and a comfort to such as us to find one whole book of the holy bible occupied by the simplest story of the fortunes of a yeomans family in a lonely village among the hills of judah  true the yeomans widow became the ancestress of david and of his mighty line of kingsnay the ancestress of our lord jesus christ himself  but the book of ruth was not written mainly to tell us that fact  it mentions it at the end and as it were by accident  the book itself is taken up with the most simple and careful details of country life country customs country folk as if that was what we were to think of as we read of ruth  and that is what we do think ofnot of the ancestress of kings but of the fair young heathen gleaning among the corn with the pious courteous highminded yeoman bidding her abide fast by his maidens and when she was athirst drink of the wine which the young men have drawn for it has been fully showed him all she has done for her motherinlaw and the lord will recompense her work and a full reward be given her of the lord god of israel under the shadow of whose wings she is to come to trust  that is the scene which painters naturally draw that is what we naturally think of because god who gave us the bible meant us to think thereof and to know that working in the quiet village or in the distant field women may be as pure and modest men as highminded and wellbred and both as full of the fear of god and the thought that gods eye is upon them as if they were in a place or a station where they had nothing to do but to watch over the salvation of their own souls that the meadow and the harvestfield need not be as they too often are places for temptation and for defilement where the old too often teach the young not to fear god and keep themselves pure but to copy their coarse jests and foul language and listen to stories which had better be buried for ever in the dirt out of which they spring  you know what i mean  you know what fieldwork too often is  read the book of ruth and see what fieldwork may be and ought to be  yes my dear friends  pure you may be and gentle upright and godly about your daily work if the spirit of god be within you  country life has its temptations  and so has town life and every life  but there has no temptation taken you save such as is common to man  boaz the rich yeoman naomi the brokenhearted and ruined ruth the fair young widowall had the very same temptations as are common to you now here but they conquered them because they feared god and kept his commandments and to know that is necessary for your salvation  and looked at in this light the book of ruth is indeed a prophecy a forecast and a shadow of the teaching of the lord jesus himself who spake to country folk as never man spake before and bade them look upon the simple everyday matters which were around them in field and wood and open their eyes to the divine lessons of gods providence which also were all around them who born himself in that little village of bethlehem and brought up in the little village of nazareth among the lonely lanes and downs spoke of country things to country folk and bade them read in the great green book which god has laid open before them all day long  who bade them to consider the lilies of the field how they grew and the ravens how god fed them to look on the fields white for harvest and pray god to send labourers into his spiritual harvestfield to look on the tares which grew among the wheat and know we must not try to part them ourselves but leave that to god at the last day to look on the fishers who were casting their net into the lake of galilee and sorting the fish upon the shore and be sure that a day was coming when god would separate the good from the bad and judge every man according to his work and worth and to learn from the common things of country life the rule of the living god and the laws of the kingdom of heaven  one word more and i have done  the story of ruth is also the consecration of womans love  i do not mean of the love of wife to husband divine and blessed as that is i mean that depth and strength of devotion tenderness and self sacrifice which god has put in the heart of all true women and which they spend so strangely and so nobly often on persons who have no claim on them from whom they can receive no earthly reward the affection which made women minister of their substance to our lord jesus christ which brought mary magdalene to the foot of the cross and to the door of the tomb that she might at least see the last of him whom she thought lost to her for ever the affection which has made a wise man say that as long as women and sorrow are left in the world so long will the gospel of our lord jesus live and conquer therein the affection which makes women round us every day ministering angels wherever help or comfort are needed which makes many a woman do deeds of unselfish goodness known only to god not known even to herself for she does them by instinct by the inspiration of gods spirit without selfconsciousness or pride without knowing what noble things she is doing without spoiling the beauty of her good work by even admitting to herself what a good work it is  how right she is in doing it  how much it will advance the salvation of her own soulbut thinking herself perhaps a very useless and paltry person while the angels of god are claiming her as their sister and their peer  yes if there is a woman in this congregationand there is one i will warrant in every congregation in englandwho is devoting herself for the good of others giving up the joys of life to take care of orphans who have no legal claim on her or to nurse a relation who perhaps repays her with little but exacting peevishness or who has spent all her savings in bringing up her brothers or in supporting her parents in their old agethen let her read the story of ruth and be sure that like ruth she will be repaid by the lord  her reward may not be the same as ruths  but it will be that which is best for her and she shall in no wise lose her reward  if she has given up all for christ it shall be repaid her tenfold in this life and in the world to come life everlasting if with ruth she is true to the inspirations of gods spirit then with ruth god will be true to her  let her endure for in due time she shall reap if she faint notand to know that is necessary for her salvation    sermon xi  solomon    ecclesiastes i 1214  i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem  and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven  this sore travail hath god given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith  i have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit   all have heard of solomon the wise  his name has become a proverb among men  it was still more a proverb among the old rabbis the lawyers and scribes of the gospels  their hero the man of whom they delighted to talk and dream was not david the psalmist and the shepherdboy the man of many wanderings and many sorrows  but his son solomon with all his wealth and pomp and magic wisdom  ever since our lords time if not before it solomon has been the national hero of the jews while david as the truer type and pattern of the lord jesus christ has been the hero of christians  the rabbis with their eastern fancychildishly fond to this day of gold and jewels and outward pomp and showwould talk and dream of the lost glories of solomons court of his gilded and jewelled temple with its pillars of sandalwood from ophir and its sea of molten brass of his ivory lionthrone and his three hundred golden shields of his fleets which went away into the far indian sea and came back after three years with foreign riches and curious beasts and as if that had not been enough they delighted to add to the truth fable upon fable  the jews after the time of the babylonish captivity seem to have more and more identified wisdom with mere magic and therefore solomon was in their eyes the master of all magicians  he knew the secrets of the stars and of the elements the secrets of all charms and spells  by virtue of his magic seal he had power over all those evil spirits with which the jews believed the earth and sky to be filled  he could command all spirits force them to appear to him and bow before him and send them to the ends of the earth to do his bidding  nothing so fantastic nothing so impossible but those old scribes and pharisees imputed it to their idol solomon the wise  the bible of course has no such fancies in it and gives us a sober and rational account of solomons wisdom and of solomons greatness  it tells us how when he was yet young god appeared to him in a dream and said ask what i shall give thee  and solomon made answer       o lord my god thou hast made thy servant king instead of david my father and i am but a little child  i know not how to go out or come in  give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad  for who is able to judge this thy so great a people  and the speech pleased the lord that solomon had asked this thing  and god said unto him because thou hast asked this thing and hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment  behold i have done according to thy words  lo i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee  and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked both riches and honour  so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days  and the promise says solomon himself was fulfilled  in his days judah and israel were many as the sand which is by the seashore for multitude eating and drinking and making merry and solomon reigned over all kings from the river to the land of the philistines and the border of egypt and they brought presents and served solomon all the days of his life  and he had peace on all sides round about him  and judah and israel dwelt safely every man under his own vine and his own figtree all the days of solomon  i was great he says and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me  and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not from them i withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labour     then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labour that i had laboured to do  and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sun  and i turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly  for what can the man do that cometh after the king even that which hath been already done  yes my dear friends we are too apt to think of exceeding riches or wisdom or power or glory as unalloyed blessings from god  how many are there who would sayif it were not happily impossible for themoh that i were like solomon  happy man that he was to be able to say of himself i was great and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem  and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not from them i withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labour  to have everything that he wanted to be able to do anything that he likedwas he not a happy man  is not such a life a paradise on earth  yes my friends it is  but it is the paradise of fools  yet solomon was not a fool  he says expressly that his wisdom remained with him through all his labour  through all his pleasure he kept alive the longing after knowledge  he even tried as he says wine and mirth and folly yet acquainting himself with wisdom  he would try that as well as statesmanship and the rule of a great kingdom and the building of temples and palaces and the planting of parks and gardens and his three thousand proverbs and his songs a thousand and five and his speech of beasts and of birds and of all plants from the cedar in lebanon to the hyssop which groweth on the wall  he would know everything and try everything if he was luxurious and proud he would be no idler no useless gay liver  he would work and discern and knowand at last he found it all out and this was the sum thereofvanity of vanities saith the preacher all is vanity  he found no rest in pleasure riches power glory wisdom itself he had learnt nothing more after all than he might have known and doubtless did know when he was a child of seven years old  and that was simply to fear god and keep his commandments for that was the whole duty of man  but though he knew it he had lost the power of doing it and he ended darkly and shamefully a dotard worshipping idols of wood and stone among his heathen queens  and thus as in david the height of chivalry fell to the deepest baseness so in solomon the height of wisdom fell to the deepest folly  my friends the truth is that exceeding gifts from god like solomons are not blessings they are duties and very solemn and heavy duties  they do not increase a mans happiness they only increase his responsibilitythe awful account which he must give at last of the talents committed to his charge  they increase too his danger  they increase the chance of his having his head turned to pride and pleasure and falling shamefully and coming to a miserable end  as with david so with solomon  man is nothing and god is all in all  and as with david and solomon so with many a king and many a great man  consider those who have been great and glorious in their day and in how many cases they have ended sadly  the burden of glory has been too heavy for them to bear they have broken down under it  the great charles the fifth emperor of germany and king of spain and all the indies  our own great queen elizabeth who found england all but ruined and left her strong and rich glorious and terrible lord bacon the wisest of all mortal men since the time of solomon and in our own fathers time napoleon buonaparte the poor young officer who rose to be the conqueror of half europe and literally the king of kingshow have they all ended  in sadness and darkness vanity and vexation of spirit  oh my friends if ever proud and ambitious thoughts arise in any of our hearts let us crush them down till we can say with david lord my heart is not haughty nor mine eyes lofty neither do i exercise myself in great matters or in things too high for me  surely i have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother my soul is even as a weaned child  and if ever idle and luxurious thoughts arise in our hearts and we are tempted to say soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry let us hear the word of the lord crying against us  thou fool  this night shall thy soul be required of thee  then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided  let us pray my friends for that greati had almost said that crowning grace and virtue of moderation what st paul calls sobriety and a sound mind  let us pray for moderate appetites moderate passions moderate honours moderate gains moderate joys and if sorrows be needed to chasten us moderate sorrows  let us long violently after nothing or wish too eagerly to rise in life and be sure that what the apostle says of those who long to be rich is equally true of those who long to be famous or powerful or in any way to rise over the heads of their fellowmen  they all fall as the apostle says into foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition and so pierce themselves through with many sorrows  and let us thank god heartily if he has put us into circumstances which do not tempt us to wild and vain hopes of becoming rich or great or admired by men  especially let us thank him for this quiet country life which we lead here free from ambition and rash speculation and the hope of great and sudden gains  all know who have watched the world how unwholesome for a mans soul any trade or occupation is which offers the chance of making a rapid fortune  it has hurt the souls of too many merchants and manufacturers ere now  good and soberminded men there are among them thank god who can resist the temptation and are content to go along the plain path of quiet and patient honesty but to those who have not the sober spirit who have not the fear of god before their eyes the temptation is too terrible to withstand and it is not withstood and therefore the columns of our newspapers are so often filled with sad cases of bankruptcy forgery extravagant and desperate trading bubble fortunes spent in a few years of vain show and luxury and ending in poverty and shame  happy on the other hand are those who till the ground who never can rise high enough or suddenly enough to turn their heads whose gains are never great and quick enough to tempt them to wild speculation  but who can if they will only do their duty patiently and well go on year after year in quiet prosperity and be content to offer up week by week agurs wise prayer  give me neither poverty nor riches but feed me with food sufficient for me  they need never complain that they have no time to think of their own souls that the hurry and bustle of business must needs drive religion out of their minds  their life passes in a quiet round of labours  day after day week after week season after season they know beforehand what they have to do and can arrange their affairs for this world so as to give them full time to think of the world to come  every week brings small gains for which they can thank the god of all plenty and every week brings too small anxieties for which they can trust the same god who has given them his only begotten son and will with him freely give them all things needful for them who has in mercy to their souls and bodies put them in the healthiest and usefullest of all pursuits the one which ought to lead their minds most to god and the one in which if they be thoughtful men they have the deep satisfaction of feeling that they are not working for themselves only but for their fellowmen that every sheaf of corn they grow is a blessing not merely to themselves but to the whole nation  my friends think of these things especially at this rich and blessed harvesttime and while you thank your god and your saviour for his unexampled bounty in this years good harvest do not forget to thank him for having given the sowing and the reaping of those crops to you and for having called you to that business in life in which i verily believe you will find it most easy to serve and obey him and be least tempted to ambition and speculation and the lust of riches and the pride which goes before a fall  think of these things and think of the exceeding mercies which god heaps on you as englishmenpeace and safety freedom and just laws the knowledge of his bible the teaching of his church and all that man needs for body and soul  let those who have thanked god already thank him still more earnestly and show their thankfulness not only in their lips but in their lives and let those who have not thanked him awake and learn as st paul bids them from gods own witness of himself in that he has sent them fruitful seasons filling their hearts with food and gladness let them learn i say from that that they have a father in heaven who has given them his only begotten son and will with him freely give them all things needful only asking in return that they should obey his lawsto obey which is everlasting life    sermon xii  progress preached before the queen at clifden june 3 1866    ecclesiastes vii 10  say not thou what is the cause that the former days were better than these for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this   this text occurs in the book of ecclesiastes which has been for many centuries generally attributed to solomon the son of david  i say generally because not only among later critics but even among the ancient jewish rabbis there have been those who doubted or denied that solomon was its author  i cannot presume to decide on such a question  but it seems to me most probable that the old tradition is right even though the book may have suffered alterations both in form and in language  but any later author personating solomon would surely have put into his month very different words from those of ecclesiastes  solomon was the ideal heroking of the later jews  stories of his superhuman wealth of magical power of a fabulous extent of dominion grew up about his name  he who was said to control by means of his wondrous seal the genii of earth and air would scarcely have been represented as a disappointed and brokenhearted sage who pronounced all human labour to be vanity and vexation of spirit who saw but one event for the righteous and the wicked and the wise man and the fool and questioned bitterly whether there was any future state any preeminence in man over the brute  these and other startling utterances made certain of the early rabbis doubt the authenticity and inspiration of the book of ecclesiastes as containing things contrary to the law and to desire its suppression till they discovered in itas we may if we be wisea weighty and worldwide meaning  be that as it may it would certainly be a loss to scripture and to our knowledge of humanity if it was proved that this book in its original shape was not written by a great king and most probably by solomon himself  the book gains by that fact not only in its reality and truthfulness but in its value and importance as a lesson of human life  especially does this text gain for it has a natural and deep connection with solomon and his times  the former days were better than his days  he could not help seeing that they were  he must have feared lest the generation which was springing up should inquire into the reason thereof in a tone which would breedwhich actually did breeddiscontent and revolution  but the fact seemed at first sight patent  the old heroic days of samuel and david were past  the jewish race no longer produced such men as saul and jonathan as joab and abner  a generation of great men whose names are immortal had died out and a generation of inferior men of whom hardly one name has come down to us had succeeded them  the nation had lost its primaeval freedom and the courage and loyalty which freedom gives  it had become rich and enervated by luxury and ease  solomon had civilised the jewish kingdom till it had become one of the greatest nations of the east but it had become also like the other nations of the east a vast and gaudy despotism hollow and rotten to the core ready to fall to pieces at solomons death by selfishness disloyalty and civil war therefore it was that solomon hated all his labour that he had wrought under the sun for all was vanity and vexation of spirit  such were the facts  and yet it was not wise to look at them too closely not wise to inquire why the former times were better than those  so it was  let it alone  pry not too curiously into the past or into the future  but do the duty which lies nearest to thee  fear god and keep his commandments  for that is the whole duty of man  thus does solomon lament over the certain decay of the jewish empire and his words however sad are indeed eternal and inspired  for they have proved true and will prove true to the end of every despotism of the east or empire formed on eastern principles of the old persian empire of the roman of the byzantine of those of hairoun alraschid and of aurungzebe of those turkish and chinese tartar empires whose dominion is decaying before our very eyes  of all these the wise mans words are true  they are vanity and vexation of spirit  that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numbered  the thing which has been is that which shall be and there is no new thing under the sun incapacity of progress the same outward civilization repeating itself again and again the same intrinsic certainty of decay and deaththese are the marks of all empire which is not founded on that foundation which is laid even jesus christ  but of christian nations these words are not true  they pronounce the doom of the old world  but the new world has no part in them unless it copies the sins and follies of the old  it is not true of christian nations that the thing which has been is that which shall be and that there is no new thing under the sun for over them is the kingdom of christ the saviour of all men specially of them which believe the king of all the princes of the earth who has always asserted and will for ever assert his own overruling dominion  and in them is the spirit of god which is the spirit of truth and righteousness of improvement discovery progress from darkness to light from folly to wisdom from barbarism to justice and mercy and the true civilization of the heart and spirit  and therefore for us it is not only an act of prudence but a duty a duty of faith in god a duty of loyalty to jesus christ our lord not to ask why the former times were better than these  for they were not better than these  every age has had its own special nobleness its own special use  but every age has been better than the age which went before it for the spirit of god is leading the ages on toward that whereof it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive the things which god hath prepared for those that love him  very unfaithful are we to the teaching of gods spirit many and heavy are our sins against light and knowledge and means and opportunities of grace  but let us not add to those sins the sin for such it is of inquiring why the former times were better than these  for first the inquiry shows disbelief in our lords own words that all dominion is given to him in heaven and earth and that he is with us always even to the end of the world  and next it is a vain inquiry based on a mistake  when we look back longingly to any past age we look not at the reality but at a sentimental and untrue picture of our own imagination  when we look back longingly to the socalled ages of faith to the personal loyalty of the old cavaliers when we regret that there are no more among us such giants in statesmanship and power as those who brought europe through the french revolution when we long that our lot was cast in any age beside our own we know not what we ask  the ages which seem so beautiful afar off would look to us were we in them uglier than our own  if we long to be back in those socalled devout ages of faith we long for an age in which witches and heretics were burned alive if we long after the chivalrous loyalty of the old cavaliers we long for an age in which stageplays were represented even before a virtuous monarch like charles i which the lowest of our playgoers would not now tolerate  when we long for anything that is past we long it may be for a little good which we seem to have lost but we long also for real and fearful evil which thanks be to god we have lost likewise  we are not indeed to fancy this age perfect and boast like some of the glorious nineteenth century  we are to keep our eyes open to all its sins and defects that we may amend them and we are to remember in fear and trembling that to us much is given and of us much is required  but we are to thank god that our lot is cast in an age which on the whole is better than any age whatsoever that has gone before it and to do our best that the age which is coming may be better even than this  we are neither to regret the past nor rest satisfied in the present but like st paul forgetting those things that are behind us and reaching onward to those things that are before us press forward each and all to the prize of our high calling in jesus christ  and as with nations and empires so with our own private lives  it is not wise to ask why the former times were better than these  it is natural pardonable  but not wise because we are so apt to mistake the subject about which we ask and when we say why were the old times better merely to mean why were the old times happier  that is not the question  there is something higher than happiness says a wise man  there is blessedness the blessedness of being good and doing good of being right and doing right  that blessedness we may have at all times we may be blest even in anxiety and in sadness we may be blest even as the martyrs of old were blestin agony and death  the times are to us whatsoever our character makes them  and if we are better men than we were in former times then is the present better than the past even though it be less happy  and why should it not be better  surely the spirit of god the spirit of progress and improvement is working in us the children of god as well as in the great world around surely the years ought to have made us better more useful more worthy  we may have been disappointed in our lofty ideas of what ought to be done  but we may have gained more clear and practical notions of what can be done  we may have lost in enthusiasm and yet gained in earnestness  we may have lost in sensibility yet gained in charity activity and power  we may be able to do far less and yet what we do may be far better done  and our very griefs and disappointmentshave they been useless to us  surely not  we shall have gained instead of lost by them if the spirit of god be working in us  our sorrows will have wrought in us patience our patience experience of gods sustaining grace who promises that as our day our strength shall be and of gods tender providence which tempers the wind to the shorn lamb and lays on none a burden beyond what they are able to bear  and that experience will have worked in us hope  hope that he who has led us thus far will lead us farther still that he who brought us through the trials of youth will bring us through the trials of age that he who taught us in former days precious lessons not only by sore temptations but most sacred joys will teach us in the days to come fresh lessons by temptations which we shall be more able to endure and by joys which though unlike those of old times are no less sacred no less sent as lessons to our souls by him from whom all good gifts come  we will believe this  and instead of inquiring why the former days were better than these we will trust that the coming days shall be better than these and those which are coming after them better still again because god is our father christ our saviour the holy ghost our comforter and guide  we will toil onward  because we know we are toiling upward  we will live in hope not in regret because hope is the only state of mind fit for a race for whom god has condescended to stoop and suffer and die and rise again  we will believe that we and all we love whether in earth or heaven are destinedif we be only true to gods spiritto rise improve progress for ever  and so we will claim our share and keep our place in that vast ascending and improving scale of being which as some dreamand surely not in vaingoes onward and upward for ever throughout the universe of him who wills that none should perish    sermon xiii  faith preached before the queen at windsor december 5 1865    habakkuk ii 4  the just shall live by his faith   we shall always find it most safe as well as most reverent to inquire first the literal and exact meaning of a text to see under what circumstances it was written what meaning it must have conveyed to those who heard it and so to judge what it must have meant in the mind of him who spoke it  if we do so we shall find that the simplest interpretation of scripture is generally the deepest and the most literal interpretation is also the most spiritual  let us examine the circumstances under which the prophet spake these words  it was on the eve of a chaldean invasion  the heathen were coming into judea as we see them still in the assyrian sculptures civilizing after their barbarous fashion the nations round them conquering massacring transporting whole populations building cities and temples by their forced labour and resistance or escape was impossible  the prophets faith fails him a moment  what is this but a triumph of evil  is there a divine providence  is there a just ruler of the world  and he breaks out into pathetic expostulation with god himself  wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he  and makest men as the fishes of the sea as the creeping things which have no ruler over them  they take up all of them with the line they gather them with the net  therefore they sacrifice unto their net and burn incense to their line for by it their portion is fat and their meat plenteous  shall they therefore empty their net and not spare to slay continually the nations  then the lord answers his doubts  behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him  but the just shall live by his faith  by his faith plainly in a just ruler of the worldin a god who avenges wrong and makes inquisition for innocent blood  he who will keep his faith in that just god will remain just himself  the sense of justice will be kept alive in him and the just will live by his faith  the prophet believes that message and a mighty change passes over his spirit  in a burst of magnificent poetry he proclaims woe to the unjust chaldean conqueror  all his greatness is a bubble which will burst a suicidal mistake which will work out its own punishment and make him a taunt and a mockery to all nations round woe to him who increaseth that which is not his and ladeth himself with thick clay  woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house that he may set his nest on high and be delivered from the power of evil  woe to him that buildeth a town with blood and stablisheth a city with iniquity  behold is it not of the lord of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity  there is a true civilization for man but not according to the unjust and cruel method of those chaldeans  the law of the true civilization the prophet says is this  the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea  but what is this to us  are we like the chaldeans  god forbid  but are we not tried by the same temptations to which they blindly yielded  a nation strong rich luxurious prosperous in industry at home and aggressive if not in theory certainly in practice to less civilized races abroadare we not tempted daily to that habit of mind which the prophet callswith that tremendous irony in which the hebrew prophets surpass all writerslooking on men as the fishes of the sea as the creeping things which have no ruler over them born to devour each other and be caught and devoured in their turn by a race more cunning than themselves  there are those among us in thousands thank god who nobly resist that temptation and they are the very salt of the land who keep it from decay  but for the many for the publicdo not too many of them believe that the law of human society is after all only that internecine conflict of interests that brute struggle for existence which naturalists tell us and truly is the law of life for mere plants and animals  are they not tempted to forget that men are not mere animals and things but persons that they have a ruler over them even god who desires to educate them to sanctify them to develop their every faculty that they may be his children and not merely our tools and do gods work in the world and not merely their employers work  are they notare we not alltempted too often to forget this  and then are we not tempted all of us to fall down like the chaldeans and worship our own net because by it our portion is fat and our meat plenteous  are we not tempted to say within ourselves this present system of things with all its anomalies and its defects still is the right system and the only system  it is the path pointed out by providence for man  it is of the lord for we are comfortable under it  we grow rich under it we keep rank and power under it  it suits us pays us  what better proof that it is the perfect system of things which cannot be amended  meanwhile we are sorry for the english are a kindhearted people for the victims of our luxury and our neglect  sorry for the thousands whom we let die every year by preventible diseases because we are either too busy or too comfortable to save their lives  sorry for the savages whom we exterminate by no deliberate evil intent but by the mere weight of our heavy footstep  sorry for the thousands who are usedup yearly in certain trades in ministering to our comfort even to our very luxuries and frivolities  sorry for the sheffield grinders who go to work as to certain death who count how many years they have left and say a short life and a merry one  let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die  sorry for the people whose lower jaws decay away in lucifermatch factories  sorry for all the miseries and wrongs which this childrens employment commission has revealed  sorry for the diseases of artificial flowermakers  sorry for the boys working in glasshouses whole days and nights on end without rest labouring in the very fire and wearying themselves with very vanityvanity indeed if after an amount of gallant toil which nothing but the indomitable courage of an englishman could endure they grow up animals and heathens  we are sorry for them allas the giant is for the worm on which he treads  alas poor worm  but the giant must walk on  he is necessary to the universe and the worm is not  so we are sorryfor half an hour and glad too for we are a kindhearted people to hear that charitable persons or the government are going to do something towards alleviating these miseries  and then we return too many of us each to his own ambition or to his own luxury comforting ourselves with the thought that we did not make the world and we are not responsible for it  how shall we conquer this temptation to laziness selfishness heartlessness  by faith in god such as the prophet had  by faith in god as the eternal enemy of evil the eternal helper of those who try to overcome evil with good the eternal avenger of all the wrong which is done on earth  by faith in god as not only our father our saviour our redeemer our protector  but the father saviour redeemer protector and if need be avenger of every human being by faith in god which believes that his infinite heart yearns over every human soul even the basest and the worst that he wills that not one little one should perish but that all should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth  we must believe that if we wish that it should be true of us that the just shall live by his faith  if we wish our faith to keep us just men leading just lives we must believe that god is just and that he shows his justice by the only possible methodby doing justice sooner or later for all who are unjustly used  if we lose that faith we shall be in dangerin more than dangerof becoming unjust ourselves  as we fancy god to be so shall we become ourselves  if we believe that god cares little for mankind we shall care less and less for them ourselves  if we believe that god neglects them we shall neglect them likewise  and then the sense of justicejustice for its own sake justice as the likeness and will of godwill die out in us and our souls will surely not live but die  for there will die out in our hearts just the most noble and god like feelings which god has put into them  the instinct of chivalry horror of cruelty and injustice pity for the weak and illused the longing to set right whatever is wrong and what is even more important the spirit of godly fear of wholesome terror of gods wrath which makes us say when we hear of any great and general sin among us if we do not do our best to set this right then god who does not make men like creeping things will take the matter into his own hands and punish us easy luxurious people for allowing such things to be done  and when a man loses that spirit of chivalry he loses his own soul for that spirit of chivalry let worldlings say what they will is the very spirit of our spirit the salt which keeps our characters from utter decaythe very instinct which raises us above the selfishness of the brute  yea it is the spirit of god himself  for what is the feeling of horror at wrong of pity for the wronged of burning desire to set wrong right save the spirit of the father and the son the spirit which brought down the lord jesus out of the highest heaven to stoop to serve to suffer and to die that he might seek and save that which was lost  some say that the age of chivalry is past  that the spirit of romance is dead  the age of chivalry is never past as long as there is a wrong left unredressed on earth and a man or woman left to say i will redress that wrong or spend my life in the attempt  the age of chivalry is never past as long as men have faith enough in god to say god will help me to redress that wrong or if not me surely he will help those that come after me  for his eternal will is to overcome evil with good  the spirit of romance will never die as long as there is a man left to see that the world might and can be better happier wiser fairer in all things than it is now  the spirit of romance will never die as long as a man has faith in god to believe that the world will actually be better and fairer than it is now as long as men have faith however weak to believe in the romance of all romances in the wonder of all wonders in that of which all poets dreams have been but childish hints and dumb forefeelingseven   that one faroff divine event towards which the whole creation moves   that wonder of which prophets and apostles have told each according to his light that wonder which habakkuk saw afar off and foretold how that the earth should be filled with the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea that wonder which isaiah saw afar off and sang how the lord should judge among the nations and rebuke among many people and they should beat their swords into plough shares and their spears into pruninghooks nation should not rise against nation neither should they learn war any more that wonder of which st paul prophesied and said that christ should reign till he had put all his enemies under his feet that wonder of which st john prophesied and said i saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven  and the nations of them that are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth bring their glory and their honour unto it that wonder finally which our lord himself bade us pray for as for our daily bread and say father thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven  thy will be done on earth  he who bade us ask that boon for generations yet unborn was very god of very god  do you think that he would have bidden us ask a blessing which he knew would never come    sermon xiv  the great commandment    matt xxii 37 32  thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind  this is the first and great commandment   some say when they hear thisit is a hard saying  who can bear it  who can expect us to do as much as that  if we are asked to be respectable and sober to live and let live not to harm our neighbours wilfully or spitefully and to come to church tolerably regularlywe understand being asked to do thatit is fair  but to love the lord our god with all our hearts  that must be meant only for very great saints for a few exceedingly devout people here and there  and devout people have been too apt to sayyou are right it is we who are to love god with all our hearts and souls and give up the world and marriage and all the joys of life and turn priests monks and nuns while you need only be tolerably respectable and attend to your religious duties from time to time while we will pray for you  but my friends if we read our bibles we cannot allow that  thou shalt love the lord thy god was spoken not to monks and nuns for there were none in those days not to great saints only for we read of none just then not even to priests and clergymen only  it was said to all the jews high and low free and slave soldier and labourer alikethou a man living in the world and doing work in the world with wife and family farm and cattle horse to ride and weapon to wearthou shalt love the lord thy god  and therefore these words are said to you and me  we english are neither monks nor nuns nor likely thank god to become so  we are in the world with our own family ties and duties our own worldly business  and to us to you and me as to those old jews the first and great commandment is thou shalt love the lord thy god  what then does it mean  does it mean that we are to have the same love toward god as we have toward a wife or a husband  certainly not  but it means at least thisthe love which we should bear toward a father  all my friends turns on this  do you look on god as your father or do you not  god is your father remember already  you cannot as some people seem to think make him your father by believing that he is one and you need not thanks to his mercy  neither can you make him not your father by forgetting him be you wise or foolish right or wrong god is your father in heaven and you ought to feel towards him as towards a father not with any sentimental fanciful fanatical affection but with a reverent solemn and rational affection such as that which the good old catechism bids us have when it tells us our duty toward god  my duty towards god is to believe in him to fear him and to love him with all my heart with all my mind with all my soul and with all my strength to worship him to give him thanks to put my whole trust in him to call upon him to honour his holy name and his word and to serve him truly all the days of my life  now i ask youand what i ask you i ask myselfdo we love the lord our god thus  and if not why not  i do not ask you to tell me  i am not going to tell you what is in my heart and i do not ask you to tell me what is in yours  we are free englishmen who keep ourselves to ourselves and think for ourselves each man in the depths of his own heart and who are the stronger and the wiser for not talking about our feelings to any man priest or layman  but ask yourselves each of youdo i love god  and if not why not  there are two reasons i believe which are alas very common  for one of them there are great excuses for the other there is no excuse whatsoever  in the first place too many find it difficult to love god because they have not been taught that god is loveable and worthy of their love  they have been taught dark and hard doctrines which have made them afraid of god  they have been taughttoo many are taught stillnot merely that god will punish the wicked but that god will punish ninetenths or ninetyninehundredths of the human race  that he will send to endless torments not merely sinners who have rebelled against what they knew was right and his command who have stained themselves with crimes who wilfully injured their fellowcreatures  but that he will do the same by little children by innocent young girls by honourable respectable moral men and women because they are not what is called sensibly converted or else what is called orthodox they have been taught to look on god not as a loving and merciful father but as a tyrant and a taskmaster who watches to set down against them the slightest mishap or neglect who is extreme to mark what is done amiss who wills the death of a sinner  often strangest notion of allthey have been told that though god intends to punish them they must still love him or they will be punished as if such a notion so far from drawing them to god could do anything but drive them from him  and it is no wonder if persons who have been taught in their youth such notions concerning god find it difficult to love him  who can be frightened or threatened into loving any being  how can we love any being who does not seem to us kind merciful amiable loving  our love must be called out by gods love  if we are to love god it must be because he has first loved us  but he has first loved us my friends  the dark and cruel notions about godwhich are too common and have been too common in all agesare not what the world about us teaches nor what scripture teaches us either  look out on the world around you  what witness does it bear concerning the god who made it  who made the sunshine and the flowers and singing birds and little children and all that causes the joy of this life  let christ himself speak and his apostles no one can say that their words are not true that they were mistaken in their view of this earth or of god who gave it to us that it might bear witness of him  what said our lord to the poor folk of galilee of whom the scribes and the pharisees in their pride said this people who knoweth not the law is accursedwhat said our lord very god of very god  he told them to look on the world around and learn from it that they had in heaven not a tyrant not a destroyer but a father a father in heaven who is perfect in this that he causeth his sun to shine upon them and is good to the unthankful and the evil  what of him did st paul sayand that not to christians but to heathensthat god had not left himself without a witness even to the heathen who knew him notand what sort of witness  the witness of his bounty and goodness  the simple but perpetual witness of the yearly harvestin that he sends men rain and fruitful seasons filling their hearts with food and gladness  this is st pauls witness  and what is st jamess  he tells men of a father of lights from whom comes down every good and perfect gift who gives to all liberally and upbraideth not grudges not stints not but gives and delights in givingthe same god in a word of whom the old psalmists and prophets spoke and said thou openest thine hand and fillest all things with good  and if natural religion tells us thus much and bears witness of a father who delights in the happiness of his creatures what does revealed religion and the gospel of jesus christ tell us  oh my friends dull indeed must be our hearts if we can feel no love for the god of whom the gospel speaks  and perverse indeed must be our minds if we can twist the good news of christs salvation into the bad news of condemnation  what says st paulthat god is against us  no  butif god be for us who can be against us  who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect  it is god that justifieth  who is he that condemneth  it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for as  who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword  as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter  nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us  for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord  what says st john  does he say that god the father desires to punish or slay us and that our lord jesus christ or the virgin mary or the saints or any other being loves us better than god and will deliver us out of the hands of god  god forbid  we have known and believed he says the love that god hath to us  god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him  my friends if we could believe those blessed wordsi do not say in all their fulnesswe shall never do that i believe in this mortal lifebut if we could only believe them a little and know and believe even a little of the love that god has to us then love to him would spring up in our hearts and we should feel for him all that child ever felt for father  if we really believed that god who made heaven and earth was even now calling to each and every one of us and beseeching us by the sacrifice of his wellbeloved son crucified for us my son give me thy heart we could not help giving up our hearts to him  providedand there is that second reason why people do not love god for which i said there was no excuseprovided only that we wish to be good and to obey god  if we do not wish to do what god commands we shall never love god  it must be so  there can be no real love of god which is not based upon a love of virtue and goodness upon what our lord calls a hunger and thirst after righteousness  if ye love me keep my commandments is our lords own rule and test  and it is the only one possible  if we habitually disobey any person we shall cease to love that person  if a child is in the habit of disobeying its parents dark and angry feelings towards those parents are sure to arise in its heart  the child tries to forget its parents to keep out of their way  it tries to justify itself to excuse itself by fancying that its parents are hard upon it unjust grudge it pleasure or what not  if its parents commandments are grievous to a child it will try to make out that those commandments are unfair and unkind  and so shall we do by gods commandments  if gods commandments seem too grievous for us to obey then we shall begin to fancy them unjust and unkind  and then farewell to any real love to god  if we do not openly rebel against god we shall still try to forget him  the thought of god will seem dark unpleasant and forbidding to us and we shall try in our short sighted folly to live as far as we can without god in the world and like adam after his fall hide ourselves from the loving god just because we know we have disobeyed him  but if in spite of many bad habits we desire to get rid of our bad habits if in spite of many faults we still desire to be faultless and perfect if in spite of many weaknesses we still desire to be strong if in one word we still hunger and thirst after righteousness and long to be good men then in due time the love of god will be shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit  for that will happen to us which happens to all those who have the pure true and heroical love  if we really love a person we shall first desire to please them and therefore the thought of disobeying and paining them will seem more and more grievous unto us  but more  we shall soon rise a step higher  the more we love them and the more we see in them in their characters things worthy to be loved the more we shall desire to be like them to copy those parts of their characters which most delight us and we shall copy them though insensibly perhaps and unawares  for no one can look up for any length of time with love and respect towards a person better wiser greater than themselves without becoming more or less like that person in character and in habit of thought and feeling and so it will be with us towards god  if we really long to be good it will grow more and more easy to us to love god  the more pure our hearts are the more pleasant the thought of god will be to us even as it is said blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see godin this life as well as in the life to come  we shall not shrink from god because we shall know that we are not wilfully offending him  but more  the more we think of god the more we shall long to be like him  how admirable in our eyes will seem his goodness how admirable his purity his justice and his bounty his long suffering his magnanimity and greatness of heart  for how great must be that heart of god of which it is written that he hateth nothing that he hath made but his mercy is over all his works that he willeth that none should perish but that all should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth  although he be infinitely high and far off and we cannot attain to him yet we shall feel it our duty and our joy to copy him however faintly and however humbly and our highest hope will be that we may behold as in a glass the glory of the lord and be changed into his image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord that so whether in this world or in the world to come we may at last be perfect even as our father in heaven is perfect and like him cause the sunlight of our love to slime upon the evil and on the good the kindly showers of our good deeds to fall upon the just and on the unjust andlike him who sent his only begotten son to save the worldbe good to the unthankful and to the evil    sermon xv  the earthquake preached october 11 1863    psalm xlvi 1 2  god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea   no one my friends wishes less than i to frighten you or to take a dark and gloomy view of this world or of gods dealings with men but when god himself speaks men are bound to take heed even though the message be an awful one  and last weeks earthquake was an awful message reminding all reasonable souls how frail man is how frail his strongest works how frail this seemingly solid earth on which we stand what a thin crust there is between us and the nether fires how utterly it depends on gods mercy that we do not like korah dathan and abiram of old go down alive into the pit  what do we know of earthquakes  we know that they are connected with burning mountains that the eruption of a burning mountain is generally preceded by and accompanied with violent earthquakes indeed the burning mountains seem to be outlets by which the earthquake force is carried off  we know that these burning mountains give out immense volumes of steam  we know that the expanding power of steam is by far the strongest force in the world and therefore it is supposed reasonably that earthquakes are caused by steam underground  we know concerning earthquakes two things  first that they are quite uncertain in their effects secondly quite uncertain in their occurrence  no one can tell what harm an earthquake will or will not do  there are three kinds  one which raises the ground up perpendicularly and sets it down againwhich is the least hurtful one which sets it rolling in waves like the waves of the seawhich is more hurtful and one the most terrible of all which gives the ground a spinning motion so that things thrown down by it fall twisted from right to left or left to right  but what kind of earthquake will take place no one can tell  moreover a very slight earthquake may do fearful damage  people who only read of them fancy that an earthquake to destroy man and his works must literally turn the earth upside down that the ground must open swallowing up houses vomiting fire and water that rocks must be cast into the sea and hills rise where valleys were before such awful things have happened and will happen again  but it does not need them to lay a land utterly waste  a very slight shocka shock only a little stronger than was felt last wednesday morning might haveone hardly dare think of what it might have done in a country like this where houses are thinly built because we have no fear of earthquakes  every manufactory and mill throughout the iron districts where the shock was felt most might have toppled to the earth in a moment  whole rows of houses hastily and thinly built might have crumbled down like packs of cards and hundreds of thousands of sleeping human beings might have been buried in the ruins without time for a prayer or a cry  a little morea very little moreand all that or more might have happened millions worth of property might have been destroyed in a few seconds and the prosperity and civilization of england have been thrown back for a whole generation  there is absolutely no reason whatever i tell you save the mercy of god why that or worse should not have happened and it is only of the lords mercies that we were not consumed  next earthquakes are utterly uncertain as to time  no one knows when they are coming  they give no warning  even in those unhappy countries in which they are most common there may not be a shock for months or years and then a sudden shock may hurl down whole towns or there may be many thirty or forty aday for weeks as there happened in a part of south america a few years ago when day after day week after week terrible shocks went on with a perpetual underground roar as if brass and iron were crashing and clanging under the feet till the people were half mad with the continual noise and continual anxiety expecting every moment one shock stronger than the rest to swallow them up  it is impossible i say to calculate when they will come  they are altogether in the hand of godhis messengers whose time and place he alone knows and he alone directs  our having had one last week is no reason for our not having another this week or any day this week and no reason happily against our having no more for one hundred years  it is in gods hands and in gods hands we must leave it  all we can say is that when one comes it is likely to be least severe in this part of england and most severe like this last in the coal and iron districts of the west and northwest where it is easy to see that earthquakes were once common by the cracks twists and settlements in the rocks and the lava streams poured out from fiery vents probably under water which pierce the rocks in many places  beyond that we know nothing and can only sayit is of the lords mercies that we are not consumed  why do i say these things  to frighten you  no but to warn you when you say to yourselvesearthquakes are so uncommon and so harmless in england that there is no need to think of them you say on the whole what is true  it has been as yet gods will that earthquakes should be uncommon and slight in england and therefore we have a reasonable ground of belief that such will be his will for the future  certainly he does not wish us to fold our hands and say there is no use in building or improving the country if an earthquake may come and destroy it at any moment  if there be an evil which man can neither prevent or foresee then if he be a wise man he will go on as if that evil would never happen  we ever must work on in hope and in faith in gods goodness without tormenting and weakening ourselves by fears about what may happen  but when god gives to a whole country a distinct and solemn warning especially after giving that country an enormous bounty in an abundant harvest he surely means that country to take the warning and if i dare so judge he means us perhaps to think of the earthquake and somewhat in this way  there is hardly any country in the world in which mans labour has been so successful as in england  owing to our having no earthquakes no really destructive stormsand thank god no foreign invading armiesthe wealth of england has gone on increasing steadily and surely for centuries past to a degree unexampled  we have never had to rebuild whole towns after an earthquake  we have never seen except in small patches whole districts of fertile land ruined by the sea or by floods  we have never seen every mill and house in a country blown down by a hurricane and the crops mown off the ground by the mere force of the wind as has happened again and again in our west india islands most blessed of all we have never seen a foreign army burning our villages sacking our towns carrying off our corn and cattle and driving us into the woods to starve  from all these horrors which have one or other of them fallen on almost every nation upon earth god has of his great mercy preserved us  ours is not the common lot of humanity  we english do not know the sorrows which average men and women go through and have been going through alas ever since adam fell  we have been an exception a favoured and peculiar people allowed to thrive and fatten quietly and safely for hundreds of years  but what if that very security tempts us to forget god  is it not so  are we noti am sure i amtoo apt to take gods blessings for granted without thanking him for them or remembering really that he gave them and that he can take them away  do we not take good fortune for granted  do we not take for granted that if we build a house it will endure for ever that if we buy a piece of land it will be called by our name long years hence that if we amass wealth we shall hand it down safely to our children  of course we think we shall prosper  we say to ourselves tomorrow shall be as today and yet more abundant  nothing can happen to england is i fear the feeling of englishmen carnal security is the national sin to which we are tempted because we have not now for forty years felt anything like national distress and britain says like babylon of old the lady of kingdoms to whom foreigners so often compare heri shall be a lady for ever i am there is none beside me  i shall never sit as a widow nor know the loss of children  what too if that same security and prosperity tempts usas foreigners justly complain of usto set our hearts on material wealth to believe that our life and the life of britain depends on the abundance of the things which she possesses  to saycorn and cattle coal and iron house and land shipping and railroads these make up great britain  while she has these she will endure for ever  ah my friendsto people in such a temptation is it wonderful that a good god should send a warning unmistakeable though only a warning most terrible though mercifully harmless a warning which says in a voice which the dullest can hearendure for ever  the solid ground on which you stand cannot do that  safe  nothing on earth is safe for a moment save in the longsuffering and tender mercy of him of whom are all things and by whom are all things without whom not a sparrow falls to the ground  is the wealth of britain then what she can see and handle  the towns she builds the roads she makes the manufactures and goods she produces  one touch of the finger of god and that might be all rolled into a heap of ruins and the labour of years scattered in the dust  you trust in the sure solid earth  you shall feel it if but for once reel and quiver under your feet and learn that it is not solid at all or sure at all that there is nothing solid sure or to be depended on but the mercy of the living god and that your solidseeming earth on which you build is nothing less than a mine which may bubble and heave and burst beneath your feet charged for ever with an explosive force as much more terrible than that gunpowder which you have invented to kill each other withal as the works of god are greater than the works of man  safe truly  it is of gods mercy from day to day and hour to hour that we are not consumed  this surely or something like this is what the earthquake says to us  it speaks to us most gently and yet most awfully of a day in which the heavens may pass away with a great noise and the elements may melt with fervent heat and the earth and the works which are therein may be burnt up  it tells us that this is no impossible fancy  that the fires imprisoned below our feet can and may burst up and destroy mankind and the works of man in one great catastrophe to which the earthquake of lisbon in 1755when 60000 persons were killed crushed drowned or swallowed up in a few minuteswould be a merely paltry accident  and it bids us think as st peter bids us  when therefore all these things are dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in holy conversation and godliness  what manner of persons  remember that if an earthquake destroyed all england or the whole world if this earth on which we live crumbled to dust and were blotted out of the number of the stars there is one thing which earthquake and fire and all the forces of nature cannot destroy and that isthe human race  we should still be  we should still endure  not indeed in flesh and blood  but in some state or other each of us the same as now our characters our feelings our goodness or our badness our immortal spirits and very selves unchanged ready to receive and certain to receive the reward of the deeds done in the body whether they be good or evil  yes we should still endure and god and christ would still endure  but as our saviour or as our judge that is a very awful thought  one day or other sooner or later each of us shall stand before the judgmentseat of christ stripped of all we ever had ever saw ever touched ever even imagined to ourselves alone with our own consciences alone with our own deserts  what shall we be saying to ourselves then  shall we be sayingi have lost all  the world is gonethe world in which were set all my hopes all my wishes the world in which were all my pleasures all my treasures the world which was the only thing i cared for though it warned me not to trust in it as it trembled beneath my feet  but the world is gone and now i have nothing left  or shall we be sayingthe world is gone  then let it go  it was not a home  i took its good things as thankfully as i could  i took its sorrows and troubles as patiently as i could  but i have not set my heart on the world  my treasure my riches were not of the world  my peace was a peace which the world did not give and could not take away  and now the world is gone i keep my peace i keep my treasure still  my peace is where it was in my own heart  my peace is what it was  my faith in godfaith that my sins are forgiven me for christs sake  my faith that god my father loves me and cares for me and that nothingheight or depth or time or space or life or death can part me from his love  my faith that i have not been quite useless in the world that i have tried to do my duty in my place and that the good which i have done little as it has been will not go forgotten by that merciful god by whose help it was done who rewards all men according to the works which he gives them heart to perform  and my treasure is where it wasin my heart and what it wasthe holy spirit of god the spirit of goodness of faith and truth of mercy and justice of love to god and love to man which is everlasting life itself  that i have  that time cannot abate nor death abolish nor the world nor the destruction of the world nor of all worlds can take away  choose my friends which of these two frames of mind would you rather be in when the great day of the lord comes foretold by that earthquake and by all earthquakes that ever were  will you be then like those whom st john saw calling on the mountains to fall on them and the hills to hide them from the wrath of him that sat on the throne and from the anger of the lamb  or will you be like him who saithgod is my hope and strength my present help in trouble  therefore will i not fear though the earth be shaken and though the mountains be carried into the depth of the sea    sermon xvi  the meteor shower preached at the chapel royal st jamess nov 26 1866    st matthew x 29 30  are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father  but the very hairs of your head are all numbered   it will be well for us to recollect once for all who spoke these words even jesus christ who declared that he was one with god the father jesus christ whom his apostles declared to be the creator of the universe  if we believe this as christian men it will be well for us to take our lords account of a universe which he himself created and to believe that in the most minute occurrence of nature there is a special providence by which not a sparrow falls to the ground without our father  i confess that it is difficult to believe this heartily  it was never anything but difficult  in the earliest ages those who first thought about the universe found it so difficult that they took refuge in the fancy of special providence which was administered by the planets above their heads and believed that the affairs of men and of the world on which they lived were ruled by the aspects of the sun and moon and the host of heaven  men found it so difficult in the middle age that they took refuge in the fancy of a special providence administered by certain demigods whom they called the saints and believed that each special disease or accident was warded off from mankind from their cattle or from their crops by a special saint who overlooked their welfare  men find it so difficult nowadays that the great majority of civilized people believe in no special providence at all and take refuge in the belief that the universe is ruled by something which they call law  therein doubtless they have hold of a great truth but one which will be only halftrue and therefore injurious unless it be combined with other truths unless questions are answered which too many do not care to answer  as for instancecan there be a law without a lawgiver  can a law work without one who administers the law  are not the popular phrases of laws impressed on matter laws inherent in matter mere metaphors dangerous because inaccurate confirmed as little by experience and reason as by scripture  does not all law imply a will  does not an almighty will imply a special providence  but these are questions for which most persons have neither time nor inclination  indeed the whole matter is unimportant to them  they have no special need of a special providence  their lives and properties are very safe in this civilized country and their secret belief is that whatever influence god may have on the next world he has little or no influence on this world neither on the facts of nature nor on the events of history nor on the course of their own lives and that a special providence seems to themif they dare confess as muchan unnecessary superstition  only poor folk in cottages and garretsand a few more who are happily poor in spirit though not in pursegrinding amid the iron facts of life and learning there by little sound science it may be but much sound theologystill believe that they have a father in heaven before whom the very hairs of their head are all numbered and that if they had not then this would not only be a bad world but a mad world likewise and that it were better for them that they had never been born  nevertheless it is difficult to believe in the special providence of our father in heaven  difficult  though necessary  just as it is difficult to believe that the earth moves round the sun  contrary like that fact to a great deal of our seeming experience  it is easy enough of course to believe that our father sends what is plainly good  not so easy to believe that he sends what at least seems evil  easy enough when we see springtime and harvest sunshine and flowers to sayhere are acts of gods providence  not so easy when we see blight and pestilence storm and earthquake to say here are acts of gods providence likewise  for this innumerable multitude of things of which we nowadays talk as if it were one thing and had an organic unity of its own or even as if it were one person and had a will of its own and call it naturea word which will one day be forgotten by philosophers with the four elements and the animal spiritsthis multitude of things i say which we miscall nature has its dark and ugly as well as its bright and fair side  nature says some one is like the spotted panthermost playful and yet most treacherous most beautiful and yet most cruel  it acts at times after a fashion most terrible undistinguishing wholesale seemingly pitiless  it seems to go on its own way as in a storm or an earthquake careless of what it crushes  terrible enough nature looks to the savage who thinks it crushes him from mere caprice  more terrible still does science make nature look when she tells us that it crushes not by caprice but by brute necessity not by illwill but by inevitable law  science frees us in many ways and all thanks to her from the bodily terror which the savage feels  but she replaces that in the minds of many by a moral terror which is far more overwhelming  am ia man is driven to askam i and all i love the victims of an organised tyranny from which there can be no escapefor there is not even a tyrant from whom i may perhaps beg mercy  are we only helpless particles at best separate parts of the wheels of a vast machine which will use us till it has worn us away and ground us to powder  are our bodiesand if so why not our soulsthe puppets yea the creatures of necessary circumstances and all our strivings and sorrows only vain beatings against the wires of our cage cries of why hast thou made me then which are addressed to nothing tell us not that the world is governed by universal law the news is not comfortable but simply horrible unless you can tell us or allow others to tell us that there is a loving giver and a just administrator of that law  horrible i say and increasingly horrible not merely to the sentimentalist but to the man of sound reason and of sound conscience must the scientific aspect of nature become if a mere abstraction called law is to be the sole ruler of the universe if to quote the famous words of the german sageif instead of the divine eye there must glare on us an empty black bottomless eye socket and the stars and galaxies of heaven in spite of all their present seeming regularity are but an everlasting storm which no man guides  it was but a few days ago that we and this little planet on which we live caught a strange and startling glimpse of that everlasting storm whichshall i say itno one guides  we were swept helpless astronomers tell us through a cloud of fiery stones to which all the cunning bolts which man invents to slay his fellowman are but slow and weak engines of destruction  we were free from the superstitious terror with which that meteor shower would have been regarded in old times  we could comfort ourselves too with the fact that heavens artillery was not known as yet to have killed any one and with the scientific explanation of that fact namely that most of the bolts were small enough to be melted and dissipated by their rush through our atmosphere  but did the thought occur to none of us how morally ghastly in spite of all its physical beauty was that grand sight unless we were sure that behind it all there was a living god  unless we believed that not one of those bolts fell or did not fall to the ground without our father  that he had appointed the path and the time and the destiny and the use of every atom of that matter of which science could only tell us that it was rushing without a purpose for ever through the homeless void  we may believe that mind without denying scientific laws or their permanence in any way  it is not a question this of a living god whether he interferes with his own laws now and then but whether interference is not the law of all laws itself  it is not a question of special providences here and there in favour of this person or that but whether the whole universe and its history is not one perpetual and innumerable series of special providences  whether the god who ordained the laws is not so administering them so making them interfere with balance and modify each other as to cause them to work together perpetually for good so that every minutest event excepting always the sin and folly of rational beings happens in the place time and manner where it is specially needed  in one word the question is not whether there be a god but whether there be a living god who is in any true and practical sense master of the universe over which he presides a king who is actually ruling his kingdom or an epicurean deity who lets his kingdom rule itself  is there a living god in the universe or is there none  that is the greatest of all questions  has our lord jesus christ answered it or has he not  easy welltodo people who find this world pleasant and whose chief concern is to live till they die care little about that question  this world suits them well enough whether there be a living god or not and as for the next world they will be sure to find some preacher or confessor who will set their minds easy about it  fanatics and bigots of all denominations care little about that question  for they say in their heartsgod is our father whosesoever father he is not  we are his people and god performs acts of providence for us  but as for the people outside who know not the law nor the gospel either they are accursed  it is not our concern to discuss whether god performs acts of providence for them  but here and there among rich and poor there are those whose heart and fleshwhose conscience and whose intellectcry out for the living god and will know no peace till they have found him  a living god a true god a real god a god worthy of the name a god who is working for ever everywhere and in all who hates nothing that he has made forgets nothing neglects nothing a god who satisfies not only their heads but their hearts not only their logical intellects but their higher reasonthat pure reason which is one with the conscience and moral sense  for him they cry out him they seek  and if they cannot find him they know no rest  for then they can find no explanation of the three great human questions where am i  whither am i going  what must i do  men come to them and say of course there is a godhe created the world long ago and set it spinning ever since by unchangeable laws but they answer that may be true but i want more  i want the living god  other men come to them and say of course there is a god and when the universe is destroyed he will save a certain number of the elect or orthodox  do you take care that you are among that number and leave the rest to him  but they answer that may be true but i want more  i want the living god  they will say so very confusedly  they will often not be able to make men understand their meaning  nay they will say and dodriven by despairvery unwise things  they will even fall down and worship the holy bread in the sacrament of the lords supper and say the living god is in that  you have forbidden us with your theories to find the living god either in heaven or earth  but somewhere he must be  and in despair we will fall back upon the old belief that he is in the wafer on the altar and find there him whom our souls must find or be for ever without a home  strange and sad that that should be the last outcome of the century of mechanical philosophy but before we blame the doctrine as materialisticwhich i fear it too truly iswe should remember that for the last fifty years the young have been taught more and more to be materialists that they have been taught more and more to believe in a god who rules over sundays but not over weekday business over the next world but not over this a god in short in whom men do not live and move and have their being  they have been brought up i say unconsciously but surely as practical materialists who make their senses the ground of all their knowledge and therefore when a revulsion happens to them they are awakened to look for the living godthey look for him instinctively in visible matter  but for the living god thoughtful men will look more and more physical science is forcing on them the question do we live and move and have our being in god  is there a real and perpetual communication between the visible and the invisible world or is there not  are all the beliefs of man from the earliest ages that such there was dreams and nothing more  is any religion whatsoever to be impossible henceforth  and to find an answer men will go either backward to superstition or forward into pantheism for in atheism whether practical or theoretical they cannot abide  the bible says that those old beliefs however partial or childish were no dreams but instincts of an eternal truth that there is such a communication between the universe and the living god  prophets psalmists apostles speaklike our nicene creedof a spirit of god the lord and giver of life in words which are not pantheism but are the very deliverance from pantheism because they tell us that that spirit proceeds not merely from a deity not merely from a creator but from a father in heaven and from a son who is his likeness and his word  and from this ground natural theology must start if it is ever to revive again instead of remaining as now an extinct science  it must begin from the keyword of the text your father  as long as natural theology begins from nature and not from god himself it will inevitably drift into pantheism as pope drifted in spite of himself when he tried to look from nature up to natures god  as long as men speculate on the dealings of a deity or of a creator they will find out nothing because they are searching under the wrong name and therefore as logicians will tell you for the wrong thing  but when they begin to seek under the right namethe name which our lord revealed to the debased multitudes of judaea when he told them that not a sparrow fell to the ground withoutnot the deity not the creator but their father then in gods good time all may come clear once more  this at least will come cleara doubt which often presents itself to the mind of scientific men  this earthwe know now that it is not the centre not the chief body of the universe but a tiny planet a speck an atom among millions of bodies far vaster than itself  it was credible enough in old times when the earth was held to be all but the whole universe that god should descend on earth and take on him human nature to save human beings  is it credible now this little corner of the systems and the galaxies  this paltry race which we call man  are they worthy of the interposition of the death of incarnate godof the maker of such a universe as science has discovered  yes  if we will keep in mind that one word father  then we dare say yes in full assurance of faith  for then we have taken the question off the mere material ground of size and of power to put it once and for ever on that spiritual ground of justice and love which is implied in the one wordfather  if god be a perfect father then there must be a perpetual intercourse of some kind between him and his children between him and that planet however small on which he has set his children that they may be educated into his likeness  if god be perfect justice the wrong and consequent misery of the universe how ever small must be intolerable to him  if god be perfect love there is no sacrificeremember that great wordwhich he may not condescend to make in order to right that wrong and alleviate that misery  if god be the father of our spirits the spiritual welfare of his children may be more important to him than the fate of the whole brute matter of the universe  think not to frighten us with the idols of size and height  god is a spirit before whom all material things are equally great and equally small  let us think of him as such and not merely as a being of physical power and inventive craft  let us believe in our father in heaven  for then that higher intellectthat pure reason which dwells not in the heads but in the hearts of men will tell them that if they have a father in heaven he must be exercising a special providence over the minutest affairs of their lives by which he is striving to educate them into his likeness a special providence over the fate of every atom in the universe by which his laws shall work together for the moral improvement of every creature capable thereof that not a sparrow can fall to the ground without his knowledge and that not a hair of their head can be touched unless suffering is needed for the education of their souls    sermon xvii  cholera 1866    luke vii 16  there came a fear on all  and they glorified god saying that a great prophet is risen up among us and that god hath visited his people   you recollect to what the text refers  how the lord visited his people  by raising to life a widows son at nain  that was the result of our lords visit to the little town of nain  it is worth our while to think of that text and of that word visit just now for we are praying to god to remove the cholera from this land  we are calling it a visitation of god and saying that god is visiting our sins on us thereby  and we are saying the exact truth  we are using the right and scriptural word  we know that this cholera comes by no miracle but by natural causes we can more or less foretell where it will break out  we know how to prevent its breaking out at all save in a scattered case here and there  of this there is no doubt whatsoever in the mind of any well informed person  but that does not prevent its being a visitation of god yea in most awful and literal earnest a housetohouse visitation  god uses the powers of nature to do his work  of him it is written he maketh the winds his angels and flames of fire his ministers  and so this minute and invisible choleraseed is the minister of god by which he is visiting from house to house searching out and punishing certain persons who have been guilty knowingly or not of the offence of dirt of filthy and careless habits of living and especially as has long been known by wellinformed men of drinking poisoned water their sickness their deaths are gods judgment on that act of theirs whereby god says to menyou shall not drink water unfit for even dumb animals and if you do you shall die  to this view there are two objections  first the poor people themselves are not in fault but those who supply poisoned water and foul dwellings  true  but only half true  if people demanded good water and good houses there would soon be a supply of them  but there is not a sufficient supply because too many of the labouring classes in towns though they are earning very high wages are contented to live in a condition unfit for civilized men and of course if they are contented so to do there will be plenty of covetous or careless landlords who will supply the bad article with which they are satisfied and they will be punished by disease for not having taken care of themselves  but as for the owners of filthy houses and the suppliers of poisoned water be sure that in his own way and his own time god will visit them that when he maketh inquisition for blood he will assuredly requite upon the guilty persons whoever they are the blood of those five or six thousand of her majestys subjects who have been foully done to death by cholera in the last two months as he requited the blood of naboth or of any other innocent victim of whom we read in holy writ  this outbreak of cholera in london considering what we now know about it and have known for twenty years past is a national shame scandal and sin which if man cannot and will not punish god can and will  but there is another objection which is far more important and difficult to answer  this cholera has not slain merely fathers and mothers of families who were more or less responsible for the bad state of their dwellings but little children aged widows and many other persons who cannot be blamed in the least  true  and we must therefore believe that to themindeed to all this has been a visitation not of anger but of love  we must believe that they are taken away from some evil to come that god permits the destruction of their bodies to the saving of their souls  his laws are inexorable and yet he hateth nothing that he hath made  and we must believe that this cholera is an instance of the great law which fulfils itself again and again and will to the end of the worldit is expedient that one die for the people and that the whole nation perish not  for the same dirt which produces cholera now and then is producing always and all day long stunted and diseased bodies drunkenness recklessness misery and sin of all kinds and the cholera will be a blessing a cheap price to have paid for the abolition of the evil spirit of dirt  and thus much for this very painful subjectof which some of you may saywhat is it to us  we cannot prevent cholera and blessed as we are with abundance of the purest water there is little or no fear of cholera ever coming into our parish  that last is true my friends and you may thank god for it meanwhile take this lesson at least home with you and teach it your children day by daythat filthy careless and unwholesome habits of living are in the sight of almighty god so terrible an offence that he sometimes finds it necessary to visit them with a severity with which he visits hardly any sin namely by inflicting capital punishment on thousands of his beloved creatures  but though we have not had the cholera among us has god therefore not visited us  that would surely be evil news for us according to holy scripture  for if god do not visit us then he must be far from us  but the psalmist cries go not far from me o lord  his fear is again and again not that god should visit him but that god should desert him  and more the word which is translated to visit in scripture has the sense of seeing to a man overseeing him being his bishop  if god do not see to oversee us and be our bishop then he must turn his face from us which is what the psalmist beseeches him again and again not to do praying hide not thy face from me o lord and crying out of the depths of anxiety and trouble put thy trust in god for i shall yet give him thanks for the light of his countenance and again in thy presence is not death butlife at thy right hand is fulness of days for evermore  and again the psalmist prays to god to visit him and visit his thoughtssearch me o lord and try the ground of my heart  search me and examine my thoughts  look well if there be any wickedness in me and lead me in the way everlasting  shall we pray that prayer my friends  shall we with the psalmist pray god to visit and if need be chasten and correct what he sees wrong in us  or shall we with the superstitious pray to god not to visit us to keep away from us to leave its alone to forget us  if he did answer that foolish prayer there would be an end of us and all created things for in god they live and move and have their being as it is written when thou hidest thy face they are troubled when thou takest away their breath they die and are turned again to their dust  but happily for us god will not answer that foolish prayer  for it is written if i go up to heaven thou art there if i go down to hell thou art there also  nowhither can we go from gods presence  nowhither can we flee from his spirit  this is the scripture language  is ours like it  have we not got to think of a visitation of god as a simple calamity  if a man die suddenly and strangely he has died by the visitation of god  but if he be saved from death strangely and suddenly it does not occur to us to call that a visitation and to say with scripture the lord has visited the man with his salvation  if the cholera comes or the crops fail we saygod is visiting us  if we have an especially healthy year or a glorious harvest we never say with scripture the lord has visited his people in giving them bread yet scripture if it says i will visit their transgressions says also that the lord visited the children of israel to deliver them out of egypt  if it talks of death as the visitation of all men it speaks of god visiting sarah and hannah to give them children  if it says i will visit the blood shed in jezreel it says also thy visitation hath preserved my spirit  if it says at the time they are visited they shall be cast down it says also the lord shall visit them and turn away their captivity  if we look through scripture we find that the words visit and visitation are used about ninety times  that in about fifty of them the meaning of the words is chastisement of some kind or other in about forty it is mercy and blessing  and that in the new testament the words never mean anything but mercy and blessing though we have begun of late years to use them only in the sense of punishment and a curse  now how is this my friends  how is it that we who are not under the terrors of the law but under the gospel of grace have quite lost the gospel meaning of this word visitation and take a darker view of it than did even the old jews under the law  have we whom god hath visited indeed in the person of his onlybegotten son jesus christ any right or reason to think worse of a visitation of god than had the jews of old  god forbid  and yet we do so i fear and show daily that we do so by our use of the word  for out of the abundance of the heart mans mouth speaketh  by his words he is justified and by his words he is condemned and there is no surer sign of what a mans real belief is than the sense in which lie naturally as it were by instinct uses certain words  and what is the cause  shall i say it  if i do i blame not you more than i blame myself more than i blame this generation  but it seems to me that there is a littleor not a littleatheism among us nowadays that we are growing to be without god in the world  we are ready enough to believe that god has to do with the next world  but we are not ready to believe that he has to do with this world  we in this generation do not believe that in god we live and move and have our being  nay some object to capital punishment because so they say it hurries men into the presence of their maker as if a human being could be in any better or safer place than the presence of his maker and as if his being there depended on us or on any man and not on god almighty alone who is surely not so much less powerful than an earthly monarch that he cannot keep out of his presence or in it whomsoever he chooses  when we talk of being ushered into the presence of god we mean dying as if we were not all in the presence of god at this moment and all day long  when we say prepare to meet thy god we mean prepare to die as if we did not meet our god every time we had the choice between doing a right thing and doing a wrong onebetween yielding to our own lusts and tempers and yielding to the holy spirit of god  for if the holy spirit of god be as the christian faith tells us god indeed do we not meet god every time a right and true and gracious thought arises in our hearts  but we have all forgotten this and much more connected with this and our notion of this world is not that of holy scriptureof that grand 104th psalm for instance which sets forth the spirit of god as the lord and giver of life to all creation  but our notion is thisthat this world is a machine which would go on very well by itself if god would but leave it alone that if the course of nature as we atheistically call it is not interfered with then suns shine crops grow trade flourishes and all is well because god does not visit the earth  ah blind that we are blind to the power and glory of god which is around us giving life and breath to all thingsgod without whom not a sparrow falls to the ground god who visiteth the earth and maketh it very plenteousgod who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth notgod whose ever creating and eversustaining spirit is the source not only of all goodness virtue knowledge but of all life health order fertility  we see not gods witness in his sending rain and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness  and then comes the punishment  because we will not keep up a wholesome and trustful belief in god in prosperity we are awakened out of our dream of unbelief to an unwholesome and mistrustful belief in him in adversity  because we will not believe in a god of love and order we grow to believe in a god of anger and disorder  because we will not fear a god who sends fruitful seasons we are grown to dread a god who sends famine and pestilence  because we will not believe in the father in heaven we grow to believe in a destroyer who visits from heaven  but we believe in him only as the destroyer  we have forgotten that he is the giver the creator the redeemer  we look on his visitations as something dark and ugly instead of rejoicing in the thought of gods presence as we should if we had remembered that he was about our path and about our bed and spying out all our ways whether for joy or for sorrow  we shrink at the thought of his presence  we look on his visitations as things not to be understood not to be searched out in childlike humilityand yet in childlike confidencethat we may understand why they are sent and what useful lesson our father means us to learn from them  but we look on them as things to be merely prayed against if by any means god will as soon as possible cease to visit us and leave us to ourselves for we can earn our own bread comfortably enough if it were not for his interference and visitations  we are too like the gadarenes of old to whom it mattered little that the lord had restored the madman to health and reason if he caused their swine to perish in the lake they were uneasy and terrified at such visitations of god incarnate he seemed to them a terrible and dangerous being and they besought him to depart out of their coasts  it would have been wiser surely in those gadarenes and better for them had they criedlord what wilt thou have us to do  we see that thou art a being of infinite power for mercy and for punishment likewise  and thou art the very being whom we want to teach us our duty and to make us do it  tell us what we ought to do and help us and if need be compel us to do it and so to prosper indeed  and so should we pray in the case of this cholera we may ask god to take it away  but we are bound to ask god also why he has sent it  till then we have no reason to suppose that he will take it away we have no reason to suppose that it will be merciful in him to take it away till he has taught us why it was sent  this question of cholera has come now to a crisis in which we must either learn why cholera comes or incur i hold lasting disgrace and guilt  andif i may dare to hint at the counsels of godit seems as if the almighty lord had no mind to relieve us of that disgrace and guilt  for months past we have been praying that this cholera should not enter england and our prayers have not been heard  in spite of them the cholera has come and has slain thousands and seems likely to slay thousands more  what plainer proof can there be to those who believe in the providence of god and the rule of jesus christ our lord than that we are meant to learn some wholesome lesson from it which we have not learnt yet  it cannot be that god means us to learn the physical cause of cholera for that we have known these twenty years  foul lodging foul food and above all natural and physical foul water there is no doubt of the cause  but why cannot we save english people from the curse and destruction which all this foulness brings  that is the question  that is our national scandal shame and sin at this moment  perhaps the lord wills that we should learn that learn what is the moral and spiritual cause of our own miserable weakness negligence hardness of heart which sinning against light and knowledge has caused the death of thousands of innocent souls  god grant that we may learn that lesson  god grant that he may put into the hearts and minds of some man or men the wisdom and courage to deliver us from such scandals for the future  but i have little hope that that will happen till we get rid of our secret atheism till we give up the notion that god only visits now and then to disorder and destroy his own handiwork and take back the old scriptural notion that god is visiting all day long for ever to give order and life to his own work to set it right whenever it goes wrong and recreate it whenever it decays  till then we can expect only explanations of cholera and of gods other visitations of affliction which are so superstitious so irrational so little connected with the matter in hand that they would be ridiculous were they not somewhat blasphemous  but when men arise in this land who believe truly in an everpresent god of order revealed in his son jesus christ when men shall arise in this land who will believe that faith with their whole hearts and will live and die for it and by it acting as if they really believed that in god we live and move and have our being as if they really believed that they were in the kingdom and rule of christa rule of awful severity and yet of perfect lovea rule meanwhile which men can understand and are meant to understand that they may not only obey the laws of god but know the mind of god and copy the dealings of god and do the will of god and when men arise in this land who have that holy faith in their hearts and courage to act upon it then cholera will vanish away and the physical and moral causes of a hundred other evils which torment poor human beings through no anger of god but simply through their own folly and greediness and ignorance  all these shall vanish away in the day when the knowledge of the lord shall cover the land and men shall say in spirit and in truth as christ their lord has said beforesacrifice and burntoffering thou wouldest not  then said i lo i come  in the volume of the book it is written of me that i should do the will of god  and in those days shall be fulfilled once more the text which saysthat the people glorified god saying a great prophet even christ the lord himself hath risen up among us and god hath visited his people    sermon xviii  the wicked servant    st matthew xviii 23  the kingdom of heaven is likened to a certain king which would take account of his servants   this parable which you heard in the gospel for this day you all know  and i doubt not that all you who know it understand it well enough  it is so human and so humane it is told with such simplicity and yet with such force and brilliancy thatif one dare praise our lords words as we praise the words of menall must see its meaning at once though it speaks of a state of society different from anything which we have ever seen or thank god ever shall see  the eastern despotic king who has no law but his own will who puts his servantliterally his slaveinto a post of such trust and honour that the slave can misappropriate and make away with the enormous sum of ten thousand talents who commands not only him but his wife and children to be sold to pay the debt who then forgives him all out of a sudden burst of pity and again when the wretched man has shown himself base and cruel unworthy of that pity revokes his pardon and delivers him to the tormentors till he shall pay all all this is a state of things impossible in a free country though it is possible enough still in many countries of the east which are governed in this very despotic fashion and justice and very often injustice likewise is done in this rough uncertain way by the will of the king alone  but however different the circumstances yet there is a lesson in this story which is universal and eternal true for all men and true for ever  the same human nature for good and for evil is in us as was in that eastern king and his slave  the same kingdom of heaven is over us as was over them its laws punishing sinners by their own sins the same spirit of god which strove with their hearts is striving with ours  if it was not so the parable would mean nothing to us  it would be a story of men who belonged to another moral world and were under another moral law not to be judged by our rules of right and wrong and therefore a story of men whom we need not copy  but it is not so  if the parable beas i take for granted it isa true story then it was christ the light who lights every man who cometh into the world who put into that kings heart the divine feeling of mercy and inspired him to forgive freely and utterly the wretched slave who worshipped him kneeling with his forehead to the ground and promising in his terror what he probably knew he could not performlord have patience with me and i will pay thee all  and it was christ the light of men who inspired that king with the feeling not of mere revenge but of just retribution who taught him that when the slave was unworthy of his mercy he had a right in a noble and divine indignation to withdraw his mercy and not to waste his favours on a bad man who would only turn them to fresh bad account but to keep them for those who had justice and honour enough in their hearts to forgive others when their lord had forgiven them  we must bear in mind that the king must have been right and acting whether he knew it or not by the spirit of god else his conduct would never have been likened to the kingdom of heaven  that is to the laws by which god governs both this world and the world to come  the kingdom of heaven  the kingdom of godwould that men would believe in them a little more  it seems at times as if all belief in them was dying out as if men throughout all civilized and christian countries had made up their minds to saythere is no kingdom of god or of heaven  there will be one hereafter in the next world  this world is the kingdom of men and of what they can do for themselves without gods help and without gods laws  my friends the jewish rulers of old said so and cried we have no king but caesar  and they remain an example to all time of what happens to those who deny the kingdom of god  christ came to tell them that the kingdom of heaven was at hand and the kingdom of god was among them  but they would have none of it  and what said our lord of them and their notion  the prince of this world said he cometh and hath nothing in me  this is your hour and the power of darkness  yes the hour in which men had determined to manage the world in their way and not in christs was also the hour of the power of darkness  that was what they had gained by having their own way by sayingthe kingdom is ours and not gods  they had fallen under the power of darkness not of light  the very light within them was darkness  they utterly mistook their road on earth  at the very moment that they were trying to make peace with the roman governor by denying that christ was their king and demanding that he should be crucifiedat that very moment the things which belonged to their peace were hid from their eyes  never men made so fatal a mistake when they thought themselves most politic and prudent  they said among themselvesunless we put down this man the romans will come and take away our place ie our privileges and power and our nation  and what followed  that the romans did come and take away their place and nation with horrible massacre and ruin  and so they lost both the kingdom of this world and the kingdom of god likewise  never i say did men make a more fatal mistake in the things of this world than those jews to whom the kingdom of god came and they rejected it  and so shall we my friends if we forget that whether we like it or not the kingdom of god is within us and we within it likewise  1  the kingdom of god is within us  every gracious motive every noble just and merciful instinct within us is a sign to us that the kingdom of god is come to us that we are not as the brutes which perish not as the heathen who are too often past feeling being alienated from the life of god by reason of the ignorance which is in them  but that we are gods children inheritors of the kingdom of heaven and that gods spirit is teaching us the laws of that kingdom so that in every child who is baptized educated and civilized is fulfilled the promise i will write my laws upon their hearts and i will be to them a father  gods spirit is teaching our hearts as he taught the heart of that old eastern king  it may be it ought to be that he is teaching us far deeper lessons than he ever taught that king  2  we are in the kingdom of god  it is worth our while to remember that steadfastly just now  many people are ready to agree that the kingdom of god is within them  they will readily confess that religion is a spiritual matter and a matter of the heart  but their fancy is that therefore religion and all just and noble and beautiful instincts and aspirations are very good things for those who have them  but that if any one has them not it does not much matter  they do not see that there are not only such things as feelings about god but that there are also such things as laws of god and that god can enforce those laws and does enforce them sometimes in a very terrible manner  they do not believe enough in a living god an acting god a god who will not merely write his laws in our hearts if we will let him but may also destroy us off the face of the earth if we would not let him  they fancy that god either cannot or will not enforce his own laws but leaves a man free to accept them or reject as he will  there is no greater mistake  be not deceived god is not mocked  as a man sows so shall he reap  god says to us to all mencopy me  do as i do and be my children and be blest  but if we will not if after all gods care and love the tree brings forth no fruit then soon or late the sentence goes forth against it in gods kingdom cut it down why cumbereth it the ground  there is a saying nowadays that nations and tribes who will not live reasonable lives and behave as men should to their fellowmen must be civilized off the face of the earth  the words are false if they mean that we or any other men have a right to exterminate their fellowcreatures  but they are true and more true than the people who use them fancy if they are spoken not of man but of god for if men will not obey the laws of gods kingdom god does actually civilize them off the face of the earth  great nations learned churches powerful aristocracies ancient institutions has god civilized off the face of the earth before now  because they would not acknowledge god for their king and obey the laws of his kingdom in which alone are life and wealth and health god has taken his kingdom away from them and given it to others who would bring forth the fruits thereof  the jews are the most awful and famous example of that terrible judgment of god but they are not the only ones  it has happened again and again  it may happen to you or me as well as to this whole nation of england if we forget that we are in gods kingdom and that only by living according to gods laws can we keep our place therein  and this is what the parable teaches us  the king tries to teach the servant one of the laws of his kingdomthat he rules according to boundless mercy and generosity  god wishes to teach us the same the king does so not by word but by deed by actually forgiving the man his debt  so does god forgive us freely in jesus christ our lord  but more than this he wishes the servant to understand that he is to copy his king that if his king has behaved to him like a father to his child he must behave as a brother to his fellowservants  so does god wish to teach us  but he does not tell the man so in so many words  he does not say to him i command thee to forgive thy debtors as i have forgiven thee  he leaves the man to his own sense of honour and good feeling it is a question not of the law but of the heart  so does god with us  he educates us not as children or slaves but as free men as moral agents  he leaves us to our own reason and conscience to reap the fruit which we ourselves have sown  therefore about a thousand matters in life he lays on us no special command  he leaves us to act according to our good feeling to our own sense of honour  it is a matter i say of the heart  if gods law be written in our hearts our hearts will lead us to do the right thing  if gods law be not in our hearts then mere outward commands will not make us do right for what we do will not be really right and good because it will not be done heartily and of our own will  but the servant does not follow his lords example  fresh from his lords presence he takes his fellowservant by the throat sayingpay me that thou owest  his heart has not been touched  his lords example has not softened him  he does not see how beautiful how noble how divine generosity and mercy are  he is a hardhearted worldly man  the heavenly kingdom which is justice and love is not within him  then if the kingdom of heaven is not in him he shall find out that he is in it and that in a very terrible way thou wicked servant unworthy of my pity because there is no goodness in thine own heart  thou wilt not take into thy heart my law which tells thee be merciful as i am merciful  then thou shalt feel another and an equally universal law of mine  as thou doest so shalt thou be done by  if thou art merciful thou shalt find mercy  if thou wilt have nothing but retribution then nothing but retribution thou shalt have  if thou must needs do justice thyself i will do justice likewise  because i am merciful dost thou think me careless  because i sit still that i am patient dost thou think me such a one as thyself  and his lord delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him  my dear friends this is an awful story  let us lay it to heart and to do that let us pray god to lay it to our hearts to write his laws in our hearts that we may not only fear them but love them not only see their profitableness but their fitness that we may obey them not grudgingly or of necessity but obey them because they look to us just and true and beautiful and as they aregodlike let us pray i say that god would make us love what he commands lest we should neglect and despise what he commands and find it some day unexpectedly alive and terrible after all  let us pray to god to keep alive his kingdom of grace within us lest his kingdom of retribution outside us should fall upon us and grind us to powder    sermon xix  civilized barbarism preached for the bishop of londons fund at st johns church notting hill june 1866    st matthew ix 12  they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick   i have been honoured by an invitation to preach on behalf of the bishop of londons fund for providing for the spiritual wants of this metropolis  by the bishop and a large number of landowners employers of labour and others who were aware of the increasing heathendom of the richest and happiest city of the world it was agreed that if possible a million sterling should be raised during the next ten years to do what money could do in wiping out this national disgrace  it is a noble plan and it has been as yetand i doubt not will be to the endnobly responded to by the rich laity of this metropolis  more than 100000l was contributed during the first six months nearly 60000l in the ensuing year beside subscriptions which are promised for the whole or part of the ten years  the money therefore does not flow in as rapidly as was desired  but there is as yet no falling off  and i believe that there will be on the contrary a gradual increase in the subscriptions as the objects of this fund are better understood and as its benefits are practically felt  now it is unnecessaryit would be almost an impertinenceto enlarge on a spiritual destitution of which you are already well aware  there are we shall all agree many thousands in london who are palpably sick of spiritual disease and need the physician  but i have special reasons for not pressing this point  if i attempted to draw subscriptions from you by painting tragical and revolting pictures of the vice heathendom and misery of this metropolis i might make you fancy that it was an altogether vicious heathen and miserable spot  than which there can be no greater mistake  these evils are not the rule but the exceptions  were they not the exceptions then not merely the society of london and the industry of london and the wealth of london but the very buildings of london the brick and the mortar would crumble to the ground by natural and inevitable decay  the unprecedentedly rapid increase of london is i firmly believe a sure sign that things in it are done on the whole not ill but well that gods blessing is on the place that because it is on the whole obeying the eternal laws of god therefore it is increasing and multiplying and replenishing the earth and subduing it  and i do not hesitate to say that i have read of no spot of like size upon this earth on which there have ever been congregated so many human beings who are getting their bread so peaceably happily loyally and virtuously and doing their dutyill enough no doubt as we all do itbut still doing it more or less by man and god  i am well aware that many will differ from me that many men and many womenholy devoted spending their lives in noble and unselfish labourspersons whose shoes latchet i am not worthy to unloose take a far darker view of the state of this metropolis  but the fact is that they are naturally brought in contact chiefly with its darker side  their first duty is to seek out cases of misery  and even if they do not the miserable will of their own accord come to them  it is their first duty tooif they be clergymento rebuke and if possible to cure open vice open heathendom as well as to relieve present want and wretchedness  and may gods blessing be on all who do that work  but in doing it they are dealing dailyand ought to deal and must dealwith the exceptional and not with the normal with cases of palpable and shocking disease and not with cases of at least seeming health  they see that into london as into a vast sewer gravitates yearly all manner of vice ignorance weakness poverty  but they are apt to forget at timesand god knows i do not blame them for it in the leastthat there gravitates into london not as into a sewer but as into a wholesome and fruitful garden a far greater amount of health strength intellect honesty industry virtue which makes london which composes i verily believe fourfifths of the population of london  for if it did not as i have said already london would decay and die and not grow and live  am i denying the spiritual destitution of this metropolis  am i arguing against the necessity of the bishop of londons fund  am i trying to cool your generosity towards it  am i raising against it the textthey that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick  am i trying to prove that the sick are fewer than was fancied the healthy more numerous and therefore the physician less needed  would to heaven that i dare so do  would to heaven that i could prove this fund unnecessary and superfluous  but instead thereof i fear that i must saythat the average of that health strength intellect honesty industry virtue which makes londonthat the average of all that i verily believe is to be counted though it knows it not among the sick and not among the sound  it is sick over and above those personal sins which are common to all classes it is sick of a great social disease of a disease which is very dangerous for the nation to which we belong which will increase more and more and become more and more dangerous unless it is stopped wholesale by some such wholesale measure as this  that disease is paradoxical as it may seem want of civilization barbarism which is the child of ungodliness  and that can i verily believe again be cured only as far as we in the nineteenth century have discovered by an extension of the parochial system  and yetlet us beware of that expressionparochial system  it seems to imply that the parish is a mere system an artificial arrangement of mans invention  now that is just what the parish is not  it is founded on local ties and they are not a system but a fact  you do not assemble men into parishes  you find them already assembled by fact which is the will of god  you take your stand upon the merest physical ground of their living next door to each other their being likely to witness each others sayings and doings to help each other and like each other or to debauch each other and hate each other upon the fact that their children play in the same street and teach each other harm or good thereby influencing generations yet unborn upon the fact that if one takes cholera or fever the man who lives next door is liable to take it tooin short on the broad fact that they are members of each other for good or evil  you take your stand on this physical ground of mere neighbourhood and saythis bond of neighbourhood is after all one of the most humanyea of the most divineof all bonds  every man you meet is your brother and must be for good or evil  you cannot live without him you must help or you must injure each other and therefore you must choose whether you will be a horde of isolated barbariansyour living in brick and mortar instead of huts and tents being a mere accidentbarbarians i say at continual war with each other  or whether you will go on to become civilized men that is fellowcitizens members of the same body confessing and exercising duties to each other which are not selfchosen not self invented but real which encompass you whether you know them or not laid on you by almighty god by the mere fact of your being men and women living in contact with each other  out of this great and true law arises the idea of a parish a local selfgovernment for many civil purposes as well as ecclesiastical ones under a priest whoif he is to be considered as a little constitutional monarchhas his powers limited carefully both by the supreme law by his assessors the churchwardens and by the democratic constitution of the parishinfluences which he is bound both by law and by christianity to obey  arising in the first place from the fact that our forefathers colonized england in small separate families each with its own jurisdiction and worship our country parish churches being to this day often the sites of old heathen tribetemples and this very place nottinghill being possibly a little colony of the nottingas the same tribe which gave their name to the great city of nottingham arising from this fact and from the very ancient institution of frankpledge between local neighbours this parochial system above all other english institutions has helped to teach us how to govern and therefore how to civilize ourselves  it was overlaid all but extinguished by the monastic system during the latter part of the middle ages  it reasserted itself in fuller vigour than ever at the reformation  but with its benefits its defects were restored likewise  the tendency of the mediaeval church had been to become merely a church for paupers  the tendency of the church of england during the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was to become merely a church for burghers  it has been of late to become merely a church for paupers again  the causes of this reaction are simple enough  population increased so rapidly that the old parish bounds were broken up the old parish staff became too small for working purposes  the church had and alas has still to be again a missionary church as she became in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries when feudal violence had destroyed the selfgovernment of the parishesoften the parishes themselves and filled the land with pauperism and barbarism  but that is but a transitional state  her duty is now becoming more and more and those who wish her well must help her to fulfil her duty to reorganize the ancient parochial system on a deeper and sounder footing than ever on a footing which will ensure her being a church not merely for pauper nor merely for burgher but for pauper and for burgher equally and alike  but some will say that parochial civilization is only a peculiar form of civilization because its centre is a church  peculiar  that is the last word which any one would apply to such a civilization if he knows history  will any one mention any civilization past or present whose centre has not been as long as it has been living and progressive a church  all past civilizationswhether heathen or mussulman jew or christianhave each and every one of them as a fact held that the common and local worship of a god was a sign to them of their common and local unity a sign to them of their religion that is the duties which bound them to each other whether they liked or not  to all races and nations as yet their sacred grove church temple or other place of worship has been a sign to them that their unity and duties were not invented by themselves but were the will and command of an unseen being who would reward or punish them according as they did those duties or left them undone so it has been in the civilizations of the past  so it will be in the civilization of the future  if the christian religion were swept awayas it never will be for it is eternaland a civilization founded on what is called nature put in its place then we should see a worship of something called nature and a temple thereof set up as the symbol of that natural civilization  so the jacobins of france when they tried to civilize france on the mere ground of what they called reasonhad whether they liked it or not to instal a worship of reason and a goddess of reason for as long as they could contrive to last  to the worlds end a church of some kind or other will be the centre and symbol of every civilization which is worthy of the name of every civilization which signifies not merely that men live in somewhat better houses travel rather faster by railway and read a few more books which is the popular meaning of civilization but which meansas it meant among the greeks the romans the jews the christians among those who discovered the idea and the very words which express itthat each and every truly civilized man is a civis a citizen the conscious and obedient member of a corporate body which he did not make but which in as far as he is not a savage has made him  how far from this idea are the great masses of our really wealthy and welltodo londoners  how much is it needed that wise men should try to reawaken in them the sense of corporate life and literally civilize them once more  consider the case not of the average wretched but of the average comfortable man  the small shopkeeper the workman skilled or unskilledhow small a consciousness has he of citizenship  what few incentives to regard civism as a solemn duty  for consider of what is he a member  he is a member of a family and in general he fulfils his family duties well  yes thank god the family life of englishmen is sound  the hearts of the children do not need to be turned to their fathers or the hearts of the fathers to the children as they did in judea of old family life which is the foundation of all national lifenay of all christian and church lifeis on the whole sound  and having that foundation we can build on it safely and well if we be wise  but of what else is the average londoner a member  of a benefit club of a trades union of a volunteer corps  each will be a valuable element of education for it will teach him that self government which is the school of all freedom of all loyalty of all true civilization  or he may be a member of some nonconformist sect  that too will be a valuable element for it will teach him the solemn fact of his own personality his direct responsibility to god for his own soul  and i cannot pass this point of my sermon without expressing my sense of the great work which the dissenting sects have done and are doing for this land with which the bishop of londons plan will in no wise interfere in teaching this one thing which the church of england while trying to carry out her far deeper and higher conception of organization has often forgotten that after all and before all and throughout all each man stands alone face to face with almighty god  this idea has helped to give the middle classes of england an independence a strong vigorous sharpcut personality which is an invaluable wealth to the nation  god forbid that we should try to weaken it even for reasons which may seem to some devout and orthodox  but all these memberships after all are only voluntary ones not involuntary  they are assumed by man himselfthe worldly associations on the ground of mutual interest the spiritual associations on that of identity of opinions  they are not instituted by god and nature and fact whether the man knows of them or not likes them or not  they are of the nature of clubs not of citizenship  they are not founded on that human ground which is by virtue of the incarnation the most divine ground of all  and for the many they do not exist  the majority of small shopkeepers and the majority of labourers too are members as far as they are aware of nothing unless it be a club at some neighbouring publichouse the old feudal and burgher bonds of the middle age for good or for evil have perished by natural and necessary decay and nothing has taken their place  each man is growing up more and more isolated tempted to selfishness to brutal independence tempted to regard his fellowmen as rivals in the struggle for existence tempted in short to incivism to a loss of the very soul and marrow of civilization while the outward results of it remain and therefore tempted to a loss of patriotism of the belief that he possesses here something far more precious than his private fortune or even his family even a country for which he must sacrifice if need be himself  and if that grow to be the general temper of england or of london in some great day of the lord some crisis of perplexity want or dangerthen may the lord have mercy upon this land for it will have no mercy on itself  but divided suspicious heartless cynical unpatriotic each class even each family even each individual man will run each his own way minding his own interest or safety content like the debased jews if he can find the life of his hand and   too happy if in that dread day his life he given him for a prey   our fathers saw that happen throughout half europe at a crisis when while the outward crust of civilization was still kept up the life of it all patriotism corporate feeling duty to a common god and faith in a common saviour had rotted out unperceived  at one blow the gay idol fell and broke and behold inside was not a soul but dust  god grant that we may never see here the same catastrophe the same disgrace  now one remedyi do not say the only remedythere are no such things as panaceas all spiritual and social diseases are complicated and their remedies must be complicated likewisebut one remedy palpable easy and useful whenever and wherever it has been tried is thisto go to these great masses of brave honest industrious but isolated and uncivilized men after the method of the bishop of this diocese and his fund and to say to themof whatever body you are or are not members you are members of that human family for which our lord jesus christ was contented to be betrayed and to suffer death upon the cross over which he now liveth and reigneth with the father and the holy ghost one god world without end  you are children of god the father of spirits who wills that all should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth  you are inheritorsthat is members not by your own will or the will of any man but by the will of god who has chosen you to be born in a christian land of christian parentsinheritors i say of the kingdom of heaven from your cradles to your graves and after that if you will for ever and ever  behave as such  claim your rights for they are yours already  and not only claim your rights but confess your duties  remember that every man woman and child in your street is prima facie just as much a member of christ as you are  treat them as such associate yourselves with them as such accept the simple physical fact that they live next door to you as gods will toward you both and as gods sign to you that you and they are members of the same human and divine family  enter with them in that plain form into the free corporate selfgovernment of a christian parish  fear no priestly tyranny from that danger you are guaranteed by the fact that the great majority of the promoters of this fund are laymen of all shades of opinion  you are guaranteed still further by the fact that in the parochial system there can be no tyranny  it is one of the very institutions by which englishmen have learnt those habits of selfgovernment which are the admiration of europe  do then the duty which lies nearest you your duty to the man who lives next door and to the man who lives in the next street  do your duty to your parish that you may learn to do your duty by your country and to all mankind and prove yourselves thereby civilized men  and confess your sins in this matter if not to us at least to god confess that while you in your sturdy comfortable independence have been fancying yourselves whole and sound you have been very sick and need the physician to cure you of the deadly and growing disease of selfish barbarism  confess that while you have been priding yourselves on english selfhelp and independence you have not deigned to use them for those purposes of common organization common worship for which the very savages and heathens have for ages past used such freedom as they have had  confess that while you have been talking loudly about the rights of humanity you have neglected too often its duties and lived as if the people in the same street had no more to do with you than the beasts which perish  confess your sins  we monied men confess ours  we ought to have foreseen the rapid growth of this city  we ought to have planned and laboured more earnestly for its better organization  and we freely offer our money as a sign of our repentance to build and establish for you institutions which you cannot afford to establish for yourselves  we excuse you moreover in very great part  you have been gathered together so suddenly into these vast new districts or rather chaos of houses and you have meanwhile shifted your dwellings so rapidly and under the pressure of such continual labour that you have not had time enough to organize yourselves  but we too have our excuse  we have actually been trying at vast expense and labour to ourselves for the last forty years to meet your new needs  but you have outgrown all our efforts  your increase has taken us by surprise  your prosperity has outrun our goodwill  it shall do so no more  we are ready to do our part in the good work of repentance we ask you to do yours  you are more able to do it than you ever were  richer better educated more acquainted with the blessings of association  we do not come to you as to paupers merely to help you  we come to you as to free and independent citizens to teach you to help yourselves and show yourselves citizens indeed  i hope ay i believe that such an appeal as this made in an honest and liberal spirit which proves its honesty and liberality by great and generous gifts out of such private wealth as no nation ever had before will be met by the masses of london in the same spirit as that in which it has been made  i am certain of it if only the ecclesiastical staff employed by this fund will keep steadfastly in mind what they have to do  true it is and happily true that they can do nothing but good  if they confine themselves to the celebration of public worship to teaching children to giving the consolations of religion to those with whom want and wretchedness bring them in contactall that will be gain clear gain vast gain  but that valuable necessary as it is will not be sufficient to evoke a full response from the people of london  but if they will not leaving the other undone do yet more if they will attempt the more difficult but the equally necessary and more permanent labourthat of attacking the disease of barbarism not merely in its symptoms but in its very roots and its causes if they will recognise the fact that with the disease there coexists a great deal of sturdy and useful health if they will have courage and address to face not merely the nonworking nonearning and generally nonthinking hundreds but the working earning thinking thousands of each parish in fact the men and women who make london what it is if they will approach them with charity confidence and respect if they will remember that they are justly jealous of that personal independence that civil and religious liberty which is theirs by law and right if they will conduct themselves not as lords over gods heritage but as examples to the flock if they will treat that flock not as their subjects but as their friends their fellowworkers their fellowcounsellorsoften their advisers if they will remember that give and take live and let live are no mere worldly maxims but necessary though difficult christian duties then i believe they will after awhile receive an answer to their call such as they dare not as yet expect such an answer as our forefathers gave to the clergy of the early middle age when they showed them that the kingdom of god was the messenger of civilization of humanity of justice and peace of strength and wellbeing in this world as well as in the next  the clergy would find in the men and women of london not merely disciples but helpers  they would meet not with fanatical excitement not even with enthusiasm not even with much outward devotion but with co operation hearty and practical though slow and quietcooperation all the more valuable in every possible sense because it will be free and voluntary and the bishop of londons fund would receive more and more assistance not merely of heads and hands but of money when money was needed from the inhabitants of the very poorest and most heathen districts as they began to feel that they were giving their money towards a common blessing and became proud to pay their share towards an organization which would belong to them and to their children after them  so runs my dream  this may be done  god grant that it may  for now it may be is our best chance of doing it  now is the accepted time now is the day of salvation  if these masses increase in numbers and in power for another generation in their present state of anarchy they may be lost for ever to christianity to order to civilization  but if we can civilize in that sense which is both classical and christian the masses of london and of england by that parochial method which has been according to history the only method yet discovered then we shall have helped not only to save innumerable souls from sin and from that misery which is the inevitable and everlasting consequence of sin but we shall have helped to save them from a specious and tawdry barbarism such as corrupted and enervated the seemingly civilized masses of the later roman empire and to save our country within the next century from some such catastrophe as overtook the jewish monarchy in spite of all its outward religiosity the catastrophe which has overtaken every nation which has fancied itself sound and whole while it was really broken sick weak ripe for ruin  for such every nation or empire becomes though the minority above be never so well organized civilized powerful educated even virtuous if the majority below are not a people of citizens but masses of incoherent atoms ready to fall to pieces before every storm  from that and from all adversities may god deliver us and our children after us by graciously beholding this his family for which our lord jesus christ was content to suffer death upon the cross and by pouring out his spirit upon all estates of men in his holy church that every member of the same in his calling and ministry may freely and godly serve him till we have no longer the shame and sorrow of praying for english men and women as we do for jews turks infidels and heretics that god would take from them all ignorance hardness of heart and contempt of his word and fetch them home to that flock of his to which they all belong    sermon xx  the god of nature preached during a wet harvest    psalm cxlvii 79  sing unto the lord with thanksgiving sing praise upon the harp unto our god  who covereth the heaven with clouds who prepareth rain for the earth who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains  he giveth to the beast his food and to the young ravens which cry   there is no reason why those who wrote this psalm and the one which follows it should have looked more cheerfully on the world about them than we have a right to do  the country and climate of judea is not much superior to ours  if we suffer at times from excess of rain and wind judea suffers from excess of drought and sunshine  it suffers too at times from that most terrible of earthly calamities from which we are freenamely from earthquakes  the sea moreover instead of being loved as it is by us as the highway of our commerce and the producer of vast stores of foodthe sea i say was almost feared by the old jews who were no sailors  they looked on it as a dangerous waste and were thankful to god that though the waves roared he had set them a bound which they could not pass  so that there is no reason why the old jews should think and speak more cheerfully about the world than we here in england ought  they had too the same human afflictions sicknesses dangers disappointments losses and chastisements as we have  they had their full share of all the ills to which flesh is heir  yet look i beg you at the cheerfulness of these two psalms the 147th and 148th in truth it is more than cheerfulness it is joy rejoicing which can only express itself in a song  these psalms are songs to be sung to music and even in our translation they are songs still sounding like poetry and not like prose  and why is this  because the men who wrote these psalms had faith in god  they trusted god  they saw that he was worthy of their trust  they saw that he was to be honoured not merely for his boundless wisdom and his boundless power  for a being might have them and yet make a bad use of them  but he was to be trusted because he was a good god  he was to be honoured not for anything which men might get out of him as the heathen fancied by flattering him and begging of him  but he was to be honoured for his own sake for what he was in himselfa just merciful kind generous magnanimous and utterly noble and perfect moral being worthy of all admiration praise honour and glory  the psalmist saw that god was good and worthy to be praised  but he saw too that he and his forefathers would never have found out that for themselves  it was too great a discovery for man to make  god must have showed it to them  god had showed his word to jacob his statutes and ordinances to israel  he had not done so to any other nation neither had the heathen knowledge of his laws  and therefore they did not trust god they did not consider him a good god and so they worshipped baalim the sun and moon and stars with silly and foul ceremonies to procure from them good harvests and burnt their children in the fire to moloch the fireking to keep off the earthquakes and the floods god had not taught them what he had taught israelto trust in him and in his word which ran very swiftly and in his laws which could not be broken  a faith which my friends we must do our best to keep up in ourselves and in our children after us  for it is very easy to lose it this faith in god  we are tempted to lose it all our lives long  our forefathers in the days of popery lost it and because they did not trust in god as a good god who took good care of the world which he had made they fell to believing that the devil and witches the servants of the devil could raise storms blight crops strike cattle and human beings with disease  and they began too to pray not to god but to certain saints in heaven to protect them against bodily ills  one saint could cure one disease and one another one saint protected the cattle another kept off thunder and so forthi will not tell you more lest i should tempt you to smile in this holy place and tempt you too to look down on your forefathers who though they made these mistakes were just as honest and virtuous men as we  and even lately up to this very time there are those who have not full faith in god though they be good and pious persons and good protestants too who would shrink with horror from worshipping saints or any being save god alone  but they are apt to shut their eyes to the beauty and order of gods world and to the glory of god set forth therein and to excuse themselves by quoting unfairly texts of scripture  they say that this world is all out of joint corrupt and cursed for adams sin  yet where it is out of joint and where it is corrupt they cannot show  and as for its being cursed for adams sin that is a dream which is contradicted by holy scripture itself  for see  we read in genesis iii 17 cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee  now that the ground does not now bring forth thorns and thistles to us we know  for it brings forth whatsoever fair flower or useful herb we plant therein according to the laws of nature which are the laws of god  neither do men eat thereof in sorrow but as solomon says eat their bread in joyfulness of heart  and so did they in the psalmists days who never speak of the tillage of the land without some expression of faith and confidence and thankfulness to that god who crowns the year with his goodness and his clouds drop fatness while the hills rejoice on every side and the valleys stand so thick with corn that they laugh and singof faith i say and gratitude toward that god who brings forth the grass for the cattle and green herb for the service of men who brings food out of the earth and wine to make glad the heart of man and oil to give him a cheerful countenance and bread to strengthen mans heart  those wellknown words are in the 104th psalm and i ask any reasonable person to read that psalm throughthe psalm which contains the jewish natural theology the jews view of this world and of gods will and dealings with itand then say could a man have written it who thought that there was any curse upon this earth on account of mans sin  but more  the book of genesis says that there is none for after it has said in the third chapter cursed is the ground for thy sake it says again in the eighth chapter verse 21 and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground for mans sake  while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest cold and heat summer and winter shall not cease  can any words be plainer  whatever the curse in adams days may have been does not the book of genesis represent it as being formally abrogated and taken away in the days of noah that the regular course of nature fruitful and beneficent might endure thenceforth  accordingly we hear no more in the bible anywhere of this same curse  we hear instead the very opposite for one says in the 119th psalm speaking indeed of god o lord thy word endureth for ever in heaven  thy truth also remaineth from one generation to another thou hast laid the foundation of the earth and it abideth  they continue this day according to thine ordinance  for all things serve thee  and so in the 148th psalm another speaks by the spirit of god let all things praise the name of the lord  for he commanded and they were created  he hath also established them for ever and ever  he hath given them a law which shall not be broken  yes my friends gods law shall not be broken and it is not broken and that faith that the laws which govern the whole material universe cannot be broken will be to us faith full of hope and joy and confidence if we will remember with the psalmist that they are the laws of the living god and of the good god  they are the laws of the living god  not the laws of nature or fate or necessityall three words which mean little or nothingbut of a living god in whom we live and move and have our being whose wordthe creating organizing inspiring wordrunneth very swiftly making all things to obey god and not themselves  and they are the laws of a good god of a moral god of a generous loving just and merciful god who as the psalmist reminds us and that is the reason of his confidence and his joy while he telleth the number of the stars and calleth them all by their names condescends at the same time to heal those who are broken in heart of a god who while he giveth fodder to the cattle and feedeth the young ravens who call on him at the same time careth for those who fear him and put their trust in his mercy of a god who while his power is great and his wisdom infinite at the same time sets up the meek and brings the ungodly down to the ground of a father in heaven who is perfect in thisthat he sends his sun and rain alike on the just and the unjust and is good to the unthankful and the evil of a father lastly who so loved the world that he spared not his onlybegotten son but freely gave him for us and has committed to that son all power in heaven and earthall power over the material world which we call nature as well as over the moral world which is the hearts and spirits of mento that word of god who runneth very swiftly who is sharper than a twoedged sword and yet more tender than the love of woman even jesus christ the saviour the word of god who was in the beginning with god and was god by whom all things were made who is the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world if by any means he will receive the light of god and see thereby the true and wise laws of nature and of spirit  this is our god  this is he who sends food and wealth rain and sunshine  shall we not trust him  if we thank him for plenty and fine weather which we see to be blessings without doubt shall we not trust him for scarcity and bad weather which do not seem to us to be blessings and yet may be blessings nevertheless  shall we not believe that his very chastisements are mercies  shall we not accept them in faith as the child takes from its parents hand bitter medicine the use of which it cannot see but takes it in faith that its parent knows best and that its parents purpose is only love and benevolence  shall we not say with jobthough he slay me yet will i trust in him  he cannot mean my harm he must mean my good and the good of all mankind  he musteven by such seeming calamities as great rains or failure of cropseven by them he must be benefiting mankind  recollect as a single instance that the great rains of 1860 which terrified so many are proved now to have saved some thousands of lives in england from fever and similar diseases  take courage and have as the old psalmist had faith in god  believe that nothing goes wrong in this world save through the sin and folly and ignorance of man that god is always right always wise always benevolent  and be sure that you each and all are    safe in the hand of one disposing power or in the natal or the mortal hour all nature is but art unknown to thee all chance discretion which thou can it not see all discord harmony not understood all partial evil universal good and spite of pride in erring reasons spite one truth is clearwhatever is is right   and pray to god that he may fill you with his spirit the spirit of wisdom and understanding of knowledge and grace of the lord and show to you as he showed to the jews of old his laws and judgments and so teach you how to see that the only thing on earth which is not right isthe sin of man
