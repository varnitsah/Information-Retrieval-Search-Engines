the very rats badgers and hedgehogs seem to have died of drought and there was scarce a wind in the parched leaves  teig then you have brought no dinner  shemus after that i sat among the beggars at the crossroads and held a hollow hand among the others  mary what did you beg  shemus i had no chance to beg for when the beggars saw me they cried out they would not have another share their alms and hunted me away with sticks and stones  teig you said that you would bring us food or money  shemus whats in the house  teig a bit of mouldy bread  mary theres flour enough to make another loaf  teig and when thats gone  mary there is the hen in the coop  shemus my curse upon the beggars my curse upon them  teig and the last penny gone  shemus when the hens gone what can we do but live on sorrel and dock and dandelion till our mouths are green  mary god that to this hours found bit and sup will cater for us still  shemus his kitchens bare there were five doors that i looked through this day and saw the dead and not a soul to wake them  mary maybe hed have us die because he knows when the ear is stopped and when the eye is stopped that every wicked sight is hid from the eye and all fool talk from the ear  shemus whos passing there and mocking us with music  a stringed instrument without  teig a young man plays it theres an old woman and a lady with him  shemus what is the trouble of the poor to her nothing at all or a harsh radishy sauce for the days meat  mary gods pity on the rich had we been through as many doors and seen the dishes standing on the polished wood in the wax candle light wed be as hard and theres the needles eye at the end of all  shemus my curse upon the rich  teig theyre coming here  shemus then down upon that stool down quick i say and call up a whey face and a whining voice and let your head be bowed upon your knees  mary had i but time to put the place to rights  cathleen oona and aleel enter  cathleen god save all here there is a certain house an old grey castle with a kitchen garden a cider orchard and a plot for flowers somewhere among these woods  mary we know it lady a place thats set among impassable walls as though worlds trouble could not find it out  cathleen it may be that we are that trouble for we although weve wandered in the wood this hour have lost it too yet i should know my way for i lived all my childhood in that house  mary then you are countess cathleen  cathleen and this woman oona my nurse should have remembered it for we were happy for a long time there  oona the paths are overgrown with thickets now or else some change has come upon my sight  cathleen and this young man that should have known the woods because we met him on their border but now wandering and singing like a wave of the sea is so wrapped up in dreams of terrors to come that he can give no help  mary you have still some way but i can put you on the trodden path your servants take when they are marketing but first sit down and rest yourself awhile for my old fathers served your fathers lady longer than books can telland it were strange if you and yours should not be welcome here  cathleen and it were stranger still were i ungrateful for such kind welcome but i must be gone for the nights gathering in  shemus it is a long while since ive set eyes on bread or on what buys it  cathleen so you are starving even in this wood where i had thought i would find nothing changed but thats a dream for the old worm o the world can eat its way  into what place it pleases  she gives money  teig beautiful lady give me something too i fell but now being weak with hunger and thirst and lay upon the threshold like a log  cathleen i gave for all and that was all i had look my purse is empty i have passed by starving men and women all this day and they have had the rest but take the purse the silver clasps ont may be worth a trifle but if youll come tomorrow to my house you shall have twice the sum  aleel begins to play  shemus muttering what music music  cathleen ah do not blame the finger on the string the doctors bid me fly the unlucky times and find distraction for my thoughts or else pine to my grave  shemus i have said nothing lady why should the like of us complain  oona have done sorrows that shes but read of in a book weigh on her mind as if they had been her own  oona mary and cathleen go out aleel looks defiantly at shemus  aleel singing impetuous heart be still be still your sorrowful love can never be told cover it up with a lonely tune he that could bend all things to his will has covered the door of the infinite fold with the pale stars and the wandering moon  he takes a step towards the door and then turns again  shut to the door before the night has fallen for who can say what walks or in what shape some devilish creature flies in the air but now two greyhorned owls hooted above our heads  he goes out his singing dies away mary comes in shemus has been counting the money  teig theres no good luck in owls but it may be that the ill lucks to fall upon their heads  mary you never thanked her ladyship  shemus thank her for seven halfpence and a silver bit  teig but for this empty purse  shemus whats that for thanks or whats the double of it that she promised with bread and flesh and every sort of food up to a price no man has heard the like of and rising every day   mary we have all she had she emptied out the purse before our eyes  shemus to mary who has gone to close the door leave that door open  mary when those that have read books and seen the seven wonders of the world fear whats above or whats below the ground its time that poverty should bolt the door  shemus ill have no bolts for there is not a thing that walks above the ground or under it i had not rather welcome to this house than any more of mankind rich or poor  teig so that they brought us money  shemus i heard say theres something that appears like a white bird a pigeon or a seagull or the like but if you hit it with a stone or a stick it clangs as though it had been made of brass and that if you dig down where it was scratching youll find a crock of gold  teig but dream of gold for three nights running and theres always gold  shemus you might be starved before youve dug it out  teig but maybe if you called something would come they have been seen of late  mary is it call devils call devils from the wood call them in here  shemus so youd stand up against me and youd say who or what i am to welcome here  he hits her  that is to show whos master  teig call them in  mary god help us all  shemus pray if you have a mind to its little that the sleepy ears above care for your words but ill call what i please  teig there is many a one they say had money from them   shemus at door whatever you are that walk the woods at night so be it that you have not shouldered up out of a gravefor ill have nothing human and have free hands a friendly trick of speech i welcome you come sit beside the fire what matter if your heads below your arms or youve a horses tail to whip your flank feathers instead of hair thats but a straw come share what bread and meat is in the house and stretch your heels and warm them in the ashes and after that lets share and share alike and curse all men and women come in come in what is there no one there  turning from door  and yet they say they are as common as the grass and ride even upon the book in the priests hand  teig lifts one arm slowly and points toward the door and begins moving backwards shemus turns he also sees something and begins moving backward mary does the same  a man dressed as an eastern merchant comes in carrying a small carpet he unrolls it and sits crosslegged at one end of it  another man dressed in the same way follows and sits at the other end this is done slowly and deliberately when they are seated they take money out of embroidered purses at their girdles and begin arranging it on the carpet  teig you speak to them  shemus no you  teig twas you that called them  shemus coming nearer id make so bold if you would pardon it to ask if theres a thing youd have of us although we are but poor people if there is why if there is  first merchant weve travelled a long road for we are merchants that must tramp the world and now we look for supper and a fire and a safe corner to count money in  shemus i thought you were but thats no matter now there had been words between my wife and me because i said i would be master here and ask in what i pleased or who i pleased and so but that is nothing to the point because its certain that you are but merchants  first merchant we travel for the master of all merchants  shemus yet if you were that i had thought but now id welcome you no less be what you please and youll have supper at the market rate that means that what was sold for but a penny is now worth fifty  merchants begin putting money on carpet  first merchant our master bids us pay so good a price that all who deal with us shall eat drink and be merry  shemus to mary bestir yourself go kill and draw the fowl while teig and i lay out the plates and make a better fire  mary i will not cook for you  shemus not cook not cook do not be angry she wants to pay me back because i struck her in that argument but shell get sense again since the dearth came we rattle one on another as though we were knives thrown into a basket to be cleaned  mary i will not cook for you because i know in what unlucky shape you sat but now outside this door  teig its this your honours because of some wild words my father said she thinks you are not of those who cast a shadow  shemus i said id make the devils of the wood welcome if theyd a mind to eat and drink but it is certain that you are men like us  first merchant its strange that she should think we cast no shadow for there is nothing on the ridge of the world thats more substantial than the merchants are that buy and sell you  mary if you are not demons and seeing what great wealth is spread out there give food or money to the starving poor  first merchant if we knew how to find deserving poor wed do our share  mary but seek them patiently  first merchant we know the evils of mere charity  mary those scruples may befit a common time i had thought there was a pushing to and fro at times like this that overset the scale and trampled measure down  first merchant but if already wed thought of a more prudent way than that  second merchant if each one brings a bit of merchandise well give him such a price he never dreamt of  mary where shall the starving come at merchandise  first merchant we will ask nothing but what all men have  mary their swine and cattle fields and implements are sold and gone  first merchant they have not sold all yet for theres a vaporous thingthat may be nothing but thats the buyers riska second self they call immortal for a storys sake  shemus you come to buy our souls  teig ill barter mine why should we starve for what may be but nothing  mary teig and shemus  shemus what can it be but nothing what has god poured out of his bag but famine satan gives money  teig yet no thunder stirs  first merchant there is a heap for each  shemus goes to take money  but no not yet for theres a work i have to set you to  shemus so then youre as deceitful as the rest and all that talk of buying whats but a vapour is fancy bred i might have known as much because thats how the trickotheloop man talks  first merchant thats for the work each has its separate price but neither price is paid till the works done  teig the same for me  mary oh god why are you still  first merchant youve but to cry aloud at every crossroad at every house door that we buy mens souls and give so good a price that all may live in mirth and comfort till the famines done because we are christian men  shemus come lets away  treig i shall keep running till ive earned the price  second merchant who has risen and gone towards fire stop for we obey a generous master that would be served by comfortable men and heres your entertainment on the road  trig and shemus have stopped teig takes the money they go out  mary destroyers of souls god will destroy you quickly you shall at last dry like dry leaves and hang nailed like dead vermin to the doors of god  second merchant curse to your fill for saints will have their dreams  first merchantm though were but vermin that our master sent to overrun the world he at the end shall pull apart the pale ribs of the moon and quench the stars in the ancestral night  mary god is all powerful  second merchant pray you shall need him you shall eat dock and grass and dandelion till that low threshold there becomes a wall and when your hands can scarcely drag your body we shall be near you  mary faints the first merchant takes up the carpet spreads it before the fire and stands in front of it warming his hands  first merchant our faces go unscratched for she has fainted wring the neck o that fowl scatter the flour and search the shelves for bread well turn the fowl upon the spit and roast it and eat the supper we were bidden to now that the house is quiet praise our master and stretch and warm our heels among the ashes                      end of scene 1     scene 2  front scenea wood with perhaps distant view of turreted house at one side but all in flat colour without light and shade and against a diafiered or gold background  countess cathleen comes in leaning upon aleels arm oona follows them  cathleen stopping surely this leafy corner where one smells the wild bees honey has a story too  oona there is the house at last  aleel a man they say loved maeve the queen of all the invisible host and died of his love nine centuries ago and now when the moons riding at the full she leaves her dancers lonely and lies there upon that level place and for three days stretches and sighs and wets her long pale cheeks  cathleen so she loves truly  aleel no but wets her cheeks lady because she has forgot his name  cathleen shed sleep that trouble awaythough it must be a heavy trouble to forget his name if she had better sense  oona your own house lady  aleel she sleeps high up on wintry knocknarea in an old cairn of stones while her poor women must lie and jog in the wave if they would sleep being water bornyet if she cry their names they run up on the land and dance in the moon till they are giddy and would love as men do and be as patient and as pitiful but there is nothing that will stop in their heads theyve such poor memories though they weep for it oh yes they weep thats when the moon is full  cathleen is it because they have short memories they live so long  aleel whats memory but the ash that chokes our fires that have begun to sink and theyve a dizzy everlasting fire  oona there is your own house lady  cathleen why thats true and wed have passed it without noticing  aleel a curse upon it for a meddlesome house had it but stayed away i would have known what queen maeve thinks on when the moon is pinched and whether nowas in the old daysthe dancers set their brief love on men  oona rest on my arm these are no thoughts for any christian ear  aleel i am younger she would be too heavy for you  he begins taking his lute out of the bag cathleen who has turned towards oona turns back to him  this hollow box remembers every foot that danced upon the level grass of the world and will tell secrets if i whisper to it sings lift up the white knee thats what they sing those young dancers that in a ring raved but now of the hearts that break long long ago for their sake  oona new friends are sweet  aleel but the dance changes  lift up the gown all that sorrow is trodden down  oona the empty rattlepate lean on this arm that i can tell you is a christened arm and not like some if we are to judge by speech but as you please it is time i was forgot maybe it is not on this arm you slumbered when you were as helpless as a worm  aleel stay with me till we come to your own house  cathleen sitting down when i am rested i will need no help  aleel i thought to have kept her from remembering  the evil of the times for full ten minutes but now when seven are out you come between  oona talk on what does it matter what you say for you have not been christened  aleel old woman old woman you robbed her of three minutes peace of mind and though you live unto a hundred years and wash the feet of beggars and give alms and climb croaghpatrick you shall not be pardoned  oona how does a man who never was baptized know what heaven pardons  aleel you are a sinful woman  oona i care no more than if a pig had grunted  enter cathleens steward  steward i am not to blame for i had locked the gate the foresters to blame the men climbed in at the east corner where the elmtree is  cathleen i do not understand you who has climbed  steward then god be thanked i am the first to tell you i was afraid some other of the servants though ive been on the watchhad been the first and mixed up truth and lies your ladyship  cathleen rising has some misfortune happened  steward yes indeed the forester that let the branches lie against the walls to blame for everything for that is how the rogues got into the garden  cathleen i thought to have escaped misfortune here has any one been killed   steward oh no not killed they have stolen half a cartload of green cabbage  cathleen but maybe they were starving  steward that is certain to rob or starve that was the choice they had  cathleen a learned theologian has laid down that starving men may take whats necessary and yet be sinless  oona sinless and a thief there should be broken bottles on the wall  cathleen and if it be a sin while faiths unbroken god cannot help but pardon there is no soul but its unlike all others in the world nor one but lifts a strangeness to gods love till thats grown infinite and therefore none whose loss were less than irremediable although it were the wickedest in the world  enter teig and shemus  steward what are you running for pull off your cap do you not see whos there  shemus i cannot wait i am running to the world with the best news that has been brought it for a thousand years  steward then get your breath and speak  shemus if youd my news youd run as fast and be as out of breath  teig such news we shall be carried on mens shoulders  shemus theres something every man has carried with him and thought no more about than if it were a mouthful of the wind and now its grown a marketable thing  teig and yet it seemed as useless as the paring of ones nails  shemus what sets me laughing when i think of it is that a rogue whos lain in lousy straw if he but sell it may set up his coach  teig laughing there are two gentlemen who buy mens souls  cathleen o god  teig and maybe theres no soul at all  steward theyre drunk or mad  teig look at the price they give showing money  shemus tossing up money go cry it all about the world they said money for souls good money for a soul  cathleen give twice and thrice and twenty times their money and get your souls again i will pay all  shemus not we not we for soulsif there are souls but keep the flesh out of its merriment i shall be drunk and merry  teig come lets away  he goes   cathleen but theres a world to come  shemus and if there is id rather trust myself into the hands that can pay money down than to the hands that have but shaken famine from the bag  he goes out r  lilting theres money for a soul sweet yellow money theres money for mens souls good money money  cathleen to aleel go call them here again bring them by force  beseech them bribe do anything you like  aleel goes   and you too follow add your prayers to his  oona who has been praying goes out  steward you know the secrets of my house how much have i  steward a hundred kegs of gold  cathleen how much have i in castles  steward as much more  cathleen how much have i in pasture  steward as much more  cathleen how much have i in forests  steward as much more  cathleen keeping this house alone sell all i have go barter where you please but come again with herds of cattle and with ships of meal  steward gods blessing light upon your ladyship you will have saved the land  cathleen make no delay  he goes l  aleel and oona return  cathleen they have not come speak quickly  aleel one drew his knife and said that he would kill the man or woman that stopped his way and when i would have stopped him he made this stroke at me but it is nothing  cathleen you shall be tended from this day for ever ill have no joy or sorrow of my own  oona their eyes shone like the eyes of birds of prey  cathleen come follow me for the earth burns my feet till i have changed my house to such a refuge that the old and ailing and all weak of heart may escape from beak and claw all all shall come till the walls burst and the roof fall on us from this day out i have nothing of my own  she goes  oona taking aleel by the arm and as she speaks bandaging his wound she has found something now to put her hand to and you and i are of no more account than flies upon a windowpane in the winter  they go out                       end of scene 2     scene 3  scenehall in the house of countess cathleen at the left an oratory with steps leading up to it at the right a tapestried wall more or less repeating the form of the oratory and a great chair with its back against the wall in the centre are two or more arches through which one can see dimly the trees of the garden cathleen is kneeling in front of the altar in the oratory there is a hanging lighted lamp over the altar aleel enters  aleel i have come to bid you leave this castle and fly out of these woods  cathleen what evil is there here that is not everywhere from this to the sea  aleel they who have sent me walk invisible  cathleen so it is true what i have heard men say that you have seen and heard what others cannot  aleel i was asleep in my bed and while i slept my dream became a fire and in the fire one walked and he had birds about his head  cathleen i have heard that one of the old gods walked so  aleel it may be that he is angelical and lady he bids me call you from these woods and you must bring but your old fostermother and some few serving men and live in the hills among the sounds of music and the light of waters till the evil days are done for here some terrible death is waiting you some unimagined evil some great darkness that fable has not dreamt of nor sun nor moon scattered  cathleen no not angelical  aleel this house you are to leave with some old trusty man and bid him shelter all that starve or wander while there is food and house room  cathleen he bids me go where none of mortal creatures but the swan dabbles and there you would pluck the harp when the trees had made a heavy shadow about our door and talk among the rustling of the reeds when night hunted the foolish sun away with stillness and pale tapers nonono i cannot although i weep i do not weep because that life would be most happy and here i find no way no end nor do i weep because i had longed to look upon your face but that a night of prayer has made me weary  aleel prostrating himself before her let him that made mankind the angels and devils and death and plenty mend what he has made for when we labour in vain and eye still sees heart breaks in vain  cathleen how would that quiet end  aleel how but in healing  cathleen you have seen my tears and i can see your hand shake on the floor  aleel faltering i thought but of healing he was angelical  cathleen turning away from him no not angelical but of the old gods who wander about the world to waken the heart the passionate proud heartthat all the angels leaving nine heavens empty would rock to sleep  she goes to chapel door aleel holds his clasped hands towards her for a moment hesitating and then lets them fall beside him  cathleen do not hold out to me beseeching hands this heart shall never waken on earth i have sworn by her whose heart the seven sorrows have pierced to pray before this altar until my heart has grown to heaven like a tree and there rustled its leaves till heaven has saved my people  aleel who has risen when one so great has spoken of love to one so little as i though to deny him love what can he but hold out beseeching hands then let them fall beside him knowing how greatly they have overdared  he goes towards the door of the hall the countess cathleen takes a few steps towards him   cathleen if the old tales are true queens have wed shepherds and kings beggarmaids gods procreant waters flowing about your mind have made you more than kings or queens and not you but i am the empty pitcher  aleel being silent i have said all yet let me stay beside you  cathleenno no not while my heart is shaken no but you shall hear wind cry and water cry and curlews cry and have the peace i longed for  aleel give me your hand to kiss  cathleen i kiss your forehead and yet i send you from me do not speak there have been women that bid men to rob crowns from the countryunderwave or apples          upon a dragonguarded hill and all that they might sift mens hearts and wills and trembled as they bid it as i tremble that lay a hard task on you that you go and silently and do not turn your head goodbye but do not turn your head and look above all else i would not have you look  aleel goes  i never spoke to him of his wounded hand and now he is gone  she looks out  i cannot see him for all is dark outside would my imagination and my heart were as little shaken as this holy flame  she goes slowly into the chapel  the two merchants enter first merchant although i bid you rob her treasury i find you sitting drowsed and motionless and yet you understand that while its full shell bid against us and so bribe the poor that our great masterll lack his merchandise you know that she has brought into this house the old and ailing that are pinched the most at such a time and so should be bought cheap youve seen us sitting in the house in the wood while the snails crawled about the windowpane and the mud floor  and not a soul to buy not even the wandering fools nor one of those that when the world goes wrong must rave and talk until they are as thin as a cats ear but all thats nothing you sit drowsing there with your back hooked your chin upon your knees  second merchant how could i help it for she prayed so hard i could not cross the threshold till her lover had turned her thoughts to dream  first merchant well well to labour there is the treasury door and time runs on  second merchant goes out first merchant sits crosslegged against a pillar yawns and stretches  first merchant and so i must endure the weight of the world far from my master and the revelry thats lasted sinceshaped as a wormhe bore the knowledgable pippin in his mouth to the first woman  second merchant returns with bags  where are those dancers gone they knew they were to carry it on their backs  second merchant i heard them breathing but a moment since but now they are gone being unsteadfast things  first merchant they knew their work it seems that they imagine wed do such wrong to our great masters name as to bear burdens on our backs as men do ill call them and wholl dare to disobey come all you elemental populace from cruachan and finbars ancient house come break up the long dance under the hill or if you lie in the hollows of the sea leave lonely the long hoarding surges leave the cymbals of the waves to clash alone and shaking the seatangles from your hair gather about us  the spirits gather under the arches  second merchant they come be still a while  spirits dance and sing  first spirit singing our hearts are sore but we come because we have heard you call  second spirit sorrow has made me dumb  first spirit her shepherds at nightfall lay many a plate and cup down by the trodden brink that when the dance break up we may have meat and drink therefore our hearts are sore and though we have heard and come our crying filled the shore  second spirit sorrow has made me dumb  first merchant what lies in the waves should be indifferent to good and evil and yet it seems that these forgetful of their pure impartial sea take sides with her  second merchant hush hush and still your feet you are not now upon maeves dancingfloor  a spirit o look what i have found a string of pearls  they begin taking jewels out of bag  second merchant you must not touch them put them in the bag and now take up the bags upon your backs and carry them to shemus ruas house on the woods border  spirits no no no no  first spirit no no let us away from this we shall not come cry out to us who may  second spirit sorrow has made me dumb  they go  second merchant theyre gone for little do they care for me and if i called they would but turn and mock but you they dare not disobey  first merchant rising these dancers are always the most troublesome of spirits  he comes down the stage and stands facing the arches he makes a gesture of command the spirits come back whimpering they lift the bags and go out three speak as they are taking ub the bags  first spirit from this day out well never dance again  second spirit never again  third spirit sorrow has made me dumb  second merchant looking into chapel door she has heard nothing she has fallen asleep  our lord would be well pleased if we could win  her now that the winds are heavy with our kind might we not kill her and bear off her spirit before the mob of angels were astir  first merchant if we would win this turquoise for our lord it must go dropping down of its free will but ive a plan  second merchant to take her soul tonight  first merchant because i am of the ninth and mightiest hell where are all kings i have a plan  voices  second merchant too late for somebody is stirring in the house the noise that the sea creatures made as they came hither their singing and their endless chattering has waked the house i hear the chairs pushed back and many shuffling feet all the old men and women shes gathered in the house are coming hither  a voice within it was here  another voice no farther away  another voice it was in the western tower  another voice come quickly we will search the western tower  first merchant we still have timethey search the distant rooms  second merchant brother i heard a sound in therea sound that troubles me  going to the door of the oratory and peering through it upon the altar steps the countess tosses murmuring in her sleep a broken paternoster  first merchant do not fear for when she has awaked the prayer will cease  second merchant what would you wake her  first merchant i will speak with her and mix with all her thoughts a thought to serve lady weve news thats crying out for speech  cathleen wakes and comes to door of the chapel  cathleen who calls  first merchant we have brought news  cathleen what are you  first merchant we are merchants and we know the book of the world because we have walked upon its leaves and there have read of late matters that much concern you and noticing the castle door stand open came in to find an ear  cathleen the door stands open that no one who is famished or afraid despair of help or of a welcome with it but you have news you say  first merchant we saw a man heavy with sickness in the bog of allen whom you had bid buy cattle near fair head we saw your grain ships lying all becalmed in the dark night and not less still than they burned all their mirrored lanthorns in the sea  cathleen my thanks to god to mary and the angels that i have money in my treasury and can buy grain from those who have stored it up to prosper on the hunger of the poor but youve been far and know the signs of things when will this yellow vapour no more hang and creep about the fields and this great heat vanish away and grass show its green shoots  first merchant there is no sign of changeday copies day green things are deadthe cattle too are dead or dyingand on all the vapour hangs and fattens with disease and glows with heat in you is all the hope of all the land  cathleen and heard you of the demons who buy souls  first merchant there are some men who hold they have wolves heads and say their limbsdried by the infinite flame have all the speed of storms others again say they are gross and little while a few will have it they seem much as mortals are but tall and brown and travelledlike uslady yet all agree a power is in their looks that makes men bow and flings a castingnet about their souls and that all men would go and barter those poor vapours were it not you bribe them with the safety of your gold  cathleen praise be to god to mary and the angels that i am wealthy wherefore do they sell  first merchant as we came in at the great door we saw your porter sleeping in his nichea soul too little to be worth a hundred pence and yet they buy it for a hundred crowns but for a soul like yours i heard them say they would give five hundred thousand crowns and more  cathleen how can a heap of crowns pay for a soul is the green grave so terrible a thing  first merchant some sell because the money gleams and some because they are in terror of the grave and some because their neighbours sold before and some because there is a kind of joy in casting hope away in losing joy in ceasing all resistance in at last opening ones arms to the eternal flames  in casting all sails out upon the wind to thisfull of the gaiety of the lost would all folk hurry if your gold were gone  cathleen there is something merchant in your voice that makes me fear when you were telling how a man may lose his soul and lose his god your eyes were lighted up and when you told how my poor money serves the people both merchants forgive meseemed to smile  first merchant mans sins move us to laughter only we have seen so many lands and seen so many men how strange that all these people should be swung as on a ladys shoestringunder them the glowing leagues of neverending flame  cathleen there is a something in you that i fear a something not of us but were you not born in some most distant corner of the world  the second merchant who has been listening at the door comes forward and as he comes a sound of voices and feet is heard  second merchant away nowthey are in the passagehurry for they will know us and freeze up our hearts with ave marys and burn all our skin with holy water  first merchant farewell for we must ride many a mile before the morning come our horses beat the ground impatiently  they go out a number of peasants enter by other door  first peasant forgive us lady but we heard a noise  second peasant we sat by the fireside telling vanities  first peasant we heard a noise but though we have searched the house we have found nobody  cathleen you are too timid for now you are safe from all the evil times there is no evil that can find you here  oona entering hurriedly ochone ochone the treasure room is broken in the door stands open and the gold is gone  peasants raise a lamentable cry  cathleen be silent  the cry ceases  have you seen nobody  oona ochone that my good mistress should lose all this money  cathleen let those among younot too old to ride get horses and search all the country round ill give a farm to him who finds the thieves  a man with keys at his girdle has come in while she speaks there is a general murmur of the porter the porter  porter demons were here i sat beside the door in my stone niche and two owls passed me by whispering with human voices  old peasant god forsakes us  cathleen old man old man he never closed a door unless one opened i am desolate for a most sad resolve wakes in my heart but i have still my faith therefore be silent for surely he does not forsake the world but stands before it modelling in the clay and moulding there his image age by age the clay wars with his fingers and pleads hard for its old heavy dull and shapeless ease but sometimesthough his hand is on it still it moves awry and demon hordes are born  peasants cross themselves  yet leave me now for i am desolate i hear a whisper from beyond the thunder  she comes from the oratory door  yet stay an instant when we meet again i may have grown forgetful oona take these twothe larder and the dairy keys  to the porter  but take you this it opens the small room of herbs for medicine of hellebore of vervain monkshood plantain and selfheal the book of cures is on the upper shelf  porter why do you do this lady did you see your coffin in a dream  cathleen ah no not that a sad resolve wakes in me i have heard a sound of wailing in unnumbered hovels and i must go down downi know not where pray for all men and women mad from famine pray you good neighbours  the peasants all kneel countess cathleen ascends the steps to the door of the oratory and turning round stands there motionless for a little and then cries in a loud voice  mary queen of angels and all you clouds on clouds of saints farewell                     end of scene 3     scene 4  scenea wood near the castle as in scene 2  the spirits pass one by one carrying bags  first spirit ill never dance another step not

souls tomorrow  second merchant what has she in her coffers now but mice  first merchant when the night fell and i had shaped myself into the image of the manheaded owl i hurried to the cliffs of donegal and saw with all their canvas full of wind and rushing through the particoloured sea those ships that bring the woman grain and meal theyre but three days from us  second merchant when the dew

their leathern gloves  first merchant five hundred thousand crowns we give the price the gold is here the souls even while you speak have slipped out of our bond because your face has shed a light on them and filled their hearts but you must sign for we omit no form in buying a soul like yours  second merchant sign with this quill it was a feather growing on the cock that crowed when peter dared deny his master and all who use it have great honour in hell  cathleen leans forward to sign  aleel rushing forward and snatching the parchment from her leave all things to the builder of the heavens  cathleen i have no thoughts i hear a crya cry  aleel casting the parchment on the ground i have seen a vision under a green hedge a hedge of hips and hawsmen yet shall hear the archangels rolling satans empty skull over the mountaintops  first merchant take him away  teig and shemus drag him roughly away so that he falls upon the floor among the peasants cathleen picks up parchment and signs then turns towards the peasants  cathleen take up the money and now come with me when we are far from this polluted place i will give everybody money enough  she goes out the peasants crowding round her and kissing her dress aleel and the two merchants are left alone  second merchant we must away and wait until she dies sitting above her tower as two grey owls waiting as many years as may be guarding our precious jewel waiting to seize her soul  first merchant we need but hover over her head in the air for she has only minutes when she signed her heart began to break hush hush i hear the brazen door of hell move on its hinges and the eternal revelry float hither to hearten us  second merchant leap feathered on the air and meet them with her soul caught in your claws  they rush out aleel crawls into the middle of the room the twilight has fallen and gradually darkens as the scene goes on there is a distant muttering of thunder and a sound of rising storm  aleel the brazen door stands wide and balor comes borne in his heavy car and demons have lifted the ageweary eyelids from the eyes that of old turned gods to stone barach the traitor comes and the lascivious race cailitin that cast a druid weakness and decay over sualtems and old decteras child and that great king hell first took hold upon when he killed naisi and broke deirdres heart and all their heads are twisted to one side for when they lived they warred on beauty and peace with obstinate crafty sidelong bitterness he moves about as though the air was full of spirits oona enters  crouch down old heron out of the blind storm  oona where is the countess cathleen all this day her eyes were full of tears and when for a moment her hand was laid upon my hand it trembled and now i do not know where she is gone  aleel cathleen has chosen other friends than us and they are rising through the hollow world demons are out old heron  oona god guard her soul  aleel shes bartered it away this very hour as though we two were never in the world and they are rising through the hollow world  he points downward  first orchill her pale beautiful head alive her body shadowy as vapour drifting under the dawn for she who awoke desire has but a heart of blood when others die about her is a vapoury multitude     of women alluring devils with soft laughter behind her a host heat of the blood made sin but all the little pinkwhite nails have grown to be great talons  he seizes oona and drags her into the middle of the room and points downward with vehement gestures the wind roars  they begin a song and there is still some music on their tongues  oona casting herself face downwards on the floor o maker of all protect her from the demons and if a soul must need be lost take mine  aleel kneels beside her but does not seem to hear her words the peasants return they carry the countess cathleen and lay her upon the ground before oona and aleel she lies there as if dead  oona o that so many pitchers of rough clay should prosper and the porcelain break in two  she kisses the hands of cathleen  a peasant we were under the tree where the path turns when she grew pale as death and fainted away and while we bore her hither cloudy gusts blackened the world and shook us on our feet draw the great bolt for no man has beheld so black bitter blinding and sudden a storm  one who is near the door draws the bolt  cathleen o hold me and hold me tightly for the storm is dragging me away  oona takes her in her arms a woman begins to wail  peasant hush  peasants hush  peasant women hush  other peasant women hush  cathleen half rising lay all the bags of money in a heap and when i am gone old oona share them out to every man and woman judge and give according to their needs  a peasant woman and will she give enough to keep my children through the dearth  another peasant woman o queen of heaven and all you blessed saints let us and ours be lost so she be shriven  cathleen bend down your faces oona and aleel i gaze upon them as the swallow gazes upon the nest under the eave before she wander the loud waters do not weep too great a while for there is many a candle on the high altar though one fall aleel who sang about the dancers of the woods that know not the hard burden of the world having but breath in their kind bodies farewell and farewell oona you who played with me and bore me in your arms about the house when i was but a child and therefore happy therefore happy even like those that dance the storm is in my hair and i must go  she dies  oona bring me the lookingglass  a woman brings it to her out of the inner room oona holds it over the lips of cathleen all is silent for a moment and then she speaks in a half scream  o she is dead  a peasant she was the great white lily of the world  a peasant she was more beautiful than the pale stars  an old peasant woman the little plant i love is broken in two  aleel takes lookingglass from oona and flings it upon the floor so that it is broken in many pieces  aleel i shatter you in fragments for the face that brimmed you up with beauty is no more and die dull heart for she whose mournful words made you a living spirit has passed away and left you but a ball of passionate dust and you proud earth and plumy sea fade out for you may hear no more her faltering feet but are left lonely amid the clamorous war of angels upon devils  he stands up almost every one is kneeling but it has grown so dark that only confused forms can be seen  and i who weep call curses on you time and fate and change and have no excellent hope but the great hour when you shall plunge headlong through bottomless space  a flash of lightning followed immediately by thunder  a peasant woman pull him upon his knees before his curses have plucked thunder and lightning on our heads  aleel angels and devils clash in the middle air and brazen swords clang upon brazen helms  a flash of lightning followed immediately by thunder  yonder a bright spear cast out of a sling has torn through balors eye and the dark clans fly screaming as they fled moytura of old  everything is lost in darkness  an old man the almighty wrath at our great weakness and sin has blotted out the world and we must die  the darkness is broken by a visionary light the peasants seem to be kneeling upon the rocky slope of a mountain and vapour full of storm and everchanging light is sweeping above them and behind them half in the light haff in the shadow stand armed angels their armour is old and worn and their drawn swords dim and dinted they stand as if upon the air in formation of battle and look downward with stern faces the peasants cast themselves on the ground  aleel look no more on the halfclosed gates of hell but speak to me whose mind is smitten of god that it may be no more with mortal things and tell of her who lies there  he seizes one of the angels  till you speak you shall not drift into eternity  the angel the light beats down the gates of pearl are wide and she is passing to the floor of peace and mary of the seven times wounded heart has kissed her lips and the long blessed hair has fallen on her face the light of lights looks always on the motive not the deed the shadow of shadows on the deed alone  aleel releases the angel and kneels  oona tell them who walk upon the floor of peace that i would die and go to her i love the years like great black oxen tread the world and god the herdsman goads them on behind and i am broken by their passing feet  a sound of faroff horns seems to come from the heart of the light the vision melts away and the forms of the kneeling peasants appear faintly in the darkness                             notes  i found the story of the countess cathleen in what professed to be a collection of irish folklore in an irish newspaper some years ago  i wrote to the compiler asking about its source but got no answer but have since heard that it was translated from les matinees de timothe trimm a good many years ago and has been drifting about the irish press ever since leo lespes gives it as an irish story and though the editor of folklore has kindly advertised for information the only christian variant i know of is a donegal tale given by mr larminie in his west irish folk tales and romances of a woman who goes to hell for ten years to save her husband and stays there another ten having been granted permission to carry away as many souls as could cling to her skirt leo lespes may have added a few details but i have no doubt of the essential antiquity of what seems to me the most impressive form of one of the supreme parables of the world the parable came to the greeks in the sacrifice of alcestis but her sacrifice was less overwhelming less apparently irremediable leo lespes tells the story as follows  ce que je vais vous dire est un recit du careme irlandais le boiteux laveugle le paralytique des rues de dublin ou de limerick vous le diraient mieux que moi cher lecteur si vous alliez le leur demander un sixpense dargent  a la mainil nest pas une jeune fille catholique a laquelle on ne fait appris pendant les jours de preparation a la communion sainte pas un berger des bords de la blackwater qui ne le puisse redire a la veillee  il y a bien longtemps quil apparut toutacoup dans la vielle irlande deux marchands inconnus dont personne navait oui parler et qui parlaient neanmoins avec la plus grande perfection la langue du pays leurs cheveux etaient noirs et ferres avec de lor et leurs robes dune grande magnificence  tous deux semblaient avoir le meme age ils paraissaient etre des hommes de cinquante ans car leur barbe grisormait un peu  or a cette epoque comme aujourdhui lirlande etait pauvre car le soleil avait ete rare et des recoltes presque nulles les indigents ne savaient a quel sainte se vouer et la misere devenai de plus en plus terrible  dans lhotellerie ou descendirent les marchands fastueux on chercha a penetrer leurs desseins mais cc fut en vain ils demeurerent silencieux et discrets  et pendant quils demeurerent dans lhotellerie ils ne cesserent de compter et de recompter des sacs de pieces dor dont la vive clarte sapercevait a travers les vitres du logis  gentlemen leur dit lhotesse un jour dou vient que vous etes si opulents et que venus pour secourir la misere publique vous ne fassiez pas de bonnes oeuvres  belle hotesse repondit lun deux nous navons pas voulu aller audevant dinfortunes honorables dans la crainte detre trompes par des miseres fictives que la douleur frappe a la porte nous ouvrirons  le lendemain quand on sut quil existait deux opulents etrangers prets a prodiguer lor la foule assiegea leur logis mais les figures des gens qui en sortaient etaient bien diverses  les uns avaient la fierte dans le regard les autres portaient la honte au front  les deux trafiquants achetaient des ames pour le demon  lame dun vieillard valait vingt pieces dor pas un penny de plus car satan avait eu le temps dy former hypotheque  lame dune pouse en valait cinquante quand elle etait jolie ou cent quand elle etait laide lame dune jeune fille se payait des prix fous les fleurs les plus belles et les plus pures sont les plus cheres  pendant ce temps il existait dans la ville un ange de beaute la comtesse ketty oconnor elle etait lidole du peuple et la providence des indigents  des quelle eut appris que des mecreants profitaient de la misere publique pour derober des coeurs a dieu elle fit appeler son majordome  master patrick lui dit elle combien aije de pieces dor dans mon coffre  cent mille  combien de bijoux  pour autant dargent  combien de chateaux de bois et de terres  pour le double de ces sommes  eh bien patrick vendez tout cc qui nest pas or et apportezmen le montant je ne veux garder a moi que ce castel et le champs qui lentoure  deux jours apres les ordres de la pieuse ketty etaient execues et le tresor etait distribue aux pauvres au fur et a mesure de leurs besoins  ceci ne faisait pas le compte dit la tradition des commisvoyageurs du malin esprit qui ne trouvaient plus dames a acheter  aides par un valet infame ils penetrerent dans la retraite de la noble dame et lui deroberent le reste de son tresor en vain luttatelle de toutes ses forces pour sauver le contenu de son coffre les larrons diaboliques furent les plus forts si ketty avait eu les moyens de faire un signe de croix ajoute la legende irlandaise elle les eut mis en fuite mais ses mains etaient captivesle larcin fut effectue  alors les pauvres solliciterent en vain pres de ketty depouillee elle ne pouvait plus secourir leur misereelle les abandonnait a la tentation pourtant il ny avait plus que huit jours a passer pour que les grains et les fourrages arrivassent en abondance des pays dorient mais huit jours cetait un siecle huit jours necessitaient une somme immense pour subvenir aux exigences de la disette et les pauvres allaient ou expirer dans les angoisses de la faim ou reniant les saintes maximes de levangile vendre a vil prix leur ame le plus beau present de la munificence du seigneur toutpuissant  et ketty navait plus une obole car elle avait abandonne son chateaux aux malheureux  elle passa douze heures dans les larmes et le deuil arrachant ses cheveux couleur de soleil et meurtrissant son sein couleur du lis puis elle se leva resolue animee par un vif sentiment de desespoir  elle se rendit chez les marchands dames  que voulezvous dirent ils  vous achetez des ames  oui un peu malgre vous nest ce pas sainte aux yeux de sapbir  aujourdhui je viens vous proposer un marche reprit elle  lequel  jai une ame a vendre mais elle est chere  quimporte si elle est precieuse lame comme le diamant sapprecie a sa blancheur  cest la mienne dit ketty  les

gentille dame combien voulezvouz  cent cinquante mille ecus dor  cest fait dirent les marchands et ils tendirent a ketty un parchemin  cachete de noir quelle signa en frissonnant  la somme lui fut comptee  des quelle fut rentree elle dit au majordome  tenez distribuez ceci avec la somme que je vous donne les pauvres attendront la huitaine necessaire et pas une de leurs ames ne sera livree au demon   puis elle senferma et recommanda quon ne vint pas la deranger  trois jours se passerent elle nappela pas elle ne sortit pas  quand on ouvrit sa porte on la trouva raide et froide elle etait morte de douleur  mais la vente de cette ame si adorable dans sa charite fut declaree nulle par le seigneur car elle avait sauve ses concitoyens de la morte eternelle  apres la huitaine des vaisseaux nombreux amenerent lirlande affamee dimmenses provisions de grains  la famine netait plus possible quant aux marchands ils disparurent de leur hotellerie sans quon sut jamais ce quils etaient devenus  toutefois les pecheurs de la blackwater pretendent quils sont enchaines dans une prison souterraine par ordre de lucifer jusquau moment ou ils pourront livrer lame de ketty qui leur a echappe je vous dis la legende telle que je la sais  mais les pauvres lont raconte dage en age et les enfants de cork et de dublin chantent encore la ballade dont voici les derniers couplets  pour sauver les pauvres quelle aime ketty donna son esprit sa croyance meme satan paya cette ame au devoument sublime en ecus dor disons pour racheter son crime confiteor  mais lange qui se fit coupable par charite  au sejour damour ineffable est remonte satan vaincu neut pas de prise  sur ce coeur dor chantons sous la nef de leglise confiteor  nest ce pas que ce recit ne de limagination des poetes catholiques de la verte erin est une veritable recit de careme   the countess cathleen was acted in dublin in 1899 with mr marcus st john and mr trevor lowe as the first and second demon mr valentine grace as shemus rua master charles sefton as teig madame san carola as mary miss florence farr as aleel miss anna mather as oona mr charles holmes as the herdsman mr jack wilcox as the gardener mr walford as a peasant miss dorothy paget as a spirit miss m kelly as a peasant woman mr t e wilkinson as a servant and miss may whitty as the countess kathleen they had to face a very vehement opposition stirred up by a politician and a newspaper the one accusing me in a pamphlet the other in long articles day after day of blasphemy because of the language of the demons or of shemus rua and because i made a woman sell her soul and yet escape damnation and of a lack of patriotism because i made irish men and women who it seems never did such a thing sell theirs the politician or the newspaper persuaded some forty catholic students to sign a protest against the play and a cardinal who avowed that he had not read it to make another and both politician and newspaper made such obvious appeals to the audience to break the peace that a score or so of police were sent to the theatre to see that they did not i had however no reason to regret the result for the stalls containing almost all that was distinguished in dublin and a gallery of artisans alike insisted on the freedom of literature  after the performance in 1899 i added the love scene between aleel and the countess and in this new form the play was revived in new york by miss wycherley as well as being played a good deal in england and america by amateurs now at last i have made a complete revision to make it suitable for performance at the abbey theatre the first two scenes are almost wholly new and throughout the play i have added or left out such passages as a stage experience of some years showed me encumbered the action the play in its first form having been written before i knew anything of the theatre i have left the old end however in the version printed in the body of this book because the change for dramatic purposes has been made for no better reason than that audienceseven at the abbey theatreare almost ignorant of irish mythology or because a shallow stage made the elaborate vision of armed angels upon a mountainside impossible            the new end is particularly suited to the abbey stage where the stage platform can be brought out in front of the prosceniurn and have a flight of steps at one side up which the angel comes crossing towards the back of the stage at the opposite side the principal lighting is from two arc lights in the balcony which throw their lights into the faces of the players making footlights unnecessary the room at shemus ruas house is suggested by a great grey curtaina colour which becomes full of rich tints under the stream of light from the arcs the two or more arches in the third scene permit the use of a gauze the short front scene before the last is just long enough when played with incidental music to allow the scene set behind it to be changed the play when played without interval in this way lasts a little over an hour  the play was performed at the abbey theatre for the first time on december 14 1911 miss maire oneill taking the part of the countess and the last scene from the going out of the merchants was as follows  merchants rush out aleel crawls into the middle of the room the twilight has fallen and gradually darkens as the scene goes on  aleel theyre rising uptheyre rising through the earth fat asmodel and giddy belial and all the fiends now they       leap in the air but why does hells gate creak     so round and round hither and hither to and fro theyre running   he moves about as though the air was full of spirits oona enters  crouch down old heron out of the blind storm  oona where is the countess cathleen  all this day her eyes were full of tears and when for a moment her hand was laid upon my hand it trembled and now i do not know where she is gone  aleel cathleen has chosen other friends than us and they are rising through the hollow world demons are out old  heron  oona god guard her soul  aleel shes bartered it away this very hour as though we two were never in the world  he kneels beside her but does not seem to hear her words the peasants return they carry the countess cathleen and lay her upon the ground before oona and aleel she lies there as if dead  oona o that so many pitchers of rough clay should prosper and the porcelain break in two  she kisses the hands of cathleen  a peasant we were under the tree where the path turns when she grew pale as death and fainted away  cathleen o hold me and hold me tightly for the storm is dragging me away  oona takes her in her arms a woman begins to wail  peasants hush  peasants hush  peasant women hush  other peasant women hush  cathleen half rising lay all the bags of money in a heap and when i am gone old oona share them out to every man and woman judge and give according to their needs  a peasant woman and will she give enough to keep my children through the dearth  another peasant woman o queen of heaven and all you blessed saints let us and ours be lost so she be shriven  cathleen bend down your faces oona and aleel i gaze upon them as the swallow gazes upon the nest under the eave before she wander the loud waters do not weep too great a while for there is many a candle on the high altar though one fall aleel who sang about the dancers of the woods that know not the hard burden of the world having but breath in their kind bodies farewell and farewell oona you who played with me and bore me in your arms about the house when i was but a childand therefore happy therefore happy even like those that dance the storm is in my hair and i must go  she dies  oona bring me the lookingglass  a woman brings it to her out of inner room oona holds glass over the lips of cathleen all is silent for a moment then she speaks in a halfscream  o she is dead  a peasant she was the great white lily of the world  a peasant she was more beautiful than the pale stars  an old peasant woman the little plant i loved is broken in two  aleel takes lookingglass from oona and flings it upon floor so that it is broken in many pieces  aleel i shatter you in fragments for the face that brimmed you up with beauty is no more and die dull heart for you that were a mirror are but a ball of passionate dust again and level earth and plumy sea rise up and haughty sky fall down  a peasant woman pull him upon his knees his curses will pluck lightning on our heads  aleel angels and devils clash in the middle air and brazen swords clang upon brazen helms look look a spear has gone through belials eye  a winged angel carrying a torch and a sword enters from the r with eyes fixed upon some distant thing the angel is about to pass out to the l when aleel speaks the angel stops a moment and turns  look no more on the halfclosed gates of hell but speak to me whose mind is smitten of god that it may be no more with mortal things and tell of her who lies there  the angel turns again and is about to go but is seized by aleel  till you speak you shall not drift into eternity angel the light beats down the gates of pearl are wide and she is passing to the floor of peace and mary of the seven times wounded heart has kissed her lips and the long blessed hair has fallen on her face the light of lights looks always on the motive not the deed the shadow of shadows on the deed alone  aleel releases the angel and kneels  oona tell them who walk upon the floor of peace  that i would die and go to her i love the years like great black oxen tread the world and god the herdsman goads them on behind and i am broken by their passing feet
