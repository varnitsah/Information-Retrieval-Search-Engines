16741073	david  five sermons     notethe first four of these sermons were preached before the university of cambridge    sermon i  davids weakness    psalm lxxviii 71 72 73  he chose david his servant and took him away from the sheepfolds  as he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him that he might feed jacob his people and israel his inheritance  so he fed them with a faithful and true heart and ruled them prudently with all his power  i am about to preach to you four sermons on the character of david his history i take for granted you all know  i look on david as an all but ideal king educated for his office by an all but ideal training  a shepherd first a lifebe it rememberedfull of danger in those times and lands then captain of a band of outlaws and lastly a king gradually and with difficulty fighting his way to a secure throne  this was his course  but the most important stage of it was probably the first  among the dumb animals he learnt experience which he afterwards put into practice among human beings  the shepherd of the sheep became the shepherd of men  he who had slain the lion and the bear became the champion of his native land  he who followed the ewes great with young fed gods oppressed and weary people with a faithful and true heart till he raised them into a great and strong nation  so both sides of the true kingly character the masculine and the feminine are brought out in david for the greedy and tyrannous he has indignant defiance  for the weak and helpless patient tenderness  my motives for choosing this subject i will explain in a very few words  we have heard much of late about muscular christianity  a clever expression spoken in jest by i know not whom has been bandied about the world and supposed by many to represent some new ideal of the christian character  for myself i do not understand what it means  it may mean one of two things  if it mean the first it is a term somewhat unnecessary if not somewhat irreverent  if it mean the second it means something untrue and immoral  its first and better meaning may be simply a healthy and manful christianity one which does not exalt the feminine virtues to the exclusion of the masculine  that certain forms of christianity have committed this last fault cannot be doubted  the tendency of christianity during the patristic and the middle ages was certainly in that direction christians were persecuted and defenceless and they betook themselves to the only virtues which they had the opportunity of practisinggentleness patience resignation selfsacrifice and selfdevotionall that is loveliest in the ideal female character and god forbid that that side of the christian life should ever be undervalued  it has its own beauty its own strength too made perfect in weakness in prison in torture at the fiery stake on the lonely sickbed in long years of selfdevotion and resignation and in a thousand womanly sacrifices unknown to man but written for ever in gods book of life  but as time went on and the monastic life which whether practised by man or by woman is essentially a feminine life became more and more exclusively the religious ideal grave defects began to appear in what was really too narrow a conception of the human character  the monks of the middle ages in aiming exclusively at the virtues of women generally copied little but their vices  their unnatural attempt to be wiser than god and to unsex themselves had done little but disease their mind and heart  they resorted more and more to those arts which are the weapons of crafty ambitious and unprincipled women  they were too apt to be cunning false intriguing  they were personally cowardly as their own chronicles declare querulous passionate prone to unmanly tears prone as their writings abundantly testify to scold to use the most virulent language against all who differed from them they were at times fearfully cruel as evil women will be cruel with that worst cruelty which springs from cowardice  if i seem to have drawn a harsh picture of them i can only answer that their own documents justify abundantly all that i have said  gradually to supply their defects another ideal arose  the warriors of the middle ages hoped that they might be able to serve god in the world even in the battlefield  at least the world and the battlefield they would not relinquish but make the best of them  and among them arose a new and a very fair ideal of manhood that of the gentle very perfect knight loyal to his king and to his god bound to defend the weak succour the oppressed and put down the wrongdoer with his lady or breadgiver dealing forth bounteously the goods of this life to all who needed occupied in the seven works of mercy yet living in the world and in the perfect enjoyment of wedded and family life  this was the ideal of course sinful human nature fell short of it and defaced it by absurdities but i do not hesitate to say that it was a higher ideal of christian excellence than had appeared since the time of the apostles putting aside the quite exceptional ideal of the blessed martyrs  a higher ideal i say was chivalry with all its shortcomings  and for this reason  that it asserted the possibility of consecrating the whole manhood and not merely a few faculties thereof to god and it thus contained the first germ of that protestantism which conquered at the reformation  then was asserted once for all on the grounds of nature and reason as well as of holy scripture the absolute sanctity of family and national life and the correlative idea namely the consecration of the whole of human nature to the service of god in that station to which god had called each man  then the old testament with the honour which it puts upon family and national life became precious to man as it had never been before and such a history as davids became not as it was with the mediaeval monks a mere repertory of fanciful metaphors and allegories but the solemn example for good and for evil of a man of like passions and like duties with the men of the modern world  these great truths once asserted could not but conquer and they will conquer to the end  all attempts to restore the monastic and feminine ideal like that of good nicholas ferrar at little gidding failed  they withered like hothouse exotics in the free keen bracing english air and in our civil wars cavalier and puritan in whatever they differed never differed in their sound and healthy conviction that true religion did not crush but strengthened and consecrated a valiant and noble manhood  now if all that muscular christianity means is that then the expression is altogether unnecessary for we have had the thing for three centuriesand defective likewise for it is not a merely muscular but a human christianity which the bible taught our forefathers and which our forefathers have handed down to us  but there is another meaning sometimes attached to this flippant expression muscular christianity which is utterly immoral and intolerable  there are those who say and there have been of late those who have written books to shew that provided a young man is sufficiently brave frank and gallant he is more or less absolved from the common duties of morality and selfrestraint  that physical prowess is a substitute for virtue is certainly no new doctrine  it is the doctrine of every red man on the american prairies of every african chief who ornaments his hut with human skulls  it was the doctrine of our heathen forefathers when they came hither slaying plundering burning tossing babes on their spearpoints  but i am sorry that it should be the doctrine of any one calling himself a gentleman much more a christian  it is certainly not the doctrine of the catechism which bids us renounce the flesh and live by the help of gods spirit a new life of duty to god and to our neighbour  it is certainly not the doctrine of the new testament  whatsoever st paul meant by bidding his disciples crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts he did not mean thereby that they were to deify the flesh as the heathen round them did in their profligate mysteries and in their gladiatorial exhibitions  neither though the old testament may seem to put more value on physical prowess than does the new testament is it the doctrine of the old testament as i purpose to show you from the life and history of david  nothing nothing can be a substitute for purity and virtue  man will always try to find substitutes for it  he will try to find a substitute in superstition in forms and ceremonies in voluntary humility and worship of angels in using vain repetitions and fancying that he will be heard for his much speaking he will try to find a substitute in intellect and the worship of intellect and art and poetry or he will try to find it as in the present case in the worship of his own animal powers which god meant to be his servants and not his masters  but let no man lay that flattering unction to his soul  the first and the last business of every human being whatever his station party creed capacities tastes duties is morality  virtue virtue always virtue  nothing that man will ever invent will absolve him from the universal necessity of being good as god is good righteous as god is righteous and holy as god is holy  believe it young men believe it  better would it be for any one of you to be the stupidest and the ugliest of mortals to be the most diseased and abject of cripples the most silly nervous incapable personage who ever was a laughingstock for the boys upon the streets if only you lived according to your powers the life of the spirit of god than to be as perfectly gifted as exquisitely organised in body and mind as david himself and not to live the life of the spirit of god the life of goodness which is the only life fit for a human being wearing the human flesh and soul which christ took upon him on earth and wears for ever in heaven a man indeed in the midst of the throne of god  and therefore it is as you will yourselves have perceived already that i have chosen to speak to you of david his character his history  it is the character of a man perfectly gifted exquisitely organised  he has personal beauty daring prowess and skill in war he has generosity nobleness faithfulness chivalry as of a mediaeval and christian knight he is a musician poet seemingly an architect likewise he is moreover a born king he has a marvellous and most successful power of attracting disciplining ruling his fellowmen  so thoroughly human a personage is he that god speaks of him as the man after his own heart that our blessed lord condescends to call himself especially the son of david  for there is in this man as there is said to be in all great geniuses a feminine as well as a masculine vein a passionate tenderness a keen sensibility a vast capacity of sympathy sadness and suffering which makes him truly the type of christ the man of sorrows which makes his psalms to this day the textbook of the afflicted of tens of thousands who have not a particle of his beauty courage genius but yet can feel in mean hovels and workhouse sickbeds that the warriorpoet speaks to their human hearts and for their human hearts as none other can speak save christ himself the son of david and the son of man  a man i say of intense sensibilities and therefore capable as is but too notorious of great crimes as well as of great virtues  and when i mention this last fact i must ask you to pause and consider with me very solemnly what it means  we may pervert or rather misstate the fact in more than one way to our own hurt  we may say cynically david had his good points and his bad ones as all your great saints have  look at them closely and in spite of all their pretensions you will find them no better than their neighbours  and so we may comfort ourselves in our own mediocrity and laziness by denying the existence of all greatness and goodness  nathan the prophet said that davids conduct would be open to this very interpretation and would give great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme  but i trust that none of you wish to be numbered among the enemies of the lord  again we may say sentimentally that these great weaknesses are on the whole the necessary concomitants of great strength that such highly organised and complex characters must not be judged by the rule of common respectability and that it is a more or less fine thing to be capable at once of great virtues and great vices  books which hint and more than hint this will suggest themselves to you at once  i only advise you not to listen to their teaching as you will find it lead to very serious consequences both in this life and in the life to come  but if we do say this or anything like this we say it on our own responsibility  davids biographers say nothing of the kind  david himself says nothing of the kind  he never represents himself as a compound of strength and weakness  he represents himself as weakness itselfas incapacity utter and complete  to overlook that startling fact is to overlook the very element which has made davids psalms the textbook for all human weaknesses penitences sorrows struggles aspirations for nigh three thousand years  but this subject is too large for me to speak of today and too deep for me to attempt an explanation till i have turned your thoughts toward another object which will explain to you david and yourselves and it seems to me at times every problem of humanity look not at david but at davids greater son and consider christ upon his cross  consider him of whom it is written thou art fairer than the children of men  full of grace are thy lips because god hath blessed thee for ever  gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh o thou most mighty according to thy worship and renown  good luck have thou with thine honour ride on because of the word of truth of meekness and righteousness and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things  thy arrows are very sharp and the people shall be subdued unto thee even in the midst among the kings enemies  consider him who alone fulfilled these words who fulfils them even now eternally in heaven king over all god blessed for ever  and then sit down at the foot of his cross however young strong proud gallant gifted ambitious you may be sit down at the foot of christs cross and look thereon till you see what it means and must mean for ever  see how he nailed to that cross not in empty metaphor but in literal fact in agonising soul and body all of human nature which the world admiresyouth grace valour power eloquence intellect  not because they were evil for he possessed them doubtless himself as did none other of the sons of mennot i say because they were evil but because they were worthless and as nothing beside that divine charity which would endure and conquer for ever when all the noblest accidents of the body and the mind had perished or seemed to perish  in the utmost weakness and shame of human flesh he would shew forth the strength and glory of the divine spirit the strength and the glory of duty and obedience of patience and forgiveness of benevolence and selfsacrifice the strength and glory of that burning love for human beings which could stoop from heaven to earth that it might seek and save that which was lost  yes  look at christ upon his cross the sight which melted the hearts of our fierce forefathers and turned them from the worship of thor and odin to the worship of the white christ and from the hope of a valhalla of brute prowess to the hope of a heaven of righteousness and love  look at christ upon his cross and see there as they saw the true prowess the true valour the true chivalry the true glory the true manhood most human when most divine which is selfsacrifice and loveas possible to the weakest meanest simplest as to the strongest most gallant and most wise  look upon him and learn from him and take his yoke upon you for he is meek and lowly of heart and you shall find rest unto your souls and in you shall be fulfilled the prophecy of jeremiah which he spake saying let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither the mighty man glory in his might neither let the rich man glory in his wealth  but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord who exercises lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earth  for in these things i delight saith the lord    sermon ii  davids strength    psalm xxvii  1  the lord is my light and my salvation whom then shall i fear  the lord is the strength of my life of whom then shall i be afraid  i said last sunday that the keynote of davids character was not the assertion of his own strength but the confession of his own weakness  and i say it again  but it is plain that david had strength and of no common order that he was an eminently powerful able and successful man  from whence then came that strength  he says from god  he says throughout his life as emphatically as did st paul after him that gods strength was made perfect in his weakness  god is his deliverer his guide his teacher his inspirer  the lord is his strength who teaches his hands to war and his fingers to fight his hope and his fortress his castle and deliverer his defence in whom he trusts who subdueth the people that is under him  to god he ascribes not only his success in life but his physical prowess  by gods help he slays the lion and the bear  by gods help he has nerve to kill the philistine giant  by gods help he is so strong that his arms can break even a bow of steel  it is god who makes his feet like harts feet and enables him to leap over the walls of the mountain fortresses  and we must pause ere we call such utterances mere eastern metaphor it is far more probable that they were meant as and were literal truths  david was not likely to have been a man of brute gigantic strength  so delicate a brain was probably coupled to a delicate body  such a nature at the same time would be the very one most capable under the influencecall it boldly inspirationof a great and patriotic cause of great dangers and great purposes capable i say at moments of accesses of almost superhuman energy which he ascribed and most rightly to the inspiration of god  but it is not merely as his physical inspirer or protector that he has faith in god  he has a deeper a far deeper instinct than even that the instinct of a communion personal practical living between god the fount of light and goodness and his own soul with its capacity of darkness as well as light of evil as well as good  in one word david is a man of faith and a man of prayeras god grant all you may be  it is this one fixed idea that god could hear him and that god would help him which gives unity and coherence to the wonderful variety of davids psalms  it is this faith which gives calm confidence to his views of nature and of man and enables him to say as he looks upon his sheep feeding round him the lord is my shepherd therefore i shall not want  faith it is which enables him to foresee that though the heathen rage and the kings of the earth stand up and the rulers take counsel together against the lord and his anointed yet the righteous cause will surely prevail for god is king himself  faith it is which enables him to bear up against the general immorality and while he cries help me lord for there is not one godly man left for the faithful fail from among the children of mento make answer to himself in words of noble hope and consolation now for the comfortless troubles sake of the needy and because of the deep sighing of the poor i will up saith the lord and will help every one from him that swelleth against him and will set him at rest  faith it is which gives a character which no other like utterances have to those cries of agonycries as of a lost childwhich he utters at times with such noble and truthful simplicity  they issue almost every one of them in a sudden countercry of joy as pathetic as the sorrow which has gone before  o lord rebuke me not in thine indignation  neither chasten me in thy displeasure have mercy upon me o lord for i am weak  o lord heal me for my bones are vexed  my soul also is sore troubled  but lord how long wilt thou punish me  turn thee o lord and deliver my soul o save me for thy mercys sake  for in death no man remembereth thee  and who will give thee thanks in the pit  i am weary of my groaning every night wash i my bed  and water my couch with my tears  my beauty is gone for very trouble  and worn away because of all mine enemies  away from me all ye that work vanity for the lord hath heard the voice of my weeping  the lord hath heard my petition  the lord will receive my prayer  faith it is in like wise which gives its peculiar grandeur to that wonderful 18th psalm davids song of triumph his masterpiece and it may be the masterpiece of human poetry inspired or uninspired only approached by the companionpsalm the 144th  from whence comes that cumulative energy by which it rushes on even in our translation with a force and swiftness which are indeed divine thought following thought image image verse verse before the breath of the spirit of god as wave leaps after wave before the gale  what is the element in that ode which even now makes it stir the heart like a trumpet  surely that which it itself declares in the very first verse  i will love thee o lord my strength the lord is my stony rock and my defence  my saviour my god and my might in whom i will trust my buckler the horn also of my salvation and my refuge  what is it which gives life and reality to the magnificent imagery of the seventh and following verses  the earth trembled and quaked  the very foundations also of the hills shook and were removed because he was wroth  there went a smoke out in his presence  and a consuming fire out of his mouth so that coals were kindled at it  he bowed the heavens also and came down  and it was dark under his feet  he rode upon the cherubims and did fly he came flying upon the wings of the wind  he made darkness his secret place  his pavilion round about him with dark water and thick clouds to cover him  at the brightness of his presence his clouds removed  hailstones and coals of fire  the lord also thundered out of heaven and the highest gave his thunder hailstones and coals of fire  he sent out his arrows and scattered them  he cast forth lightnings and destroyed them  the springs of waters were seen and the foundations of the round world were discovered at thy chiding o lord  at the blasting of the breath of thy displeasure  he shall send down from on high to fetch me  and shall take me out of many waters  what protects such words from the imputation of mere eastern exaggeration  the firm conviction that god is the deliverer not only of david but of all who trust in god that the whole majesty of god and all the powers of nature are arrayed on the side of the good and of the oppressed the lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing  according to the cleanness of my hands shall he recompense me  because i have kept the ways of the lord  and have not forsaken my god as the wicked doth  for i have an eye unto all his laws  and will not cast out his commandments from me  i was also uncorrupt before him and eschewed mine own wickedness  therefore shall the lord reward me after my righteous dealing  and according unto the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight  with the holy thou shalt be holy  and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect  faith again it is to turn from davids highest to his lowest phasefaith in god it is which has made that 51st psalm the model of all true penitence for evermore  faith in god in the spite of his full consciousness that god is about to punish him bitterly for the rest of his life  faith it is which gives to that psalm its peculiarly simple deliberate manly tone free from all exaggerated selfaccusations all cowardly cries of terror  he is crushed down it is true  the tone of his words shews us that throughout  but crushed by what  by the discovery that he has offended god  not in the least  for the sake of your own souls as well as for that of honest critical understanding of the scriptures do not foist that meaning into davids words  he never says that he had offended god had he been a mediaeval monk had he been an average superstitious man of any creed or time he would have said so and cried i have offended god he is offended and angry with me how shall i avert his wrath  not so  david has discovered not an angry but a forgiving god a god of love and goodness who desires to make his creatures good penitential prayers in all ages have too often wanted faith in god and therefore have been too often prayers to avert punishment this thisthe model of all truly penitent prayersis that of a man who is to be punished and is content to take his punishment knowing that he deserves it and far more beside  and why because as always david has faith in god  god is a good and just being and he trusts him accordingly and that very discovery of the goodness not the sternness of god is the bitterest pang the deepest shame to davids spirit  therefore he can face without despair the discovery of a more deep radical inbred evil in himself than he ever expected before  behold i was shapen in wickedness and in sin hath my mother conceived me because he could say also thou requirest truth in the inward parts and shalt make me to understand wisdom secretly  he can cry to god out of the depths of his foulness make me a clean heart o god  and renew a right spirit within me  cast me not away from thy presence  and take not thy holy spirit from me  o give me the comfort of thy help again and stablish me with thy free spirit  then shall i teach thy ways unto the wicked  and sinners shall be converted unto thee  he can cry thus because he has discovered that the will of god is not to hate not to torture not to cast away from his presence but to restore his creatures to goodness that he may thereby restore them to usefulness  david has discovered that god demands no sacrifice much less selftorturing penance  what he demands is the heart the sacrifice of god is a troubled spirit  a broken and a contrite heart he will not despise  it is such utterances as these which have given for now many hundred years their priceless value to the little book of psalms ascribed to the shepherd outlaw of the judaean hills  it is such utterances as these which have sent the sound of his name into all lands and his words throughout all the world every form of human sorrow doubt struggle error sin the nun agonising in the cloister the settler struggling for his life in transatlantic forests the pauper shivering over the embers in his hovel and waiting for kind death the man of business striving to keep his honour pure amid the temptations of commerce the prodigal son starving in the far country and recollecting the words which he learnt long ago at his mothers knee the peasant boy trudging a field in the chill dawn and remembering that the lord is his shepherd therefore he will not wantall shapes of humanity have found and will find to the end of time a word said to their inmost hearts and more a word said for those hearts to the living god of heaven by the vast humanity of david the man after gods own heart the most thoroughly human figure as it seems to me which had appeared upon the earth before the coming of that perfect son of man who is over all god blessed for ever  amen  it may be said davids belief is no more than the common belief of fanatics  they have in all ages fancied themselves under the special protection of deity the object of special communications from above  doubtless they have and evil conclusions have they drawn therefrom in every age  but the existence of a counterfeit is no argument against the existence of the reality rather it is an argument for the existence of the reality  in this case it is impossible to conceive how the idea of communion with an unseen being ever entered the human mind at all unless it had been put there originally by fact and experience  man would never have even dreamed of a living god had not that living god been a reality who did not leave the creature to find his creator but stooped from heaven at the very beginning of our race to find his creature  and a reality you will surely find itthat living and practical communication between your souls and that father in heaven who created them  it will not be real but morbid even imaginary just in proportion as your souls are tainted with selfconceit ambition selfwill malice passion or any wilful vice especially with the vice of bigotry which settles beforehand for god what he shall teach the soul and in what manner he shall teach it and turns a deaf ear to his plainest lessons if they cannot be made to fit into some favourite formula or theory  but it will be real practical healthy soulsaving in the very deepest sense of that word just in proportion as your eye is single and your heart pure just in proportion as you hunger and thirst after righteousness and wish and try simply and humbly to do your duty in that station to which god has called you and to learn joyfully and trustingly anything and everything which god may see fit to teach you  then as your day your strength shall be  then will the lord teach you and inform you with his eye and guide you in the way wherein you should go then will you obey that appeal of the psalmist be ye not like to horse and mule which have no understanding whose mouths must be held in with bit and bridle lest they fall upon thee  great plagues remain for the ungodly  but whoso putteth his trust in the lord mercy embraceth him on every side  for understand this well young men and settle it in your hearts as the first condition of human life yea of the life of every rational created being that a man is justified only by faith and not only a man but angels archangels and all possible created spirits past present and to come  all stand all are in their right state only as long as they are consciously dependent on god the father of spirits and his son jesus christ the lord in whom they live and move and have their being  the moment they attempt to assert themselves whether their own power their own genius their own wisdom or even their own virtue they ipso facto sin and are justified and just no longer because they are trying to take themselves out of their just and right state of dependence and to put themselves into an unjust and wrong state of independence  to assert that anything is their own to assert that their virtue is their own just as much as to assert that their wisdom or any other part of their being is their own is to deny the primary fact of their existencethat in god they live and move and have that being and therefore miltons satan though over and above all his other grandeurs he had been adorned with every virtue would have been satan still by the one sin of ingratitude just because and just as long as he set up himself apart from that god from whom alone comes every good and perfect gift  settle it in your hearts young men settle it in your heartsor rather pray to god to settle it therein and if you would love life and see good days recollect daily and hourly that the only sane and safe human life is dependence on god himself and that      unless above himself he can exalt himself how poor a thing is man    sermon iii  davids anger    psalm cxliii 11 12  quicken me o lord for thy names sake  for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble  and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul  for i am thy servant  there are those who would say that i dealt unfairly last sunday by the psalms of david that in order to prove them inspired i ignored an element in them which is plainly uninspired wrong and offensive namely the curses which he invokes upon his enemies  i ignored it they would say because it was fatal to my theory because it proved david to have the vindictive passions of other easterns to be speaking not by the inspiration of god but of his own private likes and dislikes to be at least a fanatic who thinks that his cause must needs be gods cause and who invokes the lightnings of heaven on all who dare to differ from him  others would say that such words were excusable in david living under the old law for it was said by them of old time thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy but that our lord has formally abrogated that permission but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good to those who despitefully use you and persecute you  how unnecessary and how wrong then they would say it is of the church of england to retain these cursing psalms in her public worship and put them into the mouths of her congregations  either they are merely painful as well as unnecessary to christians or if they mean anything they excuse and foster the habit too common among religious controversialists of invoking the wrath of heaven on their opponents  i argue with neither of the objectors  but the question is a curious and an important one and i am bound i think to examine it in a sermon which like the present treats of davids chivalry  what david meant by these curses can be best known from his own actions  what certain persons have meant by them since is patent enough from their actions  mediaeval monks considered but too often the enemies of their creed of their ecclesiastical organisation even of their particular monastery to be ipso facto enemies of god and applied to them the seeming curses of davids psalms with fearful additions of which david to his honour never dreamed may they feel with dathan and abiram the damnation of gehenna 285 is a fair sample of the formulae which are found in the writings of men who while they called themselves the servants of jesus christ our lord derived their notions of the next world principally from the sixth book of virgils aeneid  and what they meant by their words their acts shewed  whenever they had the power they were but too apt to treat their supposed enemies in this life as they expected god to treat them in the next  the history of the inquisition on the continent in america and in the portuguese indiesof the marian persecutions in englandof the piedmontese massacres in the 17th centuryare facts never to be forgotten  their horrors have been described in too authentic documents they remain for ever the most hideous pages in the history of sinful human nature  do we find a hint of any similar conduct on the part of david  if not it is surely probable that he did not mean by his imprecations what the mediaeval clergy meant  certainly whatsoever likeness there may have been in language the contrast in conduct is most striking  it is a special mark of davids character as special as his faith in god that he never avenges himself with his own hand  twice he has saul in his power once in the cave at engedi once at the camp at hachilah and both times he refuses nobly to use his opportunity  he is his master the lords anointed and his person is sacred in the eyes of david his servanthis knight as he would have been called in the middle age  the second time davids temptation is a terrible one  he has softened sauls wild heart by his courtesy and pathos when he pleaded with him after letting him escape from the cave and he has sworn to saul that when he becomes king he will never cut off his children or destroy his name out of his fathers home  yet we find saul immediately after attacking him again out of mere caprice and once more falling into his hands  abishai saysand who can wonderlet me smite him with the spear to the earth this once and i will not smite a second time  what wonder  the man is not to be trustedtruce with him is impossible but david still keeps his chivalry in the true meaning of that word  destroy him not for who can stretch forth his hand against the lords anointed and be guiltless  as the lord liveth the lord shall smite him or his day shall come to die or he shall go down into battle and perish but the lord forbid that i should stretch forth my hand against the lords anointed  and if it be argued that david regarded the person of a king as legally sacred there is a case more clear still in which he abjures the right of revenge upon a private person  nabal in addition to his ingratitude has insulted him with the bitterest insult which could be offered to a free man in a slave holding country  he has hinted that david is neither more nor less than a runaway slave  and davids heart is stirred by a terrible and evil spirit  he dare not trust his men even himself with his black thoughts  gird on your swords is all that he can say aloud  but he had said in his heart god do so and more to the enemies of david if i leave a man alive by the morning light of all that pertain to him  and yet at the first words of reason and of wisdom urged doubtless by the eloquence of a beautiful and noble woman but no less by the spirit of god speaking through her as all who call themselves gentlemen should know already his right spirit returns to him  the chivalrous instinct of forgiveness and duty is roused once more and he cries blessed be the lord god of israel which sent thee this day to meet me and blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from shedding blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand  it is plain then that davids notion of his duty to his enemies was very different from that of the monks  but still they are undeniably imprecations the imprecations of a man smarting under cruel injustice who cannot and in some cases must not avenge himself and who therefore calls on the just god to avenge him  are we therefore to say that these utterances of david are uninspired not in the least  we are boldly to say that they are inspired and by the very spirit of god who is the spirit of justice and of judgment  doubtless there were in after ages far higher inspirations  the spirit of god was and is gradually educating mankind and individuals among mankind like david upward from lower truths to higher ones  that is the express assertion of our lord and of his apostles  but the higher and later inspiration does not make the lower and earlier false  it does not even always supersede it altogether  each is true and for the most part each must remain and be respected that they may complement each other  let us look at this question rationally and reverently free from all sentimental and immoral indulgence for sin and wrong  the first instinct of man is the lex talionis  as you do to me says the savageso i have a right to do to you  if you try to kill me or mine i have a right to kill you in return  is this notion uninspired  i should be sorry to say so  it is surely the first form and the only possible first form of the sense of justice and retribution  as a man sows so shall he reap  if a man does wrong he deserves to be punished  no arguments will drive that great divine law out of the human mind for god has put it there  after that inspiration comes a higher one  the man is taught to say i must not punish my enemy if i can avoid it  god must punish him either by the law of the land or by his providential judgments to this height david rises  in a seemingly lawless age and country under the most extreme temptation he learns to say blessed be god who hath kept me from avenging myself with my own hand  but still it may be said david calls down gods vengeance on his enemies  he has not learnt to hate the sin and yet love the sinner doubtless he has not  and it may have been right for his education and for the education of the human race through him that he did not  it may have been a good thing for him as a future king it may be a good thing for many a man now to learn the sinfulness of sin by feeling its effects in his own person by writhing under those miseries of body and soul which wicked men can and do inflict on their fellowcreatures  there are sins which a good man will not pity but wage internecine war against them sins for which he is justified if god have called him thereto to destroy the sinner in his sins  the traitor the tyrant the ravisher the robber the extortioner are not objects of pity but of punishment and it may have been very good for david to be taught by sharp personal experience that those who robbed the widow and put the fatherless to death like the lawless lords of his time those like saul who smote the city of the priests for having given david foodmen and women children and sucklings oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the sword those who like the nameless traitor who so often rouses his indignationhis own familiar friend who lifted up his heel against himsought mens lives under the guise of friendship  that such i say were persons not to be tolerated upon the face of gods earth  we do not tolerate them now  we punish them by law  we even destroy them wholesale in war without inquiring into their individual guilt or innocence  david was taught not by abstract meditation in his study but by bitter need and agony not to tolerate them then  if he could have destroyed them as we do now it is not for us to say that he would have been wrong  and what if he were indignant and what if he expressed that indignation  i have yet to discover that indignation against wrong is aught but righteous noble and divine the flush of rage and scorn which rises and ought to rise in every honest heart when we see a woman or a child illused a poor man wronged or crushedwhat is that but the inspiration of almighty god  what is that but the likeness of christ  woe to the man who has lost that feeling  woe to the man who can stand coolly by and see wrong done without a shock or a murmur or even more to the very limits of the just laws of this land  he may think it a fine thing so to do a proof that he is an easy prudent man of the world and not a meddlesome enthusiast  but all that it does prove is  that the spirit of god who is the spirit of justice and judgment has departed from him  i say the spirit of god and the likeness of christ  instead of believing davids own statement of the wrong doings of these men about him we may say cynically and as it seems to me most unfairly of course there were two sides to davids quarrels as there are to all such and of course he took his own side and considered himself always in the right and every one who differed from him in the wrong and such a speech will sound sufficiently worldlywise to pass for philosophy with some critics but unfortunately he who says that of david will be bound in all fairness to say it of our lord jesus christ  for you must remember that there was a class of sinners in judaea to whom our lord speaks no word of pity or forgiveness  namely the very men who were his own personal enemies who were persecuting him and going about to kill him and that therefore by any hard words toward them he must have laid himself open just as much as david laid himself open to the imputation of personal spite  and yet what did he say to the scribes and pharisees  ye go about to kill me and therefore i am bound to say nothing harsh concerning you  what he did say was this  ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell  yes in the son of david as in davids self there was and is and will be for ever and ever no weak and really cruel indulgence but a burning fire of indignation against all hypocrisy tyranny lust cruelty and every other sin by which men oppress torment deceive degrade their fellowmen and still more still more remember that all young men their fellowwomen  that fire burns for everthe divine fire of god the fire not of hatred but of love to mankind which will therefore punish and if need be exterminate all who shall dare to make mankind the worse whether in body or soul or mind  but david prays god to kill his enemies  no doubt he does probably they deserved to be killed  he does not ask you will always remember if you be worthy of the name of critical students of the biblehe does not ask as did the mediaeval monks that his enemies should go to endless torments after they died  true or false that is a more modern notionand if it be applied to the psalms an interpolationof which david knew nothing  he asks simply that the men may die  probably he knew his own business best and the men deserved to die to be killed either by god or by man as do too many in all ages  if we take the bible as it stands and we have no right to do otherwise these men were trying to kill david  he could not and upon a point of honour would not kill them himself  but he believed and rightly that god can punish the offender whom man cannot touch and that he will and does punish them  and if he calls on god to execute justice and judgment upon these men he only calls on god to do what god is doing continually on the face of the whole earth  in fact god does punish here in this life  he does not as false preachers say give over this life to impunity and this world to the devil and only resume the reins of moral government and the right of retribution when men die and go into the next world  here in this life he punishes sin slowly but surely god punishes  and if any of you doubt my words you have only to commit sin and then see whether your sin will find you out  the whole question turns on this are we to believe in a living god or are we not  if we are not then davids words are of course worse than nothing  if we are i do not see why david was wrong in calling on god to exercise that moral and providential government of the world which is the very note and definition of a living god  but what right have we to use these words  my friends if the church bids us use these words she certainly does not bid us act upon them  she keeps them i believe most rightly as a record of a human experience which happily seems to us special and extreme of which we in a wellgoverned christian land know nothing and shall never know  special and extreme  alas alas  in too many countries in too many ages it has been the common the almost universal experience of the many weak enslaved tortured butchered at the wicked will of the few strong  there have been those in tens of thousands there may be those again who will have a right to cry to god of thy goodness slay mine enemies lest they slay or worse than slay both me and mine there were thousands of english after the norman conquest there were thousands of hindoos in oude before its annexation there are thousands of negroes at this moment in their native land of africa crushed and outraged by hereditary tyrants who had and have a right to appeal to god as david appealed to him against the robber lords of palestine a right to cry rid us o god if thou be a living god a god of justice and mercy rid us not only of these men but of their children after them  this tyrant stained with lust and wine and blood this robber chieftain who privily in his lurking dens murders the innocent and ravishes the poor when he getteth him into his net this slavehunting king who kills the captives whom he cannot sell and whose children after him will inevitably imitate his cruelties and his rapine and treacheriesdeal with him and his as they deserve  set an ungodly man to be ruler over him that he may find out what we have been enduring from his ungodly rule  let his days be few and another take his office  let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow  let his children beg their bread out of desolate places  let there be no man to pity him or take compassion on his fatherless childrento take his part and breed up a fresh race of tyrants to our misery  let the extortioner consume all he hath and the stranger spoil his labourfor what he has is itself taken by extortion and he has spoiled the labour of thousands  let his posterity be destroyed and in the next generation his name be clean put out  let the wickedness of his father and the sin of his mother be had in remembrance in the sight of the lord that he may root out the memorial of them from the earth and enable law and justice peace and freedom to take the place of anarchy and tyranny and blood  that prayer was answeredif we are to believe the records of norman not english monks in england after the conquest by the speedy extinction of the most guilty families among the norman conquerors  it is being answered thank god in hindostan at this moment  it will surely be answered in africa in gods good time for the lord reigneth be the nations never so unquiet  and we if we will read such words rationally and humanly remembering the state of society in which they were writtena state of society alas which has endured and still endures over a vast portion of the habitable globe where might is right and there is little or no principle save those of lust and greed and revengethen instead of wishing such words out of the bible we shall be glad to keep them there as testimonies to the moral government of the world by a god and a christ who will surely avenge the innocent blood and as a gospel of comfort to suffering millions when the news reaches them at last that they may call on god to deliver them from their tormentors and that he will hear their cry and will help them    sermon iv  davids deserts    2 samuel i 26  i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant hast thou been unto me  thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of women  passing the love of woman  how can that be we of these days shall say  what love can pass that saving the boundless love of him who stooped from heaven to earth that he might die on the cross for us no  david when he sang those words knew not the depth of womans love  and we shall have a right so to speak  the indefeasible and divine right which is bestowed by fact  as a fact we do not find among the ancient jews that exalting and purifying ideal of the relations between man and woman which is to be found thank god in these days in almost every british work of fiction or fancy  it is enunciated remember always in the oldest hebrew document on the very threshold of the bible in the very first chapters of genesis it is enunciated in its most ideal purity and perfection but in practice it was never fulfilled  no man seems to have attempted to fulfil it  man becomes a polygamist lower than the very birds of the air  abraham the father of the faithful has his sarah his princesswife  but he has others beside as many as he will  and so has david in like wise to the grief and harm of both him and abraham  so it would seem had the majority of the jews till after the captivity and even then the law of divorce seems to have been as indulgent toward the man as it was unjust and cruel toward the woman  then our blessed lord reasserted the ideal and primaeval law  he testified in behalf of woman the puppet of a tyrant who repudiated her upon the most frivolous pretext and declared that in the beginning god made them male and female the one husband for the one wife  but his words fell on unwilling ears  his disciples answered that if the case of a man with his wife be such it is not good for a man to marry  and such as a fact was the general opinion of christendom for many centuries  but of that as of other sayings of our lords were his own words fulfilled that the kingdom of god is as if a man should put seed into the ground and sleep and wake and the seed should spring up and bear fruit he knew not how  in due course of time when the teutonic nations were christianised there sprang up among them an idea of married love which showed that our lords words had at last fallen on good ground and were destined to bear fruit an hundredfold  gradually with many confusions and sometimes sinful mistakes there arose not in the cloister not in the studynot even alas in the churches of god as they were then but in the flowery meads of may under the forest boughs where birds sang to their mates by the side of the winter hearth from the lips of wandering minstrels in the hearts of young creatures whom neither the profligacy of worldlings nor the prudery of monks had yet defiled  from them arose a voice most human and yet most divine reasserting once more the lost law of eden and finding in its fulfilment strength and purity selfsacrifice and selfrestraint  that voice grew clearer and more strong as time went on  it was purged from youthful mistakes and youthful grossnesses till at the reformation it could speak clearly fully once and for allno longer on the ground of mere nature and private fancy but on the ground of scripture and reason and the eternal laws of god and the highest ideal of family life became possible to the family and to the nation in proportion as they accepted the teaching of the reformation  and impossible alas in proportion as they still allowed themselves to be ruled by a priesthood who asserted the truly monstrous dogma that the sexes reach each their highest excellence only when parted from each other  but these things were hidden from david  one can well conceive that he so gifted outwardly and inwardly must have experienced all that was then possible of womans love  in one case indeed he was notably brought under that moral influence of woman which we now regard and rightly as one of the holiest influences of this life the scene is unique in scripture  it reads like a scene out of the middle age  abigails meeting with david under the covert of the hill her turning him from his purpose of wild revenge by graceful compliments by the frank and yet most modest expression of her sympathy and admiration and davids chivalrous answer to her chivalrous appealall that scene which painters have so often delighted to draw is a forefeeling a prophecy as it were of the christian chivalry of after ages  the scene is most human and most divine  and we are not shocked to hear that after nabals death the fair and rich lady joins her fortune to that of the wild outlaw and becomes his wife to wander by wood and wold  but amid all the simple and sacred beauty of that scene we cannot forget we must not forget that abigail is but one wife of many that there is an element of pure single allabsorbing love absent at least in davids heart which was present in the hearts of our forefathers in many a like case and which they have handed down to us as an heirloom as precious as that of our laws and liberties  and all this was sin unto david and like all sin brought with it its own punishment  i do not mean to judge him  to assign his exact amount of moral responsibility  our lord forbids us positively to do that to any man and least of all to a man who only acted according to his right and the fashion of his race and his age  but we must fix it very clearly in our minds that sins may be punished in this life even though he who commits them is not aware that they are sins  if you are ignorant that fire burns your ignorance will not prevent your hand from suffering if you put it into the fire  if you are of opinion that two and two make five and therefore spend five pounds while you only possess four your mistake will not prevent your being in debt  and so with all mortal affairs  sin greek means first it seems to me a missing the mark end or aim of our existence a falling short of the law the ideal the good works which god has prepared beforehand for us to walk in and every such sin conscious or unconscious must avenge itself by the divine laws of the universe whether physical or spiritual  no miracle is needed no intervention of god with his own laws  his laws are far too well made for him to need to break them a second time because a sinner has broken them already  they avenge themselves  and so does polygamy  so it did in the case of david it is a breach of the ideal law of human nature and he who breaks that law must suffer as david suffered  look at the latter history of david and at what it might have been one can conceive so noble a personage under such womans influence as thank god is common now going down into an honoured old age and living together with a helpmate worthy of him in godly love and honesty to his lifes end seeing his children christianly and virtuously brought up to the praise and honour of god  and what was the fact  the indulgence of his passionsseemingly harmless to him at first becomes most harmful ere he dies  he commits a crime or rather a complication of crimes which stains his name for ever among men  i do not think that we shall understand that great crime of davids if we suppose it with some theologians to have been merely a sudden and solitary fall from which he recovered by repentance and became for the time to come as good a man as he had ever been  such a theory however well it may fit certain theological systems does not fit the facts of human life or as i hold the teaching of scripture  such terrible crimes are not committed by men in a right state of mind  nemo repente fuit turpissimus  he who commits adultery treachery and murder must have been long tampering at least in heart with all these  had not david been playing upon the edge of sin into sin he would not have fallen  he may have been quite unconscious of bad habits of mind but they must have been there growing in secret  the tyrannous selfwill which is too often developed by long success and command  the unscrupulous craft which is too often developed by long adversity and the necessity of sustaining oneself in a difficult position these must have been there  but even they would not have led david to do the deed which he did had there not been in him likewise that fearful moral weakness which comes from long indulgence of the passionsa weakness which is reckless alike of conscience of public opinion and of danger either to earthly welfare or everlasting salvation  it has been said but such a sin is so unlike davids character doubtless it was on the theory that david was a character mingled of good and evil  but on davids own theory that he was an utterly weak person without the help of god the act is perfectly like david  it is davids self  it is what david would naturally do when he had left hold of god  had he left hold of god in the wilderness he would have become a mere robberchieftain  he does leave hold of god in his palace on zion and he becomes a mere eastern despot  and what of his sons  the fearful curse of nathan that the sword shall never depart from his house needs as usual no miracle to fulfil it  it fulfils itself  the tragedies of his sons of amnon of absalom are altogether naturalto have been foreseen but not to have been avoided  the young men have seen their father put no restraint upon his passions  why should they put restraint on theirs  how can he command them when he has not commanded himself  and yet self restraint is what they above all men need  upstart princesthe sons of a shepherd boyintoxicated with honours to which they were not born they need the severest discipline they break out into the most frantic licence  what is there that they may not do and dare not do  nothing is sacred in their eyes  luxury ambition revenge vanity recklessness of decency open rebellion disgrace them in the sight of all men  and all these vices remember are heightened by the fact that they are not brothers but rivals sons of different mothers hating each other plotting against each other each probably urged on by his own mother who wishes poor fool to set up her son as a competitor for the throne against all the rest  and so are enacted in davids house those tragedies which have disgraced in every age the harems of eastern despots  but most significant is the fact that those tragedies complete themselves by the sin and shame of davids one virtuous and famous son  significant truly that in his old age solomon the wise should love strange women and deserting for their sakes the god of his fathers end as an idolater and a dotard worshipping the abominations of the heathen his once worldfamous wisdom sunk into utter folly  but it may be said the punishment of davids sin fell on his sons and not upon himself  how so  can there be a more heavy punishment a more bitter pain than to be punished in and by his children to see his own evil example working out their shame and ruin  but do not fancy that davids own character did not suffer for his sin  the theory that he became instantly on his repentance as good and great a man as he was before his fall was convenient enough to certain theologians of past days but it is neither warranted by the facts of scripture nor by the noble agonies however noble of the 51st psalm  it is a prayer for restoration and that of the only right and true kind  take not thy holy spirit from me and as such it was doubtless heard  but it need not have been fulfilled instantly and at once  it need not have been fulfilled it may be till that life to come of which david knew so little  it is a fact it was not fulfilled in this life  we read henceforth of no noble and heroical acts of david  from that time forthi speak with all diffidence and merely as it seems to mehe is a broken man  his attitude in absaloms rebellion is all but imbecile  no act is recorded of him to the day of his death but what is questionable if not mean and crafty  the one sudden flash of the old nobleness which he has shewn in pardoning shimei he himself stultifies with his dying lips by a mean command to solomon to entrap and slay the man whom he has too rashly forgiven  the whole matter of the sacrifice of sauls sons is so very strange so puzzling even shocking to our ideas of right and wrong that i cannot wonder at though i dare not endorse coleridges bold assertion that they were sacrificed to a plot of state policy and the suspicion of some critics that the whole scene was arranged between david and a too complaisant priesthood and gods name blasphemously taken in vain to find a pretext for a political murder  and so david shivers pitiably to his grave after a fashion which has furnished a jest for cynics and infidels but which contains to the eyes of a wise man the elements of the deepest tragedy one more awful lesson that human beauty valour wit genius success glory are vanity of vanities  that man is nothing and god is all in all  but some may ask what has all this to do with us  to do with us do you think that the scripture says in vain all these things are written for our example  as long as human nature is what it is now and was three thousand years ago so long shall we be tempted to commit the same sins as david  different in outward form according to the conditions of society but the same in spirit the same in sinfulness and the same in the sure punishment which they bring  and above all will men to the end be tempted to the sin of selfindulgence want of selfcontrol  in many ways but surely in some way or other will every mans temptation be to lose self control  therefore settle it in your minds young men that the first and the last of all virtues and graces of which god can give is self control as necessary for the saint and the sage lest they become fanatics or pedants as for the young man in the heyday of youth and health but as necessary for the young man as for the saint and the sage lest while they become only fanatics and pedants he become a profligate and a cumberer of the ground  remember thisremember it now in the glorious days of youth which never will return but in which you are sowing seed of which you will reap the fruit until your dying day  know that as you sow so will you reap  if you sow to the flesh you will of the flesh reap corruption corruptiondeterioration whether of health of intellect of character in some shape or other  you know not and no man knows what the curse will be like but the curse will surely come  the thing which is done cannot be undone and you will find that out before and not merely after your dying day  therefore rejoice in your youth for god has given it to you but remember that for it as for each and all of his gifts god will bring you into judgment  and when the hour of temptation comes go backgo back if you would escapeto what you all were taught at your mothers knee concerning the grace of god for that alone will keep you safe or angel or archangel or any created being safe in this life and in all lives to come    sermon v  friendship or david and jonathan    2 samuel i  26  i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant hast thou been unto me  thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of women  passing the love of woman  that is a hard saying  what love can pass that  yet david doubtless spoke truth  he was a man who must have had reason enough to know what womans love was like and when he said that the love of jonathan for him passed even that he bestowed on his friend praise which will be immortal  the name of jonathan will remain for ever as the perfect pattern of friendship  let us think a little today over his noble character and his tragical history  it will surely do us good  if it does nothing but make us somewhat ashamed of ourselves that is almost the best thing which can happen to us or to any man  we first hear of jonathan as doing a very gallant deed  we might expect as much  it is only greathearted men who can be true friends mean and cowardly men can never know what friendship means  the israelites were hidden in thickets and caves and pits for fear of the philistines when jonathan was suddenly inspired to attack a philistine garrison under circumstances seemingly desperate  and that first slaughter which jonathan and his armourbearer made was about twenty men within as it were an halfacre of land which a yoke of oxen might plough  that is one of those little hints which shews that the story is true written by a man who knew the placewho had probably been in the great battle of bethaven which followed and had perhaps ascended the rock where jonathan had done his valiant deed and had seen the dead bodies lying as they had fallen before him and his armourbearer  then follows the story of davids killing goliath and coming back to saul with the giants head in his hand and answering modestly to him i am the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite  and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved him as his own soul  then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul  and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle  he loved him as his own soul  and why  because his soul was like the soul of david because he was modest he loved davids modesty because he was brave he loved davids courage because he was virtuous he loved davids virtue  he saw that david was all that he was himself and more and therefore he loved him as his own soul  and therefore i said that it is only noble and great hearts who can have great friendships who admire and delight in other mens goodness who when they see a great and godlike man conceive like jonathan such an affection for him that they forget themselves and think only of him till they will do anything for him sacrifice anything for him as jonathan did for david  for remember that jonathan had cause to hate and envy david rather than love him and that he would have hated him if there had been any touch of meanness or selfishness in his heart  gradually he learnt as all israel learnt that samuel had anointed david to be king and that he jonathan was in danger of not succeeding after sauls death  david stood between him and the kingdom  and yet he did not envy daviddid not join his father for a moment in plotting his ruin  he would oppose his father secretly indeed and respectfully but still he would be true to david though he had to bear insults and threats of death  and mark here one element in jonathans great friendship  jonathan is a pious man as well as a righteous one  he believes the lords messages that he has chosen david to be king and he submits seeing that it is just and right and that david is worthy of the honour though it be to the hurt of himself and of his children after him it is the lords will and he instead of repining against it must carry it out as far as he is concerned  yes those who are most true to their fellowmen are always those who are true to god for the same spirit of god which makes them fear god makes them also love their neighbour  when david escapes from saul to samuel it is jonathan who does all he can to save him  the two friends meet secretly in the field  and jonathan said unto david o lord god of israel when i have sounded my father about tomorrow any time or the third day and behold if there be good toward david and i then send not unto thee and shew it thee the lord do so and much more to jonathan  then david and jonathan agree upon a sign between them by which david may know sauls humour without his bowbearer finding out david  he will shoot three arrows toward the place where david is in hiding and if he says to his bowbearer the arrows are on this side of thee david is to come for he is safe  but if he says the arrows are beyond thee david must flee for his life for the lord has sent him away  then jonathan goes in to meat with his father saul and excuses david for being absent  then sauls anger was kindled against jonathan and he said unto him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not i know that thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mother  for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die and jonathan answered saul his father and said unto him wherefore shall he be slain what hath he done  and saul cast a javelin at him to smite him whereby jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay david  he goes to the field and shoots the arrows and gives the sign agreed on  he sends his bowbearer back to the city and david comes out of his hidingplace in the rock ezel  and as soon as the lad was gone david arose out of a place toward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times and they kissed one another and wept one with another until david exceeded  and jonathan said to david go in peace forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the lord saying the lord be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever  and he arose and departed  and jonathan went into the city  and so the two friends parted and saw one another it seems but once again when jonathan went to david in the forest of ziph and strengthened his hand in god with noble words  after that jonathan vanishes from the story of david  we hear only of him that he died fighting by his fathers side upon the downs of gilboa  the green plot at their top where the israelites last struggle was probably made can be seen to this day and there most likely jonathan fell and over him david raised his famous lamentation  o jonathan thou wast slain in thine high places  i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan  very pleasant hast thou been unto me  thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of women  how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished  so ends the beautiful and tragical story of a truly gallant man seldom indeed will there be seen in the world such perfect friendship between man and man as that between jonathan and david seldom indeed shall we see anyone loving and adoring the very man whom his selfish interest would teach him to hate and to supplant but still every man may have and ought to have a friend  wretched indeed and probably deservedly wretched is the man who has none and every man may learn from this story of jonathan how to choose his friends  i say to choose  no one is bound to be at the mercy of anybody and everybody with whom he may come in contact  no one is bound to say that man lives next door to me therefore he must be my friend  we are bound not to avoid our neighbours  they are put near us by god in his providence  god intends every one of them good or bad to help in educating us in giving us experience of life and manners we are to learn from them live with them in peace and charity and only avoid them when we find that their company is really doing us harm and leading us into sin and folly  but a friendwhich is a much deeper and more sacred word than neighboura friend we have the right and the power to choose and our wisest plan will be to copy jonathan and choose our friends not for their usefulness but for their goodness not for their worth to us but for their worth in themselves and to choose if possible people superior to ourselves  if we meet a man better than ourselves more wise than ourselves more learned more experienced more delicateminded more highminded let us take pains to win his esteem to gain his confidence and to win him as a friend for the sake of his worth  then in our friendship as in everything else in the world we shall find the great law come true that he that loseth his life shall save it  he who does not think of himself and his own interest will be the very man who will really help himself and further his own interest the most  for the friend whom we have chosen for his own worth will be the one who will be worth most to us  the friend whom we have loved and admired for his own sake will be the one who will do most to raise our character to teach us to refine us to help us in time of doubt and trouble  the higherminded man our friend is the higherminded will he make us  for it is written as iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the face of his friend  nothing can be more foolish or more lowering to our own character than to choose our friends among those who can only flatter us and run after us who look up to us as oracles and fetch and carry at our bidding while they do our souls and characters no good but merely feed our selfconceit and lower us down to their own level but it is wise and ennobling to our own character to choose our friends among those who are nearer to god than we are more experienced in life and more strong and settled in character  wise it is to have a friend of whom we are at first somewhat afraid before whom we dare not say or do a foolish thing whose just anger or contempt would be to us a thing terrible  better it is that friendship should begin with a little wholesome fear till time and mutual experience of each others characters shall have brought about the perfect love which casts out fear  better to say with david he that telleth lies shall not stay in my sight i will not know a wicked person  yea let the righteous rather smite me friendly and reprove me  all my delight is in the saints that are in the earth and in such as excel in virtue  and let no man fancy that by so doing he lowers himself and puts himself in a mean place  there is no man so strongminded but what he may find a strongerminded man than himself to give him counsel no man is so noblehearted but what he may find a noblerhearted man than himself to keep him up to what is true and just and honourable when he is tempted to play the coward and be false to gods spirit within him  no man is so pureminded but what he may find a purer minded person than himself to help him in the battle against the world the flesh and the devil  my friends do not think it a mean thing to look up to those who are superior to yourselves  on the contrary you will find in practice that it is only the meanest hearts the shallowest and the basest who feel no admiration but only envy for those who are better than themselves who delight in finding fault with them and blackening their character and showing that they are not after all so much superior to other people while it is the noblesthearted the very men who are most worthy to be admired themselves who like jonathan feel most the pleasure the joy and the strength of reverence of having some one whom they can look up to and admire some one in whose company they can forget themselves their own interest their own pleasure their own honour and glory and cry him i must hear him i must follow to him i must cling whatever may betide  blessed and ennobling is the feeling which gathers round a wise teacher or a great statesman all the most earnest highminded and pious youths of his generation the feeling which makes soldiers follow the general whom they trust they know not why or whither through danger and hunger and fatigue and death itself the feeling which in its highest perfection made the apostles forsake all and follow christ saying lord to whom shall we go  thou hast the words of eternal lifewhich made them ready to work and to die for him whom the world called the son of the carpenter but whom they through the spirit of god bearing witness with their own pure and noble spirits knew to be the son of the living god  ay a blessed thing it is for any man or woman to have a friend one human soul whom we can trust utterly who knows the best and the worst of us and who loves us in spite of all our faults who will speak the honest truth to us while the world flatters us to our face and laughs at us behind our back who will give us counsel and reproof in the day of prosperity and selfconceit but who again will comfort and encourage us in the day of difficulty and sorrow when the world leaves us alone to fight our own battle as we can  if we have had the good fortune to win such a friend let us do anything rather than lose him  we must give and forgive live and let live  if our friend have faults we must bear with them  we must hope all things believe all things endure all things rather than lose that most precious of all earthly possessionsa trusty friend  and a friend once won need never be lost if we will only be trusty and true ourselves  friends may partnot merely in body but in spirit for a while  in the bustle of business and the accidents of life they may lose sight of each other for years and morethey may begin to differ in their success in life in their opinions in their habits and there may be for a time coldness and estrangement between them but not for ever if each will be but trusty and true  for then according to the beautiful figure of the poet they will be like two ships who set sail at morning from the same port and ere nightfall lose sight of each other and go each on its own course and at its own pace for many days through many storms and seas and yet meet again and find themselves lying side by side in the same haven when their long voyage is past  and if not my friends if they never meet if one shall founder and sink upon the seas or even change his course and fly shamefully home again  still is there not a friend of friends who cannot change but is the same yesterday today and for ever  what says the noble hymn   when gathering clouds around i view and days are dark and friends are few on him i lean who not in vain experienced every human pain he sees my griefs allays my fears and counts and treasures up my tears   passing the love of woman was his love indeed and of him jonathan was but such a type as the light in the dewdrop is the type of the sun in heaven  he himself saidand what he said that he fulfilledgreater love hath no man than thisthat a man lay down his life for his friends  in treachery and desertion in widowhood and childlessness in the hour of death and in the day of judgment when each soul must stand alone before its god one friend remains and that the best of all  285  from a charter quoted by ingulfand very probably a spurious one
