38324051	shakespeare bacon and the great unknown     introduction    the theory that francis bacon was in the main the author of shakespeares plays has now been for fifty years before the learned world  its advocates have met with less support than they had reason to expect  their methods their logic and their hypotheses closely resemble those applied by many british and foreign scholars to homer and by critics of the very highest school to holy writ  yet the baconian theory is universally rejected in england by the professors and historians of english literature and generally by students who have no profession save that of letters  the baconians however do not lack the countenance and assistance of highly distinguished persons whose names are famous where those of mere men of letters are unknown and in circles where the title of professor is not duly respected  the partisans of bacon aver or one of them avers that lord penzance lord beaconsfield lord palmerston judge webb judge holmes of kentucky us prince bismarck john bright and innumerable most thoughtful scholars eminent in many walks of life and especially in the legal profession     have been baconians or at least opposed to will shaksperes authorship  to these names of scholars i must add that of my late friend samuel clemens dlitt of oxford better known to many as mark twain  dr clemens was indeed no mean literary critic witness his epochmaking study of prof dowdens life of shelley while his researches into the biography of jeanne darc were most conscientious  with the deepest respect for the political wisdom and literary taste of lord palmerston prince bismarck lord beaconsfield and the late mr john bright and with every desire to humble myself before the judicial verdicts of judges holmes webb and lord penzance with sincere admiration of my late friend dr clemens i cannot regard them as in the first place and professionally trained students of literary history  they were no more specially trained students of elizabethan literature than myself they were amateurs in this province as i am an amateur who differ from all of them in opinion  difference of opinion concerning points of literary history ought not to make our angry passions rise  yet this controversy has been extremely bitter  i abstain from quoting the sweetmeats in captain macturks phrase which have been exchanged by the combatants  charges of ignorance and monomania have been answered by charges of forgery lying scandalous literary dishonesty and even inaccuracy  now no mortal is infallibly accurate but we are all sane and indifferent honest there have been forgeries in matters shakespearean alas but not in connection with the baconian controversy  it is an argument of the baconians and generally of the impugners of good wills authorship of the plays vulgarly attributed to him that the advocates of william shakspere gent as author of the plays differ like the kilkenny cats among themselves on many points  all do not believe with mr j c collins that will knew sophocles euripides and aeschylus but not aristophanes as well as mr swinburne did or knew them at allfor that matter  mr pollard differs very widely from sir sidney lee on points concerning the first folio and the quartos  my sympathies are with mr pollard few if any partisans of will agree with mrs stopes herself no baconian about the history of the stratford monument of the poet about wills authorship of titus andronicus and henry vi part i the friends of will like the friends of bacon are at odds among themselves  these and other divergencies of opinion cause the baconians to laugh as if they were a harmonious circle      for the baconian camp is not less divided against itself than the camp of the stratfordians  not all baconians hold that bacon was the legitimate son of that imperial votaress queen elizabeth  not all believe in the cryptogram of mr ignatius donnelly or in any other cryptograms  not all maintain that bacon in the sonnets was inspired by a passion for the earl of essex for queen elizabeth or for an early miniature of himself  not all regard him as the author of the plays of kit marlowe  not all suppose him to be a rosicrucian who possibly died at the age of a hundred and six or perhaps may be still running  not all aver that he wrote thirteen plays before 1593  but one party holds that in the main will was the author of the plays while the other party votes for baconor for bungay a great unknown  i use bungay as an endearing term for the mysterious being who was the author if francis bacon was not friar bungay was the rival of friar bacon as the unknown if he was not francis bacon is the rival of the inventor of inductive reasoning  i could never have expected that i should take a part in this controversy but acquaintance with the shakespeare problem restated 503 pp 1908 and later works of mr g g greenwood mp has tempted me to enter the lists  mr greenwood is worth fighting he is cunning of fence is learned and i cannot conceal my opinion that mr donnelly and judge holmes were rather ignorant  he is not over the threshold of eld as were judge webb and lord penzance when they took up shakespearean criticism  his knowledge of elizabethan literature is vastly superior to mine for i speak merely in matthew arnolds words as a belletristic trifler  moreover mr greenwood as a practising barrister is a judge of legal evidence and being a man of sense does not hold a brief for bacon as the author of the shakespearean plays and poems and does not value baconian cryptograms  in the following chapters i make endeavours conscientious if fallible to state the theory of mr greenwood  it is a negative theory  he denies that will shakspere or shaxbere or shagspur and so on was the author of the plays and poems  some other party was in the main with other hands the author  mr greenwood cannot or does not offer a guess as to who this ingenious somebody was  he does not affirm and he does not deny that bacon had a share greater or less in the undertaking  in my brief tractate i have not room to consider every argument to traverse every field  in philology i am all unlearned and cannot pretend to discuss the language of shakespeare any more than i can analyse the language of homer into protoarcadian and cyprian and so on  again i cannot pretend to have an opinion based on internal evidence about the genuine shakespearean character of such plays as titus andronicus henry vi part i and troilus and cressida  about them different views are held within both camps  i am no lawyer or naturalist as partridge said non omnia possumus omnes and cannot imagine why our author is so accurate in his frequent use of terms of lawif he be will and so totally at sea in natural historyif he be francis who took all knowledge for his province  how can a layman pretend to deal with shakespeares legal attainments after he has read the work of the learned recorder of bristol mr castle kc  to his legal mind it seems that in some of wills plays he had the aid of an expert in law and then his technicalities were correct  in other plays he had no such tutor and then he was sadly to seek in his legal jargon  i understand mr greenwood to disagree on this point  mr castle says i think shakespeare would have had no difficulty in getting aid from several sources  there is therefore no prima facie reason why we should suppose the information was supplied by bacon  of course there is not  in fact there are some reasons why one should attribute the legal assistance say to coke rather than to bacon  the truth is that bacon seems not to have been lawyer enough for wills purposes  we have no reason to believe that bacon was particularly well read in the technicalities of our law he never seems to have seriously followed his profession 0a  now we have mr greenwoods testimonial in favour of mr castle who really does know something about law 0b  mr castle thinks that bacon really did not know enough about law and suggests sir edward coke of all human beings as conceivably wills coach on legal technicalities  perhaps will consulted the archbishop of canterbury on theological niceties  que scais je  in some plays says mr castle wills law is all right in other plays it is all wrong  as to wills law when mr greenwood and mr castle differ a layman dare not intervene  concerning legend and tradition about our will it seems that in each case we should do our best to trace the quellen to discover the original sources and the steps by which the tale arrived at its late recorders in print and then each mans view as to the veracity of the story will rest on his sense of probability and on his bias his wish to believe or to disbelieve  there exists i believe only one personal anecdote of will the actor and on it the baconians base an argument against the contemporary recognition of him as a dramatic author  i take the criticism of mr greenwood who is not a baconian  one john manningham barristeratlaw a welleducated and cultured man notes in his diary february 2 1601 that at our feast we had a play called twelve night or what you will much like the comedy of errors or menaechmi in plautus but most like and near to that in italian called inganni  he confides to his diary the tricks played on malvolio as a good practice 0c  that is all  about the authorship he says nothing  perhaps he neither knew nor cared who the author was  in our day the majority of people who tell me about a play which they have seen cannot tell me the name of the author  yet it is usually printed on the playbill though in modest type  the public does not care a straw about the authors name unless he be deservedly famous for writing letters to the newspapers on things in general for his genius as an orator his enthusiasm as a moralist or in any other extraneous way  dr forman in his queer account of the plot of mack beth does not allude to the name of the author april 20 1610  twelfth night was not published till 1623 in the folio  there was no quarto to enlighten manningham about the authors name  we do not hear of printed playbills with authors names inserted at that period  it seems probable that occasional playgoers knew and cared no more about authors than they do at present  the world of the wits the critics such as francis meres poets playwrights and players did know and care about the authors apparently manningham did not  but he heard a piquant anecdote of two players and march 13 1601 inserted it in his diary  shakespeare once anticipated richard burbage at an amorous tryst with a citizens wife  burbage had by the way been playing the part of richard iii  while will was engaged in illicit dalliance the message was brought what a moment for bringing messages that richard iii was at the door and will caused return to be made that william the conqueror was before richard iii  shakespeares name william  my italics  mr greenwood argues that if shakspere the player was known to the world as the author of the plays of shakespeare it does seem extremely remarkable that manningham should have thought it needful to add shakespeares name william 0d  but was shakspere or any man known to the world as the author of the plays of shakespeare  no for mr greenwood writes nobody outside a very small circle troubled his head as to who the dramatist or dramatists might be 0e  to that very small circle we have no reason to suppose that manningham belonged despite his remarkable opinion that twelfth night resembles the menaechmi consequently it is not extremely remarkable that manningham wrote shakespeares name william to explain to posterity the joke about william the conqueror instead of saying the brilliant author of the twelfth night play which so much amused me at our feast a few weeks ago 0f  remarkable out of all hooping it would have been had manningham written in the style of mr greenwood  but manningham apparently did not trouble his head as to who the dramatist or dramatists might be  nobody outside a very small circle did trouble his poor head about that point  yet mr greenwood thinks it does seem extremely remarkable that manningham did not mention the author  later on the publication of the folio 1623 the world seems to have taken more interest in literary matters  mr greenwood says that then while the multitude would take ben jonsons noble panegyric on shakespeare as a poet au pied de la lettre the enlightened few would recognise that it had an esoteric meaning 0g  then it seems the worldthe multituderegarded the actor as the author  only the enlightened few were aware that when ben said shakespeare and swan of avon he meantsomebody else  quite different inferences are drawn from the same facts by persons of different mental conditions  for example in 1635 or 1636 cuthbert burbage brother of richard the famous actor wills comrade petitioned lord pembroke then lord chamberlain for consideration in a quarrel about certain theatres  telling the history of the houses he mentions that the burbages to ourselves joined those deserving men shakspere heminge condell phillips and others  cuthbert is arguing his case solely from the point of the original owners or leaseholders of the houses and of the wellknown actors to whom they joined themselves  judge webb and mr greenwood think that it does indeed seem strange    that the proprietors of the playhouses which had been made famous by the production of the shakespearean plays should in 1635twelve years after the publication of the great foliodescribe their reputed author to the survivor of the incomparable pair as merely a manplayer and a deserving man  why did he not remind the lord chamberlain that this deserving man was the author of all these famous dramas  was it because he was aware that the earl of pembroke knew better than that 0h  these arguments are regarded by some baconians as proof positive of their case  cuthbert burbage in 1635 or 1636 did not remind the earl of what the earl knew very well that the folio had been dedicated in 1623 to him and his brother by wills friends heminge and condell as they had been patrons of the late william shakspere and admirers of his plays  the terms of this dedication are to be cited in the text later  we all now would have reminded the earl of what he very well knew  cuthbert did not  the intelligence of cuthbert burbage may be gauged by anyone who will read pp 481484 in william shakespeare his family and friends by the late mr charles elton qc of white staunton  cuthbert was a puzzlepated old boy  the silence as to wills authorship on the part of this muddleheaded old cuthbert in 163536 cannot outweigh the explicit and positive public testimony to his authorship signed by his friends and fellowactors in 1623  men believe what they may but i prefer positive evidence for the affirmative to negative evidence from silence the silence of cuthbert burbage  one may read through mr greenwoods three books and note the engaging varieties of his views they vary as suits his argument but he is unaware of it or can justify his varyings  thus in 1610 one john davies wrote rhymes in which he speaks of our english terence mr will shakespeare good will  in his period patriotic english critics called a comic dramatist the english terence or the english plautus precisely as american critics used to call mr bryant the american wordsworth or cooper the american scott and as scots called the rev mr thomson the scottish turner somewhere i believe exists the belgian shakespeare  following this practice davies had to call will either our english terence or our english plautus  aristophanes would not have been generally recognised and will was no more like one of these ancient authors than another  thus davies was apt to choose either plautus or terence it was even betting which he selected  but he chanced to choose terence and this is curious and suggests suspicions to mr greenwoodand the baconians  they are so very full of suspicions  it does not suit the baconians or mr greenwood to find contemporary recognition of will as an author 0i  consequently mr greenwood finds daviess curious and at first sight inappropriate comparison of shakespeare to terence worthy of remark for terence is the very author whose name is alleged to have been used as a maskname or nom de plume for the writings of great men who wished to keep the fact of their authorship concealed  now davies felt bound to bring in some roman parallel to shakespeare and had only the choice of terence or plautus  meres 1598 used plautus davies used terence  mr greenwood 0j shows us that plautus would not do  could he shakespeare write only of courtesans and cocottes and not of ladies highly born cultured and refined      the supposed parallel plautus and shakespeare breaks down at every point  thus on mr greenwoods showing plautus could not serve davies or should not serve him in his search for a roman parallel to good will  but mr greenwood also writes if he shakespeare was to be likened to a latin comedian surely plautus is the writer with whom he should have been compared 0k  yet plautus was the very man who cannot be used as a parallel to shakespeare  of course no roman nor any other comic dramatist closely resembles the author of as you like it  they who selected either plautus or terence meant no more than that both were celebrated comic dramatists  plautus was no parallel to will  yet surely plautus is the author to whom he should have been compared by davies says mr greenwood  if davies tried plautus the comparison was bad if terence it was curious as terence was absurdly accused of being the nom de plume of some great concealed poets of rome  from all the known facts about terence says a baconian critic who has consulted smiths biographical dictionary it is an almost unavoidable inference that john davies made the comparison to shakspere because he knew of the point common to both cases  the common point is taken to be not that both men were famous comic dramatists but that roman literary gossips said and that baconians and mr greenwood say that terence was said to be a maskname and that shakespeare is a maskname  of the second opinion there is not a hint in literature of the time of good will  what surprises one most in this controversy is that men eminent in the legal profession should be antishakesperean if not overtly baconian  for the evidence for the contemporary faith in wills authorship is all positive from his own age comes not a whisper of doubt not even a murmur of surprise  it is incredible to me that his fellowactors and fellowplaywrights should have been deceived especially when they were such men as ben jonson and tom heywood one would expect lawyers of all people to have been most impatient of the surprising attempts made to explain away ben jonsons testimony by aid first of quite a false analogy scotts denial of his own authorship of his novels and secondly by the suppression of such a familiar fact as the constant inconsistency of bens judgments of his contemporaries in literature  mr greenwood must have forgotten the many examples of this inconsistency but i have met a baconian author who knew nothing of the fact  mr greenwood it is proper to say does not seem to be satisfied that he has solved what he calls the jonsonian riddle  really there is no riddle about will as about other authors his contemporaries and even his friends on occasion ben spoke with two voices now in terms of hyperbolical praise now in carping tones of censure  that is the obvious solution of the jonsonian riddle  i must apologise if i have in places spelled the name of the swan of avon shakespeare where mr greenwood would write shakspere and vice versa  he uses shakespeare where he means the author shakspere where he means will and is vexed with some people who write the name of will as shakespeare  as will in the opinion of a considerable portion of the human race and of myself was the author one is apt to write his name as shakespeare in the usual way  but difficult cases occur as in quotations and in conditional sentences  by any spelling of the name i always mean the undivided personality of him who sleeps by avon    chapter i  the baconian and antiwillian positions    till the years 18567 no voice was raised against the current belief about shakespeare 15641616  he was the author in the main of the plays usually printed as his  in some cases other authors one or more may have had fingers in his dramas in other cases shakespeare may have written over and transfigured earlier plays of himself and of others he may have contributed more or less to several plays mainly by other men  separately printed dramas published during his time carry his name on their titlepages but are not included in the first collected edition of his dramas the first folio put forth by two of his friends and fellowactors in 1623 seven years after his death  on all these matters did commentators critics and antiquarians for long dispute but none denied that the actor will shakspere spelled as heaven pleased was in the main the author of most of the plays of 1623 and the sole author of venus and adonis lucrece and the sonnets  even now in england at least it would be perhaps impossible to find one special and professed student of elizabethan literature and of the classical and european literatures who does not hold by the ancient belief the belief of shakespeares contemporaries and intimates the belief that he was in the sense explained above the author of the plays  but ours is not a generation to be overawed by authority as it is called  a small but eager company of scholars have convinced themselves that francis bacon wrote the shakespearean plays  that is the point of agreement among these enthusiasts  points of difference are numerous  some very wild little sects exist  meanwhile multitudes of earnest and intelligent men and women having read notices in newspapers of the baconian books or heard of them at lectures and teaparties disbelieve in the authorship of the stratford rustic and look down on the faithful of will shakespere with extreme contempt  from the baconians we receive a plain straightforward theory bacon wrote shakespeare as one of their own prophets has said 4a since we have plenty of evidence for bacons life and occupations during the period of shakespearean poetic activity we can compare what he was doing as a man a student a crown lawyer a pleader in the courts a political pamphleteer essayist courtier active member of parliament and so on with what he is said to have been doingby the baconians namely writing two dramas yearly  but there is another antiwillian theory which would dethrone will shakspere and put but a shadow in his place  conceive a concealed poet of high social position contemporary with bacon and shakespeare  let him be so fond of the law that he cannot keep legal shop out of his love sonnets even  make him a courtier a statesman a philosopher a scholar who does not blench even from the difficult latin of ovid and plautus  let this almost omniscient being possess supreme poetic genius extensive classical attainments and a tendency to make false quantities  then conceive him to live through the reigns of eliza and our james without leaving in history in science in society in law in politics or scholarship a single trace of his existence  he left nothing but the poems and plays usually attributed to will  as to the date of his decease we only know that it must necessarily have been later than the composition of the last genuine shakespearean playfor this paragon wrote it  such is the being who occupies in the theory of the nonbaconian but not antibaconian antiwillians the intellectual throne filled in the will shakespeare theory by will and in the baconian by bacontwo kings of brentford on one throne  we are to be much engaged by the form of this theory which is held by mr g g greenwood in his the shakespeare problem restated  in attempting to explain what he means i feel that i am skating on very thin ice  already in two volumes in re shakespeare 1909 and the vindicators of shakespeare mr greenwood has accused his critics of frequently misconceiving and misrepresenting his ideas  wherefore i also tremble  i am perfectly confident in saying that he holds no brief for the baconians  he is not a baconian  his position is negative merely  will of stratford is not the author of the shakespearean plays and poems  then who is  mr greenwood believes that work by an unknown number of hands exists in the plays first published all together in 1623  here few will differ from him  but setting aside this aspect of the case mr greenwood appears to me to believe in an entity named shakespeare or the author who is the predominating partner though mr greenwood does not credit him with all the plays in the folio of 1623 nor perhaps with the absolute entirety of any given play  the author or shakespeare is not a syndicate like the homer of many critics but an individual human being apparently of the male sex  as to the name by which he was called on earth mr greenwood is agnostic  he himself is not antibaconian  he does not oust bacon and put the unknown in his place  he neither affirms nor denies that bacon may have contributed more or less to the bulk of shakespearean work  to put it briefly  mr greenwood backs the field against the favourite our will and bacon may be in the field  if he has any part in the whole i suspect that it is the lions part but mr greenwood does not commit himself to anything positive  we shall find if i am not mistaken that mr greenwood regards the hypothesis of the baconians as an extremely reasonable one 7a and that for his purposes it would be an extremely serviceable one if not even essential  for as bacon was a genius to whose potentialities one can set no limit he is something to stand by whereas we cannot easily believei cannot believethat the actual author the shakespeare lived and died and left no trace of his existence except his share in the works called shakespearean  however the idea of the great unknown has for its partisans this advantage that as the life of the august shade is wholly unknown we cannot as in bacons case show how he was occupied while the plays were being composed  he must however have been much at court we learn and deep in the mysteries of legal terminology  was he sir edward coke  was he james vi and i  it is hard indeed to set forth the views of the baconians and of the antiwillians in a shape which will satisfy them  the task especially when undertaken by an unsympathetic person is perhaps impossible  i can only summarise their views in my own words as far as i presume to understand them  i conceive the baconians to cry that the world possesses a mass of transcendent literature attributed to a man named william shakespeare  of a man named william shakspere there are many varieties of spelling we certainly know that he was born 1564 and bred in stratfordonavon a peculiarly dirty stagnant and ignorant country town  there is absolutely no evidence that he or any stratford boy of his standing ever went to stratford school  his father his mother and his daughter could not write but in signing made their marks and if he could write which some of us deny he wrote a terribly bad hand as far as late traditions of seventy or eighty years after his death inform us he was a butchers apprentice and also a schoolmaster who knew latin pretty well and a poacher  he made before he was nineteen a marriage tainted with what meg dods calls antenup  he early had three children whom he deserted as he deserted his wife he came to london we do not know when about 1582 according to the guess of an antiquary of 1680 held horses at the door of a theatre so tradition says was promoted to the rank of servitor whatever that may mean became an actor a vagabond under the act and by 1594 played before queen elizabeth  he put money in his pocket heaven knows how for by 1597 he was bargaining for the best house in his native bourgade  he obtained by nefarious genealogical falsehoods too common alas in heraldry the right to bear arms and went on acting  in 161011  he retired to his native place he never took any interest in his unprinted manuscript plays though rapacious he never troubled himself about his valuable copyrights never dreamed of making a collected edition of his works  he died in 1616 probably of drink taken  legal documents prove him to have been a lender of small sums an avid creditor a wouldbe encloser of commons  in his will he does not bequeath or mention any books manuscripts copyrights and so forth  it is utterly incredible then that this man wrote the poems and plays so rich in poetry thought scholarship and knowledge which are attributed to william shakespeare  these must be the works of a concealed poet a philosopher a courtier moving in the highest circles a supreme legist and necessarily a great poet and student of the classics  no known person of the age but one bacon was a genius a legist a scholar a great poet and brilliant courtier with all the other qualifications so the author of the plays either was francis bacon or some person unknown who was in all respects equally distinguished but kept his light under a bushel  consequently the name william shakespeare is a pseudonym or penname wisely adopted by bacon or the other man as early as 1593 at a time when william shakspere was notoriously an actor in the company which produced the plays of the genius styling himself william shakespeare  let me repeat that to the best of my powers of understanding and of expression and in my own words so as to misquote nobody i have now summarised the views of the baconians sans phrase and of the more cautious or more credulous antiwillians as i may style the party who deny to will the actor any share in the authorship of the plays but do not overtly assign it to francis bacon  beyond all comparison the best work on the antiwillian side of the controversy is the shakespeare problem restated by mr g g greenwood see my introduction  to this volume i turn for the exposition of the theory that will shakspere with many other spellings is an actor from the countrya man of very scanty education in all probability and wholly destitute of books while william shakespeare or with the hyphen shakespeare is a nom de plume adopted by the great unknown concealed poet  when i use the word author here i understand mr greenwood to mean that in the plays called shakespearean there exists work from many pens  owing to the curious literary manners methods and ethics of dramatic writing in say 15891611  in my own poor opinion this is certainly true of several plays in the first collected edition the folio produced seven years after wills death namely in 1623 these curious collective methods of playwriting are to be considered later  matters become much more perplexing when we examine the theory that william shakespeare with or without the hyphen on the title pages of plays or when signed to the dedications of poems is the chosen penname or nom de plume of bacon or of the unknown  here i must endeavour to summarise what mr greenwood has written 11a on the name of the actor and the nom de plume of the unknown author who by the theory was not the actor  let me first confess my firm belief that there is no cause for all the copious writing about the spellings shakespeare or shakespeareas indicating the true but concealed poetand shakspere c as indicating the warwickshire rustic  at stratford and in warwickshire the clan name was spelled in scores of ways was spelled in different ways within a single document  if the actor himself uniformly wrote shakspere it seems that we have but five signatures he was accustomed to seeing the name spelled variously in documents concerning him and his affairs  in london the printers aimed at a kind of uniformity shakespeare or shakespeare  and even if he wrote his own name otherwise to him it was indifferent  lawyers and printers might choose their own mode of spellingand there is no more in the matter  i must now summarise briefly in my own words save where quotations are indicated in the usual way the results of mr greenwoods researches  the family of william shakspere of stratford perhaps it were safer to say the members of his name wrote their name in many different wayssome sixty i believe have been noted    but the form shakespeare seems never to have been employed by them and according to mr spedding shakspere of stratford never so wrote his name in any known case  according to many baconians he never wrote his name in his life  on the other hand the dedications of venus and adonis 1593 and of lucrece 1594 are inscribed william shakespeare without the hyphen  in 1598 the titlepage of loves labours lost bore the name w shakespere while in the same year richard ii and richard iii bear william shakespeare with the hyphen not without it as in the two dedications by the author  the name which appears in the body of the conveyance and of the mortgage bearing the actors signature is shakespeare while shackspeare appears in the will prepared as we must presume by or under the directions of francis collyns the stratford solicitor who was one of the witnesses thereto and received a legacy of 13 pounds 6s 8d  thus at stratford even the name was spelled in legal papers as it is spelled in the two dedications and in most of the titlepages and also is spelled otherwise as shackspeare  in march 1594 the actors name is spelled shakespeare in treasury accounts  the legal and the literary and treasury spellings and conveyances and mortgages and wills are not literature are shakespeare shackspeare shakespeare shakespereall four are used but we must regard the actor as never signing shakespeare in any of these varieties of spellingif sign he ever did at all events he is not known to have used the a in the last syllable  i now give the essence of mr greenwoods words 13a concerning the nom de plume of the concealed poet whoever he was  and now a word upon the name shakespeare  that in this form and more especially with a hyphen shakespeare the word makes an excellent nom de plume is obvious  as old thomas fuller remarks the name suggests martial in its warlike sound hastivibrans or shake speare  it is of course further suggestive of pallas minerva the goddess of wisdom for pallas also was a spearshaker pallas ap t pe t d and all will remember ben jonsons verses     on shakespeares truefiled lines    in each of which he seems to shake a lance as brandished at the eyes of ignorance   there is more about pallas in booktitles to which additions can easily be made and about jonsons crispinus or crispinas but perhaps we have now the gist of mr greenwoods remarks on the excellent nom de plume cf pp 3137  on the whole of this cf the shakespeare problem restated pp 293295 a nom de plume called a pseudonym pp 307 312 shakespeare a mask name p 328 a pseudonym p 330 nom de plume p 335  now why was the nom de plume or pseudonym william shakespeare an excellent nom de plume for a concealed author courtier lawyer scholar and so forth  if shakespeare suggested pallas athene goddess of wisdom and of many other things and so was appropriate why add william  in 1593 when the pseudonym first appears in venus and adonis a country actor whose name in legal documentspresumably drawn up by or for his friend francis collyns at stratfordis written william shakespeare was before the town as an actor in the leading company that of the lord chamberlain  this company produced the plays some of which by 1598 bear w shakespere or william shakespeare on their titlepages  thus even if the actor habitually spelled his name shakspere william shakespeare was practically on the baconian theory not only a pseudonym of one man a poet but also the real name of another man a wellknown actor who was not the concealed poet  william shakespeare or shakespere was thus in my view the ideally worst pseudonym which a poet who wished to be concealed could possibly have had the fatuity to select  his plays and poems would be as they were universally attributed to the actor who is represented as a person conspicuously incapable of writing them with mr greenwoods arguments against the certainty of this attribution i deal later  had the actor been a man of rare wit and of good education and wide reading the choice of name might have been judicious  a concealed poet of high social standing with a strange fancy for rewriting the plays of contemporary playwrights might obtain the manuscript copies from their owners the lord chamberlains company through that knowledgeable witty and venal member of the company will shakspere  he might then rewrite and improve them more or less as it was his whim to do  the actor might make fair copies in his own hand give them to his company and say that the improved works were from his own pen and genius  the lie might pass but only if the actor in his life and witty talk seemed very capable of doing what he pretended to have done  but if the actor according to some baconians could not write even his own name he was impossible as a mask for the poet  he was also impossible i think if he were what mr greenwood describes him to be  mr greenwood in his view of the actor as he was when he came to london does not deny to him the gift of being able to sign his name but if he were educated at stratford free school of which there is no documentary record according to mr halliwellphillipps he was removed from school long before the usual age in all probability when he was about thirteen an age at which some boys later well known went up to their universities  if we send him to school at seven or so it appears that he could only have enjoyed such advantages as it may be supposed to have provided for a period of five or six years at the outside  he was then withdrawn and as it seems put to calfslaughtering 16a  what the advantages may have been we try to estimate later  mr greenwood with mr halliwellphillipps thinks that will could have learned but little there  no doubt boys at elizabethan grammar schools if they remained long enough had a good deal of latin driven into them  latin indeed was the one subject that was taught and an industrious boy who had gone through the course and attained to the higher classes would generally be able to write fair latin prose  but he would learn very little else except to write fair latin prose  what we now call culture certainly did not enter into the curriculum nor english nor modern languages nor literature 17a  mr halliwellphillipps says that removed prematurely from school residing with illiterate relatives in a bookless neighbourhood thrown into the midst of occupations adverse to scholastic progressit is difficult to believe that when he first left stratford he was not all but destitute of polished accomplishments 17b  mr greenwood adds the apprenticeship to a butcher or draper but doubts the poaching and the frequent whippings and imprisonments as in the story told by the rev r davies in 1708 17c  that this promising young man when he came to london spoke the warwickshire dialect or patois is then as certain as anything can be that is incapable of mathematical proof 17d  here is the young warwickshire provincial     17e producing apparently five or six years after his arrival in town venus and adonis    is it conceivable that this was the work of the stratford player of whom we know so little but of whom we know so much too much  if so we have here a veritable sixteenthcentury miracle 17f  moreover our great supposed poet and dramatist had at his death neither book nor manuscript in his possession or to which he was legally entitled or in which he had any interest whatever 17g  if it be not conceivable now that the rustic speaking in a patois could write venus and adonis manifestly it was inconceivable in 1593 when venus and adonis was signed william shakespeare  no man who knew the actor as described could believe that he was the author but there does not exist the most shadowy hint proving that the faintest doubt was thrown on the actors authorship ignorant as he was bookless and rude of speech  for such a will as mr greenwood describes to persuade the literary and dramatic world of his age that he did write the plays would have been a miracle consequently mr greenwood has to try to persuade us that there is no sufficient evidence that will did persuade say ben jonson of his authorship and we shall see whether or not he works this twentieth century miracle of persuasion  of course if will were unable to write even his name as an enthusiastic baconian asserts mr greenwood sees that will could not easily pass for the author 18a  but his own bookless actor with a patois seems to him as author of venus and adonis almost inconceivable  yet despite wills bookless rusticity this poem with lucrece which displays knowledge of a work of ovid not translated into english by 1593 was regarded as his own  i must suppose therefore that will was not manifestly so ignorant of latin as mr greenwood thinks  i think it highly probable says this critic that he attended the grammar school at stratford where nothing but latin was taught for four or five years and that later in life after some years in london he was probably able to bumbast out a line and perhaps to pose as poetape that would be thought our chief  nay i am not at all sure that he would not have been capable of collaborating with such a man as george wilkins and perhaps of writing quite as well as he if not even better  but it does not follow from this that he was the author either of venus and adonis or of hamlet 19a  nothing follows from all this  we merely see that in mr greenwoods private opinion the actor might write even better than george wilkins but could not write venus and adonis  will therefore though bookless is not debarred here from the pursuits of literature in partnership with wilkins  we have merely the critics opinion that will could not write hamlet even if like wordsworth he had the mind even if the gods had made him more poetical than wilkins  again he had had but little schooling he had small latin and less greek as ben jonson truly says but he was a good johannes factotum he could arrange a scene and when necessary bumbast out a blank verse 19b  the johannes factotum who could bumbast out a blank verse is taken from robert greenes hackneyed attack on an actorpoet shake scene published in 1592  poetape that would be thought our chief is from an epigram on an actorpoet by ben jonson 160116 if the allusions by greene and jonson are to our will he by 1592 had a literary ambition so towering that he thought his own work in the new art of dramatic blank verse was equal to that of marlowe not to speak of wilkins and greene reckoned him a dangerous rival to three of his playwright friends of whom marlowe is one apparently  if jonsons poetape be meant for will by 1601 will would fain be thought the chief of contemporary dramatists  his vanity soared far above george wilkins  greenes phrases and jonsons are dictated by spite jealousy and envy and from them a true view of the work of the man whom they envy the actorpoet cannot be obtained  we might as well judge moliere in the spirit of the author of elomire hypocondre and of de vise  the antiwillian arguments keep on appearing going behind the scenes and reappearing like a stage army  to avoid this phenomenon i reserve what is to be said about shakescene and poetape for another place pp 138145 infra but i must give the reader a warning  concerning william shakespeare as a nom de plume or pseudonym mr greenwood says some indeed would see through it and roundly accuse the player of putting forth the works of others as his own  to such he would be a poetape or an upstart crow shakescene beautified with the feathers of other writers 21a  if this be true if some would see through mr greenwood apparently means did see through the nom de plume the case of the antiwillians is promising  but in this matter mr greenwood se trompe  neither greene nor jonson accused shakescene or poet ape of putting forth the works of others as his own  that is quite certain as far as the scorns of jonson and greene have reached us  see pp 141145 infra  if an actor obviously incapable of wit and poetry were credited with the plays the keenest curiosity would arise in the profession and among rival playwrights who envied the wealth and glory of the actors  this curiosity prompting the wits and players to watch and shadow will would to put it mildly most seriously imperil the secret of the concealed author who had the folly to sign himself william shakespeare  human nature could not rest under such a provocation as the concealed poet offered  this is so obvious that had one desired to prove bacon or the unknown to be the concealed author one must have credited his mask will with abundance of wit and fancy and as for learningwith about as much as he probably possessed  but the baconians make him an illiterate yokel and we have quoted mr greenwoods estimate of the young warwickshire provincial  we all have our personal equations in the way of belief  that the plot of the nom de plume should have evaded discovery for a week if the actor were the untutored countryman of the hypotheses is to me for one absolutely incredible  a concealed poet looking about for a nom de plume and a mask behind which he could be hidden would not have selected the name or the nearest possible approach to the name of an ignorant unread actor  as he was never suspected of not being the author of the plays and poems will cannot have been a country ignoramus manifestly incapable of poetry wit and such learning as the plays exhibit  every one must judge for himself mr greenwood fervently believes in what i disbelieve 22a  very few englishmen    in elizabethan times concerned themselves at all or cared one brass farthing about the authorship of plays     says mr greenwood  very few care now  they know the actors names  in vain as a rule do i ask playgoers for the name of the author of their entertainment but in elizabeths time the few who cared were apt to care very much and they would inquire intensely when the stratford actor a bookless untaught man was announced as the author of plays which were among the most popular of their day  the seekers never found any other author  they left no hint that they suspected the existence of any other author  hence i venture to infer that will seemed to them no unread rustic but a fellow of infinite fancyno scholar to be sure but very capable of writing the pieces which he fathered  they may all have been mistaken  nobody can prove that heywood and ben jonson and the actors of the company were not mistaken  but certain it is that they thought the will whom they knew capable of the works which were attributed to him  therefore he cannot possibly have been the man who could not write of the more impulsive baconians or the bookless and probably all but latinless man of mr greenwoods theory  the positions already seem to me to be untenable    chapter ii  the silence about shakespeare    before proceeding further to examine mr greenwoods book and the baconian theories with the careful attention which they deserve we must clear the ground by explaining two points which appear to puzzle baconians though to be sure they have their own solutions of the problems  the first question is  why considering that shakespeare by the consent of the learned of most of the polite foreign nations was one of the worlds very greatest poets have we received so few and such brief notices of him from the pens of his contemporaries  it is wonderful exclaims mr crouchbatchelor that hundreds of persons should not have left records of him 27a  we know nearly as much about the most insignificant writer of the period as we know of him but fifty times more about most of his contemporaries  it is senseless to try to account for this otherwise than by recognising that the man was not the author  mr crouchbatchelor is too innocent  he sees the sixteenth century in the colours of the twentieth  we know nothing except a few dates of birth death entrance at school college the inns of court and so forth concerning several of shakespeares illustrious contemporaries and successors in the art of dramatic poetry  the baconians do not quite understand or at least keep steadily before their minds one immense difference between the elizabethan age and later times  in 15901630 there was no public excitement about the characters personalities and anecdotage of merely literary men poets and playwrights who held no position in public affairs as spenser did or in court society and war as sidney did who did not write about their own feuds and friendships like greene and nash who did not expand into prefaces and reminiscences and satires like ben jonson who never killed anybody as ben did nor were killed like marlowe nor were involved like him in charges of atheism and so forth nor imprisoned with every chance of having their ears and noses slit like marston  consequently silence and night obscure the lives and personalities of kyd chapman beaumont fletcher dekker webster and several others as night and silence hide shakespeare from our view  he was popular on the stage some of his plays were circulated separately in cheap and very perishable quartos  no collected edition of his plays appeared during his life without that he could not be studied and recognised in his greatness  he withdrew to the country and died  there was no enthusiastic curiosity about him nobody boswellised any playwright of his time  the folio of 1623 gave the first opportunity of studying him as alone he can be studied  the civil wars and the reign of the saints distracted mens minds and depressed or destroyed the stage  sir william davenant a boy when shakespeare died used to see the actor at his fathers inn at oxford was interested in him and cherished the embers of the drama which were fading before the theatres were closed  davenant collected what he could in the way of information from old people of the stage he told shakespearean anecdotes in conversation a few reached the late day when uncritical inquiries began say 168090 at earliest  the memories of ancient people of the theatre and clerks and sextons at stratford were ransacked to very little purpose  as these things were so how can we expect biographical materials about shakespeare  as to the man as to how his character impressed contemporaries we have but the current epithets  friendly gentle and sweet the praise of his worth by two of the actors in his company published in 1623 and the brief prose note of ben jonsonthis is more than we have for the then so widely admired beaumont ben jonsons friend or chapman or the adored fletcher into the dark go one and all shakespeare and the others  to be puzzled by and found theories on the silence about shakespeare is to show an innocence very odd in learned disputants  the baconians as usual make a puzzle and a mystery out of their own misappreciation of the literary and social conditions of shakespeares time  that world could not possibly appreciate his works as we do the world till 1623 possessed only a portion of his plays in cheap pamphlets in several of these his text was mangled and in places unintelligible  and in not a single instance were anecdotes and biographical traits of playwrights recorded except when the men published matter about themselves or when they became notorious in some way unconnected with their literary works drummond in scotland made brief notes of ben jonsons talk shakespeare he never met  that age was not widely and enthusiastically appreciative of literary merit in playwrights who were merely dramatists and in no other way notorious or eminent  mr greenwood justly says the contemporary eulogies of the poet afford proof that there were some cultured critics of that day of sufficient taste and acumen to recognise or partly recognise his excellence     30a  here i omit some words presently to be restored to the text  from such critics the poet received such applause as has reached us we also know that the plays were popular but the audiences have not rushed to pen and ink to record their satisfaction  with them as with all audiences the actors and the spectacle much more than the cackle were the attractions  when dr ingleby says that the bard of our admiration was unknown to the men of that age he uses hyperbole and means i presume that he was unknown as all authors are to the great majority and that those who knew him in part made no modern fuss about him 31a  the second puzzle iswhy did shakespeare conscious of his great powers never secure for his collected plays the permanence of print and publication  we cannot be sure that he and his company in fact did not provide publishers with the copy for the better quartos or pamphlets of separate plays as mr pollard argues on good grounds that they sometimes did 31b  for the rest no dramatic author edited a complete edition of his works before ben jonson a scholarly man set the example in the year of shakespeares and of beaumonts death 1616  neither beaumont nor fletcher collected and published their works for the stage  the idea was unheard of before jonson set the example and much of his work lay unprinted till years after his death we must remember the conditions of playwriting in shakespeares time  there were then many poets of no mean merit all capable of admirable verse on occasion and in various degrees possessed of the lofty vigorous and vivid style of that great age  the theatre and writing for the theatre afforded to many men of talent a means of livelihood analogous to that offered by journalism among ourselves they were apt to work collectively several hands hurrying out a single play and in twos or threes or fours or fives they often collaborated  as a general rule a play when finished was sold by the author or authors to a company of players or to a speculator like the notorious philip henslowe and the new owners the grand possessors were usually averse to the publication of the work lest other companies might act it  the plays were primarily written to be acted  the company in possession could have the play altered as they pleased by a literary man in their employment  to follow mr greenwoods summary of the situation it would seem that an author could restrain any person from publishing his manuscript or could bring an action against him for so doing so long as he had not disposed of his right to it and that the publisher could prevent any other publisher from issuing the work at the same time it is clear that the law was frequently violated    whether because of the difficulty of enforcing it or through the supineness of authors and that in consequence authors were frequently defrauded by surreptitious copies of their works being issued by piratical publishers 33a  it may appear that to authors we should in the case of plays add owners such as theatrical companies for no case is cited in which such a company brings an action against the publisher of a play which they own  the two players of shakespeares company who sign the preface to the first edition of his collected plays 1623 the first folio complain that divers stolen and surreptitious copies of single plays have been put forth maimed and deformed by the frauds and stealths of injurious impostors  they speak as if they were unable to prevent or had not the energy to prevent these frauds in the accounts of the aforesaid henslowe we find him paying forty shillings to a printer to stop or stay the printing of a play patient grizel by three of his hacks  we perhaps come across an effort of the company to prevent or delay the publication of the merchant of venice on july 17 1598 in the stationers register  james robertes and all other printers are forbidden to print the book without previous permission from the lord chamberlain the protector of will shakespeares company  two years passed before robertes issued the book 34a  as is well known heywood a most prolific playwright boasts that he never made a double sale of his pieces to the players and the press  others occasionally did which heywood clearly thought less than honest  as an author who was also an actor and a shareholder in his company wills interests were the same as theirs  it is therefore curious that some of his pieces were early printed in quartos from very good copies while others appeared in very bad copies clearly surreptitious  probably the company gave a good ms copy sometimes to a printer who offered satisfactory terms after the gloss of novelty was off the acted play 34b  in any case we see that the custom and interests of the owners of manuscript plays ran contrary to their early publication  in 1619 even ben jonson who loved publication told drummond that half of his comedies were still unprinted  these times were not as our own and must not be judged by ours whoever wrote the plays the actor or bacon or the man in the moon whoever legally owned the manuscripts was equally incurious and negligent about the preservation of a correct text  as we shall see later while baconians urge without any evidence that bacon himself edited or gave to ben jonson the duty of editing the first collected edition 1623 the work has been done in an indescribably negligent and reckless manner and as mr greenwood repeatedly states the edition in his opinion contains at least two plays not by his shakespearethat concealed poetand masses of non shakespearean work  how this could happen if bacon as on one hypothesis either revised the plays himself or entrusted the task to so strict an editor as ben jonson i cannot imagine  this is also one of the difficulties in mr greenwoods theory  thus we cannot argue if the actor were the author he must have been conscious of his great powers therefore the actor cannot have been the author for the actor wholly neglected to collect his printed and to print his manuscript works  this argument is equally potent against the authorship of the plays by bacon  he too left the manuscripts unpublished till 1623  but he could not avow his authorship cry baconians giving various exquisite reasons  indeed if bacon were the author he might not care to divulge his long association with a cry of players and a man like will of stratford  but he had no occasion to avow it  he had merely to suggest to the players through any safe channel that they should collect and publish the works of their old friend will shakspere  thus indifferent was the main author of the plays whether he were actor or statesman and the actor at least is not to blame for the chaos of the first collected edition made while he was in his grave and while bacon was busy in revising and superintending latin translations of his works on scientific subjects  we now understand why there are so few contemporary records of shakspere the man and see that the neglect of his texts was extreme whether or not he were the author  the neglect was characteristic of the playwrights of his own and the next generation  in those days it was no marvel few cared  nine years passed before a second edition of the collected plays appeared  thirtytwo years went by before a third edition was issuedyears of war and tumult yet they saw the posthumous publication of the collected plays of beaumont and fletcher  there remains one more mystery connected with publication  when the first collected edition of the plays appeared it purported to contain all his comedies histories and tragedies  according to the postulate of the baconians it was edited by the author or by jonson acting for him  it contains several plays which according to many critics are not the authors  this if true is mysterious and so is the fact that a few plays were published as by shakespeare in the lifetime both of the actor and of bacon plays which neither acknowledged for his own for we hear of no remonstrance fromwhoever william shakespeare was  it is impossible for me to say why there was no remonstrance  suppose that will merely supplied bacons plays under his own name with a slight difference in spelling to his company  it was as much his interest in that case to protest when bacons penname was taken in vain as if he had spelled his own surname with an a in the second syllable  there is another instance which mr greenwood discusses twice 37a in 1599 jaggard published the passionate pilgrim w shakespeare out of twenty poems five only were by w s  in 1612 jaggard added two poems by tom heywood retaining w shakespeares name as sole author  heywood protested in print and stated that shakespeare was offended and says mr greenwood very probably he was so but as he was so i conceive a concealed poet writing under a nom de plume he seems to have only made known his annoyance through the medium of heywood  if so heywood knew who the concealed poet was  turning to pp 348 349 we find mr greenwood repeating the same story with this addition that the author of the poems published by jaggard to do himself right hath since published them in his own name  that is w shakespeare has since published under his own name such pieces of the passionate pilgrim as are his own  the author i know adds heywood was much offended with mr jaggard that altogether unknown to him presumed to make so bold with his name  why was the author so slack when jaggard in 1599 published w ss poems with others not by w s  how can anyone explain by any theory  it was as open to him in 1599 as in 1612 to publish his own pieces under his own name or penname  here we observe says mr greenwood 38a that heywood does nothing to identify the author with the player  this is we shall see the eternal argument  why should heywood speaking of w shakespeare explain what all the world knew  there was no other w shakespeare with or without the e and a but one the actor in the world of letters of elizabeth and james  who the author was heywood himself has told us elsewhere  the author waswill  but why shakespeare was so indifferent to the use of his name or when he was moved acted so mildly it is not for me or anyone to explain  we do not know the nature of the circumstances in detail we do not know that the poet saw hopes of stopping the sale of the works falsely attributed to him  i do not even feel certain that he had not a finger in some of them  knowing so little a more soaring wit than mine might fly to the explanation that shakespeare was the nom de plume of bacon or his unknown equivalent and that he preferred to let sleeping dogs lie or as mr greenwood might quote the latin tag said ne moveas camarinam    chapter iii  that impossible hethe schooling of shakespeare    the bannercry of the baconians is the word impossible  it is impossible that the actor from stratford as they think of him a bookless untutored lad speaking in patois should have possessed the wide deep and accurate scholarship displayed by the author of the plays and poems  it is impossible that at the little free school of stratford if he attended it he should have gained his wide knowledge of the literatures of greece and rome  to these arguments the orthodox stratfordian is apt to reply that he finds in the plays and poems plenty of inaccurate general information on classical subjects information in which the whole literature of england then abounded  he also finds in the plays some knowledge of certain latin authors which cannot be proved to have been translated at the date when shakespeare drew on them  how much latin shakespeare knew in our opinion will presently be explained  but in reply to the baconians and the antiwillians we must say that while the author of the plays had some lore which scholars also possessed he did not use his knowledge like a scholar  we do not see how a scholar could make as the scansion of his blank verse proves that the author did make the second syllable of the name of posthumus in cymbeline long  he must have read a famous line in horace thus   eheu fugaces posthoome posthoome   which could scarce scape whipping even at stratford free school in the same way he makes the penultimate syllable of andronicus short equally impossible  mr greenwood we shall see denies to him titus andronicus but also appears to credit it to him as one of the older plays which he revised improved and dressed 44a and that is taken to have been all his authorship in several cases  a scholar would have corrected not accepted false quantities  in other cases as when greeks and trojans cite plato and aristotle in troilus and cressida while plato and aristotle lived more than a thousand years after the latest conceivable date of the siege of troy i cannot possibly suppose that a scholar would have permitted to himself the freak any more than that in the winters tale he should have borrowed from an earlier novel the absurdity of calling delphi delphos a non existent word of confusing delphos with delos and placing the delphian oracle in an island  in the same play the author quite needlessly makes the artist giulio romano 14921546 contemporary with the flourishing age of the oracle of the pythian apollo  this at least would not be ignorance  we have i think sufficient testimony to bens inability to refrain from gibes at shaksperes want of scholarship  rowe who had traditions of davenants tells how in conversation with suckling davenant endymion porter and hales of eton ben harped on wills want of learning and how hales snubbed him  indeed ben could have made mirth enough out of the winters tale  for granting to mr greenwood 45a that the mention of delphos suggests the bohemia of a much earlier date and under the reign of ottocar 125578 bohemia extended from the adriatic to the shores of the baltic that only makes matters far worse  delphos never was a placename there was no oracle on the isle of delphos there were no oracles in 125578 ad and perdita who could have sat for her portrait to giulio romano was contemporary with an oracle at delphos but not with ottocar  there never was so mad a mixture not even in ivanhoe not even in kenilworth  scott erred deliberately as he says in his prefaces but will took the insular oracle of delphos from greene inserted giulio romano for his personal diversion never heard of ottocar no more than i and made a delightful congeries of errors in gaiety of heart  nobody shall convince me that francis bacon was so charmingly irresponsible but i cannot speak so confidently of mr greenwoods great unknown a severe scholar but perhaps a frisky soul  there was no region called bohemia when the delphic oracle was in vigourthis apology apparently contrived by sir edward sullivan is the most comic of erudite reflections  some cruel critic has censured the lovely speech of perdita concerning the flowers which proserpine let fall when she was carried off by dis  how could she brought up in the hut of a bohemian shepherd know anything of the rape of proserpine  why not as she lived in the days of the delphic oracleand giulio romano and of printed ballads  it is impossible baconians cry that the rabbitstealer brought up among the audreys and jaquenettas of warwickshire should have created the noble and witty ladies of the court and known the style of his armado and understood how dukes and kings talk among themselvesusually in blank verse it appears  it is impossible that the homekeeping yokel should have heard of the obscure sic court of navarre and known that at venice there was a place called the rialto and a common ferry called the tranect it is impossible that he should have had an intimate knowledge of the castle of elsinore though an english troupe of actors visited denmark in 1587  to will all this knowledge was impossible for these and many more exquisite reasons the yokels authorship of the plays is a physical impossibility  but scholars neither invent nor tolerate such strange liberties with time and place with history geography and common sense  will shakspere either did not know what was right or more probably did not care and supposed like fielding in the old anecdote that the audience would not find it out  how could a scholar do any of these things  he was as incapable of them as ben jonson  such sins no scholar is inclined to they have for him no temptations  as to shaksperes schooling the baconians point at the current ignorance of stratfordonavon where many topping burgesses even aldermen made their marks in place of signing their names to documents  shakespeares father wife and daughter made their marks in place of signing  so did lady jane gordon daughter of the earl of huntly when she married the cultivated earl of bothwell 1566  there is no evidence from a roll of schoolboys at stratford free grammar school about 156477 that any given boy attended it for no roll exists  consequently there is no evidence that will was a pupil  in the appendix to malones life of shakespeare will be found two latin letters written by alumni of stratford school contemporary with shakespeare says mr collins 48a  but though the writers were stratford boys contemporary with shakespeare in later life his associates as there is no roll of pupils names how do we know the baconians may ask that these men were educated at stratford school why not at winchester eton st pauls or anywhere  need one reply  mr collins goes on in his simple confiding way to state that one letter is by abraham sturley afterwards an alderman of stratford      pursuing the facts we find that sturley wrote in latin to richard quiney shakespeares friend who if he could read sturleys letter could read latin  then young richard quiney apparently aged eleven wrote in latin to his father  if young richard quiney be the son of shakespeares friend richard quiney then of course his latin at the age of eleven would only prove that if he were a schoolboy at stratford one stratford boy could write latin in the generation following that of shakespeare  thus may reason the baconians  perhaps however we may say that if stratford boys contemporary with shakspere in his own rank and known to him learned latin which they retained in manhood shakspere if he went to school with them may have done as much  concerning the school a free grammar school we know that during shakespeares boyhood the mastership was not disdained by walter roche perhaps a fellow of what was then the most progressive college in learning of those at oxford namely corpus christi  that shakespeare could have been his pupil is uncertain the dates are rather difficult  i think it probable that he was not and we do not know the qualifications of the two or three succeeding masters  as to the methods of teaching and the books read at grammar schools abundance of information has been collected  we know what the use was in one very good school ipswich from 1528 in another in 1611 but as we do not possess any special information about stratford school mr greenwood opposes the admission of evidence from other academies  a man might think that however much the quality of the teaching varied in various free schools the nominal curriculum would be fairly uniform  as to the teacher a good endowment would be apt to attract a capable man  what was the endowment of stratford school  it was derived from the bequest of thomas jolyffe died 1482 a bequest of lands in stratford and dodwell and before the reformation the brethren of the guild were to find a priest fit and able in knowledge to teach grammar freely to all scholars coming to him taking nothing for their teaching      the founders liberal endowment made it possible to secure an income for the master by deed  under the reformation somersets commission found that the school master had 10 pounds yearly by patent the school was well conducted and was not confiscated 50a  baconians can compare the yearly 20 pounds the salary in 15706 which then went much further than it does now with the incomes of other masters of grammar schools and thereby find out if the head master was very cheap  mr elton who knew his subject intimately calls the provision liberal  the headmaster of westminster had 20 pounds and a house  as to the method of teaching it was colloquial questions were asked and answered in latin  this method according to dr rouse of perse school brings boys on much more rapidly than does our current fashion as may readily be imagined but experts vary in opinion the method i conceive should give a pupil a vocabulary  lillys latin grammar was universally used and was learned by rote as by george borrow in the last century  see lavengro for details conversation books sententiae pueriles were in use with easy books such as corderiuss colloquia and so on for boys were taught to speak latin the common language of the educated in europe  waifs of the armada spaniards wrecked on the irish coast met a savage who knew latin and thus could converse with him  the eclogues of mantuanus a latin poet of the renaissance the old mantuan of loves labours lost were used with erasmuss colloquia and says mr collins such books as ovids metamorphoses and other works of his the aeneid selected comedies of terence and plautus and portions of caesar sallust cicero and livy  prodigious exclaims mr greenwood 51a referring to what mr collins says will had read at school  but precocious latinity was not thought prodigious in an age when nothing but latin was taught to boysnot even cricket  nor is it to be supposed that every boy read in all of these authors still less read all of their works but these were the works of which portions were read  it is not prodigious  i myself according to my classmaster was a bad and careless little boy at thirteen incurably idle but i well remember reading in ovid and caesar and sallust while the rest of my time was devoted to the total neglect of the mathematics english as she was taught history and whatsoever else was expected from me shakespeares time was not thus frittered away latin was all he learned if he went to school and as he was on my theory a very clever imaginative kind of boy i can conceive that he was intensely interested in the stories told by ovid and in catilines conspiracy thrilling if you know your sallust and if his interest were once aroused he would make rapid progress  my own early hatred of greek was hissing and malignant but as soon as i opened homer all was changed  one was intensely interested  mr greenwood will not in the matter of books go beyond mr halliwellphillipps 52a lillys grammar and a few classical works chained to the desks of the free schools  mr collins himself gives but a few classical books of which portions were read  the chains were in all the free schools if mr halliwellphillipps is right  the chains if authentic do not count as objections  here it must be noted that mr greenwoods opinion of wills knowledge and attainments is not easily to be ascertained with precision  he sees of course that the pretension of the extreme baconianswill could not even write his nameis absurd  if he could not write he could not pass as the author  mr greenwood fears that the arguments of a most extreme baconian would drive many wandering sheep back to the stratfordian fold 52b  he has therefore to find a via media to present as the pseudo author a will who possessed neither books nor manuscripts when he made his testament a rustic bookless will speaking a patois who could none the less pass himself off as the author  so i think it highly probable says mr greenwood that he attended the grammar school at stratford for four or five years and that later in life after some years in london he was probably able to bumbast out a line and perhaps to pose as poetape who would be thought our chief 53a  again he had had but little schooling he had small latin and less greek but he was a good johannes factotum he could arrange a scene and when necessary bumbast out a blank verse 53b  but this is almost to abandon mr greenwoods case  will appears to me to be now perilously near acceptance as greenes shakescene who was a formidable rival to greenes three professional playwrights  and quite as near to bens poetape that would be thought our chief who began by remaking old plays then won some little wealth and credit on the scene who had his works printed for ben expects them to reach posterity and whom ben accused of plagiarism from himself and his contemporaries  but this shake scene this poetape is merely our will shakespeare as described by bitterly jealous and envious rivals  where are now the works of poetape if they are not the works of shakespeare which ben so nobly applauded later if they are not in the blank verse of greenes shakescene  shakespeares plays we call them  when was it necessary for the stratford rustic to bumbast out a blank verse  where are the blank verses which he bumbasted out for what purposes were they bumbasted  by 1592 shakescene was ambitious and thought his blank verse as good as the best that greenes friends including marlowe could write  he had plenty of time to practise before the date when as ben wrote he would be thought our chief  he would not cease to do that in which he conceived himself to excel to write for the stage  when once mr greenwood deems it highly probable that will had four or five years of education at a latin school will has as much of grounding in latin i think as would account for all the knowledge of the roman tongue which he displays  his amount of teaching at school would carry and tempt even a boy who was merely clever and loved to read romantic tales and comic plays into ovid and plautus english books being to him not very accessible  here i may speak from my own memories for though utterly idle where set school tasks were concerned i tried very early to worry the sense out of aristophanesbecause he was said to contain good reading  to this amount of taste and curiosity nowise unexampled in an ordinary clever boy add genius and i feel no difficulty as to wills learning such as at best it was  the stratfordian says mr greenwood will ingeminate genius  genius 55a  i do say genius and stand by it  the ordinary clever boy in the supposed circumstances could read and admire his ovid though shakespeare used cribs also the man of genius could write venus and adonis  had i to maintain the baconian hypothesis i would not weigh heavily on bookless wills rusticity and patois  accepting ben jonsons account of his excellent phantasy brave notions and gentle expressions wherein he flowed with that facility     accepting the tradition of his lively wit admitting that he had some latin and literature i would find in him a sufficiently plausible mask for that immense unknown with a strange taste for furbishing up older plays  i would merely deny to will his genius and hand that over to baconor bungay  believe me mr greenwood this is your easiest wayperhaps this is your waythe plot of the unscrupulous will and of your astute bungay might thus more conceivably escape detection from the pack of envious playwrights  according to all tradition says mr greenwood shakespeare was taken from school at the age of thirteen  those late longdescended traditions of shakespeares youth are of little value as evidence but if it pleases mr greenwood i will for the sake of argument accept the whole of them  assuredly i shall not arbitrarily choose among the traditions  all depends on the genealogical steps by which they reach us as far as these can be discovered 56a  according to the tattle of aubrey the antiquary publishing in 1680 an opinion concerning shaksperes education reached him  it came thus there had been an actor in shaksperes company one phillips who dying in 1605 left to shakspere the usual thirtyshilling piece of gold and the same to my servant christopher beeston christophers son william in 1640 became deputy to davenant in the management of the kings and queens young company and through beeston according to aubrey davenant learned through beeston aubrey learned that shakespeare understood latin pretty well for he had been in his younger days a schoolmaster in the country aubrey writes that old mr beeston whom mr dryden calls the chronicle of the stage died in 1682 56b  this is a fair example of the genealogy of the traditions  phillips a friend of shakspere dies in 1605 leaving a servant christopher beeston he too was a versifier whose son william dies in 1682 he is the chronicle of the stage  through him davenant gets the story through him aubrey gets the story that shakspere knew latin pretty well and had been a rural dominie  mr greenwood 57a devotes much space to disparaging aubrey and i do not think him a scientific authority moult sen faut but mr greenwood here says not a word as to the steps in the descent of the tradition  he frequently repeats himself thereby forcing me to more iteration than i like  he had already disparaged aubrey in note i to p 105 but there he approached so closely to historical method as to say that aubrey quotes beeston a seventeenthcentury actor as his authority  on p 209 he dismisses the anecdote which does not suit his book as a mere myth  he knows he knows which traditions are mythical and which possess a certain historical value  my own opinion is that shakspere did know latin pretty well and was no scholar as his contemporaries reckoned scholarship  he left school if tradition speak true by a year later than the age twelve when bacon went to cambridge  will a clever kind of lad on my theory left school at an age when some other clever lads became freshmen  why not  gilbert burnet of whom you may have heard as bishop of salisbury under william iii took his degree at the age of fourteen  taking shakspere as an extremely quick imaginative boy with nothing to learn but latin and by the readiest road the colloquial i conceive him to have discovered that in ovid especially were to be found the most wonderful and delightful stories and poetry which could not but please his green unknowing youth  in the years before he left stratford and after he left school 157787 i can easily suppose that he was not always butchering calves poaching and making love and that if he could get books in no other way this graceless fellow might be detected on a summer evening knitting his brows over the stories and jests of the chained ovid and plautus on his old schoolroom desk  moi qui parle i am no genius but stories romance and humour would certainly have dragged me back to the old desksif better might not be and why not shakspere  put yourself in his place if you have ever been a lad and if as a lad you liked to steal away into the world of romance into fairyland  if will wrote the plays he and indeed whoever wrote the plays was a marvel of genius  but i am not here claiming for him genius but merely stating my opinion that if he were fond of stories and romance had no english books of poetry and romance and had acquired as much power of reading latin as a lively curious boy could easily gain in four years of exclusively latin education he might continue his studies as he pleased yet be so far no prodigy  i am contemplating will in the conditions on which the baconians insist if they will indeed let us assume that for a few years he was at a latin school  i credit the graceless loon with the curiosity the prompt acquisitiveness the love of poetry and romance which the author of the plays must have possessed in youth  tradition says nothing of all that the baconian answers and he may now if he likes turn to my reply in the traditional shakespeare 59a meanwhile how can you expect old clerks and sextons a century after date in a place where literature was not of supreme interest to retain a tradition that will used to read sometimes if he did in circumstances of privacy  as far as i am able to judge had i been a boy at stratford school for four years had been taught nothing but latin and had little or no access to english books of poetry and romance i should have acquired about the same amount of latin as i suppose shakspere to have possessed  yet i could scarcely like him have made the second syllable in posthumus long  sir walter scott however was guilty of similar false quantities  he and shakspere were about equally scholarly  i suppose then that shaksperes small latin as jonson called it enabled him to read in the works of the roman clerks to read sufficient for his uses  as a fact he made use of english translations and also of latin texts  scholars like bacon do not use bad translations of easy latin authors  if bacon wanted plutarch he went to plutarch in greek not to an english translation of a french translation of a latin translation  some works of shakespeare the lucrece for example and the comedy of errors if he were not working over an earlier canvas from a more learned hand and other passages show knowledge of latin texts which in his day had not appeared in published translations or had not been translated at all as far as we know  in my opinion will had latin enough to puzzle out the sense of the latin never difficult for himself  he could also get a construe when in london or help in reading from a more academic acquaintance  or buy a construe at no high ransom from some poor scholar  no contemporary calls him scholarly the generation of men who were small boys when he died held him for no scholar  the current english literature of his day was saturated with every kind of classical information its readers even if latinless knew or might know a world of lore with which the modern man is seldom acquainted  the ignorant baconian marvels  the classically educated baconian who is not familiar with elizabethan literature is amazed  really there is nothing worthy of their wonder  does any contemporary literary allusion to shakespeare call him learned  he is sweet honeytongued mellifluous and so forth but i ask for any contemporary who flattered him with the compliment of learned  what ben jonson thought of his learning but bens standard was very high what milton and fuller boys of eight when he died thought of his learning we know  they thought him fancys child milton and with no claims to scholarship fuller with small latin and less greek jonson  they speak of shakespeare the author and actor not yet had any man divided the persons  elizabethan and jacobean scholarly poets were widely read in the classics  they were not usually however scholars in the same sense as our modern scholarly poets and men of letters such as mr swinburne among the dead and mr mackail and sir gilbert murrayif i may be pardoned for mentioning contemporary names  but elizabethan scholarly poets and milton never regarded shakespeare as learned perhaps few modern men of letters who are scholars differ from them the opinion of mr collins is to be discussed presently but even he thought shakespeares scholarship inexact as we shall see  i conceive that shakspere knew latin pretty well and on ben jonsons evidence he knew less greek  that he knew any greek is surprising  apparently he did to judge from bens words  my attitude must to the baconians seem frivolous vexatious and evasive  i cannot pretend to know what was shaksperes precise amount of proficiency in latin when he was writing the plays  that between his own knowledge and construes given to him he might easily get at the meaning of all the latin not yet translated which he certainly knew i believe  mr greenwood says the amount of reading which the lad shakspere must have done and assimilated during his brief sojourn at the free school is positively amazing 62a  but i have shown how an imaginative boy with little or no access to english poetry and romances might continue to read latin for human pleasure after he left school  as a professional writer in a london where latinists were as common as now they are rare in literary society he might read more and be helped in his reading  any clever man might do as much not to speak of a man of genius  and yet alas there is no record or tradition of all this prodigious industry      i am not speaking of prodigious industry and of thatat school  in a region so nonliterary as by his account was stratford mr greenwood ought not to expect traditions of wills early reading even if he studied much more deeply than i have supposed to exist from fifty to seventy years after will was dead in the memories of the sons and grandsons of country people who cared for none of these things  the thing is not reasonable 62b  let me take one example 62c of what mr e a sonnenschein is quoted as saying somewhere about shakespeares debt to senecas then untranslated paper de clementia 1 3 3 i 7 2 i 6 i  it inspires portias speech about mercy  here i give a version of the latin  clemency becometh of all men none more than the king or chief magistrate principem    no one can think of anything more becoming to a ruler than clemency    which will be confessed the fairer and more goodly in proportion as it is exhibited in the higher office    but if the placable and just gods punish not instantly with their thunderbolts the sins of the powerful how much more just it is that a man set over men should gently exercise his power what  holds not he the place nearest to the gods who bearing himself like the gods is kind and generous and uses his power for the better     think    what a lone desert and waste rome would be were nothing left and none save such as a severe judge would absolve  the last sentence is fitted with this parallel in portias speech         consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation   here at least protestant theology not seneca inspires portias eloquence  now take portia   the quality of mercy is not straind it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath  it is twice blessed it blesseth him that gives and him that takes   not much seneca so far   tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown his sceptre shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptred sway it is enthroned in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest gods when mercy seasons justice       there follows the passage about none of us seeing salvation already cited and theological in origin  whether shakespeare could or could not have written these reflections without having read senecas de clementia whether if he could not conceive the ideas out of his own head he might not hear senecas words translated in a sermon or in conversation or read them cited in an english book each reader must decide for himself  nor do i doubt that shakespeare could pick out what he wanted from the latin if he cast his eye over the essay of the tutor of nero  my view of shakespeares latinity is much like that of sir walter raleigh 64a  as far as i am aware it is the opinion usually held by people who approach the subject and who have had a classical education  an exception was the late mr churton collins whose ideas are discussed in the following chapter  in his youth and in the country will could do what hogg and burns did and hogg had no education at all he was selftaught even in writing  will could pick up traditional oral popular literature his plays says sir walter raleigh are extraordinarily rich in the floating debris of popular literaturescraps and tags and broken ends of songs and ballads and romances and proverbs  in this respect he is notable even among his contemporaries     edgar and iago petruchio and benedick sir toby and pistol the fool in lear and the gravedigger in hamlet even ophelia and desdemona are all alike singers of old songs     65a  he is rich in rural proverbs not recorded in bacons promus  shakespeare in the country like scott in liddesdale was making himself all the time  the baconian will exclaim that bacon was familiar with many now obsolete rural words  bacon too may have had a memory rich in all the tags of song ballad story and dicton  but so may shakespeare    chapter iv  mr collins on shakespeares learning    that shakspere whether scholar or not had a very wide and deep knowledge both of roman literature and still more of the whole field of the tragic literature of athens is a theory which mr greenwood seems to admire in that violent stratfordian mr churton collins 69a  i think that mr collins did not persuade classical scholars who have never given a thought to the baconian belief but who consider on their merits the questions  does shakespeare show wide classical knowledge  does he use his knowledge as a scholar would use it  my friend mr collins as i may have to say again was a very wide reader of poetry with a memory like macaulays  it was his native tendency to find coincidences in poetic passages which to some to me for example did not often seem coincidental and to explain coincidences by conscious or subconscious borrowing  one remarked in him these tendencies long before he wrote on the classical acquirements of shakespeare  while mr collins tended to account for similarities in the work of authors by borrowing my tendency was to explain them as undesigned coincidences  the question is of the widest range  some inquirers explain the often minute coincidences in myths popular tales proverbs and riddles found all over the world by diffusion from a single centre usually india  others like myself do not deny cases of transmission but in other cases see spontaneous and independent though coincident invention  i do not believe that the arunta of central australia borrowed from plutarch the central feature of the myth of isis and osiris  it is not on shakespeares use now and then of greek and latin models and sources but on coincidences detected by mr collins himself and not earlier remarked that he bases his belief in the saturation of shakespeares mind with roman and athenian literature consequently we can only do justice to mr collinss system if we compare example after example of his supposed instances of shakespeares borrowing  this is a long and irksome task and the only fair plan is for the reader to peruse mr collinss studies in shakespeare compare the greek and roman texts and weigh each example of supposed borrowing for himself  baconians must delight in this labour  i shall waive the question whether it were not possible for shakespeare to obtain a view of the manuscript translation of plays of plautus made by warner for his unlearned friends and so to use the menaechmi as the model of the comedy of errors  he does not borrow phrases from it as he does from norths plutarch  venus and adonis owes to ovid at most but ideas for three purple patches scattered in different parts of the metamorphoses  lucrece is based on the then untranslated fasti of ovid  i do not think shakespeare incapable of reading such easy latin for himself or too proud to ask help from a friend or buy it from some poor young university man in london  that is a simple and natural means by which he could help himself when in search of a subject for a play or poem and ought not to be overlooked  mr collins in his rapturous account of shakespeares wide and profound knowledge of the classics opens with the remark  nothing which shakespeare has left us warrants us in pronouncing with certainty that he read the greek classics in the original or even that he possessed enough greek to follow the latin versions of those classics in the greek text 71a  in that case how did shakespeares english become contaminated as mr collins says it did with greek idioms while he only knew the greek plays through latin translations  however this is to be answered mr collins proceeds to prove shakespeares close familiarity with latin and with greek dramatic literature by a method of which he knows the perilsit is always perilous to infer direct imitation from parallel passages which may be mere coincidences 72a  yet this method is what he practises throughout with what amount of success every reader must judge for himself  he thinks it surely not unlikely that poloniuss   neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend   may be a terse reminiscence of seven lines in plautus trinummus iv 3  why polonius is a coiner of commonplaces and if ever there were a wellknown reflection from experience it is this of the borrowers and lenders  next take this of plautus pseudolus i iv 710 but just as the poet when he has taken up his tablets seeks what exists nowhere among men and yet finds it and makes that like truth which is mere fiction  we are to take this as the possible germ of theseuss theory of the origin of the belief in fairies   and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown the poets pen turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name   the reasoning is odd imagination bodies forth forms and the poets pen turns them to shapes  but to suppose that shakespeare here borrowed from plautus appears highly superfluous  these are samples of mr collinss methods throughout  of terence there were translationsfirst in part later in 1598 of the whole  of seneca there was an english version 1581  mr collins labours to show that one passage almost certainly implies shakespeares use of the latin but it was used by an inexact scholara terribly inexact scholar if he thought that alienus what belongs to another meant slippery  most of the passages are from plays titus andronicus and henry vi i ii iii which mr greenwood denies usually to his author the great unknown  throughout these early plays mr collins takes shakespeares to resemble senecas latin style  shakespeare then took up greek tragedy in later life after the early period when he dealt with seneca  here is a sample of borrowing from horace persicos odi puer apparatus odes i xxxviii i  mr collins quotes lear iii vi 85 thus you will say they are persian attire  really lear in his wild way says to edgar i do not like the fashion of your garments  you will say they are persian but let them be changed  mr collins changes this into you will say they are persian attire a phrase which could only have occurred to a classical scholar  the phrase is not in shakespeare and lears wandering mind might as easily select persian as any other absurdity  so it is throughout  two great poets write on the fear of death on the cries of newborn children on dissolution and recombination in nature on old age they have ideas in common obvious ideas glorified by poetryand shakespeare we are told is borrowing from lucretius or juvenal while the critic leaves his reader to find out and study the latin passages which he does not quote  so arbitrary is taste in these matters that mr collins like mr grant white but independently finds shakespeare putting a thought from the alcibiades i of plato into the mouth of achilles in troilus and cressida while mr j m robertson suggests that the borrowing is from senecawhere mr collins does not find the smallest parallel mr collins is certainly right the author of troilus makes ulysses quote plato as the author of a remark and makes achilles take up the quotation which ulysses goes on to criticise  thus in this play not only aristotle as hector says but plato are taken to have lived before the trojan war and to have been read by the achaeans  there were latin translations of plato the alcibiades i was published apart from ficinus version in 1560 with the subtitle concerning the nature of man  who had read itshakespeare or one of the two authors dekker and chettle of another troilus and cressida now lost or bacon or mr greenwoods unknown  which of these platonists chose to say that plato and aristotle lived long before homer  which of them followed the ionic and mediaeval anti achaean view of homers heroes as given in the troy books of the middle ages and yet knew iliad book vii and admired odysseus whom the ionian tradition abhors  troilus and cressida is indeed a mystery but somebody concerned in it had read ficinus version of the alcibiades 75a and yet made the monstrous anachronism of dating aristotle and plato before the trojan war  that was his fun as charles lamb said in another connection  mr collins it is plain goes much further than the small latin with which his age like myself credited shakespeare  he could read latin mr collins thinks as easily as an educated briton reads frenchthat is as easily as he reads english  still further shakespeare through latin translations was so saturated with the greek drama that the characteristics which differentiate his work from the work of his contemporaries and recall in essentials the work of the greek dramatists are actually attributable to these dramatists  ben jonson and all the more or less welltaught university wits as far as i remember like greene marlowe and lyly do not show much acquaintance with euripides aeschylus sophocles and do not often remind us of these masters  shakespeare does remind us of themthe only question is do the resemblances arise from his possession of a genius akin to that of greece or was his memory so stored with all the treasures of their art that the waters of helicon kept bubbling up through the wells of avon  but does mr collins prove what as he admits cannot be demonstrated that shakespeare was familiar with the attic tragedians  he begins by saying that he will not bottom his case on the ground of parallels in sentiment and reflection which as they express commonplaces are likely to be fortuitous coincidences three pages of such parallels all from sophocles therefore follow curiously close similarities of expression are also barred  four pages of examples therefore follow from sophocles and aeschylus plays and fragments euripides and homer too once  again identities of sentiment under similar circumstances are not to be cited two pages are cited and similarities however striking they may be in metaphorical expression cannot safely be used several pages of them follow  finally mr collins chooses a single play the aias of sophocles and tests shakespeare by that unluckily in part from titus andronicus which mr greenwood regards usually as non shakespearean or not by his unknown great author  troilus and cressida whatever part shakespeare may have had in it does suggest to me that the author or authors knew of homer no more than the few books of the iliad first translated by chapman and published in 1598  but he or they did know the aias of sophocles according to mr collins  so did the author of romeo and juliet  now all these sorts of parallels between shakespeare and the greeks are mr collins tells us not to count as proofs that shakespeare knew the greek tragedians  we have obviously to be on our guard 77a against three kinds of such parallels which may be mere coincidences 77b fortuitous coincidences  but these coincidences against which we must be on our guard fill sixteen pages pp 46 63  these pages must necessarily produce a considerable effect in the way of persuading the reader that shakespeare knew the greek tragedians as intimately as mr collins did  mr greenwood is obliged to leave these parallels to readers of mr collinss essay indeed what more can we do  who would read through a criticism of each instance  two or three may be given  the queen in hamlet reminds that prince grieving for his fathers death that all that live must die   that loss is common to the race and common is the commonplace  the greek chorus offers the commonplace to electraand here is a parallel  again two greeks agree with shakespeare that anxious expectation of evil is worse than actual experience thereof  greece agrees with shakespeare that illgotten gains do not thrive or that it is not lucky to be a corby messenger of bad news or that all goes ill when a man acts against his better nature or that we suffer most from the harm which we bring on ourselves or that there is strength in a righteous cause or that blood calls for blood an idea common to semites greeks and english readers of the bible or that having lost a very good man you will not soon see his like againand so on as long as you please  of such wisdom are proverbs made and savages and europeans have many parallel proverbs vestigia nulla retrorsum is as well known to bushmen as to latinists manifestly nothing in this kind proves or even suggests that shakespeare was saturated in greek tragedy  but page on page of such facts as that both shakespeare and sophocles talk one of the belly pinched wolf the other of the emptybellied wolf are apt to impress the readerand verily both shakespeare and aeschylus talk of the heart dancing for joy  mr collins repeats that such things are no proof but he keeps on piling them up  it was a theory of shakespeares time that the apparent ghost of a dead man might be an impersonation of him by the devil  hamlet knows this    the spirit that i have seen may be the devil   orestes electra euripides asks whether it may not be an avenging daemon alastor in the shape of a god that bids him avenge his father  is shakespeare borrowing from euripides or from a sermon or any contemporary work on ghosts such as that of lavater  a girl dies or is sacrificed before her marriage and characters in romeo and juliet and in euripides both say that death is her bridegroom  anyone might say that anywhere as in the greek anthology    for death not for love hast thou loosened thy zone   one needs the space of a book wherein to consider such parallels but confessedly though a parade is made of them they do not prove that shakespeare constantly read greek tragedies in latin translations  to let the truth out the resemblances are mainly found in such commonplaces  as when both aias and antony address the sun of their latest day in life or when john of gaunt and aias both pun on their own names  the situations in hamlet and the choephorae and electra are so close that resemblances in some passages must and do occur and mr collins does not comment specially upon the closest resemblance of all  the english case is here the murder of duncan the greek is the murder of agamemnon  now it would be easy for me to bring forward many close parallels between homer and the old irish epic story of cuchulainn between homer and beowulf and the njals saga yet norsemen and the early irish were not students of homer  the parallel passages in homer on one side and the old irish tain bo cualgne and the anglosaxon epics are so numerous and close that the theory of borrowing from homer has actually occurred to a distinguished greek scholar  but no student of irish and anglosaxon heroic poetry has been found i think to suggest that early irish and anglosaxon court minstrels knew greek  the curious may consult mr munro chadwicks the heroic age 1912 especially chapter xv the common characteristics of teutonic and greek heroic poetry and to what mr chadwick says much might be added  but to be short mr collinss case can only be judged by readers of his most interesting studies in shakespeare  to me hamlets soliloquy on death resembles a fragment from the phoenix of euripides no more closely than two sets of reflections by great poets on the text that of death we know nothing are bound to dothough shakespeares are infinitely the richer  for shakespeares reflections on death save where christians die in a christian spirit are as agnostic as those of the postaeschylean greek and early anglosaxon poets  in many respects as mr collins proves shakespeares highest and deepest musings are greek in tone  but of all english poets he who came nearest to greece in his art was keats who of greek knew nothing  in the same way a peculiar vein of anglosaxon thought in relation to destiny and death is purely homeric though necessarily unborrowed nor were a native fijian poets lines on old age sine amore jocisque borrowed from mimnermus  there is such a thing as congruity of genius  mr collins states the hypothesisnot his ownthat by a certain natural affinity shakespeare caught also the accent and tone as well as some of the most striking characteristics of greek tragedy  though far from accepting most of mr collinss long array of greek parallels i do hold that by natural affinity by congruity of genius shakespeare approached and resembled the great athenians  one thing seems certain to me  if shakspere read and borrowed from greek poetry he knew it as well except homer as mr collins knew it and remembered what he knew with mr collinss extraordinary tenacity of memory  now if shakespeare did all that he was not the actor  the author on mr collinss showing must have been a very sedulous and diligent student of greek poetry above all of the drama down to its fragments  the baconians assuredly ought to try to prove from bacons works that he was such a student  mr collins a violent stratfordian overproved his case  if his proofs be accepted shakspere the actor knew the greek tragedians as well as did mr swinburne  if the author of the plays were so learned the actor was not the author in my opinionhe was in the opinion of mr collins  if shakespeares spirit and those of sophocles and aeschylus meet it is because they move on the same heights and thence survey with the poets sad lucidity the same pageant of mens miseries  but how dissimilar in expression shakespeare can be how luxuriant and apart from the austerity of greece we observe in one of mr collinss parallels  polynices in the phoenissae of euripides 504506 exclaims   to the stars risings and the suns id go and dive neath earthif i could do this thing  possess heavens highest boon of sovereignty   then compare hotspur   by heaven methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honour from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathomline could never touch the ground and pluck up drowned honour by the locks so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival all her dignities   what a hurrying crowd of pictures rush through hotspurs mind  is shakespeare thinking of the phoenissae or is he speaking only on the promptings of his genius    chapter v  shakespeare genius and society    a phrase has been used to explain the greek element in shakespeares work namely congruity of genius which is apt to be resented by baconians  perhaps they have a right to resent it for genius is hard to define and genius is invoked by some wild wits to explain feats of shakespeares which to baconians appear miracles  a miracle also is notoriously hard to define but we may take it under all reserves to stand for the occurrence of an event or the performance of an action which to the speaker who applies the word miracle seems impossible  the speaker therefore says the event is impossible miracles do not happen  therefore the reported event never occurred  the alleged performance the writing of the plays by the actor was impossible was a miracle therefore was done by some person or persons other than the actor  this idea of the impossibility of the players authorship is the foundation of the baconian edifice  i have to the best of my ability tried to describe mr greenwoods view of the young provincial from warwickshire will shakspere  if will were what mr greenwood thinks he was then wills authorship of the plays seems to me humanly speaking impossible  but then mr greenwood appeared to omit from his calculations the circumstance that will may have been not merely a sharp boy but a boy of great parts and not without a love of stories and poetry  a passion which in a bookless region could only be gratified through folk song folktale and such easy latin as he might take the trouble to read  if we add to these very unusual but not wholly impossible tastes and abilities that will may have been a lad of genius there is no more miracle in his case than in other supreme examples of genius  but genius cannot work miracles cannot do what is impossible  do what is impossible to whom  to the critics the men of common sense  alas all this way of talking about miracles and the impossible and genius is quite vague and popular  what do we mean by genius  the latin term originally designates not a mans everyday intellect but a spirit from without which inspires him like the daemon or in latin genius of socrates or the lutin which rode the pen of moliere  genius is claimed for shakespeare in an inscription on his stratford monument erected at latest some six years after his death  following this path of thought we come to inspiration  the notion of it as familiar to australian savages as to any modern minds is that to the poet what he produces is given by some power greater than himself by the boilyas spirits or pundjel the father of all  this palaeolithic psychology of course is now quite discredited yet the term genius is still perhaps superstitiously applied to the rare persons whose intellectual faculties lightly outrun those of ordinary mortals and who do marvels with means apparently inadequate  in recent times some philosophers like mr f w h myers putin place of the muses or the boilyas or the geniuswhat they call the subliminal self something far more deeply interfused than the everyday intellect  this subconscious self capable of far more than the conscious intelligence is genius  on the other side genius may fairly be regarded as faculty only higher in degree and not at all different in kind from the everyday intellect which for example pens this page  thus as soon as we begin to speak of genius we are involved in speculations psychological psychical physical and metaphysical in difficulties of all sorts not at present to be solved either by physiological science or experimental psychology or by psychical research or by the study of heredity  when i speak of the genius of shakespeare of jeanne darc of bacon even of wellington i possibly have a meaning which is not in all respects the meaning of mr greenwood when he uses the term genius so we are apt to misunderstand each other  yet we all glibly use the term genius without definition and without discussion  at once too in this quest we jostle against that fool of a word as napoleon said impossible  at once on either side we assume that we know what is possible and what is impossibleand so pretend to omniscience  thus some stratfordians or defenders of the actors authorship profess to knowfrom all the signed work of bacon and from all that has reached us about bacons occupations and preoccupations from 1590 to 1605that the theory of bacons authorship of the plays is impossible  i however do not profess this omniscience  on the other side the baconian arguing from all that he knows or thinks he knows or can imagine of the actors education conditions of life and opportunities argues that the authorship of the actor is impossible  both sides assume to be omniscient but we incontestably know much more about bacon in his works his aims his inclinations and in his life than we know about the actor while about the potentialities of genius we knowvery little  thus with all bacons occupations and preoccupations he had the baconians will allow genius  by the miracle of genius he may have found time and developed inclination to begin by furbishing up older plays for a company of actors  he did it extremely well but what a quaint taste for a courtier and scholar  the eccentricities of genius may account for his choice of a nom de plume which if he desired concealment was the last that was likely to serve his turn he may also have divined all the doll tearsheets and mrs quicklys and pistols whom conceivably he did not much frequent  i am not one of those who deny that bacon might have written hamlet if he had the mind as charles lamb said of wordsworth  not at all i am the last to limit the potentialities of genius  but suppose merely for the sake of argument that will shakspere too had genius in that amazing degree which in henry v the bishop of ely and the archbishop of canterbury describe and discuss in the case of the young king  in this passage we perceive that the poet had brooded over and been puzzled by the miracle he uses the word of genius  says canterbury speaking of the princes wild youth   never was such a sudden scholar made   one baconian objection to shakespeares authorship is that during his early years in london say 158792 he was such a sudden scholar made in various things  the young kings      addiction was to courses vain his companies unletterd rude and shallow   precisely like shakespeares courses and companions at stratford   had never noted in him any study   stratford tradition a century after shakespeare left the town did not remember any study in him none had been noted nor could have been remembered  to return to henry he shines in divinity knowledge of commonwealth affairs   you would say it hath been all in all his study   he is as intimate with the art of war to him gordian knots of policy are familiar as his garter  he must have   the art and practic part of life   as mistress to this theorie   which is a wonder how his grace should glean it   as his youth was riotous and was lived in all mens gaze   and never noted in him any study any retirement any sequestration from open haunts and popularity   the bishop of ely can only suggest that henrys study or contemplation   grew like the summer grass fastest by night unseen   and canterbury says   it must be so for miracles are ceased   and thus the miracle of genius baffles the poet for henrys had been noisy nights notoriously noisy  now as we shall later show bacons rapid production of the plays considering his other contemporary activities and varied but always absorbing interests was as much a miracle as the sudden blossoming of henrys knowledge and accomplishments for all bacons known exertions and occupations and his deepest and most absorbing interest were remote from the art of tragedy and comedy  if we are to admit the marvel of genius in bacon of whose life and pursuits we know much by parity of reasoning we may grant that the actor of whom we know much less may have had genius  had powers and could use opportunities in a way for which baconians make no allowance  we now turn to mr greenwoods chapter shakespeare and genius it opens with the accustomed list of poor wills disqualifications a boy born of illiterate parents but we need not rehearse the list 91a  he comes to town date unknown a needy adventurer in 1593 appeared the poem venus and adonis authors name being printed as w shakespeare  then comes lucrece 1594  in 1598 loves labours lost printed as corrected and augmented by w shakespere  and so on with all the rest  criticism of the learning and splendour of the two poems follows  to loves labours lost and the amusing things written about it by baconians i return and to shakespeares impossible knowledge of courtly society his polish and urbanity his familiar acquaintance with contemporary french politics foreign proverbs and the gossip of the court of elizabeth  these points are made by his honour judge webb  all this lore to shakespeare is impossiblehe could not read say some baconians or had no latin or had next to none on these points i have said my say  the omniscient baconians know that all the early works ascribed to the actor were impossible to a man of say thirty who was no more and knew no more than they know that the actor was and knew and as for genius it cannot work miracles  genius bestows upon no one a knowledge of facts shakespeare however favoured by nature could impart only what he had learned  precisely but genius as i understand it and even cleverness has a way of acquiring knowledge of facts where the ordinary dull intelligent man gains none  keen interest keen curiosity swift observation even the power of tearing out the things essential from a book the gift of rapid reading the faculty of being alive to the fingertipsthese with a tenacious memory may enable a small boy to know more facts of many sorts than his elders and betters and all the neighbours  they are puzzled if they make the discovery of his knowledge  scott was such a small boy whether we think him a man of genius or not  shakspere even the actor was perhaps a man of genius and possessed this power of rapid acquisition and vivid retention of all manner of experience and information  to what i suppose to have been his opportunities in london i shall return meanwhile let the doubter take up any popular english books of shakespeares day  he will find them replete with much knowledge wholly new to himwhich he will also find in shakespeare  a good example is this  judge webb proclaimed that in points of scientific lore the lore of that age shakespeare and bacon were much on a level  professor tyrrell in a newspaper said that the facts staggered him as a stratfordian  a friend told me that he too was equally moved  i replied that these pseudoscientific facts had long been commonplaces  pliny was a rich source of them professor dowden took the matter up with full knowledge 93a and reconverted mr tyrrell who wrote  i am not versed in the literature of the shakespearian era and i assumed that the baconians who put forward the parallelisms had satisfied themselves that the coincidences were peculiar to the writings of the philosopher and the poet  professor dowden has proved that this is not so 93b  were i to enter seriously on this point of genius i should begin by requesting my adversaries to read mr f w h myerss papers on the mechanism of genius in his human personality and to consider the humble problem of calculating boys which is touched on also by cardinal newman  how do they at the age of innocence arrive at their amazing results  how did the child pascal ignorant of euclid work out the euclidean propositions of bars and rounds as he called lines and circles  science has no solution  transport the problem into the region of poetry and knowledge of human nature take will in place of pascal and gauss and in manners and matter of war jeanne darcand science i fancy is much to seek for a reply  mr greenwood considers among others the case of robert burns  the parallel is very interesting and does not i think turn so much to mr greenwoods advantage as he supposes  the genius of burns of course is far indeed below the level of that of the author of the shakespearean plays  but that author and burns have this in common with each other and obviously with homer that their work arises from a basis of older materials already manipulated by earlier artists  burns almost always has a keynote already touched as confessedly in the poems of his predecessor fergusson of hamilton of gilbertfield in songs popular or artistic and so forth  he alchemised his materials as mr greenwood says of his author of the plays turned dross into gold brick into marble  notoriously much shakespearean work is of the same nature  the education of burns he owed to his peasant father to his parish school in many such schools he might have acquired latin and greek in fact he did not to a tutor who read with him some english and french and he knew a modernised version of blind harrys wallace lockes essay the spectator novels of the day and vernacular scots poets of his century with a world of old scots songs  these things and such as these were burnss given literary materials  he used them in the only way open to him in poems written for a rural audience and published for an edinburgh public  no classical no theatrical materials were given or if he read the old drama he could not in his rural conditions and in a scotland where the theatre was in a very small way venture on producing plays for which there was no demand while he had no knowledge of the stage burns found and filled the only channels open to him in a printed book and in music books for which he transmuted old songs  the bookish materials offered to will in london were crammed with reminiscences from the classics were mainly romantic and theatrical and from his profession of actor by far the best channel open to him was the theatre  badly as it paid the outside author there was nothing that paid better  venus and adonis brought more praise than pudding if one may venture a guess  with the freedom of the theatre will could soar to all heights and plumb all depths  no such opportunity had burns even if he could have used it and owing to a variety of causes his spirit soon ceased to soar high or wing wide  i take shakespeare in london at least to have read the current elizabethan light literatureeuphues lylys court comedies novels full of the classics and of social life spenser sidneyhis defence of poesy and arcadia 1590with scores of tales translated from the italian french and spanish all full of foreign society and discourses of knights and ladies  he saw the plays of the day perhaps as one of the groundlings  he often beheld society from without when acting before the queen and at great houses  he had thus if i am right sufficient examples of style and manner and knowledge of how the great were supposed in books to comport and conduct themselves  the books were cheap and could be borrowed and turned over at the booksellers stalls 96a  the elizabethan style was omnipresent  suppose that shakespeare was a clever man a lover of reading a rapid reader with an excellent memory easily influenced like burns by what he read and i really think that my conjectures are not too audacious  not only the man in the street but the reading public so loved by coleridge have not the beginning of a guess as to the way in which a quick man reads  watch them poring for hours over a newspaper  let me quote what sir walter raleigh says  97a shakespeare was one of those swift and masterly readers who know what they want of a book they scorn nothing that is dressed in print but turn over the pages with a quick discernment of all that brings them new information or jumps with their thought or tickles their fancy  such a reader will have done with a volume in a few minutes yet what he has taken from it he keeps for years  he is a live man and is sometimes judged by slower wits to be a learned man  i am taking shakespeare to have been a reader of this kind as was dr johnson as are not a few men who have no pretensions to genius the accomplishment is only a marvel towell i need not be particular about the kind of person to whom it is a marvel  here in fairness the reader should be asked to consider an eloquent passage of comparison between the knowledge of burns and of will quoted by mr greenwood 97b from mr morgan 97c  genius says mr morgan did not guide burnss untaught pen to write of troy or egypt of athens and cyprus  no that was not burnss lay nor would he have found a public had he emulated the contemporary st andrews professor mr wilkie who wrote the epigoniad and sang of cadmeian thebes to the delight of david hume his friend  the public of 178090 did not want new epics of heroic greece from mossgiel nor was the literature accessible to burns full of the mediaeval legends of troy and athens  but the popular literature accessible to will was full of the mediaeval legends of thebes troy and athens and of these not of homer will made his market  egypt he knew only in the new english version of plutarchs lives of homer he or the author of troilus and cressida used only iliad vii in chapmans new translation 1598  for the rest he had lydgate perhaps and certainly caxtons destruction of troy still reprinted as a popular book as late as 1713  will did not as mr morgan says reproduce the very counterfeit civilisations and manners of nations born and buried and passed into history a thousand years before he had been begotten     he bestowed the manners of mediaeval chivalrous romance on his trojans and greeks  he accommodated prehistoric athens with a duke  he gave scotland cannon three hundred years too early and made cleopatra play at billiards look at his notion of the very manners of early postroman britain in cymbeline and king lear  concerning the anomalous status of a king of scotland under one of its primitive kings the author of macbeth knew no more than what he read in holinshed of the actual truth concerning duncan that old prince was in fact a young man slain in a blacksmiths bothy and of the whole affair the author knew nothing but a tissue of sophisticated legends  the author of the plays had no knowledge as mr morgan inexplicably declares that he had of matters of curious and occult research for antiquaries or dilettanti to dig out of old romances or treaties or statutes rather than for historians to treat of or schools to teach  mon dieu do historians not treat of matters of curious research and of statutes and of treaties  as for old romances they were current and popular  the occult sources of king lear are a popular tale attached to legendary history and a story in sidneys arcadia will whom mr morgan describes as a letterless peasant lad or the author whoever he was is not invested with all the love sic v1 lore which the ages behind him had shut up in clasped books and buried and forgotten  our friends style has flowery components mr greenwood adds to this deliciously eloquent passage from his american author and yet shakespeare who did all this et caetera  but shakespeare did not do all this  we know the sources of the plays well enough  novels in one of which delphos is the insular seat of an oracle of apollo holinshed with his contaminated legends norths plutarch done out of the french older plays and the rest of it  shakespeare does not go to tighernach and the hennskringla for macbeth or for hamlet to the saga which is the source of saxo or for his english chronicle plays to the state papers  shakespeare did not like william of deloraine dig up clasped books buried and forgotten  there is no original research the author uses the romances novels ballads and popular books of uncritical history which were current in his day mr greenwood knows that mr morgan perhaps knew it but forgot what he knew hurried away by the muse of eloquence  and the common baconian may believe mr morgan  but mr greenwood asks what was the poetic output in burnss case 100a  it was what we know and that was what suited his age and his circumstances  it was lyric idyll song and satire it was not drama for to the stage he had no access he who passed but one winter in edinburgh where the theatre was not the centre of literature  shakespeare came with genius and with such materials as i have suggested to an entirely different market the elizabethan theatre i have tried to show how easily his mind might be steeped in the all pervading classicism and foreign romance of the period with the wide sketchy general information the commonly known fragments from the great banquet of the classicswith such history wholly uncritical as holinshed and stow and other such english chroniclers could copiously provide with the courtly manners mirrored in scores of romances and court plays and in the current popular morte darthur and destruction of troy  i can agree with mr greenwood when he says that genius is a potentiality and whether it will ever become an actuality and what it will produce depends upon the moral qualities with which it is associated and the opportunities that are open to itin a word on the circumstances of its environment 101a  of course by moral qualities a character without spot or stain is not intended  we may take that for granted  otherwise i agree and think that shakespeare of stratford had genius and that what it produced was in accordance with the opportunities open to it and with the circumstances of its environment  without the environment no jeanne darcwithout the environment no shakespeare  to come to his own shakespeare needed the environment of the light people the crowd of wits living from hand to mouth by literature like greene and nash and he needed that pellmell of the productions of their pens  the novels the poems the pamphlets and above all the plays and the wine the wild talk the wit the travellers tales the seamens company the vision of the court the gallants the beauties and he needed the people of whom he does not speak in the terms of such a philanthropist as bacon professedly was  not as an aristocrat a courtier but as a simple literary man william does not like though he thoroughly understands the mob  like alceste in le misanthrope of poquelin he might say   lami du genre humain nest point du tout mon fait   in london not in stratford he could and did find his mob  this reminds one to ask how did the courthaunting or the study haunting or lawcourt and chamber of criminal examinationrooms haunting bacon make acquaintance with mrs quickly and doll tearsheet and drawers and carters and bardolph and pistol and copper captains and all shakespeares crowd of people hanging loose on the town  it is much easier to discover how shakespeare found the tone and manners of courtly society which by the way are purely poetic and conventional than to find out where bacon got his immense knowledge of what is called low life  if you reply as regards bacon his genius divined the costards and audreys the doll tearsheets and tapsters and drawers and bardolphs and carters from a hint or two a glance i answer that will had much better sources for them in his own experience of life and had conventional poetic sources for his courtiersof whom in the quick he saw quite as much as moliere did of his marquis  but one baconian has found out a more excellent way of accounting for bacons pictures of rude rustic life and he is backed by lord penzance that aged judge  the way is short  these pictures of rural life and character were interpolated into the plays of bacon by his collaborator william shakspere actor who prepared the plays for the stage  this brilliant suggestion is borrowed from mr appleton morgan 103a  thus have these two baconians perceived that it is difficult to see how bacon obtained his knowledge of certain worlds and aspects of character which he could scarcely draw from the life  i am willing to ascribe miracles to the genius of bacon but the baconians cited give the honour to the actor who prepared the plays for the stage  take it as you please my baconian friends who do not believe as i believe in genius  shakespeare and moliere did not live in society though both rubbed shoulders with it or looked at it over the invisible barrier between the actor and the great people in whose houses or palaces he takes the part of entertainer  the rest they divined by genius  bacon did not perhaps study the society of carters drawers mrs quickly and doll tearsheet of copper captains and their boys not at court not in the study did he meet them  how then did he create his multitude of very lowlived persons  rustics and rural constables he may have lovingly studied at gorhambury but for his collection of other very loose fish bacon must have kept queer company  so you have to admit geniusthe miracle of genius in your baconto an even greater extent than i need it in the case of my will or like lord penzance you may suggest that will collaborated with bacon  try to imagine that will was a born poet like burns but with a very different genius education and environment  burns could easily get at the press and be published  that was impossible for shakespeare at stratford if he had written any lyrics  suppose him to be a poet an observer a wit a humorist  tradition at stratford says something about the humorist and tradition in similar circumstances would have remembered no more of burns after the lapse of seventy years  imagine will then to have the nature of a poet that much i am obliged to assume and for nine or ten years after leaving school at thirteen to hang about stratford observing nature and man flowers and foibles with thoughts incommunicable to sturley and quiney  some sorts of parkpalings as he was married at eighteen he could not break so lightly as burns didsome outlying deer he could not so readily shoot at perhaps but i am not surprised if he assailed other deer and was in troubles many  unlike burns he had a keen eye for the main chance  everything was going to ruin with his father schoolmastering if he tried it i merely follow tradition was not satisfactory  his opinion of dominies if he wrote the plays was identical with that frequently expressed in fiction and privately by sir walter scott  something must be done  perhaps the straitest baconian will not deny that companies of players visited stratford or even that he may have seen and talked with them and been attracted  he was a practical man and he made for london and by tradition we first find him heading straight for the theatre holding horses at the door and organising a small brigade of boys as his deputies  according to ben jonson he shone in conversation he was good company despite his rustic accent that terrible bar  the actors find that out he is admitted within the house as a servitora callboy if you like an apprentice if you please  by 1592 when greene wrote his groatsworth shakescene thinks he can bombast out a blank verse with the best he is an actor he is also an author or a furbisher of older plays and as a member of the company is a rival to be dreaded by greenes three author friends  whoever they were they were professional university playwrights the critics think that marlowe so near his death was one of them  will supposing him to come upon the town in 1587 has now had say five years of such opportunities as were open to a man connected with the stage  among these in that age we may perhaps reckon a good deal of very mixed societywriting men bookish young blades young blades who haunt the theatre and sit on the stage as was the custom of the gallants  what follows  chaff follows a kind of intimacy a supper perhaps after the play if an actor seems to be good company  this is quite natural the most modish young gallants are not so very dainty as to stand aloof from any amusing company  they found it among prize fighters when byron was young and extremely conscious of the fact that he was a lord  moreover there were no women on the stage to distract the attention of the gallants  the players says asinius lupus in jonsons poetaster corrupt young gentry very much i know it  i take the quotation from mr greenwood 106a  they could not corrupt the young gentry if they were not pretty intimate with them from bens poetaster which bristles with envy of the players mr greenwood also quotes a railing address by a copper captain to histrio a poor actor there are some of you players honest gentlemanlike scoundrels and suspected to ha some wit as well as your poets both at drinking and breaking of jests and are companions for gallants  a man may skelder ye now and then of half a dozen shillings or so 107a  we think of nigel olifaunt in the fortunes of nigel but better gallants might choose to have some acquaintance with shakespeare  to suppose that young men of position would not form a playhouse acquaintanceship with an amusing and interesting actor seems to me to show misunderstanding of human nature  the players were when unprotected by men of rank vagabonds  the citizens of london mainly puritans hated them mortally but the young gallants were not puritans  the court patronised the actors who performed masques in palaces and great houses  the wealth and splendid attire of the actors their acquisition of land and of coats of arms infuriated the sweated playwrights  envy of the actors appears in the cambridge parnassus plays of c 16002  in the mouth of will kempe who acted dogberry in shakespeares company and was in favour says heywood with queen elizabeth the cambridge authors put this brag for londoners who of more report than dick burbage and will kempe he is not counted a gentleman that knows not dick burbage and will kempe  it is not my opinion that shakespeare was as ben jonson came to be as much in society as is possible for a mere literary man  i do not in fancy see him wooing a maid of honour  he was a mans man a peer might be interested in him as easily as in a jockey a fencer a tennisplayer a musician que scaisje southampton discovering his qualities may have been more interested interested in a better way  in such circumstances which are certainly in accordance with human nature i suppose the actor to have been noticed by the young handsome popular earl of southampton who found him interesting and interested himself in the poet  there followed the dedication to the earl of venus and adonis a poem likely to please any young amorist 1693  mr greenwood cries out at the audacity of a player dedicating to an earl without even saying that he has asked leave to dedicate  the mere fact that the dedication was accepted and followed by that of lucrece proves that the earl did not share the surprise of mr greenwood  he conceivably will argue that the earl knew the real concealed author and the secret of the pseudonym  but of the hypothesis of such a choice of a pseudonym enough has been said whatever happened whatever the earl knew if it were discreditable to be dedicated to by an actor southampton was discredited for we are to prove that all in the world of letters and theatre who have left any notice of shakespeare identified the actor with the poet  this appears to me to be the natural way of looking at the affair but says mr greenwood of this intimacy or patronage of southampton not a scrap of evidence exists 109a  where would mr greenwood expect to find a scrap of evidence  in literary anecdote of contemporary literary anecdote about shakespeare as about beaumont dekker chapman heywood and fletcher there is none or next to none  there is the tradition that southampton gave the poet 1000 pounds towards a purchase to which he had a mind  rowe seems to have got this from davenantthrough betterton  in what documents would the critic expect to find a scrap of evidence perhaps in southamptons book of his expenditure and that does not exist  it is in the accounts of prince charlie that i find him poor as he was giving money to jean jacques rousseau  as to the chances of an actors knowing smart people heywood who knew all that world tells us 109b that tarleton in his time was gracious with the queen his sovereign queen elizabeth  will kempe was in the favour of his sovereign  they had advantages they were not literary men but low comedians i am not pretending that though his      flights upon the banks of thames so did take eliza and our james   will shakspere was gracious with the queen  we may compare the dedication of the folio of 1623 here two players address the earls of pembroke and montgomery  they have the audacity to say nothing about having asked and received permission to dedicate  they say that the earls have prosecuted both the plays and their authour living while in life with much favour  they have collected and published the works of the dead    only to keep alive the memory of so worthy a friend and fellow associate as was our shakespeare your servant shakespeare  nothing can possibly be more explicit both as to the actors authorship of the plays and as to the favour in which the two earls held him  mr greenwood 110a supposes that jonson wrote the preface which contains an allusion to a wellknown ode of horace and to a phrase of pliny  be that as it may the preface signed by the two players speaks to pembroke and montgomery  to them it cannot lie they know whether they patronised the actor or not whether they believed or not that the plays were their servants  how is mr greenwood to overcome this certain testimony of the actors to the identity of their late fellow the player with the author and to the patronage which the earls bestowed on him and his compositions mr greenwood says nothing except that we may reasonably suppose ben to have written the dedication which the players signed 111a  whether or not the two earls had a personal knowledge of shakespeare the dedication does not say in so many words  they had seen his plays and had favoured both him and them with so much favour had used indulgence to the author  that is not nearly explicit enough for the precise baconians  but the earls knew whether what was said were true or false  i am not sure whether the baconians regard them as having been duped as to the authorship or as fellowconspirators with ben in the great baconian joke and mysterythat william shakespeare the author is not the actor whose stratford friend collyns has his name written in legal documents as william shakespeare  anyone however may prefer to believe that while william shakspere was acting in a company 15923 bacon or who you please wrote venus and adonis and signing w shakspeare dedicated it to his young friend the earl promising to add some graver labour a promise fulfilled in lucrece  in 1593 bacon was chiefly occupied we shall see with the affairs of a young and beautiful earlthe earl of essex not of southampton  to essex he did not dedicate his two poems if venus and lucrece were his  he did nothing but ruminate he tells the world on essex  how mr greenwoods unknown was occupied in 15934 of course we cannot possibly be aware  i have thus tried to show that will shakspere if he had as much schooling as i suggest and if he had four or five years of life in london about the theatre and above all had genius might by 1592 be the rising playerauthor alluded to as shakescene  there remains a difficulty  by 1592 will had not time to be guilty of thirteen plays or even of six  but i have not credited him with the authorship between say 1587 and 1593 of eleven plays namely hamlet romeo and juliet midsummer nights dream titus andronicus comedy of errors loves labours lost king john the three plays of henry vi and the taming of the shrew  mr greenwood 112a cites judge webb for the fact that between the end of 1587 and the end of 1592 some halfdozen shakespearean dramas had been written and for dr furnivalls opinion that eleven had been composed  if i believed that half a dozen or eleven shakespearean plays as we have them had been written or composed between 1587 and 1592 i should be obliged to say that in my opinion they were not composed in these five years by will  mr greenwood writes some of the dates are disputable and for himself would omit titus andronicus the three plays of henry vi and possibly also the taming of the shrew while the reference to hamlet also is as i have elsewhere shown of very doubtful force 113a  this leaves us with six of dr furnivalls list of earliest plays put out of action  the miracle is decomposing but plays numerous enough to stagger my credulity remain  i cannot believe that the author even of the five plays before 15923 was the exbutchers boy  meanwhile these five plays written by somebody before 1593 meet the reader on the threshold of mr greenwoods book 113b with dr furnivalls eleven and they fairly frighten him if he be a stratfordian  will even will says the stratfordian could not have composed the five much less the eleven much less mr edwin reeds thirteen before 1592 113c but at the close of his work 113d mr greenwood reviews and disbands that unlucky troop of thirteen shakespearean plays before 1592 as mustered by mr reed a baconian of whom mr collins wrote in terms worthy of feu mr bludyer of the tomahawk  from the five plays left to shakespeares account in p 51 king john as we know it is now eliminated  i find it impossible to believe that the same man was the author of the drama the troublesome reign of king john published in 1591 and that which so far as we know first saw the light in the folio of 1623     hardly a single line of the original version reappears in the king john of shakespeare 114a  i think it is a mistake to endeavour to fortify the argument against him my will toi que jaime by ascribing to shakespeare such old plays as the king john of 1591 or the primitive hamlet 114b  i thought so too when i read p 51 and saw king john apparently still coloured on the card among shakespeares lot  we are now left with loves labours lost midsummer nights dream comedy of errors and romeo and juliet out of dr furnivalls list of plays up to 1593  the phantom force of miraculously early plays is following darkness like a dream  we do not know the date of a midsummer nights dream we do not know the date of romeo and juliet  mr gollancz dates the former about 1592 and the latter at 1591 114c  this is a mere personal speculation  of loves labours lost we only know that our version is one corrected and augmented by william shakespeare in 1598  i dare say it is as early as 15912 in its older form  of the comedy of errors mr collins wrote it is all but certain that it was written between 1589 and 1592 and it is quite certain that it was written before the end of 1594 114d  the legion of shakespearean plays of date before 1593 has vanished the miracle is very considerably abated  in place of introducing the airy hosts of plays before 1592 in p 51 it would have been perhaps more instructive to write that as far as we can calculate shakespeares earliest trials of his pinions as a dramatist may be placed about 15913  there would then have been no specious appearance of miracles to be credited by stratfordians to will  but even so we have sufficient to give us pause says mr greenwood with justice  it gives me pause if i am to believe that between 1587 and 1592 will wrote loves labours lost the comedy of errors a midsummer nights dream and romeo and juliet  there is a limit even to my gullibility and if anyone wrote all these plays as we now possess them before 1593 i do not suppose that will was the man  but the dates in fact are unknown  the miracle is apocryphal    chapter vi  the courtly plays  loves labours lost    we now come to consider another miracle discovered in the playsa miracle if the actor be the author  the new portent is the courtliness and refinement too often alas the noblest ladies make the coarsest jokes and wit of the speeches of the noble gentlemen and ladies in the plays  to be sure the refinement in the jests is often conspicuously absent  how could the rude actor learn his quips and pretty phrases and farfetched conceits  this question i have tried to answer alreadythe whole of these fashions abound in the literature of the day  here let us get rid of the assumption that a poet could not make the ladies and gentlemen of his plays converse as they do converse whether in quips and airs and graces or in loftier style unless he himself frequented their society  marlowe did not frequent the best society he was no courtier but there is the high courtly style in the speeches of the great and noble in edward ii  courtiers and kings never did speak in this manner any more than they spoke in blank verse  the style is a poetical convention while the quips and conceits the airs and graces ran riot through the literature of the age of lyly and his euphues and his comedies the age of the arcadia  a cheap and probable source of wills courtliness is to be found in the courtly comedies of john lyly five of which were separately printed between 1584 and 1592  lylys real significance is that he was the first to bring together on the english stage the elements of high comedy thereby preparing the way for shakespeares much ado about nothing and as you like it and loves labours lost one may add  whoever knows his shakespeare and his lyly well can hardly miss the many evidences that shakespeare had read lylys plays almost as closely as lyly had read plinys natural history     one could hardly imagine loves labours lost as existent in the period from 1590 to 1600 had not lylys work just preceded it 120a  it is to lylys plays writes dr landmann that shakespeare owes so much in the liveliness of his dialogues in smartness of expression and especially in that predilection for witticisms quibbles and playing upon words which he shows in his comedies as well as in his tragedies  there follows a dissertation on the affected styles of guevara and gongora of the pleiade in france and generally of the artificial manner in europe till in england we reach lyly in whose comedies says dr furness i think we should look for motives which appeared later in shakespeare 121a  the baconians who think that a poet could not derive from books and court plays his knowledge of fashions far more prevalent in literature than at court decide that the poet of loves labours lost was not will but the courtly concealed poet  no doubt baconians may argue with mr r m theobald 121b that bacon wrote marlowe and by parity of reasoning many urge though mr theobald does not that bacon wrote lyly pouring into lylys comedies the grace and wit the quips and conceits of his own courtly youth what for no  the hypothesis is as good as the other hypotheses bacon wrote marlowe bacon wrote shakespeare  the less impulsive baconians and the antiwillians appear to ignore the wellknown affected novels which were open to all the world and are noted even in short educational histories of english literature shakespeare in london had only to look at the books on the stalls to read or if he had the chance to see lylys plays and read the poems of the time  i am taking him not to be a dullard but a poet it was not hard for him if he were a poet of genius not only to catch the manner of lylys court comedies and marlowes mighty line marlowe was not brought up on the knees of marchionesses but to improve on them  people did not commonly talk in the poetical way heaven knows people did not write in the poetic convention certainly queen mary and queen elizabeth talked and wrote as a rule we have abundance of their letters like women of this world there is a curious exception in letter viii of the casket letters from mary to bothwell  in this we have a copy of the original french mary plunges into the affected and figured style already practised by les precieuses of her day and expands into symbolisms in a fantastic jargon  if courtiers of both sexes conversed in the style of euphues which is improbable they learned the trick of it from euphues not the author of euphues from them  lylys most popular prose was accessible to shakespeare  the whole convention as to how the great should speak and bear themselves was accessible in poetry and the drama  a man of genius naturally made his ladies and courtiers more witty more conceited more eloquent more gracious than any human beings ever were anywhere in daily life  it seems scarcely credible that one should be obliged to urge facts so obvious against the baconian argument that only a bacon intimately familiar with the society of the great could make the great speak as in the plays they doand as in real life they probably did not  we now look at loves labours lost published in quarto in 1598 as corrected and augmented by w shakespere  the date of composition is unknown but the many varieties of versification with some allusions mark it as among the earliest of the dramas  supposing that shakespeare obtained his knowledge of fine manners and speech and of the tedious quips and conceits which he satirises from the contemporary poems plays and novels which abounded in them and from precieux and precieuses who imitated them as i suggest even then loves labours lost is an extremely eccentric piece  i cannot imagine how a man who knew the foreign politics of his age as bacon did could have dreamed of writing anything so eccentric that is if it has any connection with foreign politics of the time  the scene is the court of ferdinand king of navarre  in 158993 the eyes of england were fixed on the court of her ally henri of navarre in his struggle with the league and the guises the war of religion  but the poet calls the king ferdinand taking perhaps from some story this nonexistent son of charles iii of navarre died 1425  to whom according to monstrelet the burgundian chronicler of that time the french king owed 200000 ducats of gold  this is a transaction of the early fifteenth century and leads to the presence of the princess of france as an envoy at the court of navarre in the play the whole thing is quite unhistorical and has the air of being borrowed from some lost story or brief novel  bacons brother anthony was english minister at the court of navarre  what could tempt bacon to pick out a nonhistorical king ferdinand of navarre plant him in the distant days of jeanne darc and make him at that period found an academe for three years of austere study and absence of women  but if bacon did this what could induce him to give to the nonexistent ferdinand as companions the marechal de biron with de longueville both of them in 158993 the chief adherents of henri of navarre and add to them dumain that is the duc de mayenne one of the guises the deadly foes of henri and of the huguenots  even in the unhistorically minded shakespeare the freak is of the most eccentricbut in bacon this friskiness is indeed strange  i cannot like mr greenwood 124a find any allusions to the civil war of france  france and navarre in the play are in full peace  the actual date of the fabulous king ferdinand would have been about 1430  by introducing biron longueville and the duc de mayenne and bankess celebrated educated horse the author shifts the date to 1591  but the navarre of the play is a region out of space out of time a fairy world of projected academes like that of the four young men in de la primaudayes lacademie francaise englished in 1586 and of peace while the actual king of navarre of 1591 was engaged in a struggle for life and faith and in his ceaseless amours  many of shakespeares anachronisms are easily intelligible  he takes a novel or story about any remote period or he chooses as for the midsummer nights dream a period earlier than that of the trojan war  he gives to the athens contemporary with the late minoan iii period 1600 bc a duke and his personages live like english nobles and rustics of his own day among the fairies of english folk lore  it is the manner of chaucer and of the poets and painters of any age before the end of the eighteenth century  the resulting anachronisms are natural and intelligible  we do not expect war chariots in troilus and cressida it is when the author makes the bronzeclad achaeans familiar with plato and aristotle that we are surprised  in loves labours lost we do not expect the author to introduce the manners of the early fifteenth century the date of the affair of the 200000 ducats  let the play reflect the men and manners of 158993but why place mayenne a fanatical catholic foe of navarre among the courtiers of the huguenot king of navarre  as for de mayenne under the english spelling of the day dumain appearing as a courtier of his hated adversary henri bacon of all men could not have made that absurd error  it was shakespeare who took but an absentminded interest in foreign politics  if bacon is building his play on an affair the ducats of 142535 roughly speaking he should not bring in a performing horse trained by bankes a staffordshire man which was performing its tricks at shrewsburyin 1591 126a  thus early we find that great scholar mixing up chronology in a way which in shakespeare even surprises but in bacon seems quite out of keeping  shakespeare as sir sidney lee says gives mayenne as dumain mayenne whose name was so frequently mentioned in popular accounts of french affairs in connection with navarres movements that shakespeare was led to number him also among his supporters  bacon would not have been so led  as mayenne and henri fought against each other at ivry in 1590 this was carrying nonsense far even for will but for the earnestly instructive bacon  the habits of the author could not have been more scholastic so judge webb is quoted if he had like bacon spent three years in the university of cambridge      bacon or whoever corrected the play in 1598 might have corrected primater into pia mater unless bacon intended the blunder for a malapropism of nathaniel a curate  either will or bacon either in fun or ignorance makes nathaniel turn a common italian proverb on venice into gibberish  it was familiar in florios second frutes 1591 and first frutes 1578 with the english translation  the books were as accessible to shakspere as to bacon  either author might also draw from james sandfords garden of pleasure done out of the italian in 15736  where the scholastic habits of bacon at cambridge are to be discovered in this play i know not unless it be in birons witty speech against study  if the wit implies in the author a cambridge education costard and dull and holofernes imply familiarity with rustics and country schoolmasters  where the author proves that he could not have been more familiar with french politics if like bacon he had spent three years in the train of an ambassador to france i cannot conjecture  there are no french politics in the piece any more than there are mysteries of fashionable life such as bacon might have heard of from essex and southampton  there is no familiarity with all the gossip of the court there is no greater knowledge of foreign proverbs than could be got from common english books  there is abundance indeed overabundance of ridicule of affected styles and quips with which the literature of the day was crammed  call it gongorism euphuism or what you please  one does not understand how or where judge webb in extreme old age made all these discoveries sympathetically quoted by mr greenwood 127a like bacon the author of the play must have had a large command of books he must have had his horace his ovidius naso and his good old mantuan  what a prodigious command of books  country schoolmasters confessedly had these books on the school desks  it was not even necessary for the author to have access to the chronicles of monstrelet  it is not known we have said whether or not such plot as the play possesses with king ferdinand and the 100000 ducats or 200000 ducats needed to bring the princess and the mythical king ferdinand of navarre together were not adapted by the poet from an undiscovered conte partly based on a passage in monstrelet  perhaps it will be conceded that loves labours lost is not a play which can easily be attributed to bacon  we do not know how much of the play existed before shakespeare augmented it in 1598  we do not know whether what he then corrected and augmented was an early work of his own or from another hand though probably it was his own moliere certainly corrected and augmented and transfigured in his illustrious career in paris several of the brief early sketches which he had written when he was the chief of a strolling troupe in southern france  mr greenwood does not attribute the wit such as it is the quips the conceits the affectations satirised in loves labours lost to wills knowledge of the artificial style then prevalent in all the literatures of western europe and in england most pleasingly used in lylys comedies  no the author must have been not only a man of high intellectual culture but one who was intimately acquainted with the ways of the court and the fashionable society of his time as also with contemporary foreign politics 129a  i search the play once more for the faintest hint of knowledge of foreign politics  the embassy of the daughter of the king of france who by the date of the affair of the ducats should be charles vii has been compared to a diplomatic sally of the mother of the childless actual king of france henri iii in 1586 when catherine de medici was no chicken  i do not see in the embassy of the princess of the story any intimate acquaintance with contemporary foreign politics about 15913  the introduction of mayenne as an adherent of the king of navarre shows either a most confused ignorance of foreign politics on the part of the author or a freakish contempt for his public  i am not aware that the author shows any intimate acquaintance with the ways of elizabeths court or of any other fashionable society except the courts which fancy held in plays  mr greenwood 129b appears to be repeating the case as to this very remarkable play as well summed up by the late judge webb in his mystery of william shakespeare p 44  in that paralysing judicial summary as we have seen the author could not have been more familiar with french politics if like bacon he had spent three years in the train of an ambassador to france  the french politics in the play are to send the daughter of a king of france the contemporary king henri iii was childless to conduct a negotiation about 200000 ducats at the court steeped in peace of a king of navarre a scholar who would fain be a recluse from women in an academe of his own device  such was not the navarre of henri in his war with the guises and henri did not shun the sex  such are the contemporary foreign politics the french politics which the author knowsas intimately as bacon might have known them they are not foreign politics they are not french politics they are politics of fairyland  with which will was at least as familiar as bacon  these then are the arguments in favour of bacon or the great unknown which are offered with perfect solemnity of assurance  and the baconians repeat them in their little books of popularisation and propaganda  quantula sapientia    chapter vii  contemporary recognition of will as author    it is absolutely impossible to prove that will or bacon or the man in the moon was the author of the shakespearean plays and poems but it is easy to prove that will was recognised as the author by ben jonson heywood and heminge and condell the actors to take the best witnesses  meanwhile we have received no hint that any man except will was ever suspected of being the author till 1856 when the twin stars of miss delia bacon and mr smith arose  the evidence of ben jonson and the rest can only prove that professed playwrights and actors who knew will both on and off the stage saw nothing in him not compatible with his work  had he been the kind of letterless country fellow or bookless fellow whom the baconians and mr greenwood describe the contemporary witnesses cited must have detected will in a day and the story of the concealed poet who really at first did the additions and changes in the companys older manuscript plays and of the inconceivably impudent pretences of will of stratford would have kept the town merry for a month five or six threadbare scholars would have sat down at a long table in a tavern room and after their manner dashed off a comedy of errors on the real and the false playwright  baconians never seem to think of the mechanical difficulties in their assumed literary hoax  if will like the old hermit of prague who never saw pen and ink could not even write the hoax was a physical impossibility  if he could write but was a rough bookless man his condition would be scarcely the more gracious even if he were able to copy in his scrawl the fine roman hand of the concealed poet  i am surprised that the baconians have never made that point  wills copy was almost without blot or erasion the other actors were wont to boast  really the absence of erasions and corrections is too easily explained on the theory that will was not the author  will merely copied the fair copies handed to him by the concealed poet the farce was played for some twenty years and was either undetected or all concerned kept the dread secretand all the other companies and rival authors were concerned in exposing the imposture  the whole story is like the dream of a child  we therefore expect the antiwillians to endeavour to disable the evidence of jonson heywood heminge and condell  their attempts take the shape of the most extravagant and complex conjectures with certain petty objections to bens various estimates of the merits of the plays  he is constant in his witness to the authorship  to these efforts of despair we return later when we hope to justify what is here deliberately advanced  meanwhile we study mr greenwoods attempts to destroy or weaken the testimony of contemporary literary allusions in prose or verse to the plays as the work of the actor  mr greenwood rests on an argument which perhaps could only have occurred to legal minds originally perhaps to the mind of judge webb not in the prime vigour of his faculties  not very many literary allusions remain made during wills lifetime to the plays of shakespeare  the writers usually speak of shakespeare or w shakespeare or will shakespeare and leave it there  in the same way when they speak of other contemporaries they name themand leave it there without telling us who frank beaumont or kit marlowe or robin greene or jack fletcher or any of the others were  all interested readers knew who they were  and also knew who shakespeare or will shakespeare was  no other will shakc was prominently before the literary and dramatic world in 15921616 except the warwickshire provincial who played with burbage  but though the mere names of the poets ben jonson kit marlowe frank beaumont harry chettle and so forth are accepted as indicating the wellknown men whom they designate this evidence to identity does not satisfy mr greenwood and the baconians where will is concerned  we should expect to find allusions to dramatic and poetical works published under the name of shakespeare we should expect to find shakespeare spoken of as a poet and a dramatist we should expect further to find some few allusions to shakespeare or shakspere the player  and these of course we do find but these are not the objects of our quest  what we require is evidence to establish the identity of the player with the poet and dramatist to prove that the player was the author of the plays and poems  that is the proposition to be established and that the allusions fail as it appears to me to prove says mr greenwood he adds at any rate they do not disprove the theory that the true authorship was hidden under a pseudonym 136awhich raises an entirely different question  makers of allusions to the plays must identify shakespeare with the actor explicitly must tell us who this shakespeare was though they need not and usually do not tell us who the other authors mentioned were and though the world of letters and the stage knew but one william shakspere or shakespeare who was far too familiar to them to require further identification  but even if the makers of allusions did all this and said by w shakespeare the poet we mean w shakespeare the actorthat is not enough  for they may all be deceived may all believe that a bookless untutored man is the author  so we cannot get evidence correct enough for mr greenwood  destitute as i am of legal training i leave this notable way of disposing of the evidence to the judgement of the bench and the bar a layman intermeddleth not with it  still i am like other readers on the jury addressedi do not accept the arguments  miror magis as mr greenwood might quote latin  we have already seen one example of this argument when heywood speaks of the author of poems by shakespeare published in the passionate pilgrim  heywood does nothing to identify the actor shakspere with the author shakespeare says mr greenwood  i shall prove that elsewhere heywood does identify them and no man knew more of the world of playwrights and actors than heywood  i add that in his remarks on the passionate pilgrim heywood had no need to say by w shakespeare i mean the wellknown actor in the kings company  there was no other william shakspere or shakespeare known to his public  it is to no purpose that mr greenwood denies as we have seen above that the allusions disprove the theory that the true authorship was hidden under a pseudonym  that is an entirely different question he is now starting quite another hare  men of letters who alluded to the plays and poems of william shakespeare meant the actor that is my position  that they may all have been mistaken  that william shakespeare was bacons or any ones pseudonym is i repeat a wholly different question and we must not allow the critic to glide away into it through an at any rate as he does three or four times  so far then mr greenwoods theory that it was impossible for the actor shakspere to have been the author of the plays encounters the difficulty that no contemporary attributed them to any other hand  that none is known to have said this warwickshire man cannot be the author  let us however examine some of these allusions to shakspere real or supposed says the critic 138a  he begins with the hackneyed words of the dying man of letters robert greene in a groatsworth of wit 1592  the pamphlet is addressed to gentlemen of his acquaintance that spend their wits in making plays he wisheth them a better exercise and better fortunes than his own  marlowe is supposed to be one of the three gentlemen playwrights but such suppositions do not here concern us  greenes is the ancient feud between the players and the authors between capital and labour  the players are the capitalists and buy the plays out and outcheap the author has no royalties and no control over the future of his work which a shakspere or a bacon a jonson or a chettle or any handyman of the company owning the play may alter as he pleases  it is highly probable that the actors also acquired most of the popular renown for even now playgoers have much to say about the players in a piece while they seldom know the name of the playwright  women fall in love with the actors not with the authors but with those puppets as greene says that speake from our mouths these anticks garnished in our colours  ben jonson we shall see makes some of the same complaintsmost natural in the circumstances though he managed to retain the control of his dramas how i do not know  greene adds that in his misfortunes illness and poverty he is ungratefully forsaken by the players and warns his friends that such may be their lot advising them to seek some better exercise  he then writesand his meaning cannot easily be misunderstood i think but misunderstood it has beenyes trust them not trust not the players for there is an upstart crow beautified with our feathers that with his tygers heart wrapt in a players hide players in place of womans in an old play the tragedy of richard duke of york c supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a blank verse as the best of you and being an absolute johannes factotum is in his own conceit the only shake scene in a country  the meaning is pellucid  do not trust the players my fellow playwrights for the reasons already given for they in addition to their glory gained by mouthing our words and their ingratitude may now forsake you for one of themselves a player who thinks his blank verse as good as the best of yours including marlowes probably the man is ready at their call an absolute johannes factotum in his own conceit he is the only shakescene in a country seek you better masters than these players who have now an author among themselves the only shakescene where the pun on shakespeare does not look like a fortuitous coincidence  but it may be anything may happen  the sense i repeat is pellucid  but mr greenwood writes that if shakescene be an allusion to shakespeare it seems clear that it is as an actor rather than as an author he is attacked 140a  as an actor the person alluded to is merely assailed with the other actors his fellows  but he is picked out as presenting another and a new reason why authors should distrust the players for there is among themselves in a players hide an upstart crowwho thinks his blank verse as good as the best of theirs  he is therefore necessarily a playwright and being a factotum can readily be employed by the players to the prejudice of greenes three friends who are professed playwrights  mr greenwood says that we do not know why greene should have been so particularly bitter against the players and why he should have thought it necessary so seriously to warn his fellow playwrights against them 141a  but we cannot help knowing for greene has told us  in addition to gaining renown solely through mouthing our words wearing our feathers they have been bitterly ungrateful to greene in his poverty and sickness they will in the same circumstances as cruelly forsake his friends yes for they now have an author and to the playwrights a dangerous rival in their own fellowship  thus we know with absolute certainty why greene wrote as he did  he says nothing about the superior financial gains of the players which mr greenwood suspects to have been the only cause of his bitterness  greene gives its causes in the plainest possible terms as did ben jonson later in his verses poetape playwrightactor  moreover mr greenwood gives greenes obvious motives on the very page where he says that we do not know them  even mr greenwood 141b anxious as he is to prove shakescene to be attacked as an actor admits that the words supposes himself as well able to bumbast out a blank verse as the best of you do seem to have that implication 141c namely that shakescene is a dramatic author  what else can the words mean why if not for the stage should shakescene write blank verse  finally mr greenwood after saying it is clear that it is as an actor rather than as an author that shakescene is attacked 142a concedes 142b that it certainly looks as if he greene meant to suggest that this shakescene supposed himself able to compose as well as to mouth verses  nothing else can possibly be meant  the rest of you were authors not actors  if not why in a whole company of actors should shakescene alone be selected for a special victim  shakescene is chosen out because as an author a factotum always ready at need he is more apt than the professed playwrights to be employed as author by his company this is a new reason for not trusting the players  i am not going to take the trouble to argue as to whether in the circumstances of the case shakescene is meant by greene for a pun on shakespeare or not  if he had some other rising player author the factotum of a cry of players in his mind baconians may search for that personage in the records of the stage  that other playerauthor may have died young or faded into obscurity  the term the only shakescene may be one of those curious coincidences which do occur  the presumption lies rather on the other side  i demur when mr greenwood courageously struggling for his case says that even assuming the validity of the surmise that there is an allusion to shakspere 143a the utmost that we should be entitled to say is that greene here accuses player shakspere of putting forward as his own some work or perhaps some parts of a work for which he was really indebted to another the great unknown  i do more than demur i defy any man to exhibit that sense in greenes words  the utmost that we should be entitled to say is in my opinion what we have no shadow of a title to say  look at the poor hackneyed tortured words of greene again  yes trust them not for there is an upstart crow beautified with our feathers that with his tygers heart wrapped in a players hide supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a blank verse as the best of you and being an absolute johannes factotum is in his own conceit the only shake scene in a country  how can mortal man squeeze from these words the charge that player shakspere is putting forward as his own some work or perhaps some parts of a work for which he was really indebted to another it is as an actor with other actors that the player is beautified with our feathersnot with the feathers of some one not ourselves bacon or mr greenwoods unknown  mr greenwood even says that shakescene is referred to as beautified with the feathers which he has stolen from the dramatic writers our feathers  greene says absolutely nothing about feathers which he has stolen the feathers the words of the plays were bought not stolen by the actors anticks garnished in our colours  tedious it is to write many words about words so few and simple as those of greene meaning do not trust the players for one of them writes blank verse which he thinks as good as the best of yours and fancies himself the only shakescene in a country  but greene here accuses player shakspere of putting forward as his own some work or perhaps some parts of a work for which he was really indebted to another this is the utmost we should be entitled to say even if the allusion be to shakspere  how does mr greenwood get the antiwillian hypothesis out of greenes few and plain words  it is much safer for him to say that shakescene is not meant for shakespeare  nobody can prove that it is the pun may be a strange coincidenceor any one may say that he thinks it nothing more if he pleases  greene nowhere refers to this shakescene as being an impostor an upstart crow beautified with the feathers which he has stolen from the dramatic writers our feathers 145athat is greene makes no such reference to shakescene in his capacity of writer of blank verse  like all players who are all anticks garnisht in our colours shakescene as player is beautified with our feathers it is mr greenwood who adds beautified with the feathers which he has stolen from the dramatic writers  greene does not even remotely hint at plagiarism on the part of shakescene  and the feathers the plays of greene and his friends were not stolen but bought  we must take greenes evidence as we find itit proves that by shake scene he means a poetape a playwrightactor for greene like jonson speaks of actors as apes  both men saw in a certain actor and dramatist a suspected rival  only one such successful practising actorplaywright is known to us at this date 15921601and he is shakespeare  unless another such existed greene in 1592 alludes to william shakc as a player and playwright  this proves that the actor from stratford was accepted in greenes world as an author of plays in blank verse  he cannot therefore have seemed incapable of his poetry  let us now briefly consider other contemporary allusions to shakespeare selected by mr greenwood himself  no allusion can prove that shakespeare was the author of the work attributed to him in the allusions  the plays and poems may have been by james vi and i a parcelpoet  the allusions can prove no more than that by his contemporaries shakespeare was believed to be the poet which is impossible if he were a mere rustic ignoramus as the baconians aver omitting some remarks by chettle on greenes groatsworth of wit 146a as if grammar goes for all they do not refer to shakespeare we have the cambridge farce or comedy on contemporary literature the return from parnassus 1602  the university wits laugh at shakespearenot an university man as the favourite poet in his venus and adonis of a silly braggart pretender to literature gullio  they also introduce kempe the low comedy man of shakespeares company speaking to burbage the chief tragic actor of shakespeare as a member of their company who as an author of plays puts down the university wits and ben jonson too  the date is not earlier than that of bens satiric play on the poets the poetaster 1601 to which reference is made  since kempe is to be represented as wholly ignorant his opinion of shakespeares preeminent merit only proves as in the case of gullio that the university wits decried the excellences of shakespeare  in him they saw no scholar  the point is that kempe recognises shakespeare as both actor and author  all this is quite consistent with the theory that shakespeare was a pseudonym 147a says mr greenwood  of course it is but it is not consistent with the theory that shakespeare was an uneducated bookless rustic for in that case his mask would have fallen off in a day in an hour  of course the cambridge author only proves if you will that he thought that kempe thought that his fellow player was the author  but we have better evidence of what the actors thought than in the cambridge play  in 1598 as we saw francis meres in palladis tamia credits shakespeare with venus and adonis with privately circulated sonnets and with a number of the comedies and tragedies  how the allusions negative the hypothesis that shakespeare was a nom de plume is not apparent says mr greenwood always constant to his method  i repeat that he wanders from the point which is here that the only william shakc known to us at the time in london was credited with the plays and poems on all sides which proves that no incompatibility between the man and the works was recognised  then weaver 1599 alludes to him as author of venus lucrece romeo richard more whose names i know not  davies 1610 calls him our english terence the famous comedian and mentions him as having played some kingly parts in sport  freeman 1614 credits him with venus and lucrece  besides in plays thy wit winds like meander  i repeat heywoods evidence  thomas heywood author of that remarkable domestic play a woman killed with kindness was from the old days of henslowe in the fifteennineties a playwright and an actor he survived into the reign of charles i  writing on the familiar names of the poets jack fletcher frank beaumont kit marlowe tom nash he says   mellifluous shakespeare whose enchanting quill commanded mirth and passion was but will   does heywood not identify the actor with the author  no quibbles serve against the evidence  we need not pursue the allusions later than shakespeares death or invoke at present ben jonsons panegyric of 1623  as to davies his dull and obscure epigram is addressed to our english terence mr will shakespeare  he accosts shakespeare as good will  he remarks that as some say if will had not played some kingly parts in sport he had been a companion for a king and been a king among the meaner sort  nobody now can see the allusion and the joke  shakespeares company in 1604 acted a play on the gowrie conspiracy of 1600  king james suppressed the play after the second night as of course he was brought on the stage throughout the action  and in very droll and dreadful situations  did will take the kings part and annoy gentle king jamie as some say  nobody knows  but mr greenwood to disable daviess recognition of mr will as a playwright our english terence quotes from florios montaigne a silly old piece of roman literary gossip terences plays were written by scipio and laelius  in fact terence alludes in his prologue to the adelphi to a spiteful report that he was aided by great persons  the prologue may be the source of the fable that does not matter  davies might get the fable in montaigne and knowing that some great one wrote wills plays might therefore in irony address him as our english terence  this is a pretty free conjecture  in roman comedy he had only two names known to him to choose from he took terence not plautus  but if davies was in the great secret a world of others must have shared le secret de polichinelle  yet none hints at it and only a very weak cause could catch at so tiny a straw as the offchance that davies knew and used terence as a gibe 149a  the allusions even the few selected cannot prove that the actor wrote the plays but do prove that he was believed to have done so and therefore that he was not so ignorant and bookless as to demonstrate that he was incapable of the poetry and the knowledge displayed in his works  mr greenwood himself observes that a baconian critic goes too far when he makes will incapable of writing such a will could deceive no mortal 150a  but does mr greenwood who finds in the author of the plays much learning and remarkable classical attainments or a wide familiarity with the classics 150b suppose that his absolutely bookless will could have persuaded his intimates that he was the author of plays exhibiting a wide familiarity with the classics or remarkable classical attainments  the thing is wholly impossible  i do not remember that a single contemporary allusion to shakespeare speaks of him as learned erudite scholarly and so forth  the epithets for him are sweet gentle honeyed sugared honey tonguedthis is the convention  the tradition followed by milton who was eight years of age when shakespeare died and who wrote lallegro just after leaving cambridge makes shakespeare sweetest shakespeare fancys child with native woodnotes wild and gives to jonson the learned sock  fuller like milton was born eight years before the death of shakespeare namely in 1608  like milton he was a cambridge man  the first folio of shakespeares works appeared when each of these two bookish men was aged fifteen  it would necessarily revive interest in shakespeare now first known as far as about half of his plays went  he would be discussed among lovers of literature at cambridge  mr greenwood quotes fullers remark that shakespeares learning was very little that if alive he would confess himself to be never any scholar 151a  i cannot grant that fuller is dividing the persons of actor and author  men of shakespeares generation such as jonson did not think him learned nor did men of the next generation  if mr collinss view be correct the men of shakespeares and of miltons generations were too ignorant to perceive that shakespeare was deeply learned in the literature of rome and in the literature of greece  every one was too ignorant till mr collins came    chapter viii  the silence of philip henslowe    when shakespeare is mentioned as an author by contemporary writers the baconian stratagem we have seen is to cry ah but you cannot prove the author mentioned to be the actor  we have seen that meres 1598 speaks of shakespeare as the leading tragic and comic poet poor poetape that would be thought our chief quoth jonson as author of venus and adonis and as a sonneteer  all this does nothing whatever to support the idea that the stratford player was the author of the plays and poems alluded to says mr greenwood playing that card again 155a  the allusions i repeat do prove that shakc the actor was believed to be the author till any other noted william shakc is found to have been conspicuously before the town  there is nothing at all to prove that meres native of lincolnshire had any personal knowledge of shakespeare  there is nothing at all to prove that meres native of lincolnshire had any personal knowledge of nine tenths of the english authors famous or forgotten whom he mentions on the questionwho was shakespearehe throws no light  he throws no light on the question who was any of the poets mentioned by him except one quite forgotten whose college he names    to myself this sad repeated aircritics who praise shakespeare do not say who shakespeare waswould appear to be not an argument but a subterfuge  though mr greenwood honestly believes it to be an argumentotherwise he would not use it  much less would he repeat it with frequent iteration  the more a man was notorious as was will shakspere the actor the less the need for any critic to tell his public who shakespeare was  as mr greenwood tries to disable the evidence when shakespeare is alluded to as an author so he tries to better his case when in the accountbook of philip henslowe an owner of theatres moneylender pawnbroker purchaser of plays from authors and so forth shakespeare is not mentioned at all  here is a mystery which properly handled may advance the great cause  henslowe has notes of loans of money to several actors some of them of shakespeares company the lord chamberlains  there is no such note of a loan to shakespeare  does this prove that he was not an actor  if so burbage was not an actor henslowe never names him  there are notes of payments of money to henslowe after each performance of any play in one of his theatres  in these notes the name of shakespeare is never once mentioned as the author of any play  how weird  but in these notes the names of the authors of the plays acted are never mentioned  does this suggest that bacon wrote all these plays  on the other hand there are frequent mentions of advances of money to authors who were working at plays for henslowe singly or in pairs threes fours or fives  we find drayton dekker chapman and nine authors now forgotten by all but antiquarians  we have also ben jonson 1597 marston munday middleton webster and others authors in henslowes pay  but the same of shakespeare never appears  mysterious  the other mens names writes dr furness occur because they were all writers for henslowes theatre but we must wait at all events for the discovery of some other similar record before we can produce corresponding memoranda regarding shaksper sic and his productions 157a  the natural mind of the ordinary man explains all by saying henslowe records no loans of money to shakspere the actor because he lent him no money  he records no payments for plays to shakespeare the authoractor because to henslowe the actor sold no plays  that is the whole explanation of the silence of philip henslowe  if shakspere did sell a play to henslowe why should that financier omit the fact from his accounts  suppose that the actor was illiterate as baconians fervently believe and sold bacons plays what prevented him from selling a play of bacons under his own name as usual to henslowe  to obtain a baconian reply you must wander into conjecture and imagine that bacon forbade the transaction  then why did he forbid it  because he could get a better price from shaksperes company  the same cause would produce the same effect on shakspere himself whether he were the author or were bacons or any mans gobetween  on any score but that of money why was henslowe good enough for ben jonson dekker heywood middleton and webster and not good enough for bacon who did not appear in the matter at all but was represented in it by the actor will  as a gentleman and a man of the court bacon would be as much discredited if he were known to sell for 6 pounds on an average his noble works to the lord chamberlains company as if he sold them to henslowe  i know not whether the great lawyer courtier scholar and philosopher is supposed by baconians to have given will shakspere a commission on his sales of plays or to have let him keep the whole sum in each case  i know not whether the players paid shakspere a sum down for his or bacons plays or whether will received a double share or other or any share of the profits on them as henslowe did when he let a house to the players  nobody knows any of these things  if shakspere the player had been a dramatist surely henslowe would have employed him also like the others in that behalf 159a henslowe would if he could have got the copy cheap enough  was any one of the others the playwrights a player holding a share in his company  if not the fact makes an essential difference for shakspere was a shareholder  collier in his preface to henslowes socalled diary mentions a playwright who was bound to scribble for henslowe only henry porter and another chettle who was bound to write only for the company protected by the earl of nottingham 159b  modern publishers and managers sometimes make the same terms with novelists and playwrights  it appears to me that shaksperes company would be likely as his plays were very popular to make the same sort of agreement with him and to give him such terms as he would be glad to acceptwhether the wares were his ownor bacons  he was a keen man of business in such a case he would not write for henslowes pittance  he had a better market  the plays whether written by himself or bacon or the man in the moon were at his disposal and he did not dispose of them to henslowe wherefore henslowe cannot mention him in his accounts  that is all  quoting an american judge dr stotsenburg apparently mr greenwood cites the circumstance that in two volumes of alleyns papers there is not one mention of such a poet as william shaksper in his list of actors poets and theatrical comrades 160a  if this means that shakspere is not mentioned by alleyn among actors are we to infer that william was not an actor  even baconians insist that he was an actor  how strange how more than strange cries mr greenwood that henslowe should make no mention in all this long diary embracing all the time from 1591 to 1609 of the actorauthor    no matter  credo quia impossibile 160b  credo what and what is impossible  henslowes volume is no diary he does not tell a single anecdote of any description he merely enters loans gains payments  does henslowe mention say ben jonson when he is not doing business with ben  does he mention any actor or author except in connection with money matters  then if he did no business with shakspere the actor in borrowing or lending and did no business with shakespeare the author in borrowing lending buying or selling how strange how more than strange it would be if henslowe did mention shakespeare  he was not keeping a journal of literary and dramatic jottings  he was keeping an account of his expenses and receipts  he never names richard burbage any more than he mentions shakespeare  mr greenwood again expresses his views about this dark suspicious mystery the absence of shakespeare or shakspere or shak as you like it from henslowes accounts if shakc wrote plays  but the mystery if mystery there be is just as obscure if the actor were the channel through which bacons plays reached the stage for the pretended author of these masterpieces  shakwas not the man to do all the troking bargaining lying going here and there and making himself a motley to the view for 0 pounds 0s 0d  if he were a sham a figurehead a liar a fetcherandcarrier of manuscripts he would be paid for it  but he did not deal with henslowe in his bargainings and that is why henslowe does not mention him  mr greenwood in one place 161a agrees so far with me  why did henslowe not mention shakespeare as the writer of other plays than titus andronicus and henry vi  i think the answer is simple enough  so do i  neither shakspere nor shakespeare ever wrote for henslowe  the obvious is perceived at last and the reason given is that he was above henslowes skyline he being the author  we only differ as to why the author was above henslowes skyline  i say because good will had a better market that of his company  i understand mr greenwood to thinkbecause the great unknown was too great a man to deal with henslowe  if to write for the stage were discreditable to deal unknown with henslowe was no more disgraceful than to deal with a cry of players and as unknown will did the bargaining the great unknown was as safe with will in one case as in the other  if will did not receive anything for the plays from his own company who firmly believed in his authorship they must have said will dost thou serve the muses and thy obliged fellows for naught  dost thou give us two popular plays yearlygratis  do you not see that in the interests of the great secret itself will had to take the pay for the plays pretended his from somebody will shakspere making his dear fellows and friends a present of two masterpieces yearly was too incredible  so i suppose he did have royalties on the receipts or otherwise got his money and as he certainly did not get them from henslowe henslowe had no conceivable reason for entering wills name in his accounts  such are the reflections of a plain man but to an imaginative soul there seems to be a brooding mist with a heart of fire which half conceals and half reveals the darkened chamber wherein abides the silence of philip henslowe  the silence of philip henslowe mr greenwood writes is a very remarkable phenomenon      it is a phenomenon precisely as remarkable as the absence of mr greenwoods name from the accounts of a bootmaker with whom he has never had any dealings  if however there was a man in high position a concealed poet who took the works of others and rewrote and transformed them besides bringing out original plays of his own    then it is natural enough that his name should not appear among those of the for the most part impecunious dramatists to whom henslowe paid money for playwriting 163a  nothing can be more natural and in fact the name of bacon or southampton or james vi or sir john ramsay or sir walter raleigh or sir fulke greville or any other man in high position does not appear in henslowes accounts  nor does the name of william shakc  but why should it not appear if will sold either his own plays or those of the noble friend to whom he lent his name and personalityto henslowe  why not  then consider the figure to my mind impossible of the great concealed poet of high position who can bring out original plays of his own and yet takes the works of others say of sporting kyd or of dekker and chettle and such poor devils takes them as a yankee piratepublisher takes my rhymesand rewrites and transforms them  bacon or bungay cannot take them without permission of their legal ownersshaksperes or any other companyof any one in short who as ben jonson says buys up reversions of old plays how is he to manage these shabby dealings  apparently he employs will shakspere spells his own nom de plume shakespeare and has his rewritings and transformations of the destitute authors work acted by wills company  what a situation for bacon or sir fulke greville or james vi or any man in high position whom fancy can suggest  the plays by the original authors whoever they were could only be obtained by the concealed poet and man in high position from the legal owners shaksperes company usually  the concealed poet had to negotiate with the owners and bacon or whoever he was employed that scamp will shakspere first i think to extract the plays from the owners and then to pretend that he himself even will had rewritten and transformed them  what an associate was our will for the concealed poet how certain it was that will would blackmail the man in high position doubtless he did  we find bacon arrested for debt more than once while will buys new place in stratford with the money extorted from the concealed poet of high position 164a  bacon did associate with that serpent phillips a reptile of walsingham who forged a postscript to mary stuarts letter to babington  but now if not bacon then some other concealed poet of high position with a mysterious passion for rewriting and transforming plays by sad needy authors is in close contact with will shakspere the warwickshire poacher and ignorant butchers boy country schoolmaster drapers apprentice enfin tout le tremblement  how strange how more than strange  the sum of the matter seems to me to be that from as early as march 3 1591 we find henslowe receiving small sums of money for the performances of many plays  he was paid as owner or lessee of the house used by this or that company  on march 3 1591 the play acted by lord stranges derbys men was henry vi  several other plays with names familiar in shakespeares works such as titus andronicus all the three parts of henry vi king leare april 6 1593 henry v may 14 1592 the taming of a shrew june 11 1594 and hamlet paid toll to henslowe  he received so much on each occasion when they were acted in a theatre of his  but he never records his purchase of these plays and it is not generally believed that shakespeare was the author of all these plays in the form which they bore in 15914  though there is much difference of opinion  there is one rather interesting case  on august 25 1594 henslowe enters ne that is a new play received at the venesyon comodey eighteen pence  that was his share of the receipts  the lord chamberlains company that of shakespeare was playing in henslowes theatre at newington butts  if the venesyon comodey venetian comedy were the merchant of venice this is the first mention of it  but nobody knows what henslowe meant by the venesyon comodey  he does not mention the authors name because in this part of his accounts he never does mention the author or authors  he only names them when he buys from or lends to or has other money dealings with the authors  he had none with shakespeare hence the silence of philip henslowe    chapter ix  the later life of shakespearehis monument and portraits    in the chapter on the preoccupations of bacon the reader may find help in making up his mind as to whether bacon with his many and onerous duties and occupations his scientific studies and his absorbing scientific preoccupation is a probable author of the shakespearean plays  mr greenwood finds the young shakspere impossiblebecause of his ignorancewhich made him such a really good pseudoauthor and such a successful mask for bacon or bacons unknown equivalent  the shakspere of later life the welltodo shakspere the purchaser of the right to bear arms so bad at paying one debt at least so eager a creditor a wouldbe encloser of a common a man totally bookless is to mr greenwoods mind an impossible author of the later plays  here first are moral objections on the ground of character as revealed in some legal documents concerning business  now i am very ready to confess that williams dealings with his debtors and with one creditor are wholly unlike what i should expect from the author of the plays  moreover the conduct of shelley in regard to his wife was in my opinion very mean and cruel and the last thing that we could have expected from one who in verse was such a tender philanthropist and in life waswomen apartthe besthearted of men  the conduct of robert burns alas too often disappoints the lover of his cottars saturday night and other moral pieces  he was an inconsistent walker  i sincerely wish that shakespeare had been less hard in money matters just as i wish that in financial matters scott had been more like himself that he had not done the last things that we should have expected him to do  as a member of the scottish bar it was inconsistent with his honour to be the secret proprietor of a publishing and a printing business  this is the unexplained moral paradox in the career of a man of chivalrous honour and strict probity  but the fault did not prevent scott from writing his novels and poems  why then should the few bare records of shaksperes monetary transactions make his authorship impossible  the objection seems weakly sentimental  macaulay scolds scott as fiercely as mr greenwood scolds shakspere for the more part ignorantly and unjustly  still there is matter to cause surprise and regret  both scott and shakspere are accused of writing for gain and of spending money on lands and houses with the desire to found families  but in the mysterious mixture of each human personality any sober soul who reflects on his own sins and failings will not think other mens failings incompatible with intellectual excellence  bacons own conduct in money matters was that of a man equally grasping and extravagant  ben jonson thus describes shakespeare as a social character  he was indeed honest and of an open and free nature    i loved the man and do honour his memory on this side idolatry as much as any  perhaps ben never owed money to shakspere and refused to pay  we must not judge a mans whole intellectual character and declare him to be incapable of poetry on the score of a few legal papers about matters of business  apparently shakspere helped that elizabethan mr micawber his father out of a pecuniary slough of despond in which the exhigh bailiff of the town was floundering pursued by the distraint of one of the friendly family of quiney adrian quiney  they were neighbours and made a common dunghill in henley street 171a  i do not like mr greenwood see anything at all out of the way in the circumstance that a man should be writing hamlet and at the same time bringing actions for petty sums lent on loan at some unspecified interest 171b  nor do i see anything at all out of the way in bacons prosecution of his friend and benefactor essex 1601 while bacon was writing hamlet  indeed shaksperes case is the less out of the way of the two  he wanted his loan to be repaid and told his lawyer to bring an action  bacon wanted to keep his head of inestimable value on his shoulders or to keep his body out of the tower or he merely as he declares wanted to do his duty as a lawyer of the crown  in any case bacon was in a tragic position almost unexampled and was at once overwhelmed by work and one must suppose by acute distress of mind in the case of essex  he must have felt this the more keenly if as some baconians vow he wrote the sonnets to essex  whether he were writing his hamlet when engaged in essexs case 1601 or any other of his dramatic masterpieces even this astonishing man must have been sorely bestead to combine so many branches of business  thus i would reply to mr greenwoods amazement that shakspere a hard creditor and so forth should none the less have been able to write his plays  but if it is meant that a few business transactions must have absorbed the whole consciousness of shakespeare and left him neither time nor inclination for poetry consider the scientific preoccupation of bacon his parliamentary duties his ceaseless activity as one of the legal bodyguard of the queen at a time when he had often to be examining persons accused of conspiracyand do not forget his long and poignant anxiety about essex his constant efforts to reconcile him with elizabeth and to advocate his cause without losing her favour and finally the anguish of prosecuting his friend and of knowing how hardly the world judged his own conduct  follow him into his relations with james i his eager pursuit of favour the multiplicity of his affairs his pecuniary distresses and the profound study and severe labour entailed by the preparation for and the composition of the advancement of learning 16035  he must be a stouthearted baconian who can believe that between 1599 and 1605 bacon was writing hamlet and other masterpieces of tragedy or comedy  but all is possible to genius what mr greenwoods great unknown was doing at this period neither does he know nor do i know but he only  he no doubt had abundance of leisure  at last shakspere died 1616 and had not the mead of one melodious tear as far as we know from the london wits in the shape of obituary verses  this fills mr greenwood with amazement  was it because the friends of the muses were for the most part aware that shakespeare had not died with shakspere  did jonson perchance think that his idea might be realised when he wrote      what a sight it were to see thee in our waters yet appear   and so on  did jonson expect and hope to see the genuine shakespeare return to the stage seven years after the death of shakspere the actor the swan of avon  as jonson was fairly sane we can no more suspect him of having hoped for this miracle than believe that most of the poets knew the actor not to be the author  moreover jonson while desiring that shakespeare might shine forth again and cheer the drooping stage added   which since thy flight from hence hath mourned like night and despairs day but for thy volumes light   that isthe folio of 1623  ben did not weave the amazing tissue of involved and contradictory falsities attributed to him by baconians beaumont died in the same year as shakspere who died in the depths of the country weary of london  has mr greenwood found obituary poems dropped on the grave of the famous beaumont  did fletcher did jonson produce one melodious tear for the loss of their friend in fletchers case his constant partner  no  were the poets then aware that beaumont was a humbug whose poems and plays were written by bacon 174a  i am not to discuss shakespeares will the secondbest bed and so forth  but as shakespeares will says not a word about his books it is decided by mr greenwood that he had no books  mr greenwood is a lawyer so was my late friend mr charles elton qc of white staunton who remarks that shakespeare bequeathed all the rest of my goods chattels leases c to my soninlaw john hall gent he really was a gent with authentic coatarmour  it is with mr eltons opinion not with my ignorance that mr greenwood must argue in proof of the view that goods are necessarily exclusive of books for mr elton takes it as a quite natural fact that shakespeares books passed with his other goods to mr hall and thence to a mr nash to whom mr hall left my study of books 175a library  i only give this as a lawyers opinion  there is in the bodleian an aldine ovid with shakespeares signature merely wm she and a note this little volume of ovid was given to me by w hall who sayd it was once will shakespeares i do not know that the signature like that on florios montaigne in the british museum has been detected as a forgery nor do i know that shakespeares not specially mentioning his books proves that he had none  lawyers appear to differ as to this inference  both mr elton and mr greenwood seem equally confident 175b  but if it were perfectly natural that the actor shakspere should have no books then he certainly made no effort by the local colour of owning a few volumes to persuade mankind that he was the author yet they believed that he wasreally there is no wriggling out of it  as regards any of his own mss which shakespeare may have had one would expect them to be at his theatre and their monetary value if they were not as usual the property of his company and of him as a member thereof we can discuss that question in the section headed the first folio  it appears that shakespeares daughter judith could write no more than her grandfather 176a  nor i repeat could the lady jane gordon daughter of the great earl of huntly when she was married to the earl of bothwell in 1566  at all events lady jane made her mark  it may be feared that judith brought up in that very illiterate town of stratford under an illiterate mother was neglected in her education  sad but very common in women of her rank and scarcely a proof that her father did not write the plays  as nothing is known of the disposition and character 176b of shakespeares granddaughter lady barnard who died in 1670 it is not so paralysingly strange that nothing is known of any relics or anecdotes of shakespeare which she may have possessed  mr greenwood would have supposed that she would have had much to say about the great poet exhibited his books if any and so forth  perhaps she didbut how if we know nothing about her disposition and character can we tell  no interviewers rushed to her house abington hall northamptonshire with pencils and notebooks to record her utterances no reporter interviewed her for the press  it is surprising is it not  the inference might be drawn in the baconian manner that during the commonwealth and restoration the friends of the muses knew that the actor was not the author and therefore did not interview his granddaughter in the country  but at any rate we have the stratford monument says mr greenwood and delves into this problem  even the stratford monument of shakespeare in the parish church is haunted by baconian mysteries if the gentle reader will throw his eye over the photograph 177a of the monument as it now exists he may not be able to say to the face of the poet    thou wast that all to me will for which my soul did pine   but if he has any knowledge of jacobean busts on monuments he will probably agree with me in saying this effigy though executed by somebody who was not a pheidias and who perhaps worked merely from descriptions is at all events jacobean  the same may assuredly be said of the monument it is in good jacobean style  the pillars with their capitals are graceful  all the rest is in keeping and the two inscriptions are in the square capital letters of inscriptions of the period not in italic characters  distrusting my own expertise i have consulted sir sidney colvin and mr holmes of the national portrait gallery  they with mr spielmann think the work to be of the early seventeenth century  next glance at the figure opposite  this is a reproduction of the earliest representation of the bust and monument in dugdales antiquities of warwickshire 1656  compare the two objects point by point from the potato on top with holes in it of dugdale which is meant for a skull through all the detailsbust and all  does dugdales print whether engraved by hollar or not represent a jacobean work  look at the two ludicrous children their legs dangling in air at the lions heads above the capitals of the pillars at the lettering of the two visible words of the inscription and at the gloomy hypochondriac or lunatic clasping a cushion to his abdomen  that hideous design was not executed by an artist who had his eye on the object if the object were a jacobean monument  while the actual monument was fashioned in no period of art but the jacobean  from digges rhymes in the folio of 1623 we know that shakespeare already had his stratford monument  the existing object is what he had the monument in dugdale is what i hope no architect of 161623 could have imagined or designed  dugdales engraving is not a correct copy of any genuine jacobean work of art  is dugdale accurate in his reproductions of other monuments in stratford church  to satisfy himself on this point sir george trevelyan as he wrote to me june 13 1912 made a sketch of the carew renaissance monument in stratford church and found that the discrepancies between the original tomb and the representation in dugdales warwickshire are far and away greater than in the monument to william shakespeare  mr greenwood 179a while justly observing that the little sitting figures    are placed as no monumental sculptor would place them on the whole sees no reason at all why we should doubt the substantial accuracy of dugdales figure     it is impossible to suppose that hollar would have drawn and that dugdale would have published a mere travesty of the stratford monument  i do not know who drew the design but a travesty of jacobean work it is in every detail of the monument  a travesty is what dugdale gives as a representation of the carew monument  mr greenwood elsewhere repeating his criticism of the impossible figures of children says this is certainly mere matter of detail and in the absence of other evidence would give us no warrant for doubting the substantial accuracy of dugdales presentment of the shakespeare bust 180a  why are we to believe that dugdales artist was merely fantastic in his design of the children and also remote from jacobean taste in every detail and yet to credit him with substantial accuracy in his halflength of a gloomy creature clutching a cushion to his stomach  with his inaccuracies as to the carew monument why are we to accept him as accurate in his representation of the bust moreover other evidence is not wanting  it is positively certain that the monument existing in 1748 was then known as the original monument and that no other monument was put in its place at that date or later  now mrs stopes 180b argues that in 1748 the monument was entirely reconstructed and so must have become no longer what dugdales man drew but what we see today  it is positively certain that her opinion is erroneous  if ever what we see today was substituted for anything like what dugdales man drew the date of the substitution is unknown  mrs stopes herself discovered the documents which disprove her theory  they were known to halliwellphillipps who quotes an unnamed contemporary account 181a  this account mrs stopes with her tireless industry found in the wheler manuscripts among papers of the rev joseph greene in 1746 head master of the grammar school  in one paper of september 1740 the original monument is said to be much impaired and decayed  there was a scheme for making a new monument in westminster abbey  that i venture to think would have been in hanoverian not in jacobean taste and style  but there was no money for a new monument  mrs stopes also found a paper of november 20 1748 showing that in september 1746 mr ward grandfather of mrs siddons was at stratford with a cry of players  he devoted the proceeds of a performance of othello to the reparation of the then existing monument  the amount was twelve pounds ten shillings  the affair dragged on one of the church wardens a blacksmith held the 12 pounds 10s and was troublesome the document of november 20 1748 was drawn up to be signed but was not signed by the persons who appear to be chiefly concerned in the matter  it directed that mr hall a local limner or painter is to take care according to his ability that the monument shall become as like as possible to what it was when first erected  this appears to have been the idea of mr greene  another form of words was later adopted directing mr hall the painter to repair and beautify or to have the direction of repairing and beautifying the original monument of shakespeare the poet  mrs stopes infers justly in my opinion that hall would fill up the gaps restore what was amissing as he thought it ought to be and finally repaint it according to the original colours traces of which he might still be able to see  in his history and antiquities of stratfordonavon 182a mr wheler tells us that this was what hall did  in the year 1748 the monument was carefully repaired and the original colours of the bust c as much as possible preserved by mr john hall limner of stratford  it follows that we see the original monument and bust but the painting is of 1861 for the bust says wheler was in 1793 painted in white to please malone  it was repainted in 1861  mrs stopes unluckily is not content with what hall was told to do and what according to wheler he did  she writes  it would only be giving good value for his money 12 pounds 10s to his churchwardens if hall added sic a cloak a pen and manuscript he could not help changing the face and so on  now it was physically impossible to add a cloak a pen and manuscript to such a stone bust as dugdales man shows to take away the cushion pressed to the stomach and to alter the head  mr hall if he was to give us the present bust had to make an entirely new bust and to give us the present monument in place of that shown in dugdales print had to construct an entirely new monument  now hall was a painter not like giulio romano also an architect and sculptor  pour tout potage he had but 12 pounds 10s  he could not do and he did not do these things he did not destroy the original monument and make a new monument in jacobean style  he was straitly ordered to repair and beautify the original monument he did repair it and repainted the colours  that is all  i do not quote what halliwellphillipps tells us 183a about the repairing of the forefinger and thumb of the right hand and the pen work which he says had to be renewed by william roberts of oxford in 1790  he gives no authority and baconians may say that he was hoaxed or lied with circumstance  mr greenwood 183b quotes halliwellphillippss works of shakespeare 1853 in which he says that the design in dugdales book is evidently too inaccurate to be of any authority the probability being that it was not taken from the monument itself indeed the designer is so inaccurate that he gives the first word of the latin inscription as judicyo just as oudry blunders in the latin inscription of a portrait of mary stuart which he copied badly mr greenwood proceeds  in his outlines halliwell simply ignores dugdale  his engraving was doubtless too inconvenient to be brought to public notice  here halliwell is accused of suppressing the truth if he invented his minute details about the repeated reparation of the writing handnot represented in dugdales designhe also lied with circumstance  but he certainly quoted a genuine contemporary account of the orders for repairing and beautifying the original monument in 1748 and i presume that he also had records for what he says about reparations of the hand and pen he speaks too of substitutions for decayed alabaster parts of the monument though not in his outlines and i observe that in mrs stopess papers there is record of a meeting on december 20 1748 at which mention was made of the materials which hall was to use for repairs  to me the evidence of the style as to the date of both monument and bust speaks so loudly for their accepted date 161623 and against the georgian date of 1748 that i need no other evidence nor do i suppose that any one familiar with the monumental style of 15901620 can be of a different opinion  in the same way i do not expect any artist or engraver to take the engraving of the monument in rowes shakespeare 1709 and that by grignion so late as 1786 for anything but copies of the design in dugdale with modifications made a plaisir  in popes edition 1725 vertue gives the monument with some approach to accuracy but for the bald plump face of the bust presents a topheavy and sculpturally impossible face borrowed from the chandos portrait which in my opinion is of no more authority than any other portrait of shakespeare  none of them i conceive was painted from the life  the baconians show a wistful longing to suppose the original bust copied in dugdale to have been meant for bacon but we need not waste words over this speculation  mr greenwood writes that if i should be told that dugdales effigy represented an elderly farmer deploring an exceptionally bad harvest i should not feel it to be strange  neither should i feel it at all strange if i were told that it was the presentment of a philosopher and lord chancellor who had fallen from high estate and recognised that all things are but vanity  i should not feel it to be strange if a baconian told me that the effigy of a living exchancellor were placed in the monument of the dead will shakspere and if on asking why the alteration was made i were asked in reply in mr greenwoods words was dugdales bust thought to bear too much resemblance to one who was not shakspere of stratford  or was it thought that the presence of a woolsack the cushion might be taken as indicating that shakspere of stratford was indebted for support to a certain lord chancellor 186a  such indeed are the things that baconians might readily say  do say i believe  dugdales engraving reproduces the first words of a latin inscription still on the monument   judicio pylium genio socratem arte maronem    terra tegit populus maeret olympus habet   earth covers olympus heaven or the muses hill holds him who was a nestor in counsel in poetic art a virgil a socrates for his daemon genius  as for the genius or daemon of socrates and the permitted false quantity in making the first syllable of socrates short and the use of olympus for heaven in epitaphs it is sufficient to consult the learning of mr elton 186b  the poet who made such notable false quantities in his plays had no cause to object to another on his monument  we do not know who erected the monument and paid for it or who wrote or adapted the epitaph but it was somebody who thought shakespeare or bacon a clayver man the monument if a trembling conjecture may be humbly put forth was conceivably erected by the piety of shakespeares daughter and son inlaw mr and mrs hall  they exhibit a taste for the mortuary memorial and the queer latin inscription  mrs hall gratified the manes of her poor mother mrs shakespeare with one of the oddest of latin epitaphs 187a  it opens like an epigram in the greek anthology and ends in an unusual strain of christian mysticism  mr hall possesses perhaps arranged for himself a few latin elegiacs as an epitaph  the famous good friend for jesus sake forbear and so on on the stone in the chancel beneath which the sacred dust of shakespeare lies or lay is the first of the last lines written we are told 187b by the author of hamlet  who tells us that shakespeare wrote the four lines of doggerel  is it conceivable that the authority for shakespeares authorship of the doggerel is a tradition gleaned by mr dowdall of queens in 1693 from a parish clerk aged over eighty he sayscriticism makes the clerk twenty years younger 187c  for baconians the lines are bad enough to be the work of william shakspere of stratford  meanwhile in 1649 when wills daughter mrs hall died her epitaph spoke quite respectfully of her fathers intelligence   witty above her sex but thats not all wise to salvation was good mistris hall something of shakespeare was in that but this wholly of him with whom shes now in bliss 187d   thirtythree years after shakespeares death he was still thought witty in stratford  but what could stratford know  milton and charles i were of the same opinion so was suckling and the rest of the generation after shakespeare  but they did not know how should they that bacon or his equivalent was the genuine author of the plays and poems  the secret perhaps so widely spread among the friends of the muses in 1616 was singularly well kept by a set of men rather given to blab as a general rule  i confess to be passing weary of the baconian hatred of will which pursues him beyond his death with sneers and fantastic suspicions about his monument and his grave and asks if he died with a curse upon his lips an imprecation against any man who might move his bones  a mean and vulgar curse indeed 188a  and the authority for the circumstance that he died with a mean and vulgar curse upon his lips  about 1694 a year after mr dowdall in 1693 and eighty years almost after shakespeares death w hall a queens man oxford the w hall perhaps who gave the bodleian aldine ovid with shakespeares signature true or forged to its unknown owner went to stratford and wrote about his pilgrimage to his friend mr thwaites a fellow of queens  mr hall heard the story that shakespeare was the author of the mean and vulgar curse  he adds that there was a great ossuary or bonehouse in the church where all the bones dug up were piled they would load a great number of waggons  not desiring this promiscuity shakespeare wrote the curse in a style intelligible to clerks and sextons for the most part a very ignorant sort of people  if shakespeare did that accommodation of himself to his audience was the last stroke of his wisdom or his wit 189a  of course there is no evidence that he wrote the mean and vulgar curse  that he did is only the pious hope of the baconians and antiwillians  into the question of the alleged portraits of shakespeare i cannot enter  ben spoke well of the engraving prefixed to the first folio but ben as mr greenwood says was anxious to give the folio a good sendoff  the engraving is choicely bad we do not know from what actual portrait if from any it was executed  richard burbage is known to have amused himself with the art of design possibly he tried his hand on a likeness of his old friend and fellowactor  if so he may have succeeded no better than mary stuarts embroiderer oudry in his copy of the portrait of her majesty  that ben jonson was painted by honthorst and others while shakespeare as far as we know was not has nothing to do with the authorship of the plays  ben was a scholar the darling of both universities constantly employed about the court in arranging masques his learning and his scottish blood may have led james i to notice him  ben in his later years was much in society fashionable and literary  he was the father of the literary tribe of ben  thus he naturally sat for his portrait  in the same way george buchanan has and had nothing like the fame of knox  but as a scholar he was of european reputation haunted the court as tutor of his king and was the good pen of the antimarian nobles murray morton and the rest  therefore buchanans portrait was painted while of knox we have only a woodcut done apparently after his death from descriptions for bezas icones  the folio engraving may have no better source  without much minute research it is hard to find authentic portraits of mary stuart and just as in shakespeares case 190a the market in her own day and in the eighteenth century was flooded with mockoriginals not even derived in any case known to me from genuine and authentic contemporary works  one thing is certain about the stratford bust  baconians will believe that dugdales man correctly represented the bust as it was in his time and that the actual bust is of 1748 in spite of proofs of dugdales mans fantastic inaccuracy in spite of the evidence of style and in spite of documentary evidence that the original monument was not to be destroyed and replaced by the actual monument but was merely repaired and beautified painted afresh by a local painter    chapter x  the traditional shakspere    in perusing the copious arguments of the antishakesperean but non baconian mr greenwood i am often tempted in socratic phrase to address him thus  best of men let me implore you first to keep in memory these statements on which you have most eloquently and abundantly insisted namely that society in stratford was not only not literary but was illiterate  next pardon me for asking you to remember that the late sixteenth and the early seventeenth century did not resemble our fortunate age  some people read shakespeares beaumonts and fletchers plays  this exercise is now very rarely practised  but nobody cared to chronicle literary gossip about the private lives and personal traits of these and several other elizabethan and jacobean playwrights in the modern manner  of shakespeare pardon i mean shakspere the actor there is one contemporary anecdote in my poor opinion a baseless waggery  of beaumont there is none  of a handmaid of fletcher who drank sack in a tumbler one anecdote appears at the end of the seventeenth centurynothing better  meanwhile of shakspere the traditions must be sought either at stratford or in connection with the london stage and in both cases the traditions began to be in demand very late  as stratford was not literary indeed was terribly illiterate any traditions that survived cannot conceivably have been literary  that is absolutely certain  natives at stratford had by your own hypothesis scant interest in literary anecdote  fifty years after shakespeares death no native was likely to cherish tales of any sprouts of wit though it was remembered in 1649 that he was witty or any woodnotes wild which he may have displayed or chirped at an early age  such things were of no interest to stratford  if he made a speech when he killed a calf or poached or ran away to town the circumstance might descend from one gaffer to another he might even be remembered as the best of his familythe least inefficient given your nonliterary and illiterate stratford and you can expect nothing more and nothing better than we receive  let me illustrate by a modern example  in 1866 i was an undergraduate of a years standing at balliol college oxford certainly not an unlettered academy  in that year the early and the best poems of a considerable balliol poet were published  he had gone down some eight years before  being young and green i eagerly sought for traditions about mr swinburne  one of his contemporaries who took a first in the final classical schools told me that he was a smug  another that as mr swinburne and his friend later a scotch professor were not cricketers they proposed that they should combine to pay but a single subscription to the cricket club  a third a tutor of the highest reputation as a moralist and metaphysician merely smiled at my early enthusiasm and told me nothing  a whitehaired college servant said that mr swinburne was a very quiet gentleman  then you take us to dirty illiterate stratford from fifty to eighty years after shaksperes deatha civil war and the reign of the saints a restoration and a revolution having intervenedand ask us to be surprised that no anecdotes of shaksperes early brilliance a century before survived at stratford  a very humble parallel may follow  some foolish person went seeking early anecdotes of myself at my native town selkirk on the ettrick from an intelligent townsman he gathered much that was true and interesting about my younger brothers who delighted in horses and dogs hunted shot and fished and played cricket one of them bowled for gloucestershire and oxford  but about me the inquiring literary snipe only heard that andra was aye the stupid ane o the famly  yet i too had bowled for the local club non sine gloria  even that was forgotten  try to remember best of men that literary anecdotes of a fellow townsmans youth do not dwell in the memories of his neighbours from sixty to a hundred years after date  it is not in human nature that what was incomprehensible to the grandsire should be remembered by the grandson  go to thrums and ask for literary memories of the youth of mr barrie  yet 198a the learned malone seems to have been sorry that little of shakespeare but the calfkilling and the poaching and the dying of a fever after drink taken where i ask you with ben and drayton was remembered so long after date at stratford of all dirty ignorant places  bah how could these people have heard of drayton and ben  remember that we are dealing with human nature in a peculiarly malodorous and densely ignorant bourgade where however the wit of shakespeare was not forgotten in the family in 1649 see the epithet on the tomb of his daughter mrs hall  you give us the rev john ward vicar of stratford 16613 who has heard that the actor was a natural wit and contracted and died of a fever after a bout with drayton and ben  i can scarcely believe that these were local traditions  how could these rustauds have an opinion about natural wit how could they have known the names of ben and drayton  when you come to aubrey publishing in 1680 sixty years after shakespeares death you neglect to trace the steps in the descent of his tradition  as has been stated beeston the chronicle of the stage died 1682 gave him the story of the schoolmastering beeston being the son of a servitor of phillips an actor and friend of shakespeare who died eleven years before that player  the story of the schoolmastering and of shakespeare knowing latin pretty well is of no value to me  i think that he had some knowledge of latin as he must have had if he were what i fancy him to have been and if which is mere hypothesis he went for four years to a latin school  but the story does not suit you and you call it a mere myth which of course will be believed by those who wish to believe it  but most excellent of mortals will it not by parity of reasoning of course be disbelieved by those who do not wish to believe it  and do you want to believe it  to several stage anecdotes of the actor as an excellent instructor of younger players you refer slightingly  they do not weigh with me still the stage would remember shakspere or shakespeare best in stage affairs  in reference to a very elliptic statement that in hamlet betterton benefited by shakespeares coaching you write this is astonishing seeing that shakspere had been in his grave nearly twenty years when betterton was born  the explanation is that taylor of the black fryars company was according to sir william davenant instructed by shakspere and davenant who had seen taylor act according to downes instructed betterton  there is a similar story about betterton playing king henry viii  betterton was said to have been instructed by sir william who was instructed by lowen who was instructed by shakspere 200a  why a note of exclamation  who was downes and what were his opportunities of acquiring information  he was for many years book keeper in the dukes company first under davenant in the old house      davenant was notoriously the main link between the first and second temple the theatre of shakespeare whom as a boy he knew and the restoration theatre  devoted to the traditions of the stage he collected shakespearean and other anecdotes he revived the theatre cautiously during the last years of puritan rule and told his stories to the players of the early restoration  as his book keeper with the duke of yorks company downes heard what davenant had to tell he also for his roscius anglicanus had notes from charles booth prompter at drury lane  on may 28 1663 davenant reproduced hamlet with young betterton as the prince of denmark davenant says charles booth had seen the part taken by taylor of the black fryars company and taylor had been instructed by the author not bacon but mr william shakespeare and davenant taught mr betterton in every particle of it  mr elton adds we cannot be sure that taylor was taught by shakespeare himself  he is believed to have been a member of the kings company before 1613 and to have left it for a time before shakespeares death 201a  his name is in the list in the folio of the principall actors in all these plays but i cannot pretend to be certain that he played in them in wills time  it is mr pepys december 30 1668 who chronicles davenants splendid revival of henry viii in which betterton as the king was instructed by sir william davenant who had it from old mr lowen that had his instruction from mr shakespear himself  lowin or lowen joined shakespeares company in 1604 being then a man of twentyeight  burbage was the natural man for hamlet and henry viii but it is not unusual for actors to have understudies  the stage is notoriously tenacious of such traditions  when we come with you to mr w fulman about 1688 and the additions to his notes made about 16901708 we are concerned with evidence much too remote and in your own classical style all this is just a little mixed 201b  with what mr dowdall heard in 1693 and mr william hall 1694 heard from a clerk or sexton or other illiterate dotard at stratford i have already dealt  i do not habitually believe in what i hear from the oldest aunt telling the saddest taleno not even if she tells a ghost story or an anecdote about the presentation by queen mary of her portrait to the ancestor of the lairdthe portrait being dated 1768 and representing her majesty in the bloom of girlhood  nor do i care for what rowe said on bettertons information in 1709 about shakespeares schooling nor for what dr furnivall said that plume wrote nor for what anybody said that sir john mennes menzies said  but i do care for what ben jonson and shakespeares fellowactors said and for what his literary contemporaries have left on record  but this evidence you explain away by aetiological guesses absolutely modern and i conceive to anyone familiar with historical inquiry not more valuable as history than other explanatory myths  what will shakspere had to his literary credit when he died was mens impressions of the seeing of his acted plays with their knowledge if they had any of fugitive cheap perishable and often bad reprints in quartos of about half of the plays  men also had venus and adonis lucrece and the sonnets which sold very poorly and i do not wonder at it  of the genius of shakespeare england could form no conception till the publication of the folio 1623 not in a large edition it struggled into a third edition in 1664 the engouement about the poet the search for personal details did not manifest itself with any vigour till nearly thirty years after 1664and we are to wonder that the gleanings at illiterate stratford and in stage tradition are so scanty and so valueless what could have been picked up by 168090 about bacon at gorhambury or in the courts of law i wonder    chapter xi  the first folio    the first folio is the name commonly given to the first collected edition of shakespeares plays  the volume includes a preface signed by two of the actors heminge and condell panegyrical verses by ben jonson and others and a bad engraved portrait  the book has been microscopically examined by baconians hunting for cyphered messages from their idol in italics capital letters misprints and everywhere  their various discoveries do not win the assent of writers like the late lord penzance and mr greenwood  the mystery as to the sources editing and selection of plays in the folio 1623 appears to be impenetrable  the titlepage says that all the contents are published according to the true original copies  if only ms copies are meant this is untrue in some cases the best quartos were the chief source supplemented by mss  the baconians following malone think that ben jonson wrote the preface and certainly it looks like his work 207a speaking in the name of the two actors who sign it  they say that shakespeares friends have collected and published the plays have so published them that whereas you were abusd with divers stolne and surreptitious copies maimed and deformed by the frauds and stealthes of injurious impostors that exposed them  even those namely the pieces previously illproduced by pirates are now offered to your view curd and perfect of their limbes and all the rest that is all the plays which had not been piratically debased absolute in their numbers as he conceived them  so obscure is the preface that not all previously published separate plays are explicitly said to be stolen and deformed but divers stolen copies are denounced  mr pollard makes the same point in shakespeare folios and quartos p 2 1909  now as a matter of fact while some of the quarto editions of separate plays are very bad texts others are so good that the folio sometimes practically reprints them with some tinkerings from manuscripts  some quartos like that of hamlet of 1604 are excellent and how they came to be printed from good texts and whether or not the texts were given to the press by shakespeares company or were sold or stolen is the question  mr pollard argues on grounds almost certain that we have strong prima facie evidence that the sale to publishers of plays afterwards duly entered on the stationers registers was regulated by their lawful owners 208a  the preface does not explicitly deny that some of the separately printed texts were good but says that divers of them were stolen and deformed  my view of the meaning of the preface is not generally held  dr h h furness in his preface to much ado about nothing p vi says we all know that these two friends of shakespeare assert in their preface to the folio that they had used the authors manuscripts and in the same breath denounce the quartos as stolen and surreptitious  i cannot see i repeat that the preface denounces all the quartos  it could be truly said that divers stolen and maimed copies had been foisted on abused purchasers and really no more is said  dr furness writes when we now find them using as copy one of these very quartos much ado about nothing 1600 we need not impute to them a wilful falsehood if we suppose that in using what they knew had been printed from the original text howsoever obtained they held it to be the same as the manuscript itself      that was their meaning i think the quarto of much ado had not been maimed and deformed as divers other quartos stolen and surreptitious had been  shakspere unlike most of the other playwrights was a member of his company  i presume that his play was thus the common good of his company and himself  if they sold a copy to the press the price would go into their common stock unless they in good will allowed the author to pocket the money  it will be observed that i understand the words of the preface otherwise than do the distinguished editors of the cambridge edition they write the natural inference to be drawn from this statement in the preface is that all the separate editions of shakespeares plays were stolen surreptitious and imperfect and that all those published in the folio were printed from the authors own manuscripts my italics  the editors agree with dr furness not with mr pollard whose learned opinion coincides with my own  perhaps it should be said that i reached my own construction of the sense of this passage in the preface by the light of nature before mr pollards valuable book based on the widest and most minute research came into my hands  by the results of that research he backs his opinion and mine that some of the quartos are surreptitious and bad while others are good and were honestly obtained 210a  the preface never denies this never says that all the quartos contain maimed and disfigured texts  the preface draws a distinction to this effect even those even the stolen and deformed copies are now cured and perfect in their limbsthat is have been carefully edited while all the rest are absolute in their numbers as he conceived them  this does not allege that all the rest are printed from shakespeares own holograph copies  among the plays spoken of as all the rest namely those not hitherto published and not deformed by the fraudulent are tempest two gentlemen measure for measure comedy of errors as you like it alls well twelfth night winters tale henry vi iii henry viii coriolanus timon julius caesar macbeth antony and cleopatra and cymbeline  also henry vi i ii king john and taming of the shrew appeared now in other form than in the hitherto published quartos bearing these or closely similar names  we have moreover no previous information as to the shrew timon julius caesar alls well and henry viii  the preface adds the remarkable statement that whatever shakespeare thought he uttered with that easinesse that wee have scarce received from him a blot in his papers  it is plain that the many dramas previously unpublished could only be recovered from manuscripts of one sort or another because they existed in no other form  the preface takes it for granted that the selected manuscripts contain the plays absolute in their numbers as he conceived them  but the preface does not commit itself i repeat to the statement that all of these many plays are printed from shakespeares own handwriting  after as he conceived them it goes on who as he was a most happy imitator of nature was a most gentle expresser of it  his mind and hand went together  and what he thought he uttered with that easiness that we have scarce received from him a blot in his papers  this may be meant to suggest but does not affirm that the actors have all the rest of the plays in shakespeares own handwriting they may have or may have had some of his manuscripts and believed that other manuscripts accessible to them and used by them contain his very words  whether from cunning or design or from the elizabethan inability to tell a plain tale plainly the authors or author of the preface have everywhere left themselves loopholes and ways of evasion and escape  it is not possible to pin them down to any plain statement of facts concerning the sources for the hitherto unpublished plays the rest of the plays  these at least were from manuscript sources which the actors thought accurate and some may have been fair copies in shakespeares own hand scott as regards his novels sent his prima cura his first writing down to the press and his pages are nearly free from blot or erasion  in one case at least shelleys first draft of a poem is described as like a marsh of reeds in water with wild ducks but he made very elegant fair copies for the press  let it be supposed that ben jonson wrote all this preface in accordance with the wishes and instructions of the two actors who sign it  he took their word for the almost blotless mss which they received from shakespeare  he remarks in his posthumously published discoveries notes memories brief essays i remember the players have often mentioned it as an honour to shakespeare that in his writing whatsoever he penned he never blotted out a line  and ben gives we shall later see his habitual reply to this habitual boast  as to the sources of such plays as had been maimed and deformed by injurious impostors and are now offered curd and perfect of their limbs it can be proved to demonstration say the cambridge editors that several plays in the folio were printed from earlier quarto editions but the players secured a retreat on this point and that in other cases the quarto is more correctly printed or from a better manuscript than the folio text and therefore of higher authority  hamlet in the folio of 1623 when it differs from the quarto of 1604 differs for the worse in fortyseven places while it differs for the better in twenty places  can the wit of man suggest any other explanation than that the editing of the folio was carelessly done out of the best quartos and mss in the theatre for acting purposes andif the players did not lie in what they often said and if they kept the originalsout of some mss received from shakspere  whether the two players themselves threw into the press after some hasty botchings whatever materials they had or whether they employed an editor a very wretched editor or editors or whether the great author bacon himself was his own editor the preparation of a text was infamously done  the two actors probably i think never read through the proofsheets and took the word of the man whom they employed to edit their materials for gospel  the editing of the folio is so exquisitely careless that twelve printers errors in a quarto of 1622 of richard iii appear in the folio of 1623  again the merry wives of the folio is nearly twice as long as the quarto of 1619 yet keeps old errors  how can we explain the reckless retention of errors and also the large additions and improvements  did the true author bacon or bungay now edit his work add much matter and go wrong fortyseven times where the quarto was right and go right twenty times when the quarto was wrong  did he for the folio of 1623 nearly double the merry wives in extent and also leave all the errors of the fourth quarto uncorrected  in that case how negligent was bacon of his immortal works  now bacon was a scholar and this absurd conduct cannot be imputed i hope to him  mr pollard is much more lenient than his fellowscholars towards the editor or editors of the folio  he concludes that manuscript copies of the plays were easily procurable  sixteen out of the thirtysix plays existed in quartos  eight of the sixteen were not used for the folio five were used with additions corrections or alterations which must have been made from manuscripts  three quartos only were reprinted as they stood  the editors greatly preferred to use manuscript copies and showed this mr pollard thinks by placing plays never before printed in the most salient parts of the three sets of dramas in their book 215a  they did make an attempt to divide their plays into acts and scenes whereas the quartos as a general rule had been undivided  but the editors i must say had not the energy to carry out their good intentions fullyor bacon or bungay if the author wearied in welldoing  the work is least ill done in the comedies and grows worse and worse as the editor or bacon or bungay becomes intolerably slack  a great living author who had a decent regard for his own works could never have made or passed this slovenly folio  yet mr greenwood argues that probably bungay was still alive and active after shakspere was dead and buried  mr greenwood of course does not speak of bungay which i use as short for his great unknown thus richard iii from 1597 to 1622 appeared in six quartos  it is immensely improved in the folio and so are several other plays  who made the improvements which the editors could only obtain in manuscripts  if we say that shakespeare made them in ms mr greenwood asks what had he to work upon since after selling his plays to his company he did not preserve his manuscript 216a now i do not know that he did sell his plays to his company  we are sure that will got money for them but we do not know what arrangement he made with his company  he may have had an authors rights in addition to a sum down as later was customary and he had his regular share in the profits  nor am i possessed of information that he did not preserve his manuscript  how can we know that  he may have kept his first draft he may have made a fair copy for himself as well as for the players or may have had one made  he may have worked on a copy possessed by the players and the publisher of the quartos of 1605 1612 1622 may not have been allowed to use or may not have asked for the latest manuscript revised copy  the richard iii of the folio contains with much new matter the printers errors of the quarto of 1622  i would account for this by supposing that the casual editor had just sense enough to add the new parts in a revised manuscript to the quarto and was far too lazy to correct the printers errors in the quarto  but mr greenwood asks whether the natural conclusion is not that some person unknown took the quarto of 1622 revised it added the new passages and thus put it into the form in which it appeared in 1623  this natural conclusion means that the author bungay was alive in 1622 and put his additions and improvements of recent date into the quarto of 1622 but never took the trouble to correct the errors in the quarto and so on in other plays similarly treated  is it not a more natural conclusion that shakespeare bungay himself revised its publication and that some part of this revision at any rate was done after 1616 and before 1623 217a  mr greenwood after criticising other systems writes 217b there is of course another hypothesis  it is that shakespeare meaning the real author did not die in 1616 and here follows the usual notion that shakespeare was the nom de plume of that transcendent genius moving in court circles among the highest of his day as assuredly shakespeare must have movedwho wished to conceal his identity  i have not the shadow of assurance that the author moved in court circles though will would see a good deal when he played at court and in the houses of nobles before eliza and our james  i never moved in court circles  mr greenwood must know them better than i do and i have explained see loves labours lost and shakespeare genius and society how will picked up his notions of courtly ways  another hypothesis the baconian hypothesisnom de plume and allmr greenwood thinks an extremely reasonable one  i cannot easily conceive of one more unreasonable  supposing that there was such an author as i have suggested he may well have conceived the idea of publishing a collected edition of the plays which had been written under the name of shakespeare and being himself busy with other matters he may have entrusted the business to some literary man to some good pen who was at the time doing work for him and why not to the man who wrote the commendatory verses the lines to the reader opposite to the engraving and as seems certain the preface to the great variety of readers 218a  that man that good pen was ben jonson  on the supposing of mr greenwood ben is doing work for the great unknown at the time when the business following on the idea of publishing a collected edition of the plays which had been written under the name of shakespeare occurred to the illustrious but unknown owner of that nom de plume  in plain words of my ownthe author may have entrusted the business and what was that business if not the editing of the folioto ben jonsonwho was at the time doing work for himfor the author  here is a clue  we only need to know for what man of transcendent genius universal culture worldwide philosophy    moving in court circles and so on ben was working about 16213 the folio appearing in 1623  the heart beats with anticipation of a discovery  on january 22 1621 bacon celebrated his sixtieth birthday with great state at york house  jonson was present and wrote an ode with something about the genius of the house lar or brownie   thou standst as if some mystery thou didst   mr greenwood does not know what this can mean nor do i 219a  jonson it appears on what authority was bacons guest at gorhambury and was one of those good pens of whom bacon speaks as assisting him in the translation of some of his books into latin  bacon writing to toby mathew june 26 1623 mentions the help of some good pens ben jonson he does not mention  but judge webb does  it is an undoubted fact says judge webb that the latin of the de augmentis which was published in 1623 was the work of jonson 219b  to whom mr collins replies there is not a particle of evidence that jonson gave to bacon the smallest assistance in translating any of his works into latin 219c  tres bien on judge webbs assurance the person for whom ben was working in 1623 was bacon  meanwhile mr greenwoods supposing is that there was such an author of transcendent genius and so on who may have entrusted the editing of his collected plays to some good pen who was at the time doing work for him and why not toben jonson 220a  now the man for whom ben in 1623 was doing workwas baconso judge webb says 220b  therefore by this hypothesis of mr greenwood 220c the great unknown was baconjust the hypothesis of the common baconian  is my reasoning erroneous  is the supposing suggested by mr greenwood 220d any other than that of miss delia bacon and judge webb  true mr greenwoods baconian supposing is only a working hypothesis  not a confirmed belief  but it is useful to his argument see ben jonson and shakespeare when he wants to explain away bens evidence in his verses in the folio to the stratford actor as the author  mr greenwood writes in the first page of his preface  it is no part of my plan or intention to defend that theory the baconian theory  apparently it pops out contrary to the intention of mr greenwood  but pop out it does  at least i can find no flaw in the reasoning of my detection of bacon  i see no way out of it except this  after recapitulating what is said about ben as one of bacons good pens with other details mr greenwood says but no doubt that way madness lies 221a  ah no not madness no but baconism lies that way  however let it be granted as euclid says in his sportsmanlike way that mr greenwood by no means thinks that his concealed poet is bacononly some one similar and similarly situated and still active in 1623 and occupied with other business than supervising a collected edition of plays written under his nom de plume of shakespeare  bacon too was busy with supervising or toiling at the latin translation of his scientific works and ben according to judge webb was busy in turning the advancement of learning into latin prose  mr greenwood quotes without reference archbishop tenison as saying that ben helped bacon in doing his works into latin 221b  tenison is a very late witness  the prophetic soul of bacon did not quite trust english to last as long as latin or he thought latin the lingua franca of europe in his day more easily accessible to foreign students as of course it was  thus bacon was very busy so was ben  the sad consequence of bens business perhaps is that the editing of the folio is notoriously bad whether ben were the editor or not it is infamously bad  conceivably mr greenwood is of the same opinion  he says it stands admitted that a very large part of that volume the folio consists of work that is not shakespeares at all  how strange if ben edited it for the great unknownwho knew if any human being knew what work was shakespeares  on mr greenwoods hypothesis 222a or supposing the unknown author may well have conceived the idea of publishing a collected edition of the plays which had been written not published written under the name of shakespeare and being himself busy with other matters he may have entrusted the business to some good pen and why not toben nevertheless a very large part of that volume consists of work that is not shakespeares at all 222b  how did this occur  the book 222c is that very doubtful canon  how if shakespeares man edited it for shakespeare  did shakespeare not care what stuff was placed under his immortal nom de plume  it is not my fault if i think that mr greenwoods hypotheses 222d the genuine shakespeare either revised his own works or put ben on the editorial taskare absolutely contradicted by his statements in another part of his book 222e  for the genuine shakespeare knew what plays he had written knew what he could honestly put forth as his own as shakespeares  or if he placed the task of editing in bens hands he must have told ben what plays were of his own making  in either case the folio would contain these and no others butthe plat contrairethe very reverseis stated by mr greenwood  it stands admitted that a very large portion of that volume the folio consists of work that is not shakespeares is not bacons or the other mans at all 223a  then away fly the hypotheses 223b that the autoshakespeare or that ben employed by the autoshakespeare apparently bacon revised edited and prepared for publication the autoshakespearean plays  for mr greenwood has already dealt with titus andronicus and henry vi 223c and proved them not to be autoshakespeareanand he adds there are many other plays in that very doubtful canon the folio which by universal admission contain much nonshakespearean composition 223d  perhaps but if so the two hypotheses 223e that either the genuine shakespeare 223f revised is it not a more natural solution that shakespeare himself revised his works for publication and that some part at any rate of this revision 223g was done after 1616 and before 1623 or 223h that he gave ben who was working by the conjecture for bacon the task of editing the folioare annihilated  for neither the autoshakespeare if honest nor ben if sober could have stuffed the folio full of nonshakespearean workincluding four nonshakespearean plays nor could the folio be that very doubtful canon 224a  again if either the autoshakespeare or ben following his instructions were editor neither could have as the folio editor had evidently no little doubt about troilus and cressida 224b  neither ben nor the actual simon pure the author the auto shakespeare could fail to know the truth about trodus and cressida but the editor 224c did not know the truth the whole canon is doubtful  therefore the hypothesis the supposing that the actual author did the revising 224d and the other hypothesis that he gave ben the work 224e seem to me wholly impossible  but mr greenwood needs the supposings of pp 290 293 and as he rejects titus andronicus and henry vi both in the folio he also needs the contradictory views of pp 351 358  on which set of supposings and averments does he stand to win  perhaps he thinks to find a way out of what appears to me to be a dilemma in the following fashion  he will not accept titus andronicus and henry vi though both are in the folio as the work of his shakespeare his unknown the bacon of the baconians  well we ask if your unknown or bacon or beninstructed by bacon or by the unknownedited the folio how could any one of the three insert titus and henry vi and be in no little doubt about troilus and cressida  bacon or the unknown or the editor employed by either knew perfectly well which plays either man could honestly claim as his own work done under the nom de plume of william shakespeare with or without the hyphen  yet the editor of the folio does not knowand mr greenwood does knowhenry vi and titus are wrong ones  mr greenwoods way out if i follow him is this  225a judge stotsenburg asks who wrote the taming of a shrew printed in 1594 and who wrote titus andronicus henry vi or king lear referred to in the diary henslowes  the judge continues  neither collier nor any of the shaxper commentators make sic any claim to their authorship in behalf of william shaxper  since these plays have the same names as those included in the folio of 1623 the presumption is that they are the same plays until the contrary is shown  of course it may be shown either that those in the folio are entirely different except in name or that these plays were revised improved and dressed by some one whom they who called shakespeare  mr greenwood says my own conviction is that    these plays were revised improved and dressed by some one whom they called shakespeare 226a  whom who called shakespeare  in that case these playssay titus andronicus and henry vi part 1which mr greenwood denies to his shakespeare were just as much his shakespeares plays as any other plays and there are several which his shakespeare revised improved and dressed  yet his shakespeare is not author of henry vi 226b not the author of titus andronicus 226c  mr anders writes mr greenwood makes what i think to be a great error in citing henry vi and titus as genuine plays of shakespeare 226d  he hammers at this denial in nineteen references in his index to titus andronicus  yet ben or bacon or the unknown thought that these plays were genuine plays of shakespeare the concealed authorbacon or mr greenwoods man  it appears that the immense poet who used the nom de plume of shakespeare did not know the plays of which he could rightfully call himself the author that not foreseeing mr greenwoods constantly repeated objections he boldly annexed four plays or two certainly which mr greenwood denies to him and another about which the folio editor was in no little doubt  finally 227a mr greenwood is convinced it is my conviction that some plays which he often denies to his shakespeare were revised improved and dressed by some one whom they called shakespeare  that some one if he edited or caused to be edited the folio thought that his revision improvement and dressing up of the plays gave him a right to claim their authorshipand mr greenwood a dozen times and more denies to him their authorship  one is seriously puzzled to discover the critics meaning  the taming of a shrew titus henry vi and king lear referred to in henslowes diary are not shakespearean we are repeatedly told but my own conviction is that     these plays were revised improved and dressed by some one whom they called shakespeare  but to be revised improved and dressed by some one whom they called shakespeare is to be as truly shakespearean work as is any play so handled by shakespeare  thus the plays mentioned are as truly shakespearean as any others in which shakespeare worked on an earlier canvas and also titus is not shakespearean at all  mr greenwood i repeat constantly denies the shakespearean character to titus and henry vi  the conclusion of the whole matter is that titus and the trilogy of henry vi are not the work of shakespeare that his hand is probably not to be found at all in titus and only once or twice if at all in henry vi part i but that he it probably was who altered and remodelled the two parts of the old contention of the houses of york and lancaster thereby producing henry vi parts ii and iii 228a  yet 228b titus and henry vi appear as revised improved and dressed by the mysterious some one whom they called shakespeare if mr greenwoods conclusion 228c be correct shakespeare had no right to place henry vi part i and titus in his folio  if his conviction 228d be correct shakespeare had as good a right to them as to any of the plays which he revised and improved and dressed  they must be shakespearean if mr greenwood is right 228e in his suggestion that shakespeare either revised his works for publication between 1616 and 1623 or set his man ben jonson upon that business  yet neither one nor the other knew what to make of troilus and cressida  the folio editor had evidently no little doubt about that play 228f  so neither shakespeare nor ben instructed by him can have been the folio editor  consequently mr greenwood must abandon his suggestion that either man was the editor and may return to his rejection of titus and henry vi part i  but he clings to it  he finds in henslowes diary references to and records of the writing of such plays as among others titus andronicus and henry vi 229a  mr greenwood after rejecting a theory of some one says far more likely does it appear that there was a great man of the time whose genius was capable of transforming dross into gold who took these plays and in great part rewrote and revised them leaving sometimes more and sometimes less of the original work and that so rewritten revised and transformed they appeared as the plays of shakespeare 229b  this statement is made 229c about these plays including titus andronicus and henry vi while 229d titus and the trilogy of henry vi are not the work of shakespeare    his hand is probably not to be found at all in titus and only once or twice in henry vi part i though he probably made parts ii and iii out of older plays  i do not know where to have the critic  if henry vi part i and titus are in no sense by shakespeare then neither shakespeare nor ben for him edited or had anything to do with the editing of the folio  if either or both had to do with the editing as the critic suggests then he is wrong in denying shakespearean origin to titus and henry vi part i  of course one sees a way out of the dilemma for the great auto shakespeare himself who by one hypothesis handed over the editing of his plays to ben he by mr greenwoods supposing was deviling at literary jobs for bacon  the autoshakespeare merely tells ben to edit his plays and never even gives him a list of them  then ben brings him the folio and the author looks at the list of plays  mr jonson he says i have hitherto held thee for an honest scholar and a deserving man in the quality thou dost profess  but thou hast brought me a maimed and deformed printed copy of that which i did write for my own recreation not wishful to be known for so light a thing as a poet  moreover thou hast placed among these my trifles four plays to which i never put a finger and others in which i had no more than a thumb  the seneschal mr jonson will pay thee what is due to thee thy fardels shall be sent whithersoever thou wilt and mary  mr jonson i bid thee never more be officer of mine  this painful discourse must have been held at gorhamburyif ben edited the foliofor francis  it is manifest i hope that about the folio mr greenwood speaks with two voices and these very discordant  it is also manifest that whoever wrote the plays left his materials in deep neglect and that when they were collected some one gathered them up in extreme disorder  it is extraordinary that the baconians and mr greenwood do not see the fallacy of their own reasoning in this matter of the folio  they constantly ridicule the old view that the actor will shakspere if by miracle he were the author of the plays could have left them to take their fortunes  they are asked what did other playwrights do in that age  they often parted with their whole copyright to the actors of this or that company or to henslowe  the new owners could alter the plays at will and were notoriously anxious to keep them out of print lest other companies should act them  as mr greenwood writes 231a such we are told was the universal custom with dramatists of the day they kept no copies of their plays and thought no more about them  it will i suppose be set down to fanaticism that i should doubt the truth of this proposition that i doubt if it be consonant with the known facts of human nature  but whom except jonson does mr greenwood find editing and publishing his plays  beaumont fletcher heywood  no  if the great unknown were dead in 1623 his negligence was as bad as wills  if he were alive and revised his own work for publication 231b he did it as the office cat might have done it in hours of play  if on the other side he handed the editorial task over to ben 232a then he did not even give ben a list of his genuine works  mr greenwood cites the case of ben jonson a notorious and i think solitary exception  ben was and often proclaimed himself to be essentially a scholar  he took as much pains in prefacing editing and annotating his plays as he would have taken had the texts been those of greek tragedians  finally all baconians cry out against the sottish behaviour of the actor will if being really the author of the plays he did not bestir himself and bring them out in a collected edition  yet no english dramatist ventured on doing such a thing till ben thus collected his works and was laughed at in 1616  the example might have encouraged will to be up and doing but he died early in 1616  if will were not the author what care was bacon or the unknown taking of his many manuscript plays and for the proper editing of those which had appeared separately in pamphlets  as indolent and casual as will the great author bacon or another left the plays to take their chances  mr greenwood says that if the author bacon or somebody very like him had been careless about keeping copies of his manuscripts     232b  what an if in the case of the great author  this gross neglect infamous in will may thus have been practised by the great unknown himself  in 1911 mr greenwood writes there is overwhelming authority for the view that titus andronicus is not shakespearean at all 233a in that case neither bacon nor the unknown nor ben acting for either can have been the person who put titus into the folio    chapter xii  ben jonson and shakespeare    the evidence of ben jonson to the identity of shakespeare the author with shakspere the actor is the strength of the stratfordian faith says mr greenwood  but i think it will be admitted that the various jonsonian utterances with regard to shakespeare are by no means easy to reconcile one with the other 237a  it is difficult to reply briefly to mr greenwoods fortyseven pages about the evidence of jonson  but first whenever in written words or in reported conversation ben speaks of shakespeare by name he speaks of his works  in 1619 to drummond of hawthornden in 1623 in commendatory verses to the folio while about 1630 probably in his posthumously published discourses he writes on shakespeare as the friend and fellow of the players on shakespeare as his own friend and as a dramatist  on each of these three occasions bens tone varies  in 1619 he said no more to drummond of hawthornden apparently on two separate occasions than that shakespeare lacked art and made the mistake about a wreck on the seacoast of bohemia  in 1619 ben spoke gruffly and briefly of shakespeare as to drummond he also spoke disparagingly of beaumont whom he had panegyrised in an epigram in his own folio of 1616 and was again to praise in the commendatory verses in the folio  he spoke still more harshly of drayton whom in 1616 he had compared to homer virgil theocritus and tyraeus  he told an unkind anecdote of marston with whom he had first quarrelled and then made friends collaborating with him in a play and very generously and to his great peril sharing his imprisonment  to drummond jonson merely said that he beat marston and took away his pistol  of sir john beaumont brother of the dramatist ben had written a most hyperbolical eulogy in verse luckily for sir john to drummond ben did not speak of him  such was ben in panegyric verse hyperbolical in conversation a despiser of others and praiser of himself  compare bens three remarks about donne all made to drummond  donne deserved hanging for breaking metre donne would perish for not being understood  and donne was in some points the first of living poets  mr greenwoods effort to disable jonsons evidence rests on the contradictions in his estimates of shakespeares poetry in notices scattered through some thirty years  jonson it is argued cannot on each occasion mean will  he must now mean will now the great unknown and nowboth at once  yet i have proved that ben was the least consistent of critics all depended on the occasion and on his humour at the moment  this is a commonplace of literary history the baconians do not know it mr greenwood if he knows it ignores it and bases his argument on facts which may be unknown to his readers  we have noted bens words of 1619 and touched on his panegyric of 1623  thirdly about 1630 probably ben wrote in his manuscript book discourses an affectionate but critical page on shakespeare as a man and an author  always in prose and in verse and in recorded conversation ben explicitly identified shakspere william of stratford with the author of the plays usually ascribed to him  but the baconian judge webb in extreme old age and the antishakespearean mr greenwood and others choose to interpret bens words on the theory that in 1623 he had his tongue in his cheek that like odysseus he mingled things false with true that they know what is true from what is false and can undo the many knots which ben tied in his tongue  how they succeed we shall see  in addition to his three known mentions of shakespeare by name 1619 1623 1630 ben certainly appears to satirise his rival at a much earlier date especially as pantalabus a playwright in the poetaster 1601 and as actor poet and plagiarist in an epigram poetape published in his collected works of 1616 but probably written as early as 1602  it is well known that in 1598 shakespeares company acted bens every man in his humour  it appears that he conceived some grudge against the actors and apparently against shakespeare and other playwrights for in 1601 his poetaster is a satire both on playwrights and on actors whom he calls apes  the apparent attacks on shakespeare are just such as ben if angry and envious would direct against him while we know of no other poetplayer of the period to whom they could apply  for example in the poetaster histrio the actor is advised to ingratiate himself with pantalabus gentman parcelpoet his father was a man of worship i tell thee this is perhaps unmistakably a blow at shakespeare who had recently acquired for his father and himself arms and the pleasure of writing himself gentleman  this parcelpoet gentman pens lofty in a new stalking stylehe is thus an author he pens and in a high style  he is called pantalabus from the greek words for to take up all which means that as poet he is a plagiarist  jonson repeats this charge in his verses called poetape    he takes up all makes each mans wit his own and told of this he slights it   in a scene added to the poetaster in 1616 the author ben is advised not   with a sad and serious verse to wound pantalabus railing in his saucy jests   and obviously slighting the charges of plagiarism  perhaps ben is glancing at shakespeare who if accused of plagiary by an angry rival would merely laugh  a reply to the poetaster namely satiromastix by dekker and marston introduces jonson himself as babbling darkly about mr justice shallow and an innocent moor othello  here is question of administering strong pills to jonson then   what lumps of hard and indigested stuff of bitter satirism of arrogance of selflove of detraction of a black and stinking insolence should we fetch up   this pill is a reply to bens purge for the poets in his poetaster  oh the sad old stuff  referring to jonsons poetaster and to satiromastix the counter attack we find a passage in the cambridge play the return from parnassus about 1602  burbage the tragic actor and kempe the lowcomedy man of shakespeares company are introduced discussing the possible merits of cambridge wits as playwrights  kempe rejects them as they smell too much of that writer ovid and that writer metamorphosis      the purpose of course is to laugh at the ignorance of the lowcomedy man who thinks metamorphosis a writer and does not suspecthow should hethat shakespeare smells of ovid  kempe innocently goes on why heres our fellow comrade shakespeare puts them all down all the university playwrights aye and ben jonson too  o that ben jonson is a pestilent fellow he brought up horace in the poetaster giving the poets a pill but our fellow shakespeare hath given him a purge      the cambridge author perhaps is thinking of the pill not purge which in satiromastix might be administered to jonson  the cambridge author may have thought that shakespeare wrote the passage on the pill which was to fetch up masses of bens insolence self love arrogance and detraction  if this be not the sequence of ideas it is not easy to understand how or why kempe is made to say that shakespeare has given jonson a purge  stupid old nonsense there are other more or less obscure indications of jonsons spite during the stagequarrel against shakespeare but the most unmistakable proof lies in his verses in poetape  i am aware that bens intention here to hit at shakespeare has been denied for example by mr collins with his usual vigour of language  but though i would fain agree with him the object of attack can be no known person save will  jonson was already in the poetaster using the term poetape for he calls the actors at large apes  jonson thought so well of his rhymes that he included them in the epigrams of his first folio 1616  by that date the year of shakespeares death if he really loved shakespeare as he says in verse and prose ben might have suppressed the verses  but as drummond noted he preferred his jest such as it was to his friend who was not as usually understood a man apt to resent a very blunt shaft of very obsolete wit  like moliere shakespeare had outlived the charge of plagiarism made long ago by the jealous ben  poetape is an actorplaywright that would be thought our chief words which by 1601 could only apply to shakespeare there was no rival save ben near his throne  the playwrightactor too has now confessedly      grown to a little wealth and credit in the scene   of no other actorplaywright could this be said  he is the author of works jonson was laughed at for calling his own plays works but these works are the frippery of wit that is a tissue of plagiarisms as in the case of pantalabus  but told of this he slights it as most successful authors when accused as they often are of plagiarism by jealous rivals wisely doso did moliere  this poetape began his career by picking and gleaning and buying reversions of old plays  this means that shakespeare did work over earlier plays which his company had acquired or if shakespeare did notthen i presumebacon did  that with much bad humour is the gist of the rhymes on poetape ben thinks shakespeares works very larcenous but still the works as such are those of the poetactor  i hope it is now clear that poetape who like pantalabus takes up all who has grown to a little wealth and credit in the scene and who thinks himself the chief of contemporary dramatists can be nobody but shakespeare  hence it follows that the works of poetape are the works of shakespeare  ben admits nay asserts the existence of the works says that they may reach the aftertime but he calls them a mass of plagiarismsbecause he is in a jealous rage  but this view does not at all suit mr greenwood for it shows ben regarding shakespeare as the ape or actor and also as the poet and author of the works  yet bens words mean nothing if not that an actor is the author of works which ben accuses of plagiarism  mr greenwood thinks that the epigram proves merely that jonson looked upon shakspere if indeed he refers to him as one who put forward the writings of others as his own or in plain english an impostor  the work which goes in his name is in truth the work of somebody else 244a  mr greenwood put the same interpretation on greenes words about shakescene and we showed that the interpretation was impossible  the utmost we should be entitled to say if shakescene be meant for shakspere is that greene accuses player shakspere of putting forward as his own some work or perhaps some parts of a work for which he was really indebted to another 245a  we proved by quoting greenes words that he said nothing which could be tortured into this sense 245b  in the same way bens words cannot be tortured into the sense that the work which goes in his poetapes name is in truth the work of somebody else 245c  mr greenwood tries to find the antiwillian hypothesis in greenes groatsworth of wit and in bens epigram  it is in neither  jonson is not accusing shakespeare of pretending to be the author of plays written by somebody else but of making each mans wit his own and the men are the other dramatists of the day  thus the future may judge shakespeares work to be his as well as ours  it is we the living and recognised dramatists whom shakespeare is said to plagiarise from so boldly that   we the robbed leave rage and pity it   ben does not mean that shakespeare is publishing as his own whole plays by some other author but that his works are tissues of scraps stolen from his contemporaries from us the robbed  where are to be found or heard of any works by a playerpoet of 1601 the wouldbe chief dramatist of the day except those signed william shakc there are none and thus ben at this date is identifying will shakspere the actor with the author of the shakespearean plays which he expects to reach posterity after times may judge them to be his as after times do to this hour  thus ben expresses in accordance with his humour on each occasion most discrepant opinions of wills works but he never varies from his identification of will with the author of the plays  the works of which ben wrote so splenetically in poetape were the works of a playwrightactor who could be nobody but the actor shakespeare as far as ben then knew  if later and in altered circumstances he wrote of the very same works in very different terms his utterances are not easily reconcilable with each otherwhoever the real author of the works may be  if bacon or mr greenwoods anonymous equivalent for bacon were the author and if ben came to know it his attitudes towards the works are still as irreconcilable as ever  perhaps baconians and mr greenwood might say as long as ben believed that the works were those of an actorplaywright he thought them execrable  but when he learned that they were the works of bacon or of some great one he declared them to be more than excellentbut not to drummond  i am reluctant to think that jonson was the falsest and meanest of snobs  i think that when his old rival by his own account his dear friend was dead and when 1623 ben was writing panegyric verses about the first collected edition of his plays the folio then between generosity and his habitual hyperbolical manner when he was composing commendatory verses he saidnot too much in the way of praisebut a good deal more than he later said 1630 in prose and in cold blood  i am only taking ben as i find him and as i understand him  every step in my argument rests on wellknown facts  ben notoriously in his many panegyric verses wrote in a style of inflated praise  in conversation with drummond he censured in brief blunt phrases the men whom in verse he had extolled  the baconian who has not read all bens panegyrics in verse and the whole of his conversations with drummond argues in ignorance  we now come to bens panegyrics in the folio of 1623  ben heads the lines   to the memory of my beloved the author mr william shakespeare and what he hath left us   words cannot be more explicit  bacon was alive i do not know when mr greenwoods hidden genius died and ben goes on to speak of the author shakespeare as dead and buried  he calls on him thus      soul of the age the applause delight the wonder of our stage my shakespear rise  i will not lodge thee by chaucer or spenser or bid beaumont lie a little further to make thee a room thou art a monument without a tomb and art alive still while thy book doth live and we have wits to read and praise to give   beaumont by the way died in the same year as shakespeare 1616 and while ben here names him with chaucer spenser and shakespeare his contemporaries have left no anecdotes no biographical hints  in the panegyric follow the lines   and though thou hadst small latin and less greek from thence to honour thee i would not seek for names but call forth thundring aeschylus   and the other glories of the roman and attic stage to see and hear how shakespeare bore comparison with all that the classic dramatists did or that did from their ashes come  jonson means despite your lack of greek and latin i would not shrink from challenging the greatest greek and roman tragedians to see how you bear comparison with themselves  mr greenwood and the baconians believe that the author of the plays abounded in latin and greek  in my opinion his classical scholarship must have seemed slight indeed to ben so learned and so vain of his learning  but this is part of a vexed question already examined so far bens verses have brought not a hint to suggest that he does not identify the actor his beloved with the author  nothing is gained when ben in commendatory verses praises thy art whereas speaking to drummond of hawthornden 1619 he said that shakespeare wanted art  ben is not now growling to drummond of hawthornden he is writing a panegyric and applauds shakespeares wellturned and truefiled lines adding that to write a living line a man must sweat and strike the second heat upon the muses anvil  to produce such lines requires labour requires conscious art  so shakespeare had art after all despite what ben had said to drummond  shakespeare lacked art  there is no more in the matter the inconsistency is that of bens humours on two perfectly different occasions now grumbling to drummond and now writing hyperbolically in commendatory verses  but the contrast makes mr greenwood exclaim can anything be more astonishing and at the same time more unsatisfactory than this 249a  can anything be more like ben jonson  did he know the secret of the authorship in 1619  if so why did he say nothing about the plays of the great unknown whom he called shakespeare save what drummond reports want of art ignorance of bohemian geography  or did ben not know the secret till say 1623 and then heap on the very works which he had previously scouted praise for the very quality which he had said they lacked  if so ben was as absolutely inconsistent as before  there is no way out of this dilemma  on neither choice are bens utterances easy to reconcile one with the other except on the ground that ben was ben and his comments varied with his varying humours and occasions i believe that in the commendatory verses ben allowed his muse to carry him up to heights of hyperbolical praise which he never came near in cold blood  he was warmed with the heat of poetic composition and wound up to heights of eulogy though even now he could not forget the small latin and less greek  we now turn to mr greenwoods views about the commendatory verses on mature consideration i say nothing of his remarks on bens couplets about the bad engraved portrait 250a  they are concerned with the supposed original bust as represented in dugdales engraving of 1656  what the baconians hope to make out of the original bust i am quite unable to understand 250b  again i leave untouched some witticisms 250c on jonsons lines about spenser chaucer and beaumont in their tombslines either suggested by or suggestive of others by an uncertain w basse but the evidence of authorship seems somewhat doubtful  how the date is determined i do not know     251a  as mr greenwood knows so little and as the discussion merely adds dust to the dust and fog to the mist of his attempt to disable bens evidence i glance and pass by  then follow these memorable words which i have already discussed   and though thou hadst small latin and less greek     251b   in these memorable words every nonbaconian sees bens opinion about his friends lack of scholarship  according to his own excellent index mr greenwood has already adverted often to these memorable words   1  p 40      if this testimony is to be explained away as not seriously written then are we justified in applying the same methods of interpretation to jonsons other utterances as published in the folio of 1623  but i shall have more to say as to that further on  2  p 88  nothing of importance  3  p 220  quotation from dr johnson  ben who had no imaginable temptation to falsehood wrote the memorable words  but mr greenwood has to imagine a temptation to falsehoodand he does  4  p 222  and we have recognised that jonsons small latin and less greek must be explained away a quotation from somebody  5  p 225  allusion to anecdote of latin latten spoons  6  pp 382 383  some of us some of whom have long looked upon it as axiomatic    that jonsons small latin and less greek if meant to be taken seriously can only be applicable to shakspere of stratford and not to shakespeare that is not to the unknown author  unluckily ben in 1623 is addressing the shade of the sweet swan of avon meaning stratfordonavon  7  the next references in the laudable index are to pp 474 475 then follow these memorable words which i have already discussed   and though thou hadst small latin and less greek   words which those who see how singularly inappropriate they are to the author of the plays and poems of shakespeare have been at such infinite pains to explain away without impeaching the credit of the author or assuming that he is here indulging in a little socratic irony  i do not want to explain bens words away  i want to know how on earth mr greenwood explains them away  my view is that ben meant what he said that will whose shade he is addressing was no scholar which he assuredly was not  i diligently search mr greenwoods scriptures asking how does he explain bens memorable words away on p 106 of the shakespeare problem restated i seem to catch a glimmer of his method  once let the stratfordians every human and nonbaconian person of education admit that jonson when he penned the words small latin and less greek was really writing with his tongue in his cheek      once admit that vulgarism concerning a great english poet engaged on a poem of pindaric flight and of prophetic vision  no we leave the admission to mr greenwood and his allies  to consider thus is to consider too seriously  the baconians and antiwillians have ceased to deserve serious attention if ever they did deserve it and virtuous indignation and all that kind of thing when they ask people who care for poetry to admit that ben wrote his verses with his tongue in his cheek  elsewhere 253a in place of bens tongue in his cheek mr greenwood prefers to suggest that ben is here indulging in a little socratic irony socrates with his tongue in his cheek  say talking through his throat if one may accept the evidence of the author of raffles as to the idioms of burglars  to return to criticism we are to admit that jonson was really writing with his tongue in his cheek knowing that as a fact shakespeare the great unknown the bacon of the baconians had remarkable classical attainments and they of course open the door to the suggestion that the entire poem is capable of an ironical construction and esoteric interpretation 254a  so this is mr greenwoods method of explaining away the memorable words  he seems to conjecture that will was not shakespeare not the author of the plays that jonson knew it that his poem is as a whole addressed to bacon or to the great unknown under his nom de plume of william shakespeare that the address to the swan of avon is a mere blind and that ben only alludes to his beloved the stratford actor when he tells his beloved that his beloved has small latin and less greek  all the praise is for bacon or the great unknown mr harris the jeer is for his beloved the author mr william shakespeare and what he hath left us  as far as i presume to understand this theory of the tongue in the cheek of the socratic irony this is what mr greenwood has to propose towards explaining away the evidence of ben jonson in his famous commendatory verses  when we can see through the dust of words we find that the esoteric interpretation of the commendatory verses is merely a reassertion of the general theory  a man with small latin and less greek could not have written the plays and poems  therefore when ben explicitly states that his beloved mr shakespeare of stratford the swan of avon did write the plays and had small latin and less greek ben meant that he did not write them that they were written by somebody else who had plenty of greek and latin  it is a strange logical method  mr greenwood merely reasserts his paradox and proves it like certain biblical critics of more orthodoxy than sense by aid of his private esoteric method of interpretation  ben we say about 1630 in prose and in cold blood and in a humour of criticism without the old rancour and envy or the transitory poetic enthusiasm pens a note on shakespeare in a volume styled timber or discoveries made upon men and matter as they have flowed out of his daily readings or had their reflux to his peculiar notion of the times  ben died in 1637 his ms collection of notes and brief essays and reflections was published in 1641  bacon of whom he wrote his impressions in this manuscript had died in 1626  ben was no longer young  he says among these notes that his memory once unusually strong after he was past forty is much decayed in me     it was wont to be faithful to me but shaken with age now    i copy the extract as given by mr greenwood 255a  he spoke sooth  he attributes to orpheus in timber a line from homer and quotes from homer what is not in that poets works  in this manuscript occurs then a brief prose note headed de shakespeare nostrati on our countryman shakespeare  it is an anecdote of the players and their ignorance with a few critical and personal remarks on shakespeare  i remember the players have often mentioned it as an honour to shakespeare that whatsoever he penned he never blotted out a line  my answer hath been would he had blotted a thousand which they thought a malevolent speech  i had not told posterity this but for their ignorance who chose that circumstance to commend their friend by that wherein he most faulted and to justify mine own candour for i loved the man and do honour his memory on this side idolatry as much as any  he was indeed honest and of an open and free nature had an excellent phantasy brave notions and gentle expressions wherein he flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be stopped  sufflaminandus erat as augustus said of haterius  his wit was in his own power would the rule of it had been so too  many times he fell into those things could not escape laughter as when he said in the person of caesar one speaking to him caesar thou dost me wrong  he replied caesar did never wrong but with just cause and such like which were ridiculous  but he redeemed his vices with his virtues  there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned  baconians actually maintain that ben is here speaking of bacon  of whom is ben writing  of the author of julius caesarcertainly from which his memory failing he misquotes a line  if ben be in the great secretthat the author was bacon or mr greenwoods great unknown he is here no more enthusiastic about the shadow or the statesman than about shakespeare no less cool and critical whoever may be the subject of his comments  whether in the commendatory verses he referred to the actorauthor or bacon or the shining shadow or all of them at once he is now in a mood very much more cool and critical  if to be so cool and critical is violently inconsistent in the case of the stratford actor it is not less so if ben has bacon or the shadow in his mind  meanwhile the person of whom he speaks is here the actorauthor whom the players his friends commended wherein he faulted namely in not blotting where in a thousand cases ben wishes that he had blotted  can the most enthusiastic baconian believe that when ben wrote about the players ignorant applause of shakespeares of their friends lack of care in correction ben had bacon in his mind  as for mr greenwood he says that in bens sentence about the players and their ignorant commendation we have it on jonsons testimony that the players looked upon william shakspere the actor as the author of the plays and praised him for never blotting out a line  we have it and how is the critic to get over or round the fact  thus we know that this statement about the almost blotless lines is ridiculous that if the players had any unblotted manuscripts in their hands which is by no means probable they were merely fair copies      perhaps but the baconians appear to assume that a fair copy is not and cannot be a copy in the handwriting of the author  as i have said before the players knew wills handwriting if he could write  if they received his copy in a hand not his own and were not idiots they could not praise him and his unerring speed and accuracy in penning his thoughts  if on the other hand will could not write in their long friendship with will the players must have known the fact and could not possibly believe as they certainly did on jonsons testimony in his authorship  to finish mr greenwoods observations if they the players really thought that the author of the plays wrote them off currente calamo and never or hardly ever blotted a line never revised never made any alterations they knew nothing whatever concerning the real shakespeare 258a  nothing whatever  what they did not know was merely that will gave them fair copies in his own hand as before the typewriting machine was invented authors were wont to do  within the last fortnight i heard the error attributed to the players made by an english scholar who is foremost in his own field of learning  he and i were looking at some of dickenss mss  they were full of erasions and corrections  i said how unlike scott whose first draft of his novels exactly answered to the players description of wills copy my friend said browning scarcely made an erasion or change in writing his poems and referred to mr brownings mss for the press of which examples were lying near us  but browning must have made clean copies for the press i said  which was as new an idea to my learned friend as it was undreamed of by the players if what they received from him were his clean copies  the players testimony through jonson cannot be destroyed by the easy stratagem of mr greenwood  mr greenwood now nearly falls back on bacon though he constantly professes that he is not the advocate of bacons authorship  the author was some great man as like bacon as one pea to another  mr greenwood says that jonson looked on the issue of the first folio 259a as a very special occasion  well it was a very special occasion no literary occasion could be more special  without the folio badly as it is executed we should perhaps never have had many of shakespeares plays  the occasion was special in the highest degree  but says mr greenwood if we could only get to the back of jonsons mind we should find that there was some efficient cause operating to induce him to give the best possible sendoff to that celebrated venture 260a  ben was much in the habit of giving sendoffs of great eloquence to poetic ventures now forgotten  what could the efficient cause be in the case of the folio  at once mr greenwood has recourse to bacon he cannot do what he will keep bacon out of the memorial ben was with bacon at gorhambury on bacons sixtieth birthday january 22 1621  ben wrote verses about the genius of the old house   thou standst as if some mystery thou didst   what was that mystery asks mr greenwood 260b  what indeed and what has all this to do with bens commendatory verses for the folio two years later  mr greenwood also surmises as we have seen 260c that jonson was with bacon helping to translate the advancement of learning in june 1623  let us suppose that he was  what has that to do with bens verses for the folio  does mr greenwood mean to hint that bacon was the efficient cause operating to induce ben to give the best possible sendoff to the folio  one does not see what interest bacon had in stimulating the enthusiasm of ben unless we accept bacon as author of the plays which mr greenwood does not  if mr greenwood thinks that bacon was the author of the plays then the facts are suitable to his belief  but if he does noti hold no brief for the baconians he sayshow is all this passage on bens visits to bacon concerned with the subject in hand  between the passage on some efficient cause at the back of bens mind 261a and the passage on bens visits to bacon in 16213 261b six pages intervene and blur the supposed connection between the efficient cause of bens verses of 1623 and his visits to bacon in 16213  these intercalary pages are concerned with bens laudations of bacon by name in his discoveries  the first is entirely confined to praise of bacon as an orator  bacon is next mentioned in a catalogue of writers as he who hath filled up all numbers and performed that in our tongue which may be preferred or compared either to insolent greece or haughty rome words used of shakespeare by jonson in the folio verses  mr greenwood remarks that jonsons catalogue to judge by the names he cites more chaloner smith sir nicholas bacon sidney hooker essex raleigh savile sandys and so on suggests that he is thinking mainly of wits and orators of his own and the preceding generation not of poets specially  this is obvious why should ben name shakespeare with more smith chaloner eliot bishop gardiner egerton sandys and savile  yet it is remarkable that no mention should be made of the great dramatist  where is spenser named or beaumont or chaucer with whom ben ranked shakespeare  ben quoted of bacon the line he wrote long before of shakespeare as a poet about insolent greece and all this is remarkable and mr greenwood finds it not surprising 262a that the baconians dwell on the extraordinary coincidence of expression as if ben were incapable of repeating a happy phrase from himself and as if we should wonder at anything the baconians may say or do  another startling coincidence is that in discoveries ben said of shakespeare his wit was in his own power and wished that the rule of it had been so too  of bacon ben wrote his language where he could spare or pass by a jest was nobly censorious  thus bacon had the rule of his own wit bacon could spare or pass by a jest whereas shakespeare apparently could notso like were the two dromios in this particular  strong in these convincing arguments the baconians ask not so mr greenwood he is no baconian were there then two writers of whom this description was appropriate    was there only one and was it of bacon under the name of shakespeare that ben wrote de shakespeare nostrati  read it again substituting bacon for shakespeare  i remember the players and so on and what has bacon to do here  sometimes it was necessary that bacon should be stopped  many times bacon fell into those things could not escape laughter such as caesars supposed line and such like which were ridiculous  bacon redeemed his vices with his virtues  there was ever more in bacon to be praised than to be pardoned  thus freely according to the baconians speaks ben of bacon whom he here styles shakespeareheaven knows why while crediting him with the players as his friends  ben could not think or speak thus of bacon  mr greenwood occupies his space with these sagacities of the baconians one marvels why he takes the trouble  we are asked why ben wrote so little and that so cool i loved him on this side idolatry as much as any about shakespeare  read through bens discoveries  what has he to say about any one of his great contemporary dramatists from marlowe to beaumont  he says nothing about any of them though he had panegyrised them as he panegyrised beaumont in verse  in his prose discoveries he speaks among english dramatists of shakespeare alone  we are also asked by the baconians to believe that his remarks on bacon under the name of shakespeare are really an addition to his more copious and infinitely more reverential observations on bacon named by his own name i have and do reverence him for the greatness that was only proper to himself  also where bacon is spoken of as shakespeare he redeemed his vices by his virtues  there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned    sometimes it was necessary that he should be stopped    many times he fell into those things that could not escape laughter  these two views of bacon are if you like incongruous  the person spoken of is in both cases bacon say the baconians and mr greenwood sympathetically alludes to their ideas 264a which i cannot qualify in courteous terms  baconians would of course explain the difficulty by saying that however sphinxlike were jonsons utterances he had clearly distinct in his own mind two different personages viz shakspere the player and shakespeare the real author of the plays and poems and that if in the perplexing passage quoted from the discoveries he appears to confound one with the other it is because the solemn seal of secrecy had been imposed on him  they would say they do say all that  ben is not to let out that bacon is the author  so he tells us of bacon that he often made himself ridiculous and so forthbut he pretends that he is speaking of shakespeare  all this wedge of wisdom remember is inserted between the search for the efficient cause of bens panegyric 1623 in the folio on his beloved mr william shakespeare and the discovery of bens visits to bacon in 16213  does mr greenwood mean that ben in 1623 or earlier knew the secret of bacons authorship and stimulated by his hospitality applauded his works in the folio while as he must not disclose the secret he throughout speaks of bacon as shakespeare puns on that name in the line about seeming to shake a lance and salutes the lord of gorhambury as sweet swan of avon  mr greenwood cannot mean that for he is not a baconian  what does he mean  put together his pages 483 489491  on the former we find how it would appear that jonson thought the issue of the folio 1623 a very special occasion and that perhaps if we could only get to the back of his mind we should find that there was some efficient cause operating to induce him to give the best possible sendoff to that celebrated venture  then skip to pp 489491 and you find very special occasions  bacons birthday feast with its mystery ben as one of bacons good pens in 1623  the best of these good pens it seems was jonson 266a  on what evidence does it seem  the opinion of judge webb  is this supposed collaboration with bacon in 1623 the efficient cause operating to induce ben to give the best possible sendoff to the folio  how could this be the efficient cause if bacon were not the author of the plays  mr greenwood like the genius at the birthday supper   stands as if some mystery he did   on a trifling point of honour namely as to whether ben were a man likely to lie tortuously hypocritically to be elaborately false about the authorship of the shakespearean plays it is hopelessly impossible to bring the baconians and mr greenwood who holds no brief for the baconians to my point of view  mr greenwood rides off thuswhat the baconians do is unimportant  there are as everybody knows many falsehoods that are justifiable some that it is actually a duty to tell  it may be so i pray that i may never tell any of them or any more of them  among justifiable lies i do not reckon that of scott if ever he plumply denied that he wrote the waverley novels  i do not judge sir walter  heaven forbid  but if in mr greenwoods words he we are told thought it perfectly justifiable for a writer who wished to preserve his anonymity to deny when questioned the authorship of a work since the interrogator had no right to put such a question to him 267a i disagree with sir walter  many other measures in accordance with the conditions of each case were open to him  some are formulated by his own bucklaw in the bride of lammermoor as regards questions about what occurred on his bridal night  bucklaw would challenge the man and cut the lady who asked questions  but scotts case as cited applies only to bacon or mr greenwoods unknown if he were asked whether or not he were the author of the plays  no idiot at that date was likely to put the question  but if anyone did ask bacon must either evade or deny or tell the truth  on the parallel of scott bacon could thus deny evade or tell the truth  but the parallel of scott is not applicable to any other person except to the author who wishes to preserve his anonymity and is questioned  the parallel does not apply to ben  he had not written the shakespearean plays  nobody was asking him if he had written them  if he knew that the author was bacon and knew it under pledge of secrecy and was asked per impossibile who wrote these plays he had only to say look at the titlepage  but no mortal was asking ben the question  but we are to suppose that in the panegyric and in discoveries ben chooses to assert first that shakespeare was his beloved his sweet swan of avon and that he loved him on this side idolatry as much as any  there is no evidence that he did love shakespeare except his own statement when according to the baconians he is really speaking of bacon and according to mr greenwood of an unknown person singularly like bacon  consequently unless we can prove that ben really loved the actor he is telling a disgustingly hypocritical and wholly needless falsehood both before and after the death of bacon  to be silent about the authorship of a book an authorship which is the secret of your friend and patron is one thing and a blameless thing all the friends some twenty to whom scott confided the secret of his authorship were silent  but not one of them publicly averred that the author was their very dear friend soandso who was not scott and perhaps not their friend at all  that was bens line thus the parallel with scott drawn by mr greenwood twice 268a is no parallel  it has no kind of analogy with bens alleged falsehoods so elaborate so incomprehensible except by baconians and if he did not love the actor shakspere dearly so detestably hypocritical and open to instant detection  it is not easy to find a parallel to the conduct with which ben is charged  but suppose that scott lived unsuspected of writing his novels which let us say he signed james hogg and died without confessing his secret and without taking his elaborate precautions for its preservation on record  next imagine that lockhart knew scotts secret under vow of silence and was determined to keep it at any cost  he therefore writing after the death of hogg of ettrick and in scotts lifetime publishes verses declaring that hogg was his beloved an enormous fib and that hogg sweet swan of ettrick was the author of the waverley novels  to complete the parallels lockhart after scotts death leaves a note in prose to the effect that while he loved hogg on this side idolatry again a monstrous fable he must confess that hogg author of the waverley novels often fell into things that were ridiculous and often needed to have a stopper put on him for all these remarks  lockhart while speaking of hogg is thinking of scottand he makes the remarks solely to conceal scotts authorship of the novelsof which on the hypothesis nobody suspected scott to be the author  lockhart must then have been what the baconian mr theobald calls mr churton collins a measureless liarall for no reason  mr greenwood starting as usual from the case which is no parallel of scotts denying his own authorship goes on for all we know jonson might have seen nothing in the least objectionable in the publication by some great personage of his dramatic works under a pseudonym under another mans name really even though that pseudonym led to a wrong conception as to the authorship and that if being a friend of that great personage and working in his service ben worked by the theory in bacons he had solemnly engaged to preserve the secret inviolate and not to reveal it even to posterity then doubtless i thank thee jew meaning sir sidney lee for teaching me that word he would have remained true to that solemn pledge 270a  to remain true ben had only to hold his peace  but he lied up and down and right and left and even declared that bacon was a friend of the players and needed to be shut up and made himself a laughingstock in his playsstyling bacon shakespeare  all this and much more of the same sort we must steadfastly believe before we can be baconians for only by believing these doctrines can we get rid of ben jonsons testimony to the authorship of will shakspere gent    chapter xiii  the preoccupations of bacon    let us now examine a miracle and mystery in which the baconians find nothing strange nothing that is not perfectly normal  bacon was the author of the shakespearean plays they tell us  let us look rapidly at his biography after which we may ask does not his poetic supremacy and imaginative fertility border on the miraculous when we consider his occupations and his ruling passion  bacon born in 1561 had a prodigious genius was well aware of it and had his own ideal as to the task which he was born to do  while still at cambridge and therefore before he was fifteen he was utterly dissatisfied as he himself informed dr rawley with the scientific doctrines of the schools  in the study of nature they reasoned from certain accepted ideas a priori principles not from what he came to call interrogation of nature  there were indeed and had long been experimental philosophers but the school doctors went not beyond aristotle and discovered nothing  as mr spedding puts it the boy bacon asked himself if our study of nature be thus barren our method of study must be wrong might not a better method be found     upon the conviction this may be done followed at once the question how may it be done  upon that question answered followed the resolution to try and do it  this was in religious phrase the conversion of bacon the event which had a greater influence than any other upon his character and future course  from that moment he had a vocation which employed and stimulated him    an object to live for as wide as humanity as immortal as the human race an idea to live in vast and lofty enough to fill the soul for ever with religious and heroic aspirations 274a  the vocation the idea the object were not poetical  in addition to this ceaseless scientific preoccupation bacon was much concerned with the cause of reformed religion then at stake in france and supposed to be in danger at home and with the good government of his native country  he could only aid that cause by the favour of elizabeth and james by his services in parliament where despite his desire for advancement he conscientiously opposed the queen  he was obliged to work at such tasks of various sorts legal and polemical literature as were set him by people in power with these three great objects filling his heart inspiring his ambition and occupying his energies and time we cannot easily believe without direct external evidence that he or any mortal could have leisure and detachment from his main objects to which we may add his own advancement sufficient to enable him to compose the works ascribed to shakespeare  thus at the age of twentytwo 1583 when if ever he might have penned sonnets to his mistresss eyebrow he reports that he wrote his first essay on the instauration of philosophy which he called temporis partus maximus the greatest birth of time and we need not doubt that between law and philosophy he found enough to do 275a  for the baconians take bacon to have been a very great lawyer of which i am no judge and law is a hard mistress rapacious of a mans hours  in 1584 he entered parliament but we do not hear anything very important of his occupations before 1589 when he wrote a long pamphlet touching the controversies of the church of england 275b  he had then leisure enough that he was not anonymously supplying the stage with plays i can neither prove nor disprove  but there is no proof that he wrote loves labours lost by 15912 we learn much of him from his letter to cecil who never would give him a place wherein he could meditate his philosophy  he was apparently hard at scientific work  i account my ordinary course of study and meditation to be more painful than most parts of action are  he adds the contemplative planet carries me away wholly and by contemplation i conceive him to mean what he calls vast contemplative ends  these he proceeds to describe  he does not mean the writing of venus and adonis 1593 nor of lucrece 1594 nor of comedies  i have taken all knowledge to be my province and he recurs to his protest against the pseudoscience of his period  if i could purge knowledge of two sorts of rovers whereof the one with frivolous disputations confutations and verbosities the other with blind experiments and auricular traditions and impostures hath committed so many spoils i hope i should bring in industrious observations grounded conclusions and profitable inventions and discoveries    this whether it be curiosity or vainglory or nature or if one take it favourably philanthropy is so fixed in my mind that it cannot be removed  if cecil cannot help him to a post if he cannot serve the truth he will reduce himself like anaxagoras to voluntary poverty     and become some sorry bookmaker or a true pioneer in that mine of truth     276a  really from first to last he was the prince of beggingletter writers endlessly asking for place pensions reversions money and more money  though his years were thirtyone bacon was as young at heart as shelley at eighteen when he wrote thus to cecil my lord treasurer burghley  what did cecil care for his youngish kinsmans philanthropy and vast speculative ends how modern it all is and the rest of it  but just because bacon at thirtyone is so extremely green going to take all knowledge for his province if some one will only subsidise him and endow his research i conceive that he was in earnest about his reformation of science  surely no baconian will deny it  being so deeply in earnest taking his study and meditation so hard i cannot see him as the author of venus and adonis and whatever plays of the periodsay loves labours lost the two gentlemen of verona henry vi part iare attributed to him about this time by baconians  of course my view is merely personal or subjective  the baconians view is also subjective i regard bacon in 1591 and later as intellectually preoccupied by his vast speculative aims what he says that he desires to do in science is what he did as far as he was able  his other desires his personal advancement money a share in the conduct of affairs he also hotly pursued not much to his own or the public profit there seems to be no room left no inclination left for competition in their own line with marlowe greene nash and half a dozen other professed playwrights  no room for plays done under the absurd pseudonym of an ignorant actor  you see these things as the baconians do or as i do  argument is unavailing  i take bacon to have been sincere in his effusive letter to cecil  not so the baconians he concealed they think a vast literary aim  they must take his alternativeto be some sorry bookmaker or a pioneer in that mine of truth as meaning that he would either be the literary hack of a company of players or the founder of a regenerating philosophy  but at that date playwrights could not well be called bookmakers for the owners of the plays did their best to keep them from appearing as printed books  if bacon by bookmaker meant playwright he put a modest value on his poetical work  meanwhile 15912 bacon attached himself to the young beautiful and famous essex on the way to be a favourite and gave him much excellent advice as he always did and as always his advice was not taken  it is not a novel suggestion that essex is the young man to whom bacon is so passionately attached in the sonnets traditionally attributed to shakespeare  i applied myself to him that is to essex says bacon in a manner which i think happeneth rarely among men  the poet of the sonnets applies himself to the beloved youth in a manner which luckily happeneth rarely among men  it is difficult to fit the sonnets into bacons life  but if you pursue the context of what bacon says concerning essex you find that he does not speak openly of a tenderly passionate attachment to that young man not more than this i did nothing but advise and ruminate with myself to the best of my understanding propositions and memorials of anything that might concern his lordships honour fortune or service 279a  as bacon did nothing but these things 15912 he had no great leisure for writing poetry and plays moreover speaking as a poet in the sonnets he might poetically exaggerate his intense amatory devotion to essex into the symbolism of his passionate verse  was essex then a married man  if so the sonneteers insistence on his marrying must be symbolical of anything else you please  we know that bacon at this period did nothing but ruminate about essex  the words are his own 1604  no plays no venus and adonis nothing but enthusiastic service of essex and the sonnets mr spedding indeed thinks that to adorn some pageant of essex november 17 1592 bacon kindly contributed such matter as mr bacon in praise of knowledge containing his usual views about regenerating science and mr bacons discourse in praise of his sovereign 279b  both are excellent though for a court festival not very gay  he also very early in 1593 wrote an answer to father parsons  famous indictment of elizabeths government in observations on a libel 280a  what with ruminating on essex and this essay he was not solely devoted to venus and adonis and to furbishingup old plays though no doubt he may have unpacked his bosom in the sonnets and indulged his luscious imaginations in venus and adonis i would not limit the potentialities of his genius  but certainly this amazing man was busy in quite other matters than poetry not to mention his severe study and meditation on science  all these activities of bacon in the year of venus and adonis do not exhaust his exercises  bacon living laborious days plunged into the debate in the commons on supply and fell into elizabeths disgrace and vainly competed with coke for the attorneygeneralship and went on to write a pamphlet on the conspiracy of lopez and to try to gain the office of solicitorgeneral to manage essexs affairs to plead at the bar to do crown work as a lawyer to urge his suit for the solicitorship to trifle with the composition of formularies and elegancies january 1595 to write his essays to try for the mastership of the rolls to struggle with the affairs of the doomed essex 16001 while always labouring in secret at that vast aim of the reorganisation of natural science which ever preoccupied him he says and distracted his attention from his practice and from affairs of state 281a  of these state affairs the projected union with scotland was the most onerous  he was also writing the advancement of learning 1605  i do confess he wrote to sir thomas bodley since i was of any understanding my mind hath in effect been absent from that i have done 281b  his mind was with his beloved reformation of learning  this came between him and his legal his political labours his pamphletwriting and his private schemes and suits  to this burden of atlas the baconians add the vampingup of old plays for shakespeares company and the inditing of new plays poems and the sonnets  even without this considerable addition to his tasks bacon is wonderful enough but with ithe needs the sturdy faith of the rationalist to accept him and his plotto write plays under the pseudonym of william shakespeare  talk of miracles as things which do not happen  the activities of bacon from 1591 to 1605 the strain on that mans mind and heart especially his heart when we remember that he had to prosecute his passionately adored essex to the death all this makes it seem to me improbable that as mrs pott and her school of baconians hold he lived to be at least a hundred and six if not much older  no wonder that he turned to tragedy lear macbeth othello and saw life en noir  man delighted him not nor woman either  the occupations and even more the scientific preoccupation of bacon do not make his authorship of the plays a physical impossibility  but they make it an intellectual miracle  perhaps i may be allowed to set off this marvel against that other portent will shaksperes knowledge and frequent use of terms of law 282a i do not pretend to understand how will came to have them at the tip of his pen  thus it may be argued that the sonnets are by bacon and no other man because the law is so familiar to the author and his legal terms are always used with so nice an accuracy that only bacon can have been capable of these mysterious productions  but why was bacon so wofully inaccurate in points of scholarship and history  by precisely the same argument lord penzance proves that bacon not ben as mr greenwood holds wrote for the players the dedication of the folio 282b  if it should be the case that francis bacon wrote the plays he would probably afterwards have written the dedication of the folio and the style of it stuffed with terms of law would be accounted for  mr greenwood thinks that jonson wrote the dedication so ben too was fond of using legal terms in literature legal terms abounded in all plays and poems of the period says sir sidney lee and mr greenwood pounces on the word all 283a however he says we must admit that this use of legal jargon is frequently found in laywriters poets and others of the elizabethan periodin sonnets for example where it seems to us intolerable examples are given from barnabe barnes 283b  the lawyers all agree however that shakespeare does the legal style more natural and more accurately than the rest  and yet i cannot even argue that if he did use legal terms at all he would be sure to do it pretty well  for on this point of wills use of legal phraseology i frankly profess myself entirely at a loss  to use it in poetry was part of the worse side of taste at that period  the lawyers with one voice declare that wills use of it is copious and correct and that their mystery is difficult their jargon hard to master there is nothing so dangerous wrote lord campbell as for one not of the craft to tamper with our freemasonry  i have not tampered with it perhaps a man of genius who found it interesting might have learned the technical terms more readily than lawyers deem possible  but will so accurate in his legal terms is so inaccurate on many other points for example in civil and natural history and in classic lore  mr greenwood proves him to be totally at sea as a naturalist on the habits of bees for example his natural history of the insect is as limited as it is inaccurate 284a  virgil though not a lord avebury was a great entomologist compared with will  about the cuckoo will was recklessly misinformed  his natural history was folklore or was taken from that great mediaeval storehouse of absurdities the popular work of pliny  he went to contemporary error or antiquated fancy for his facts not to nature says a critic quoted by mr greenwood 284b  was that worthy of bacon  all these charges against le vieux williams as theophile gautier calls our will i admit  but will was no bacon will had not taken all knowledge for his province  bacon i hope had not neglected bees  thus the problem why is will accurate in his legal terminology and reckless of accuracy in quantity in history in classic matters is not by me to be solved  i can only surmise that from curiosity or for some other unknown reason he had read law books or drawn information from templars about the meaning of their jargon and that for once he was technically accurate   we have now passed in review the chief baconian and antiwillian arguments against will shakespeares authorship of the plays and poems  their chief argument for bacon is aut diabolus aut franciscus which freely interpreted means if bacon is not the author who the devil is  we reply that man is the author in the main to whom the works are attributed by every voice of his own generation which mentions them namely the only william shakespeare that from 1593 to the early years of the second decade of the following century held a prominent place in the world of the drama  his authorship is explicitly vouched for by his fellowplayers heminge and condell to whom he left bequests in his will and by his sometime rival later friend and always critic ben jonson heywood player and playwright and pamphleteer who had been one of henslowes hands and lived into the great rebellion knew the stage and authors for the stage from within and his mellifluous shakespeare is will as his beaumont was frank his marlowe kit his fletcher jack  the author of daiphantus 1604 mentioning the popularity of hamlet styles it one of friendly shakespeares tragedies  shakespeare to him was our will clearly a man of known and friendly character  the other authors of allusions did not need to say who their shakespeare was any more than they needed to say who marlowe or any other poet was we have examined the possibly unprecedented argument which demands that they who mention shakespeare as the poet must if they would enlighten us add explicitly that he is also the actor  but all may have been deceived by the long conspiracy of the astute bacon or the nameless one  to believe this possible considering the eager and suspicious jealousy and volubility of rival playwrights is to be credulous indeed  the baconians representing will almost as incapable of the use of pen and ink as the old hermit of prague destroy their own case  a will who had to make his mark like his father could not pose as an author even to the callboy of his company  mr greenwoods bookless will with some crumbs of latin and some power of bumbasting out a blank verse is a rather less impossible pretender indeed but why and when did the speaker of patois the bookless one write blank verse from 1592 onwards and where are his blank verses  where are the works of poetape as to the man even will by tradition whatever it may be worth he was a handsome wellshaped man very good company and of a very ready and pleasant smooth wit  to his fellowactors he was so worthy a friend and fellow associate  to jonson he was indeed honest and of an open and free nature had an excellent phantasy brave notions and gentle expressions wherein he flowed so freely that sometimes it was necessary he should be stopped  if jonson here refers as i suppose he does to his conversation it had that extraordinary affluence of thoughts each mating itself with as remarkable originality of richly figured expressions which is so characteristic of the style of shakespeares plays  in this prodigality he was remote indeed from the style of the greeks panting time toils after him in vain and even the reader much more the listener might say sufflaminandus est he needs to have the brake put on 287a  such according to unimpeachable evidence was will  only despair can venture the sad suggestion that under the name of shakespeare ben is here speaking of bacon as falling into those things which could not escape laughter    which were ridiculous  but to this last poor shift and fantastic guess were the antiwillians and baconians reduced  such was shakespeare according to a rival  but it is impossible that a man should have known so much especially of classical literature and courtly ways and foreign manners and phrases if he had no more at most than four or five years at a latin school and five or six years in that forcinghouse of faculty the london of the stage in the flush of the triumph over the armada  with innumerable sorts of english books and infinite fardles of printed pamphlets this country is pestered all shops stuffed and every study furnished says a contemporary 288a  if a doubter will look at the cheap and common books of that day a play in quarto and the sonnets of shakespeare when new were sold for fippence in any great collection he will not marvel that to a lover of books poor as he might be many were accessible  such a man cannot be kept from books  if the reader will look into the translations and imitations of the classics which poured from the press    the poems and love pamphlets and plays of the university wits when these chanced to be printed the tracts and dialogues in the prevailing taste 288b he will understand the literary soil in which the genius of shakespeare blossomed as rapidly as the flowers in adonis garden the whole literature was to an extent which we find tedious saturated with classical myths anecdotes philosophic dictaa world of knowledge of a kind then in widest commonalty spread but now so much forgotten that to baconians and the public such lore seems recondite learning  the gallants who haunted the stage and such university wits as could get the money or had talent like crichton to dispute their way through europe made the italian tour and notoriously were italianate  they would not be chary of reminiscences of florence venice and rome  actors visited denmark and germany  no man at home was far to seek for knowledge of elsinore the mysterious venetian tranect or common ferry the gondolas and the rialto there was no lack of soldiers fresh and voluble from the foreign wars  only dullards or the unthinking can be surprised by the ease with which a quickwitted man having some knowledge of latin can learn to read a novel in french italian or spanish  that shakespeare was the very reverse of a dullard of the clod of baconian fancy is proved by the fact that he was thought capable of his works  for courtly manners he had the literary convention and lylys court comedies with what he saw when playing at the court and in the houses of the great  as to untaught nobility of manners there came to the court of france in 1429 from a small pigbreeding village on the marches of lorraine one whose manners were deemed of exquisite grace propriety and charm by all who saw and heard her of her manners and swift wit and repartee the official record of her trial bears concordant evidence  other untaught gifts she possessed and the historic record is unimpeached as regards that child of genius jeanne darc  ne me dites jamais cette bete de mot impossible said napoleon it is indeed a stupid word where genius is concerned  if intellectual miracles were impossible to genius even bacon could not have been and done all that he was and did and also the author of the shakespearean plays and poems even ben could not have been the scholar that he was  for the rest i need not return on my tracks and explain once more such shallow mysteries as the silence of philip henslowe and the lack of literary anecdotage about shakespeare in a stupendously illiterate country town  had will not ben visited drummond of hawthornden we should have matter enough of the kind desired  we have the epics of homer people say what matters it whether they be by a man or by a syndicate that was in business through seven centuries  we have the plays of shakespeare what matters it whether he or bacon or x were in the main the author  it matters to us if we hold such doubts to be fantastic pedantries such guesses contrary to the nature of things while we wish to give love and praise and gratitude where they are due to that achaean father of the rest and to friendly shakespeare     appendices     appendix i  troilus and cressida    to myself troilus and cressida is with henry vi part i the most mysterious among the shakespearean plays  here we find if will wrote it or had any hand in it the greatest poet of the modern world in touch with the heroes of the greatest poet of the ancient world but the english authors eyes are dimmed by the mists and dust of posthomeric perversions of the tale of troy  the work of perversion began we know in the eighth century before our era when by the author of the cypria these favourite heroes of homer odysseus and diomede were represented as scoundrels assassins and cowards  in the prologue to the play whosoever wrote it we see that the writer is no scholar  he makes the achaean fleet muster in the port of athens of all places  even ovid gave the homeric trysting place aulis in boeotia  this prologue is not in the folio of 1623  six gates hath the englishmans troy and the scaean is not one of them  the loves of troilus and cressida with pandarus as gobetween are from the mediaeval troy books and were wholly unknown to homer whose pandarus is only notable for loosing a traitors shaft at menelaus in time of truce and for his death at the hand of diomede the play begins after the duel iliad iii between paris and menelaus  in the play not in homer paris retires hurt as is at first reported  hector has a special grudge against the telamonian aias  as in the iliad there is a view of the achaeans taken from the walls by priam and helen so in the play pandarus and cressida review the trojans reentering the city  paris turns out not to be hurt after all  in act i scene 3 the achaeans hold council and regret the disaffection of achilles  here comes ulysses great speech on discipline in armies and in states the gradations of rank and duty commonly thought to be a leaf in shakespeares crown of bays the speeches of agamemnon and nestor are dignified indeed the poet treats agamemnon much more kindly than homer is wont to do  but the poet represents achilles as laughing in his quarters at patrocluss imitation of the cough and other infirmities of old nestor to which homer naturally never alludes  throughout the english poet regards achilles with the eyes of his most infamous late greek and ignorant mediaeval detractors  the homeric sequence of events is so far preserved that on the day of the duel between paris and menelaus comes through aeneas the challenge by hector to fight any greek in gentle and joyous passage of arms iliad vii  as in the iliad the greeks decide by lot who is to oppose hector but by the contrivance of odysseus not by chance as in homer the lot falls on aias  in the iliad aias is as strong and sympathetic as porthos in les trois mousquetaires  the play makes him as great an eater of beef and as stupid as sir andrew aguecheek  achilles save in a passage quite out of accord with the rest of the piece is nearly as dull as aias is discourteous and is cowardly  no poet and no scholar who knew homers heroes in homers greek could thus degrade them and the whole of the revilings of thersites are loathsome in their profusion of filthy thoughts  it does not follow that will did not write the part of thersites  some of the most beautiful and shakespearean pieces of verse adorn the play one would say that no man but will could have written them  troilus and cressida at first appear to dally with the innocence of love and nothing can be nobler and more dramatic than the lines in which cressida compelled to go to her father calchas in the greek camp in exchange for antenor professes her loyalty in love  but the homeric and the alien later elementsthe story of false lovecannot be successfully combined  the poet whoever he was appears to weary and to break down  he ends indeed as the iliad ends with the death of hector but hector in the play is murdered while resting unarmed without shield and helmet after stripping a suit of sumptuous mail from a nameless runaway  in the play he has slain patroclus but has not stripped him of the armour of achilles which in homer he is wearing  achilles then meets hector but far from rushing to avenge on him patroclus he retires like a coward musters his men and makes them surround and slay the defenceless hector  cressida who is sent to her father calchas in the greek camp in a day becomes the sluttish spoil of opportunity and of diomede and the comedy praised by the prefacewriter of a quarto of 1609 is a squalid tragedy reeking of thersites and pandarus of a light o love and the base victory of cruel cowardice over knightly hector yet there seemed to be muffled notes from the music and broken lights from the splendour of homer  when achilles eyes hector all over during a truce and insultingly says that he is thinking in what part of his body he shall drive the spear we are reminded of iliad xxii 320326 where achilles searches his own armour worn by patroclus stripped by hector from him and worn by hector for a chink in the mail  yet after all these points are taken not from the iliad but from caxtons popular troy book  once more when hector is dead and achilles bids his men to      cry amain achilles hath the mighty hector slain   we think of iliad xxii 390393 where achilles commands the myrmidons to go singing the paean   glory have we won we have slain great hector   the sumptuous armour stripped by hector from a nameless man recalls his winning of the arms of achilles from patroclus  but in fact this passage is also borrowed with the murder of hector from caxton except as regards the paean  it may be worth noting that chapmans first instalment of his translation of the iliad containing books i ii and viixi appeared in 1598 and thence the author could adapt the passages from iliad book vii  in or about 15989 occurred in histriomastix by marston and others a burlesque speech in which troilus addressing cressida speaks of thy knight who shakes his furious speare while in april 1599 henslowes accountbook contains entries of money paid to dekker and chettle for a play on troilus and cressida for the earl of nottinghams company 297a  of this play no more is known nor can we be sure that chapmans seven books of the iliad i ii viixi of 1598 attracted the attention of playwrights from shakespeare to chettle and dekker to trojan affairs  the coincidences at least are curious  if shakes his furious speare in histriomastix refers to shakespeare in connection with cressida while in 1599 dekker and chettle were doing a troilus and cressida for a company not shakespeares then there were two troilus and cressida in the field  a licence to print a troilus and cressida was obtained in 16023 but the quarto of our play the shakespearean play is of 1609 as it is acted by my lord chamberlains men that is by shakespeares company  now dekker and chettle wrote apparently for lord nottinghams company  one quarto of 1609 declares in a preface that the play has never been staled with the stage another edition of the same year from the same publishers has not the preface but declares that the piece was acted by the kings majestys servants at the globe 298a  the author of the preface ben jonson mr greenwood thinks 298b speaks only of a single author who has written other admirable comedies  when he is gone and his comedies out of sale you will scramble for them and set up a new english inquisition  why  the whole affair is a puzzle  but if the author of the preface is right about the single author of troilus and cressida and if shakespeare is alluded to in connection with cressida in histriomastix 1599 then it appears to me that shakespeare in 15989 after chapmans portion of the iliad appeared was author of one troilus and cressida extant in 16023 when its publication was barred till the publisher got authority while chettle and dekker in april 1599 were busy with another troilus and cressida as why should they not be  in an age so lax about copyright if their play was of their own original making are we to suppose that there was copyright in the names of the leading persons of the piece troilus and cressida  perhaps not  but meanwhile mr greenwood cites judge stotsenburgs opinion 298c that henslowes entries of april 1599 refute the shakespearean claim to the authorship of troilus and cressida which exhibits the collaboration of two men as leading commentators hold that it does  but the learned judge mentions as a conceivable alternative that there were two plays on the subject with the same name and really it looks as if there were  the judge does not agree with webb and other gifted writers that bacon wrote this play  so far the court is quite with him  he goes on however it was in my opinion based on the foregoing facts originally the production of dekker and chettle added to and philosophically dressed by francis bacon  but according to mr greenwood it is admitted not only that the different writing of two authors is apparent in the folio play but also that shakespeare must have had at least some share in a play of troilus and cressida as early as the very year 1599 in the spring of which dekker and chettle are found engaged in writing their play of that name on the evidence of histriomastix 299a  how that evidence proves that a play of troilus and cressida had been published as by shakespeare about 1599 i know not  perhaps published means acted  and it is not unreasonable to suppose that this play published as by shakespeare was the one to which henslowe alludesas being written in april 1599 by dekker and chettle  if so the play must show the hands of three not two men dekker chettle and shakespeare the great unknown or bacon  he collaborates with dekker and chettle in a play for lord nottinghams men according to sir sidney lee 300a but it is later at least played by shakespeares company and perhaps bacon gets none of the 4 pounds paid 300b to dekker and chettle  henslowe does not record his sale of the dekker and chettle play to shakespeares or to any company or purchaser  without an entry of the careful henslowe recording his receipts for the sale of the dekker and chettle play to any purchaser it is not easy to see how shakespeares company procured the manuscript and thus enabled him to refashion it perhaps no reader will fail to recognise his hand in the beautiful blank verse of many passages  i am not familiar enough with the works of dekker and chettle to assign to them the less desirable passages  thersites is beastly  a yahoo of swifts might poison with such phrases as his the name and nature of love loyalty and military courage  but whatsoever shakespeare did he did thoroughly and if he were weary if man delighted him not nor woman either he may have written the whole piece in which love perishes for the whim of a daughter of the game and the knightly hector is butchered to sate the vanity of his cowardly achilles  if shakespeare read the books translated by chapman he must have read them in the same spirit as keats and was likely to find that the poetry of the achaean could not be combined with the ionian athenian and roman perversions as he knew them in the mediaeval books of troy in the english of lydgate and caxton  the chivalrous example of chaucer he did not follow  probably will looked on the play as one of his failures  the editor if we can speak of an editor of the folio clearly thrust the play in late so confusedly that it is not paged and is not mentioned in the table of the contents  the grand possessors of the play referred to in the preface to one of the two quartos of 1609 we may suppose to be shakespeares company  in this case the owners would not permit the publication of the play if they could prevent it  the title provokes mr greenwood to say why these worthies should be so styled is not apparent indeed the supposition seems not a little ridiculous 301a  of course if the players were the possessors grand is merely a jeer by a person advertising a successful piracy  and in regard to tiecks conjecture that james i is alluded to as the grand possessor for whom the play was expressly written 301b the autocratic james was very capable of protecting himself against larcenous publishers    appendix iichettles supposed allusion to will shakspere    in discussing contemporary allusions to william shakspere or shakespeare or however you spell the name i have not relied on chettles remarks in kindharts dreame 1592 concerning greenes groatsworth of wit  chettle speaks of it saying in which a letter written to divers playmakers is offensively by one or two of them taken  it appears that by one or two chettle means two with neither of them that take offence was i acquainted at the time when he edited the groatsworth and with one of them i care not if i never be  we do not know who the gentlemen his quondam acquaintance addressed by greene were  they are usually supposed to have been marlowe peele and lodge or nash  we do not know which of the two who take offence is the man with whom chettle did not care to be acquainted  of the other according to chettle myself have seen his demeanour no less civil than he is excellent in the quality he professes that is in his profession as we say besides divers of worship have reported his uprightness of dealing which argues his honesty and his facetious grace in writing that approves his art  speaking from his own observation chettle avers that the person of whom he speaks is civil in his demeanour and apparently that he is excellent in the quality he professesin his profession  speaking on the evidence of divers of worship the same man is said to possess facetious grace in writing  had his writings been then published chettle a bookish man would have read them and formed his own opinion  works of lodge peele and marlowe had been published  writing is not the quality he professes is not the profession of the man to whom chettle refers  on the other hand the profession of greenes quondam acquaintance was writing they spend their wits in making plays  thus the man who wrote but whose profession was not that of writing does not so far appear to have been one of those addressed by greene  it seems undeniable that greene addresses gentlemen who are playmakers who spend their wits in making plays and who are not actors for greenes purpose is to warn them against the rich ungrateful actors  if greenes friends at the moment when he wrote were or if any one of them then was by profession an actor greenes warning to him against actors directed to an actor is not to me intelligible  but mr greenwood writes as i have shown george peele was one of the playwrights addressed by greene and peele was a successful player as well as playwright and might quite truly have been alluded to both as having facetious grace in writing and being excellent in the quality he professed that is as a professional actor 304a  i confess that i did not know that george peele ma of oxford had ever been a player and a successful player  but one may askin 1592 did george peele profess the quality of an actor was he then a professional actor and only an occasional playwright  if so i am not apt to believe that greene seriously advised him not to put faith in the members of his own profession  from them as a successful member of their profession a profession which as greene complains exploited dramatic authors peele stood in no danger  thus i do not see how chettles professional actor reported to have facetious grace in writing can be identified with peele  the identification seems to me impossible  peele and marlowe in 1592 were literary gentlemen lodge in 1592 was filibustering though a literary man he had not yet become a physician  in 1592 none of the three had any profession but that of literature so far as i am aware  the man who had a special profession and also wrote was not one of these three nor was he tom nash a mere literary gentleman pamphleteer and playwright  i do not know the name of any one of the three to whom greene addressed the groatsworth though the atheistic writer of tragedies seems meant and disgracefully meant for marlowe  i only know that chettle is expressing his regrets for greenes language to some one whom he applauded as to his exercise of his profession and who according to divers of worship had also facetious grace in writing  myself have seen him no less civil than he is excellent in the quality he professes whether or not this means that chettle has seen his excellence in his profession i cannot tell for certain but chettles remark is at least contrasted with what he gives merely from reportthe facetious grace in writing of the man in question  his writing is not part of his profession so he is not in 1592 i conceive lodge peele marlowe or nash  who then is this mysterious personage  malone dyce steevens collier halliwellphillipps knight sir sidney lee messrs gosse and garnett and mr j c collins say that he is will shakspere but mr fleay and mr castle whose mind is legal have pointed out that this weird being cannot be shakescene or shakspere if greene meant shakspere attacked by greene  for chettle says that in the groatsworth of wit a letter written to divers playmakers is offensively by one or two of them taken  the mysterious one is therefore one of the playwrights addressed by greene  consequently all the followers of malone who wrote before messrs fleay and castle are mistaken and what mr greenwood has to say about sir sidney lee j c collins and dr garnett and mr gosse in the way of moral reprobation may be read by the curious in his pages 305a  meanwhile if we take chettle to have been a strict grammarian by his wordsa letter written to divers playmakers is offensively by one or two of them taken will is excluded the letter was most assuredly not written to him  but i whose mind is not legal am not certain that chettle does not mean that the letter written to divers playmakers was by one or two makers of plays offensively taken  this opinion seems the less improbable as the person to whom chettle is most apologetic excels in a quality or profession which is contrasted with and is not identical with his facetious grace in writinga parergon or  byework in his case  whoever this person was he certainly was not marlowe peele lodge or nash  we must look for some other person who had a profession and also was reported to have facetious grace in writing  if chettle is to be held tight to grammar greene referred to some one unknown some one who wrote for the stage but had another profession  if chettle is not to be thus tautly construed i confess that to myself he seems to have had shakspere even will in his mind  for will in 1592 had a quality which he professed that of an actor and also i conceive was reported to have  facetious grace in writing  but other

1911 he makes such reply as the space permits to a paper of my own shakespeare or x in the september number  with my goodwill he might have written thirtytwo pages to my sixteen but i am not the editor and never heard of mr greenwoods note till may 1912  he says that i had represented him as stating that the unknown genius adopted the name of william shakespeare or shakespeare as a good nom de guerre without any reference to the fact that there was an actor in existence of the name of william shakspere whose name was sometimes written shakespeare and without the least idea that the works he published under this pseudonym would be fathered upon the actor     my meaning has obviously been too obscurely stated by me  mr greenwood next writes that the confusion between the actor and the unknown taking the name william shakespeare did happen and was intended to happen  cest la le miracle  how could it happen if the actor were the bookless ignorant man whom mr greenwood describes  it could not happen  will must have been unmasked in a day  the fact that a strange plot existed was only too obvious  the unknowns secret must have been tracked by the hounds of keenest nose in the packs of rival and jealous authors and of actors  none gives tongue  27a  francis bacon wrote shakespeare p 37  30a  the shakespeare problem restated p 333  31a  in the passage which i quoted with notes of omission from mr greenwood p 333 he went on to say that the eulogies of the poet by some cultured critics of that day afford no proof that the author who published under the name of shakespeare was in reality shakspere the stratford player  that position i later contest  31b  see chap xi the first folio  33a  the shakespeare problem restated pp 305 306  34a  furness merchant of
