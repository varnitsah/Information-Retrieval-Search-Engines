ericson was being naughty probably no boy in joralemon was being naughtier that october saturday afternoon he had not half finished the woodpiling which was his punishment for having chased the family rooster thirteen times squawking around the chickenyard while playing soldiers with bennie rusk  he stood in the middle of the musty woodshed pessimistically kicking at the scattered wood his face was stern as became a man of eight who was a soldier of fortune famed from the front gate to the chickenyard an unromantic film of dirt hid the fact that his scandinavian cheeks were like creamcolored silk stained with rosepetals a baby norseman with only an average boys prettiness yet with the whiteness and slenderness of a girls little finger a backyard boy in baggy jacket and pants gingham blouse and cap whose lining oozed back over his ashblond hair which was tangled now like trampled grass with a tiny chip riding grotesquely on one flossy lock  the darkness of the shed displeased carl the whole basic conception of work bored him the sticks of wood were personal enemies to which he gave insulting names he had always admired the hard bark and metallic resonance of the ironwood but he hated the poplarpopple it is called in joralemon minnesota poplar becomes dry and dusty and the bark turns to a monstrously mottled and evil greenishwhite carl announced to one poplar stick i could lick you im a genral i am the stick made no reply whatever and he contemptuously shied it out into the chickweed which matted the grubby back yard this necessitated his sneaking out and capturing it by stalking it from the rear lest it rouse the popple army  he loitered outside the shed sniffing at the smoke from burning leavesthe scent of autumn and migration and wanderlust he glanced down between houses to the reedy shore of joralemon lake the surface of the water was smooth and tinted like a bluebell save for one patch in the current where wavelets leaped with october madness in sparkles of diamond fire across the lake woods sprinkled with golddust and paprika broke the sweep of sparse yellow stubble and a red barn was softly brilliant in the caressing sunlight and lively air of the minnesota prairie over there was the field of valor where grownup men with shiny shotguns went hunting prairiechickens the great world leading clear to the red river valley and canada  three mallardducks with necks far out and wings beating hurriedly shot over carls head from far off a gunshot floated echoing through forest hollows in the waiting stillness sounded a roosters crow distant magical  i want to go hunting mourned carl as he trailed back into the woodshed it seemed darker than ever and smelled of moldy chips he bounced like an enraged chipmunk his phlegmatic chinablue eyes filmed with tears wont pile no more wood he declared  naughty he undoubtedly was but since he knew that his father oscar ericson the carpenter all knuckles and patched overalls and bad temper would probably whip him for rebellion he may have acquired merit he did not even look toward the house to see whether his mother was watching himhis farmbred worried kindly small flatchested pinchnosed bleached twangyvoiced plucky norwegian mother he marched to the workshop and brought a collection of miscellaneous nails and screws out to a bare patch of earth in front of the chickenyard they were the nail people the most reckless band of mercenaries the world has ever known led by old general doorhinge who was somewhat inclined to collapse in the middle but possessed of the unusual virtue of eyes in both ends of him he had explored the deepest ca√±ons of the woodshed and victoriously led his tenpenny warriors against the sumacs in the vacant lot beyond irving lambs house  carl marshaled the nail people sticking them upright in the ground after reasoning sternly with an intruding sparrow thus did the dauntless general doorhinge address them  men theres a nawful big army against us but les die like men my men forwards  as the veteran finished a devastating fire of stones enfiladed the company and one by one they fell save for the commander himself who bowed his grizzled wroughtsteel head and sobbed the brave boys done their duty  from across the lake rolled another gunshot  carl dug his grimy fingers into the earth jiminy i wisht i was out hunting why cant i never go i guess ill pile the wood but im gonna go seekmyfortune after that                                       since carl ericson some day to be known as hawk ericson was the divinely restless seeker of the romance that mustor we dielie beyond the hills you first see him in action find him in the year 1893 aged eight leading revolutions in the back yard but equally since this is a serious study of an average young american there should be an indication of his soilnourished ancestry  carl was secondgeneration norwegian americanborn american in speech american in appearance save for his flaxen hair and chinablue eyes and thanks to the flagdecked public school overwhelmingly american in tradition when he was born the typical americans of earlier stocks had moved to city palaces or were marooned on rundown farms it was carl ericson not a trowbridge or a stuyvesant or a lee or a grant who was the typical american of his period it was for him to carry on the american destiny of extending the western horizon his to restore the wintry pilgrim virtues and the exuberant october partridgedrumming days of daniel boone then to add in his own or another generation new american aspirations for beauty  they are the new yankees these scandinavians of wisconsin and minnesota and the dakotas with a human breed that can grow and a thousand miles to grow in the foreignborn parents when they first come to the northern middlewest huddle in unpainted farmhouses with grassless dooryards and flyzizzing kitchens and smelly dairies set on treeless shadeless unsoftened leagues of prairie or bunched in new clearings ragged with small stumps the first generation are alien and forlorn the echoing fjords of trondhjem and the moors of finmark have clipped their imaginations silenced their laughter hidden with ice their real tenderness in america they go sedulously to the bare lutheran church and frequently drink ninetypercent alcohol they are also heroes and have been the makers of a new land from the days of indian raids and oxteams and hillside dugouts to now repeating in their patient hewing the history of the western reserve in one generation or even in one decade they emerge from the desolation of being foreigners they and the germans pay yankee mortgages with blood and sweat they swiftly master politics voting for honesty rather than for handshakes they make keen scrupulously honest business deals send their children to school accumulate landone section two sectionsor move to town to keep shop and ply skilled tools become methodists and congregationalists are neighborly with yankee manufacturers and doctors and teachers and in one generation or less are completely american  so was it with carl ericson his carpenter father had come from norway by way of steerage and a farm in wisconsin changing his name from ericsen ericson senior owned his cottage and though he still said aye ban going he talked as naturally of his own american tariff and his own norwegianamerican governor as though he had five generations of connecticut or virginia ancestry  now it was carls to go on to seek the flowering                                       unconscious that he was the heirapparent of the age but decidedly conscious that the woodshed was dark carl finished the pile  from the step of the woodshed he regarded the world with plaintive boredom  irrrrrving he called  no answer from irving the nextdoor boy  the village was rustlingly quiet carl skipped slowly and unhappily to the group of boxelders beside the workshop and stuck his fingernails into the cobwebby crevices of the black bark he made overtures for company on any terms to a hoprobin a woolly worm and a large blue fly but they all scorned his advances and when he yelled an ingratiating invitation to a passing dog it seemed to swallow its tail and ears as it galloped off no one else appeared  before the kitchen window he quavered  mama  in the kitchen the muffled pounding of a sadiron upon the padded ironingboard  ma  mrs ericsons whiteyyellow hair pale eyes and small nervous features were shadowed behind the cotton flyscreen  vell she said  i havent got nothing to doo  go pile the vood  i piled piles of it  then you can go and play  i been playing  then play some more  i aint got nobody to play with  then find somebody but dont you step vun step out of this yard  i dont see why i cant go outa the yard  because i said so  again the sound of the sadiron  carl invented a game in which he was to run in circles but not step on the grass he made the tenth inspection that day of the drying hazelnuts whose husks were turning to sealbrown on the woodshed roof he hunted for a good new bottle to throw at irving lambs barn he mended his slingshot he perched on a sawbuck and watched the street nothing passed nothing made an interesting rattling except one democrat wagon  from over the water another gunshot murmured of distant hazards  carl jumped down from the sawbuck and marched deliberately out of the yard along oak street toward the hill the smart section of joralemon where live in exclusive state five large houses that get painted nearly every year  im gonna seekmyfortune im gonna find bennie and go swimming he vowed calmly as napoleon defying his marshals general carl disregarded the sordid facts that it was too late in the year to go swimming and that benjamin franklin rusk couldnt swim anyway he clumped along planting his feet with spats of dust very dignified and melancholy but like all small boys occasionally going mad and running in chase of nothing at all till he found it  he stopped before the house with mysterious shutters  carl had never made blieve fairies or princes rather he was in the secret world of boyhood a soldier a trapper or a swingbrakeman on the m  d rr but he was bespelled by the suggestion of grandeur in the iron fence and gracious trees and dark carriageshed of the house with shutters it was a large square solid brick structure set among oaks and sinister pines once the home or perhaps the mansion of banker whiteley but unoccupied for years leaves rotted before the deserted carriageshed the disregarded steps in front were seamed with shallow pools of water for days after a rain the windows had always been darkened but not by broadslatted outside shutters smeared with housepaint to which stuck tiny black hairs from the paintbrush like the ordinary frame houses of joralemon instead these windows were masked with inside shutters haughtily varnished to a hard refined brown  today the windows were open the shutters folded furniture was being moved in and just inside the iron gate a frilly little girl was playing with a whitewashed conchshell  she must have been about ten at that time since carl was eight she was a very dressy and complacent child possessed not only of a clean white muslin with three rows of tucks immaculate bronze boots and a green tamoshanter but also of a large hairribbon a ribbon sash and a silver chain with a large goldwashed heartshaped locket she was softly plump softly gentle of face softly brown of hair and softly pleasant of speech  hello said she  hlo  whats your name little boy  aint a little boy im carl ericson  oh are you im  im gonna have a shotgun when im fifteen he shyly hurled a stone at a telegraphpole to prove that he was not shy  my name is gertie cowles i came from minneapolis my mamma owns part of the joralemon flour mill are you a nice boy we just moved here and i dont know anybody maybe my mamma will let me play with you if you are a nice boy  i jus soon come play with you if you play soldiers my pa s the smartest man in joralemon he builded alex johnsons house hes got a tengauge gun  oh my mamma s a widow  carl hung by his arms from the gatepickets while she breathed mmmmmmy in admiration at the feat  that aint nothing i can hang by my knees on a trapeze what did you come from minneapolis for  were going to live here she said  oh  i went to the chicago worlds fair with my mamma this summer  aw you didnt  i did so and i saw a teeny engine so small it was in a walnutshell and you had to look at it through a magnifyingglass and it kept on running like anything  huh thats nothing ben rusk he went to the worlds fair too and he saw a statchue that was bigger n our house and all pure gold you didnt see that  i did so and we got cousins in chicago and we stayed with them and cousin edgar is a very prominent doctor for eyenear and stummick  aw ben rusks pa is a doctor too and hes got a brother whats going to be a sturgeon  i got a brother hes a year older than me his name is ray theres lots more people in minneapolis than there is in joralemon theres a hundred thousand people in minneapolis  that aint nothing my pa was born in christiania in the old country and theys a million million people there  oh there is not  honest there is  is there honest gertie was admiring now  he looked patronizingly at the redplush furniture which was being splendidly carried into the great house from jordans drayan old friend of carls which had often carried him banging through town he condescended  jiminy you dont know bennie rusk nor nobody do you ill bring him and we can play soldiers and we can make tents out of carpets did you ever run through carpets on the line  he pointed to the row of rugs and carpets airing beside the carriageshed  no is it fun  its awful scary but i aint afraid  he dashed at the carpets and entered their long narrow tent to tell the truth when he stepped from the sunshine into the intense darkness he was slightly afraid the ericsons one carpet made a short passage but to pass on and on and on through this succession of heavy rug mats where snakes and poisonous bugs might hide and where the roughthreaded gritty undersurface scratched his pushing hands was fearsome he emerged with a whoop and encouraged her to try the feat she peeped inside the first carpet but withdrew her head giving homage  oh its so dark in there where you went  he promptly performed the feat again  as they wandered back to the gate to watch the furnitureman gertie tried to regain the superiority due her years by remarking of a large escritoire which was being juggled into the front door my papa bought that desk in chicago  carl broke in ill bring bennie rusk and me and him ll teach you to play soldiers  my mamma dont think i ought to play games ive got a lot of dolls but im too old for dolls i play authors with mamma sometimes and dominoes authors is a very nice game  but maybe your ma will let you play indian squaw and me and bennie ll tie you to a stake and scalp you that wont be rough like soldiers but im going to be a reallytruly soldier im going to be a norficer in the army  i got a cousin thats an officer in the army gertie said grandly bringing her yellowribboned braid round over her shoulder and gently brushing her lips with the end  crossyourheart  umhuh  crossyourheart hopetdie if you aint  honest hes an officer  jiminy crickets say gertie could he make me a norficer lets go find him does he live near here  oh my no hes way off in san francisco  come on lets go

she dont let me play around with boys anyway shes in the house now and besides its way far off across the sea to san francisco its beyond the salt sea where the mormons live and they all got seven wives  beyond the sea like christiania ah taint its in america because mr lamb went there last winter sides even if it was across the sea couldnt we go an be stowways like the younger brothers and all them and little lord fauntleroy he went and was a lord and he wasnt nothing but a orphing my ma read me about him only she dont talk english very good but well go stowways he wound up triumphantly  gerrrrrrtrrrrrude a highpitched voice from the stoop  gertie glowered at a tall meager woman with a long greenandwhite apron over a most respectable black alpaca gown her nose was large her complexion dull but she carried herself so commandingly as to be almost handsome and very formidable  oh dear gertie stamped her foot now i got to go in i never can have any fun goodby carl  he urgently interrupted her tragic farewell say gee whillikins i know what well do you sneak out the back door and ill meet you and well run away and go seekourfortunes and well find your cousin  gerrrtrrrude from the stoop  yes mamma im just coming to carl sides im older n you and im most grownup and i dont believe in santy claus and onct i taught the infant class at st chrysostoms sundayschool when the teacher wasnt there anyway i and miss bessie did and i asked them most all the questions about the trumpets and pitchers so i couldnt run away im too old  gerrrtrrrude come here this instant  come on ill be waiting carl demanded  she was gone she was being ushered into the house of mysterious shutters by mrs cowles carl prowled down the street a fine new long stick at his side like a saber he rounded the block and waited back of the cowles carriageshed doing sentrygo and planning the number of parrots and pieces of eight he would bring back from san francisco then his father and mother would be sorry theyd talked about him in their norwegian  carl gertie was running around the corner of the carriageshed oh carl i had to come out and see you again but i cant go seekourfortunes with you cause theyve got the piano moved in now and i got to practise else ill grow up just an ignorant common person and besides theres going to be teabiscuits and honey for supper i saw the honey  he smartly swung his saber to his shoulder ordering come on  gertie edged forward perplexedly sucking a fingerjoint and followed him along lake street toward open country they took to the minnesota  dakota railroad track a natural footpath in a land where the trains were few and not fast as was the condition of the singletracked m  d of 1893 in a worried manner carl inquired whether san francisco was northwest or southeastthe directions in which ran all selfrespecting railroads gertie blandly declared that it lay to the northwest and northwest they startedtoward the swamps and the first forests of the big woods  he had wonderlands to show her along the track to him every detail was of scientific importance he knew intimately the topography of the fields beside the track in which corner of tubbss pasture between the track and the lake the scraggly wild clover grew and down what part of the gravelbank it was most exciting to roll as far along the track as the arch each railroad tie or sleeper had for him a personality the fat white tie which oozed at the end into an awkward knob he had always hated because it resembled a flattened grub a new tamarack tie with a sliver of fresh bark still on it recently put in by the section gang was an entertaining stranger and he particularly introduced gertie to his favorite a winecolored tie which always smiled  gertie though noblesse oblige compelled her to be gracious to the imprisoned ties writhing under the steel rails did not really show much enthusiasm till he led her to the justly celebrated arch even then she boasted of minnehaha falls and fort snelling and lake calhoun but upon his grieved solicitation declared that after all the twin cities had nothing to compare with the archa sandstone tunnel full twenty feet high miraculously boring through the railroad embankment and faced with great stones which you could descend by lowering yourself from stone to stone through the arch ran the creek with rare minnows in its pools while important paths led from the creek to a wilderness of hazelnutbushes he taught her to tear the drying husks from the nuts and crack the nuts with stones at his request gertie produced two pins from unexpected parts of her small frilly dress he found a piece of string and they fished for perch in the creek as they had no bait whatever their success was not large  a flock of ducks flew low above them seeking a pond for the night  jiminy carl cried its getting late we got to hurry its awful far to san francisco andi dont knowgee wherell we sleep tonight  we hadnt ought to go on had we  yes come on     chapter ii   from the creek they tramped nearly two miles through the dark gravelbanks of the railroad cut across the high trestle over joralemon river where gertie had to be coaxed from stringer to stringer they stopped only when a gopher in a clearing demanded attention gertie finally forgot the superiority of age when she saw carl whistle the quivering gophercry while the gopher sat as though hypnotized on his pile of fresh black earth carl stalked him as always happened the gopher popped into his hole just before carl reached him but it certainly did seem that he had nearly been caught and gertie was jumping with excitement when carl returned strutting cocking his saberstick over his shoulder  gertie was tired she the minneapolis girl had not been much awed by the railroad ties nor the arch but now she tramped proudly beside the man who could catch gophers till carl inquired  are you gettin awful hungry its amost suppertime  yes i am hungry trustingly  im going to go and swipe some taters i guess maybe theres a farmhouse over there i see a chimbly beyond the slough you stay here  i dassnt stay alone oh i better go home im scared  come on i wont let nothing hurt you  they circled a swamp surrounded by woods carls left arm about her his right clutching the saber though the sunset was magnificent and a gay company of blackbirds swayed on the reeds of the slough dusk was sneaking out from the underbrush that blurred the forest floor and gertie caught the panic fear she wished to go home at once she saw darkness reaching for them her mother would unquestionably whip her for staying out so late she discovered a mudsmear on the side of her skirt and a shoebutton was gone she was cold finally if she missed supper at home she would get no teabiscuits and honey gerties polite little stomach knew its rights and insisted upon them  i wish i hadnt come she lamented i wish i hadnt do you spose mamma will be dreadfully angry wont you splain to her you will wont you  it was carls duty as officer commanding to watch the blackened stumps that sprang from the underbrush and there was something way over in the woods beyond the trees horribly gashed to whiteness by lightning perhaps the something hadnt moved perhaps it was a stump  but he answered her loudly so that lurking robbers might overhear i know a great big man over there and hes a friend of mine hes a brakie on the m  d and he lets me ride in the caboose any time i want to and hes right behind us i was just making blieve gertie ill splain everything to your mother hes bigger n anybody more conversationally aw jiminy gertie dont cry please dont ill take care of you and if you aint going to have any supper well swipe some taters and roast em he gulped he hated to give up to return to woodshed and chickenyard but he conceded i guess maybe we hadnt better go seekourfortunes no more to  a long wail tore through the air the children shrieked together and fled stumbling in dry bog weeping in terror carls backbone was all one prickling bar of ice but he waved his stick fiercely and because he had to care for her was calm enough to realize that the wail must have been the cry of the bittern  it wasnt nothing but a bird gertie it cant hurt us heard em lots of times  nevertheless he was still trembling when they reached the edge of a farmyard clearing beyond the swamp it was graydark they could see only the mass of a barn and a farmers cabin both new to carl holding her hand he whispered  they must be some taters or beggies in the barn ill sneak in and see you stand here by the corncrib and work out some ears between the bars seelike this  he left her the sound of her frightened snivel aged him he tiptoed to the barn door eying a light in the farmhouse he reached far up to the latch of the broad door and pulled out the wooden pin the latch slipped noisily from its staple the door opened with a groaning creek and banged against the barn  paralyzed hearing all the silence of the wild clearing he waited there was a step in the house the door opened a huge farmer touslehaired blackbearded held up a lamp and peered out it was the black dutchman  the black dutchman was a living legend he often got drunk and rode past carls home at night lashing his horses and cursing in german he had once thrashed the schoolteacher for whipping his son he had no friends  oh dear oh dear i wisht i was home sobbed carl but he started to run to gerties protection  the black dutchman set down the lamp wer ist da i see you damnation he roared and lumbered out seizing a pitchfork from the manurepile  carl galloped up to gertie panting hes after us and dragged her into the hazelbushes beyond the corncrib as his countrybred feet found and followed a path toward deeper woods he heard the black dutchman beating the bushes with his pitchfork shouting  hiding i know vere you are hah  carl jerked his companion forward till he lost the path there was no light they could only crawl on through the bushes whose malicious fingers stung gerties face and plucked at her proud frills he lifted her over fallen trees freed her from branches and all the time between his own sobs he encouraged her and tried to pretend that their incredible plight was not the end of the world whimpering  were amost on the road now gertie honest we are i cant hear him now i aint afraid of himhe wouldnt dast hurt us or my pa would fix him  oh i hear him hes coming oh please save me carl  gee run fast aw i dont hear him i aint afraid of him  they burst out on a grassy woodland road and lay down panting they could see a strip of stars overhead and the world was dark silent in the inscrutable night of autumn carl said nothing he tried to make out where they werewhere this road would take them it might run deeper into the woods which he did not know as he did the arch environs and he had so twisted through the brush that he could not tell in what direction lay either the main wagonroad or the m  d track  he lifted her up and they plodded hand in hand till she said  im awful tired its awful cold my feet hurt awfully carl dear oh pleassssse take me home now i want my mamma maybe she wont whip me now its so dark andohhhhhh she muttered incoherently there by the road hes waiting for us she sank down her arm over her face groaning dont hurt me  carl straddled before her on guard there was a distorted mass crouched by the road just ahead he tingled with the chill of fear down through his thighs he had lost his sticksaber but he bent felt for and found another stick and piped to the shadowy watcher  i aint afffraid of you you gwan away from here  the watcher did not answer  i know who you are bellowing with fear carl ran forward furiously waving his stick and clamoring you better not touch me the stick came down with a silly flat clack upon the watchera roadside boulder its just a rock gertie jiminy im glad its just a rock aw i knew it was a rock all the time ben rusk gets scared every time he sees a stump in the woods and he always thinks its a robber  chattily carl went back lifted her again endured her kissing his cheek and they started on  im so cold gertie moaned from time to time till he offered  ill try and build a fire maybe we better camp i got a match what i swiped from the kitchen maybe i can make a fire so we better camp  i dont want to camp i want to go home  i dont know where we are i told you  can you make a regular campfire like indians  umhuh  lets but i rather go home  you aint scared now are you gertie gee youre a awful brave girl  no but im cold and i wisht we had some teabiscuits  ever too complacent was miss gertrude cowles the good girl in whatever group she joined but she seemed to trust in carls heroism and as she murmured of a certain chilliness she seemed to take it for granted that he would immediately bring her some warmth carl had never heard of the romantic males who in fiction so frequently offer their coats to ladies fair but chill yet he stripped off his jacket and wrapped it about her while his ginghamclad shoulders twitched with cold  i can hear a crick way way over there les camp by it he decided  they scrambled through the brush carl leading her and feeling the way he found a patch of long grass beside the creek with only his tremulous hands for eyes he gathered leaves twigs and dead branches and piled them together in a pyramid as he had been taught to do by the older woodsfaring boys  it was still no wind but carl who had gobbled up every word he had heard about deerhunting in the north woods got a great deal of interesting fear out of dreading what might happen if his one match did not light he made gertie kneel beside him with the jacket outspread and he hesitated several times before he scratched the match it flared up the leaves caught the pile of twigs was instantly aflame  he wept jiminy if it hadnt lighted by and by he announced loudly i wasnt afraid to convince himself and sat up throwing twigs on the fire grandly  gertie who didnt really appreciate heroism sighed im hungry and  my secondgrade teacher told us a story how they was a arctic explorer and he was out in a blizzard  and i wish we had some teabiscuits concluded gertie companionably but firmly  ill go pick some hazelnuts  he left her feeding the flame as he crept away the fire behind him he was dreadfully frightened now that he had no one to protect a few yards from the fire he stopped in terror he clutched a branch so tightly that it creased his palm two hundred yards away across the creek was the small square of a lighted window hovering detached in the darkness  for a panicfilled second carl was sure that it must be the black dutchmans window his tired childmind whined but there was no creek near the black dutchmans though he did not want to venture up to the unknown light he growled i will if i want to and limped forward  he had to cross the creek the strange creek whose steppingstones he did not know shivering hesitant he stripped off his shoes and stockings and dabbled the edge of the water with reluctant toes to see if it was cold it was  doggone he swore mightily he plunged in waded across  he found a rock and held it ready to throw at the dog that was certain to come snapping at him as he tiptoed through the clearing his wet legs smarted with cold the fact that he was trespassing made him feel more forlornly lost than ever but he stumbled up to the oneroom shack that was now shaping itself against the sky it was a house that he believed he had never seen before when he reached it he stood for fully a minute afraid to move but from across the creek whimpered gerties call  carl oh carl where are you  he had to hurry he crept along the side of the shack to the window it was too high in the wall for him to peer through he felt for something to stand upon and found a short board which he wedged against the side of the shack  he looked through the dusty window for a second he sprang from the board  alone in the shack was the one person about joralemon more feared more fabulous than the black dutchmanbone stillman the man who didnt believe in god  bone stillman read robert g ingersoll and said what he thought otherwise he was not dangerous to the public peace a lone old bachelor farmer it was said that he had been a sailor or a policeman a college professor or a priest a forger or an embezzler nothing positive was known except that three years ago he had appeared and bought this farm he was a grizzled man of fiftyfive with a long tobaccostained gray mustache and an opennecked blueflannel shirt to carl beside the shack bone stillman was all that was demoniac  gertie was calling again carl climbed upon his board and resumed his inspection seeking a course of action  the oneroom shack was lined with tarpaper on which were pinned lithographs of robert g ingersoll karl marx and napoleon under a gunrack made of deer antlers was a cupboard half filled with dingy books shotgun shells and fishing tackle bone was reading by a pine table still littered with supperdishes before him lay a cleanlimbed english setter the dog was asleep in the shack was absolute stillness and loneliness intimidating  while carl watched bone dropped his book and said here bob what dyou think of singletax heh  carl gazed apprehensively no one but bone was in the shack it was said that the devil himself sometimes visited here on carl was the chill of a nightmare  the dog raised his head stirred blinked pounded his tail on the floor and rose a gentlemanly affable chap to lay his muzzle on bones knee while the solitary droned  this fellow says in this book here that the city s the natural place to liveaboriginal tribes prove man s naturally gregarious what dyou think about it heh bob bum country this is no thinking what in the name of the seven saintly sisters did i ever want to be a farmer for heh  lets skedaddle bob  i aint an atheist im an agnostic  lonely bob go over and talk to his whiskers karl marx hes liberal he dont care what you say he oh shut up youre damn poor company say something  carl still motionless was the more agonized because there was no sound from gertie not even a sobbing call anything might have happened to her while he was coaxing himself to knock on the pane stillman puttered about the shack petting the dog filling his pipe he passed out of carls range of vision toward the side of the room in which was the window  a huge hand jerked the window open and caught carl by the hair two wild faces stared at each other six inches apart  i saw you came here to plague me roared bone stillman  oh mister oh please mister i wasnt me and gertie is lost in the woodsweouch oh please lemme go  why youre just a brat come here  the lean arm of bone stillman dragged carl through the window by the slack of his gingham waist  lost heh wheres tother onegertie was it  shes over in the woods  poor little tyke wait ll i light my lantern  the swinging lantern made friendly everchanging circles of light and carl no longer feared the dangerous territory of the yard riding pickaback on bone stillman he looked down contentedly on the dogs deferential tail beside them they found gertie asleep by the fire she scarcely awoke as stillman picked her up and carried her back to his shack she nestled her downy hair beneath his chin and closed her eyes  stillman said cheerily as he ushered them into his mansion ill hitch up and take you back to town you young tropical tramps first you better have a bite to eat though what do kids eat bub  the dog was nuzzling carls hand and carl had almost forgotten his fear that the devil might appear he was flatteringly friendly in his answer porritch and meat and potatoesonly i dont like potatoes andpie  fraid i havent any pie but howd some bacon and eggs go as he stoked up his cannonball stove and sliced the bacon stillman continued to the children who were shyly perched on the buffalorobe cover of his bed were you scared in the woods  yes sir  dont ever fordablast that egg dont forget this son nothing outside of you can ever hurt you it can chew up your toes but it cant reach you nobody but you can hurt you let me try to make that clear old man if i can  theres your fodder draw up and set to pretty sleepy are you ill tell you a story j like to hear about how napoleon smashed the theory of divine rule or about how me and charlie weems explored tiburon well  though carl afterward remembered not one word of what bone stillman said it is possible that the outcasts treatment of him as a grownup friend was one of the most powerful of the intangible influences which were to push him toward the great world outside of joralemon the schoolbound childtaught by young ladies that the worst immorality was whispering in school the chief virtue a dull quietudewas here first given a reasonable basis for supposing that he was not always to be a backyard boy  the man in the flannel shirt who chewed tobacco who wrenched infinitives apart and thrust profane words between was for fifteen minutes carls froebel and montessori  carls recollection of listening to bone blurs into one of being somewhere in the back of a wagon beside gertie wrapped in buffalo robes and of being awakened by the stopping of the wagon when bone called to a band of men with lanterns who were searching for the missing gertie apparently the next second he was being lifted out before his home and his aproned mother was kissing him and sobbing oh my boy he snuggled his head on her shoulder and said  im cold but im going to san francisco     chapter iii   carl ericson grown to sixteen and long trousers trimmed the arclights for the joralemon power and lighting company after school then at eddie klemms billiardparlor he won two games of kelly pool smoked a cigarette of flake tobacco and wheatstraw paper and chipped in five cents toward a can of beer  a slender carl hesitating in speech but with plenty to say rangy as a setter pup silkenhaired his scandinavian cheeks like petals at an age when his companions faces were like maps of the moon stubborn and healthy wearing a celluloid collar and a plain black fourinhand a blueeyed undistinguished awkward busy proletarian of sixteen to whom evening clothes and poetry did not exist but who quivered with inarticulate determinations to see minneapolis or even chicago to him it was sheer romance to parade through town with a tin haversack of carbons for the arclights familiarly lowering the highhung mysterious lamps while his plodding acquaintances clerked in stores on saturdays or tended furnaces sometimes he donned the virileand noisyuniform of an electrician army gauntlets a coil of wire poleclimbers strapped to his legs crunching his steel spurs into the crisp pine wood of the lightingpoles he carelessly ascended to the place of humming wires and red crossbars and greenglass insulators while crowds of two and three small boys stared in awe from below at such moments carl did not envy the aristocratic leisure of his highschool classmate fatty ben rusk who as son of the leading doctor did not work but stayed home and read library books  carls own home was not adapted to the enchantments of a boys reading perfectly comfortable it was and clean with the hard cleanness that keeps oilcloth looking perpetually unused but it was so airlessly respectable that it doubled carls natural restlessness it had been old oscar ericsons labor of love but the carpenter loved shininess more than space and leisure his model for a house would have been a pine drygoods box grained in imitation of oak oscar ericson radiated intolerance and a belief in unimaginative unresting labor every evening collarless and carpetslippered ruffling his broomcolored hair or stroking his large long chin while his shirttab moved ceaselessly in time to his breathing he read a norwegian paper carls mother darned woolen socks and thought about milkpans and the neighbors and breakfast the creak of rockers filled the unventilated oilclothfloored sittingroom the sound was as unchanging as the sacred positions of the crayon enlargement of mrs ericsons father the greenglass tophat for matches or the violent ingrain rug with its dogshead pattern  carls own room contained only plaster walls a narrow wooden bed a bureau a kitchen chair fifteen minutes in this irreproachable home sent carl off to eddie klemms billiardparlor which was not irreproachable  he rather disliked the bitterness of beer and the acrid specks of cigarette tobacco that stuck to his lips but the bunch at eddies were among the few people in joralemon who were conscious of life eddies establishment was a long whiteplastered room with a pressedsteel ceiling and an unswept floor on the walls were billiardtablemakers calendars and a collection of cigarettepremium chromos portraying bathing girls the girls were of lithographic complexions almost too perfect of feature and their lips were more than ruby carl admired them                                       a september afternoon the sixteenyearold carl was tipped back in a chair at eddie klemms one foot on a rung while he discussed village scandals and told outrageous stories with eddie klemm a brisk moneymaker and vulgarian aged twentythree who wore a fancy vest and celluloid buttons on his lapels ben rusk hesitatingly poked his head through the door  eddie klemm called with businesslike cordiality hlo fatty come in hows your good health havent reformed have you going to join us roughnecks come on ill teach you to play pool wont cost you a cent  no i guess i hadnt better i was just looking for carl  well well fatty aint we reefined why do we guess we hadnt to probably maybe oughtnt to had better  oh i dont know some day ill learn i guess sighed fatty ben rusk who knew perfectly that with a doctor father a religious mother and an effeminate taste for reading he could never be a town sport  hey watch out shrieked eddie  whwhats the matter gasped fatty  the floor s falling on you  ththaw say youre kidding me said fatty weakly with a propitiating smile  dont worry son youre the third guy today that ive caught on that stick around son and sit in any time and ill learn you some pool you got just the right build for a champ player have a cigarette  the social amenities whereby joralemon prepares her youth for the graces of life having been recognized fatty rusk hitched a chair beside carl and muttered  say carl heres what i wanted to tell you i was just up to the cowleses to take back a french grammar i borrowed to look atmaybe that aint a hardlooking language what dyou think mrs cowles told me gertie is expected back tomorrow  gee whiz i thought she was going to stay in new york for two years and shes only been gone six months  i guess mrs cowles is kind of lonely without her ben mooned  so now youll be all nice and in love with gertie again heh it certainly gets me why you want to fall in love fatty when you could go hunting  if youd read about king arthur and galahad and all them instead of reading the scientific american and about these fool horseless carriages and stuffthere never will be any practical use for horseless carriages anyway  there will growled carl  my mother says she dont believe the lord ever intended us to ride without horses or what did he give us horses for and the things always get stuck in the mud and you have to walk homemother was reading that in a newspaper just the other day  son let me tell you ill own a horseless carriage some day and i bet i go an average of twenty miles an hour with it maybe forty  oh rats but i was saying if youd read some library books youd know about love why what d god put love in the world for  say will you quit explaining to me about what god did things for  ouch quit awwww quit carl say listen heres what i wanted to tell you how if you and me and adelaide benner and some of us went down to the depot to meet gertie tomorrow she comes in on the twelvefortyseven  well all right say bennie you dont want to be worried when i kid you about being in love with gertie i dont think ill ever get married but its all right for you                                       saturday morning was so cool so radiant that carl awakened early to a conviction that no matter how important meeting gertie might be in the cosmic scheme he was going hunting he was downstairs by five he fried two eggs called dollar ingersoll his dogson of robert ingersoll stillman gentleman dogthen in canvas huntingcoat and slouchhat tramped out of town southward where the woods ended in prairie gerties arrival was forgotten  it was a gipsy day the sun rolled splendidly through the dry air over miles of wheat stubble whose grayyellow prickles were transmuted by distance into tawny velvet seeming only the more spacious because of the straight thin lines of barbedwire fences lined with goldenrod and solitary houses in willow groves the dips and curves of the rolling plain drew him on the distances satisfied his eyes a pleasant hum of insects filled the lands wide serenity with hidden life  carl left a trail of happy monotonous whistling behind him all day as his dog followed the winding trail of prairiechickens as a covey of chickens rose with booming wings and he swung his shotgun for a bead he stopped by prairiesloughs or brightgreen bogs to watch for a duck he hailed as equals the occasional groups of hunters in twoseated buggies quartering the fields after circling dogs he lunched contentedly on sandwiches of cold lamb and lay with his arms under his head gazing at a steeple fully ten miles away  by six of the afternoon he had seven prairiechickens tucked inside the long pocket that lined the tail of his coat and he headed for home superior to miles his quiet eyes missing none of the purple asters and goldenrod  as he began to think he felt a bit guilty the flowers suggested gertie he gathered a large bunch poking stalks of aster among the goldenrod examining the result at armslength yet when he stopped at the rusks in town to bid bennie take the rustic bouquet to gertie he replied to reproaches  what you making all the fuss about my not being there to meet her for she got here all right didnt she what j expect me to do kiss her you ought to known it was too good a day for hunting to miss hows gert have a good time in new york  carl himself took the flowers to her however and was so shyly attentive to her account of new york that he scarcely stopped to speak to the cowleses hired girl who was his second cousin mrs cowles overheard him shout hello lena hows it going to the hired girl with cousinly ease mrs cowles seemed chilly carl wondered why                                       from month to month of his junior year in high school carl grew more discontented he let the lines of his cicero fade into a gray blur that confounded ciceros blatant virtue and catalines treachery while he pictured himself tramping with snowshoes and a mackinaw coat into the snowy solemnities of the northern minnesota tamarack swamps much of his discontent was caused by his learned preceptors the teachers for this year were almost perfectly calculated to make any lad of the slightest independence hate culture for the rest of his life with the earnestness and industry usually ascribed to the devil prof sybrant e larsen b a platonis miss mcdonald and miss muzzy kept up ninetyfive per cent discipline and seven per cent instruction in anything in the least worth while  miss muzzy was sarcastic and proud of it she was sarcastic to carl when he gruffly asked why he couldnt study french instead of all this latin stuff if there be any virtue in the study of latin and we have all forgotten all our latin except the fact that suburb means under the cityi e a subway carl was blinded to it for ever miss muzzy wore eyeglasses and had no bosom carls father used to say approvingly dat miss muzzy dont stand for no nonsense and mrs dr rusk often had her for dinner miss mcdonald fat and slowspoken and kind prone to use the word dearie to read longfellow and to have buttons off her shirtwaists used on carl a feminine weapon more unfair than the robust sarcasm of miss muzzy for after irritating a selfrespecting boy into rudeness by pawing his soul with damp puffy hands she would weep she was a kind honest and reverent bovine carl sat under her supervision in the junior room with its hardwood and blackboards and plaster high windows and portraits of washington and a president who was either madison or monroe no one ever remembered which he hated the eternal school smell of drinkingwater pails and chalk and slates and varnish he loathed the blackboard erasers white with crayondust he found inspiration only in the laboratory where prof larsen mistaught physics and rebuked questions about the useless part of chemistrythat is the part that wasnt in their textbooks  as for literature ben rusk persuaded him to try captain marryat and conan doyle carl met sherlock holmes in a paperbound book during a wait for flocks of mallards on the duckpass which was a little temple of silver birches bare with november he crouched down in his canvas coat and rubber boots gun across knees and read for an hour without moving as he tramped home into a vast minnesota sunset like a furnace of fantastic coals past the garnettinged ice of lakes he kept his gun cocked and under his elbow ready for the royal robber who was dogging the personage of baker street  he hunted much distinguished himself in geometry and chemistry nearly flunked in cicero and english learned to play an extraordinarily steady game of bottle pool at eddie klemms  and always gertie cowles gently hesitant toward ben rusks affection kept asking carl why he didnt come to see her oftener and play tiddledywinks  on the friday morning before christmas vacation carl and ben rusk were cleaning up the chemical laboratory its pine experimentbench and iron sink and rough floor bennie worried a rag in the sink with the resigned manner of a man who having sailed with purple banners the sunset sea of tragedy goes bravely on with a life gray and weary  the town was excited gertie cowles was giving a party and she had withdrawn her invitation to eddie klemm gertie was staying away from high school gracefully recovering from a cold for two weeks the junior and senior classes had been furtively exhibiting her hollydecked cards of invitation eddie had been included but after his quarrel with howard griffin a plato college freshman who was spending the vacation with ray cowles it had been explained to eddie that perhaps he would be more comfortable not to come to the party  gerties brother murray or ray was the town hero he had captained the highschool football team he was tall and very blackhaired and he jollied the girls it was said that twenty girls in joralemon and wakamin and a grass widow in st hilary wrote to him he was now a freshman in plato college plato minnesota he had brought home with him his classmate howard griffin whose people lived in south dakota and were said to be wealthy griffin had been very haughty to eddie klemm when introduced to that brisk young man at the billiardparlor and now the town eagerly learned eddie had been rejected of society  in the laboratory carl was growling well say fatty if it was right for them to throw eddie out where do i come in his dad s a barber and mine s a carpenter and thats just as bad or how about you i was reading that docs used to be just barbers  aw thunder said ben rusk the doctors scion uncomfortably youre just arguing i dont believe that about doctors being barbers dont it tell about doctors way back in the bible why of course luke was a physician sides it aint a question of eddies being a barbers son i shd think youd realize that gertie isnt well she wouldnt want to have to entertain both eddie and griffin and griffin s her guest and besides  youre getting all tangled up if i was to let you go on youd trip over a long word and bust your dome come on weve done enough cleaning les hike come on up to the house and help me on my bobs i got a new scheme for pivoting the back sled you just wait till tonight im going to tell gertie and mister howard griffin just what i think of them for being such twobit snobs and your future mainlaw gee im glad i dont have to be in love with anybody and become a snob come on  out of this wholesome democratic and stuffy village life carl suddenly stepped into the great world a motorcar the first he had ever seen was drawn up before the hennepin house  he stopped his chinablue eyes widened his shoulders shot forward to a rigid stoop of astonishment his mouth opened he gasped as they ran to join the gathering crowd  a horseless carriage do you get that theres one here he touched the bonnet of the twocylinder 1901 car and worshiped under therethe engine and theres where you steer i will own one gee youre right fatty i believe i will go to college and then ill study mechanical engineering  thought you said you were going to try and go to annapolis and be a sailor  no rats im going to own a horseless carriage and im going to tour every state in the union think of seeing mountains and the ocean and going twenty miles an hour like a train     chapter iv   while carl prepared for gertie cowless party by pressing his trousers with his mothers flatiron while he blacked his shoes and took his weekly spongebath he was perturbed by partisanship with eddie klemm and a longing for the world of motors and some anxiety as to how he could dance at the party when he could not dance  he clumped up the new stone steps of the cowles house carelessly not unusually shy ready to tell gertie what he thought of her treatment of eddie then the front door opened and an agonized carl was smothered in politeness his second cousin lena the cowleses hired girl was opening the door stiff and uncomfortable in a cap a black dress and a small frilly apron that dangled on her boniness like a lace kerchief pinned on a broomhandle murray cowles rushed up he was in evening clothes  behind murray mrs cowles greeted carl with thawed majesty we are so glad to have you carl wont you take your things off in the room at the head of the stairs  an affable introduction to howard griffin also in evening clothes was poured on carl like soothing balm said griffin mighty glad to meet you ericson ray told me youd make a ripping sprinter the captain of the track team ll be on the lookout for you when you get to plato course youre going to go there the u of minn is too big youll do something for old plato wish i could but all i can do is warble like a darn dickybird have a cigarette theyre just starting to dance come on old man come on ray  carl was drawn downstairs and instantly precipitated into a dance regarding which he was sure only that it was either a waltz a twostep or something else it filled with glamour the cowles librarythe only parlor in joralemon that was called a library and the only one with a fireplace or a polished hardwood floor grandeur was in the red lambrequins over the doors and windows the bead porti√®re a handpainted coalscuttle small round paintings of flowers set in black velvet an enormous blackwalnut bookcase with fully a hundred volumes and the two lamps of greenmottled shades and wroughtiron frames set on pyrographed leather skins brought from new york by gertie the light was courtly on the polished floor adelaide bennera new adelaide in chiffon over yellow satin and patentleather slippersgrinned at him and ruthlessly towed him into the tide of dancers in the spell of society no one seemed to remember eddie klemm adelaide did not mention the incident  carl found himself bumping into others continually apologizing to adelaide and the restand not caring for he saw a vision each time he turned toward the south end of the room he beheld gertie cowles glorified  she was out of anklelength dresses she looked her impressive eighteen in a foaming long white mull that showed her soft throat a red rose was in her brown hair she reclined in a big chair of leather and oak and smiled her gentlest especially when carl bobbed his head to her  he had always taken her as a matter of course she had no age no sex no wonder that afternoon she had been a negligible bit of joralemon to be accused of snobbery toward eddie klemm and always to be watched suspiciously lest she spring some new york airs on us gertie had craftily seemed unchanged after her new york enlightenment till nowhere she was suddenly grownup and beautiful haloed with a peculiar magic which distinguished her from all the rest of the world  shes the one that would ride in that horseless carriage when i got it carl exulted that must be a train that thing shes got on  after the dance he disposed of adelaide benner as though she were only a sister he hung over the back of gerties chair and urged i was awful sorry to hear you were sick say you look wonderful tonight  im so glad you could come to my party oh i must speak to you aboutdo you suppose you would ever get very very angry at poor me me so bad sometimes  he cut an awkward little caper to show his aplomb and assured her i guess probably ill kill you some time all right  no listen carl im dreadfully serious i hope you didnt go and get dreadfully angry at me about eddie klemm i know eddie s good friends with you and i did want to have him come to my party but you see it was this way mr griffin is our guest he likes you a lot carl isnt he a dandy fellow i guess adelaide and hazel re just crazy about him i think hes just as swell as the men in new york eddie and he didnt get along very well together it isnt anybodys fault i dont guess i thought eddie would be lots happier if he didnt come dont you see  oh no of course oh yes i see sure i can see howsay gertie i never did know you could look so grownup i suppose now youll never play with me  i want you to be a good friend of mine always we always have been awfully good friends havent we  yes do you remember how we ran away  and how the black dutchman chassssed us her sweet and complacent voice was so cheerful that he lost his awe of her new magic and chortled  and how we used to play pumpumpullaway  she delicately leaned her cheek on a fingertip and sighed yes i wonder if we shall ever be so happy as when we were young i dont believe you care to play with me so much now  oh gee gertie like to the shyness was on him again say are you feeling better now youre all over being sick  almost now ill be back in school right after vacation  its you that dont want to play i guess i cant get over that long white dress it makes you look sooh you know so uh  theyre going to dance again i wish i felt able to dance  let me sit and talk to you gertie instead of dancing  i suppose youre dreadfully bored though when you could be down at the billiardparlor  yes i could not eddie klemm and his fancy vest wouldnt have much chance alongside of griffin in his dresssuit course i dont want to knock eddie him and me are pretty good sidekicks  oh no i understand its just that people have to go with their own class dont you think  oh yes sure i do think so myself carl said it with a spurious society manner in gerties aristocratic presence he desired to keep aloof from all vulgar persons  of course i think we ought to make allowances for eddies father carl but then  she sighed with the responsibilities of noblesse oblige and carl gravely sighed with her  he brought a stool and sat at her feet immediately he was afraid that every one was watching him ray cowles bawled to them as he passed in the waltz watch out for that carl gert hes a regular badix  carls scalp tickled but he tried to be very offhand in remarking you must have gotten that dress in new york didnt you why havent you ever told me about new york youve hardly told me anything at all  well i like that and you never been near me to give me a chance  i guess i was kind of scared you wouldnt care much for joralemon after new york  why carl you mustnt say that to me  i didnt mean to hurt your feelings gertie honestly i didnt i was just joking i didnt think youd take me seriously  as though i could forget my old friends even in new york  i didnt think that straight please tell me about new york thats the place all right jiminy wouldnt i like to go there  i wish you could have been there carl we had such fun in my school there werent any boys in it but we  no boys in it why hows that  why it was just for girls  i see he said fatuously completely satisfied  we did have the best times carl i must tell you about one awfully naughty thing carrieshe was my chum in schooland i did there was a stock company on twentythird street and we were all crazy about the actors especially clements devereaux and one afternoon carrie told the principal she had a headache and i asked if i could go home with her and read her the assignments for next day they called the lessons assignments there and they thought i was such a meek little country mouse that i wouldnt ever fib and so they let us go and what do you think we did she had tickets for the two orphans at the stock company youve never seen the two orphans have you its perfectly splendid i used to weep my eyes out over it and afterward we went and waited outside right near the stage entrance and what do you think the leading man clements devereaux went right by us as near as i am to you oh carl i wish you could have seen him maybe he wasnt the handsomest thing he had the blackest curliest hair and he wore a thumb ring  i dont think much of all these hamfatters growled carl actors always go broke and have to walk back to chicago dont you think it d be better to be a civil engineer or something like that instead of having to slick up your hair and carry a cane theyre just dudes  why of course carl you silly boy you dont suppose id take clements seriously do you you silly boy  im not a boy  i dont mean it that way she sat up touched his shoulder and sank back he blushed with bliss and the fear that some one had seen as she continued i always think of you as just as old as i am we always will be wont we  yes  now you must go and talk to doris carson poor thing she always is a wallflower  however much he thought of common things as he left her beyond those common things was the miracle that gertie had grown into the one perfect divinely ordained woman and that he would talk to her again he danced the virginia reel instead of clumping sulkily through the steps as at other parties he heeded adelaide benners lessons and watched gertie in the hope that she would see how well he was dancing he shouted a demand that they play skip to maloo and cried down the shy girls who giggled that they were too old for the childish partygame he howled without prejudice in favor of any particular key the ancient words      rats in the sugarbowl two by two     bats in the belfry two by two     rats in the sugarbowl two by two         skip to maloo my darling  in the nonchalant company of the smarter young bachelors upstairs he smoked a cigarette but he sneaked away he paused at the bend in the stairs below him was gertie silvergowned wonderful he wanted to go down to her he would have given up his chance for a motorcar to be able to swagger down like an eddie klemm for the carl ericson who sailed his iceboat over inchthick ice was timid now he poked into the library and in a nausea of discomfort he conversed with mrs cowles mrs cowles doing the conversing  are you going to be a republican or a democrat carl asked the forbidding lady  yessum mumbled carl peering over at gerties throne where ben rusk was being cultured  i hope you are having a good time we always wish our young friends to have an especially good time at gertrudes parties mrs cowles sniffed and bowed away  carl sat beside adelaide benner in the decorous and giggling circle that ringed the room waiting for the refreshments he was healthily interested in devouring maple icecream and chocolate layercake but all the while he was spying on the group gathering about gertieben rusk howard griffin and joe jordan he took the most strategic precautions lest some one think that he wanted to look at gertie made such ponderous efforts to prove he was carefree that every one knew something was the matter  ben rusk was taking no part in the gaiety of howard and joe the serious man of letters was not easily led into paths of frivolity carl swore to himself ben s the only guy i know thats got any delicate feelings he appreciates how gertie feels when shes sick poor girl he dont make a goat of himself like joe or maybe hes got a stomachache  postoffice cried howard griffin to the room at large come on were all of us going to be kids again and play postoffice whos the first girl wants to be kissed  the idea giggled adelaide benner  me for adelaide bawled joe jordan  oh jooe bet i kiss gertie from irving lamb  the idea  just as if we were children  he must think were kids again  shamey winnie wants to be kissed and carl wont  i dont either so there  i think its awful  bet i kiss gertie  carl was furious at all of them as they strained their shoulders forward from their chairs and laughed he asked himself havent these galoots got any sense  to speak so lightly of kissing gertie he stared at the smooth rounding of her left cheek below the cheekbone till it took a separate identity and its white softness filled the room  ten minutes afterward playing postoffice he was facing gertie in the semidarkness of the sittingroom authorized by the game to kiss her shut in with his divinity  she took his hand her voice was crooning are you going to kiss me terribly hard  he tried to be gracefully mocking oh yes sure im going to eat you alive  she was waiting  he wished that she would not hold his hand within he groaned gee whiz i feel foolish he croaked do you feel better now youll catch more cold in here wont you theres kind of a draught lemme look at this window  crossing to the obviously tight window he ran his finger along the edge of the sash with infinite care he trembled in a second now he had to turn and make light of the lips which he would fain have approached with ceremony pompous and lingering  gertie flopped into a chair laughing i believe youre afraid to kiss me fraid cat youll never be a squire of dames like those actors are all right for you  i am not afraid he piped even his prized semibass voice had deserted him he rushed to the back of her chair and leaned over confused determined hastily he kissed her the kiss landed on the tip of her cold nose  and the whole party was tumbling in crying  time s up you cant hug her all evening  did you see he kissed her on the nose  did he ohhhhh  time s up cant try it again  joe jordan in the van was dancing fantastically scraping his forefinger at carl in token of disgrace  the riotous crowd gertie and carl among them flooded out again to show that he had not minded the incident of the misplaced kiss carl had to be very loud and merry in the library for a few minutes but when the game of postoffice was over and mrs cowles asked ray to turn down the lamp in the sittingroom carl insisted  ill do it mrs cowles im nearer n ray and bolted  he knew that he was wicked in not staying in the library and continuing his duties to the party he had to crowd into a minute all his agonizing and be back at once  it was beautiful in the stilly sittingroom away from the noisy crowd to hear loves heart beating he darted to the chair where gertie had sat and guiltily kissed its arm he tiptoed to the table blew out the lamp remembered that he should only have turned down the wick tried to raise the chimney burnt his fingers snatched his handkerchief dropped it groaned picked up the handkerchief raised the chimney put it on the table searched his pockets for a match found it dropped it picked it up from the floor dropped his knife from his pocket as he stooped felt itchy about the scalp picked up the knife relighted the lamp exquisitely adjusted the chimneyand again blew out the flame and swore  as darkness whirled into the room again the vision of gertie came nearer then he understood his illness and gasped great jumping jupiter on a high mountain i guessiminlove me  the party was breaking up each boy as he accompanied a girl from the yellow lamplight into the belowzero cold shouted and scuffled the snow to indicate that there was nothing serious in his attentions and immediately tried to manoeuver his girl away from the others mrs cowles was standing in the hallnot hurrying the guests away you understand but perfectly resigned to accepting any farewellswhen gertie moving gently among them with little sounds of pleasure penned carl in a corner and demanded  are you going to see some one home i suppose youll forget poor me completely now  i will not  i wanted to tell you what ray and mr griffin said about plato and about being lawyers isnt it nice youll know them when you go to plato  yes it ll be great  mr griffin s going to be a lawyer and maybe ray will too and why dont you think about being one you can get to be a judge and know all the best people it would be lovely refining influencestheythats  i couldnt ever be a highclass lawyer like griffin will said carl his head on one side much pleased  you silly boy of course you could i think youve got just as much brains as he has and ray says they all look up to him even in plato and i dont see why plato isnt just as goodof course it isnt as large but its so select and the faculty can give you so much more individual attention and i dont see why it isnt every bit as good as yale and michigan and all those eastern colleges howardmr griffinhe says that he wouldnt ever have thought of being a lawyer only a girl was such a good influence with him and if you get to be a famous man too maybe ill have been just a teenyweeny bit of an influence too wont i  oh yes  i must get back now and say goodby to my guests good night carl  i am going to studyyou just watch me and if i do get to go to platooh gee you always have been a good influence he noticed that doris carson was watching them well i gotta be going ive had a peach of a time good night  doris carson was expectantly waiting for one of the boys to see her home but carl guiltily stole up to ben rusk and commanded  les hike fatty les take a walk something big to tell you     chapter v   carl kicked up the snow in moonshot veils the lake boomed for all their woolen mittens ribbed redcotton wristlets and plush caps with earlaps the cold seared them carl encouraged ben to discourse of gertie and the delights of a long and hopeless love he discovered that actually ben had suddenly fallen in love with adelaide benner gee he exulted maybe that gives me a chance with gertie then but i wont let her know ben aint in love with her any more jiminy aint it lucky gertie liked me just when ben fell in love with somebody else funny the way things go and her never knowing about ben he laid down his cards while they plowed through the hard snowdrifts swinging their arms against their chests like milkmen he blurted out all his secret that gertie was the slickest girl in town that no one appreciated her  ho ho jeered ben  i thought you were crazy about her and then you start kidding about her a swell bunch of chivalry you got you and your galahad you  dont you go jumping on galahad or ill fight  he was all right but you aint said carl you hadnt ought to ever sneer at love  why you said just this afternoon  you poor yahoo i was only teasing you no about gertie its like this she was telling me a lot about how griffin s going to be a lawyer about how much they make in cities and ive about decided ill be a lawyer  thought you were going to be a mechanical engineer  well cant a fellow change his mind when youre an engineer youre always running around the country and you never get shaved or anything and there aint any refining influences  the absorbing game of what were going to be made them forget snow and coldsqueezed fingers ben it was decided was to own a newspaper and support c ericson attorneyatlaw in his dramatic run for state senator  carl did not mention gertie again but it all meant gertie                                       carl made his round trimming the arclights next day apparently a rudely healthy young person but really a dreamer lovelorn and misunderstood he had found a good excuse for calling on gertie at noon and had been informed that miss gertrude was taking a nap he determined to go up the lake for rabbits he doubted if he would ever return and wondered if he would be missed who would care if he froze to death he wouldnt though he did seem to be taking certain precautions by donning a mackinaw coat two pairs of trousers two pairs of woolen socks and shoepacks  he was graceful as an indian when he swept on skees he had made himself across miles of snow covering the lake and dazzling in the diffused light of an even gray sky the reeds by the marshy shore were frostglittering and clattered faintly marshy islands were lost in snow hummocks and icejams and the weaving patterns of mink tracks were blended in one white immensity on which carl was like a fly on a plaster ceiling the world was deserted but carl was not lonely he forgot all about gertie as he cached his skees by the shore and prowled through the woods leaping on brushpiles and shooting quickly when a rabbit ran out  when he had bagged three rabbits he was besieged by the melancholy of loneliness the perfection of the silvergowned gertie he wanted to talk he thought of bone stillman  it was very likely that bone was as usual in winter up beyond big bend fishing for pickerel with tipups a neverstopping dot in the dusk carl headed for big bend three miles away  the tipup fisher watches a dozen tipupsshort automatic fishingrods with lines running through the ice the pivoted arm signaling the presence of a fish at the bait sometimes for warmth he has a tiny shanty perhaps five feet by six in ground area heated by a powdercan stove bone stillman often spent the night in his movable shanty on the lake which added to his reputation as village eccentric but he was more popular now with the local sporting gentlemen who found that he played a divine game of poker  hello son he greeted carl come in leave them long legs of yours up on shore if there aint room  say bone do you think a fellow ever ought to join a church  depends why  well suppose he was going to be a lawyer and go in for politics  look here what re you thinking of becoming a lawyer for  didnt say i was  of course youre thinking of it look here dont you know youve got a chance of seeing the world youre one of the lucky people that can have a touch of the wanderlust without being made useless by itas i have you may you may wander in thought as well as on freighttrains and discover something for the world whereas a lawyertheyre priests they decide whats holy and punish you if you dont guess right they set up codes that it takes lawyers to interpret and so they perpetuate themselves i dont mean to say youre extraordinary in having a chance to wander dont get the bighead over it youre a pretty average young american theres plenty of the same kind only mostly they get tied up to something before they see what a big world there is to hike in and i want to keep you from that im not roasting lawyersyes i am too they live in calfbound books son son for gods sake live in life  yes but look here bone i was just thinking about it thats all youre always drumming it into me about not taking anything for granted anyway by the time i go to plato ill know  dyou mean to say youre going to that backcreek nunnery that blackhaw university are you going to play checkers all through life  oh i dont know now bone plato aint so bad a fellows got to go some place so he can mix with people that know whats the proper thing to do refining influences and like that  proper refining son son are you going to get joralemonized if you want what the french folks call the grand manner if youre going to be a tiptop a number 1 genuwine grand senyor or however they pronounce it why all right go to it thats one way of playing a big game but when it comes down to a shortbit freshwater sewingcircle like plato college where an imitation scholar teaches you imitation translations of useless classics and amblefooted girls teach you imitation party manners that d make you just as plumb ridiclous in a real salon as they would in a lumbercamp whyoh saaay ive got it girls eh what girl ve you been falling in love with to get this plato idea from eh  aw i aint in love bone  no i dont opine you are at your age you got about as much chance of being in love as you have of being a grandfather but somehow i seem to have a little old suspicion that you think youre in love but its none of my business and i aint going to ask questions about it he patted carl on the shoulder moving his arm with difficulty in their small dark space son ive learned this in my lifeand ive done quite some hiking at that even if i didnt have the booklarnin and the gitupandgit to make anything out of my experience its a thing i aint big enough to follow up but i know its there life is just a little old checker game played by the alfalfa contingent at the country store unless youve got an ambition thats too big to ever quite lasso it you want to know that theres something ahead thats bigger and more beautiful than anything youve ever seen and never stop tillwell till you cant follow the road any more and anything or anybody that doesnt pack any surprisesget thatsurprises for you is dead and you want to slough it like a snake does its skin you want to keep on remembering that chicagos beyond joralemon and paris beyond chicago and beyond pariswell maybe theres some big peak of the himalayas  for hours they talked bone desperately striving to make his dreams articulate to carland to himself they ate fish fried on the powdercan stove with halfwarm coffee they walked a few steps outside the shack in the ringing cold to stretch stiff legs carl saw a world of unuttered freedom and beauty forthshadowed in bones cloudy speech but he was melancholy for he was going to give up his citizenship in wonderland for gertie cowles                                       gertie continued to enjoy ill health for another week every evening carl walked past her house hoping that he might see her at a window longing to dare to call each night he pictured rescuing her from thingsrescuing her from fire from drowning from evil men he felt himself the more bound to her by the social recognition of having his name in the joralemon dynamite the following thursday       one of the pleasantest affairs of the holiday season among      the younger set was held last friday evening when gertrude      cowles entertained a number of her young friends at a party      at her mothers handsome residence on maple hill among      those present were mesdames benner and rusk who came in for      a brief time to assist in the jollities of the evening      misses benner carson wesselius madlund ripka smith      lansing and brick and messrs ray cowles his classmate      howard griffin who is spending his vacation here from plato      college carl ericson joseph jordan irving lamb benjamin      rusk nels thorsten peter schoenhof and william t upham      after dancing and games which were thoroughly enjoyed by      all present and a social hour spent in discussing the      events of the season in j h s a most delicious repast      was served and the party adjourned one and all voting that      they had been royally entertained  the glory was the greater because at least seven names had been omitted from the list of guests such social recognition satisfied carlfor half an hour possibly it nerved him finally to call on gertie  since for a week he had been dreading a chilly reception when he should call he was immeasurably surprised when he did call and got what he expected he had not expected the fates to be so treacherous as to treat him as he expected after he had disarmed them by expecting it  when he rang the bell he was an immensely grownup lawyer though he couldnt get his worn navyblue tie to hang exactly right he turned into a crestfallen youth as mrs cowles opened the door and waitedwaitedfor him to speak after a crisp  well what is it carl  why uh i just thought id come and see how gertie is  gertrude is much better thank you i presume she will return to school at the end of vacation  the hall behind mrs cowles seemed very stately very long  ive heard a lot saying they hoped she was better  you may tell them that she is better  mrs cowles shivered no one could possibly have looked more like a person closing a door without actually closing one lena she shrieked close the kitchen door theres a draught she turned back to carl  the shy lover vanished an angry young man challenged if gertie s up i think ill come in a few minutes and see her  why uh hesitated mrs cowles  he merely walked in past her his anger kept its own council for he could depend upon gerties warm greetinglonely gertie he would bring her the cheer of the great open  the piano sounded in the library and the voice of the one perfect girl mingled with a mans tenor in old black joe carl stalked into the library gertie was there much corseted well powdered wearing a blue foulard frenziedly dotted with white and being cultured in company with dr doyle the lively young dentist who had recently taken an office in the national bank block he was a graduate of the university of minnesotadental department he had oily black hair and smiled with goldfilled teeth before one came to the real point of a joke he sang in the congregational church choir and played tennis in a crimsonandblack blazerthe only one in joralemon  to carl dr doyle was dismayingly mature and smart he horribly feared him as a rival for the second time that evening he did not balk fate by fearing it the dentist was a rival after fluttering about the mature charms of miss dietz the school drawingteacher and taking a tentative buggyride or two with the millers daughter dr doyle was bringing all the charm of his professional position and professional teeth and patentleather shoes to bear upon gertie  and gertie was interested obviously she was all of eighteen tonight she frowned slightly as she turned on the pianostool at carls entrance and mechanically this is a pleasant surprise then enthusiastically isnt it too bad that dr doyle was out of town or i would have invited him to my party and he would have given us some of his lovely songs do try the second verse doctor the harmony is so lovely  carl sat at the other end of the library from gertie and the piano while mrs cowles entertained him he obediently said yessum and no m to the observations which she offered from the fullness of her lack of experience of life he sat straight and still behind his fixed smile he was simultaneously longing to break into the musical fiesta and envying the dentists ability to get married without having to wait to grow up and trying to follow what mrs cowles was saying  she droned while crocheting with highminded industry a useless pianoscarf do you still go hunting carl  yessum quite a little rabbithunting oh not very much  at the distant piano across the shining acres of floor the mystical woman and a dentist had ceased singing and were examining a fresh sheet of music the dentist coyly poked his finger at her coiffure and she slapped the finger gurgling  i hope you dont neglect your school work though carl mrs cowles held the scarf nearer the lamp and squinted at it deliberately and solemnly through the eyeglasses that lorded it atop her severe nose a headachy scent of mothballs was in the dull air she forbiddingly moved the shade of the lamp about a tenth of an inch she removed some nonexistent dust from the wroughtiron standard her gestures said that the lamp was decidedly more chic than the pinkshaded hanging lamps raised and lowered on squeaking chains which characterized most joralemon livingrooms she glanced at the red lambrequin over the nearest window the mothball smell grew more stupifying  carl felt stuffy in the top of his nose as he mumbled oh i work pretty hard at chemistry but gee i cant see much to all this latin  when youre a little older carl youll learn that the things you like now arent necessarily the things that are good for you i used to say to gertrudeof course she is older than you but she hasnt been a young lady for so very long even yetand i used to say to her gertrude you will do exactly what i tell you to and not what you want to do and we shall makenomorewordsabout it and i think she sees now that her mother was right about some things dr doyle said to me and of course you know carl that hes a very fine scholarour pastor told me that the doctor reads french better than he does and the doctors told me some things about modern french authors that i didnt know and i used to read french almost as well as english when i was a girl my teachers all told meand he says that he thinks that gertrude has a very fine mind and he was so glad that she hasnt been taken in by all this wicked hysterical way girls have today of thinking they know more than their mothers  yes she isgertie isi think shes got a very fine mind carl commented  from the other end of the room gertie could be overheard confiding to the dentist in tones of hushed and delicious adult scandal they say that when she was in st paul she  so mrs cowles serenely sniffed on while the bridge of carls nose felt broader and broader stretching wider and wider as that stuffy feeling increased and the intensive heat stung his eyelids you see you mustnt think because youd rather play around with the boys than study latin carl that its the fault of your latinteacher she nodded at him with a condescending smile that was infinitely insulting  he knew it and resented it but he did not resent it actively for he was busy marveling how the dickens is it i never heard doc doyle was stuck on gertie everybody thought he was going with bertha dang him anyway the way he snickers youd think she was his best girl  mrs cowles was loftily pursuing her pillared way latin was known to be the best study for developing the mind a long long time and her clicking crochetneedles impishly echoed a long long time and the odor of mothballs got down into carls throat while in the golden olympian atmosphere at the other end of the room gertie coyly pretended to slap the dentists hand with a series of tittering taps a long long time before either you or i were born carl and we cant very well set ourselves up to be wiser than the wisest men that ever lived now can we again the patronizing smile that would scarcely  carl resolved this s got to stop i got to do something he felt her monologue as a blank steel wall which he could not pierce aloud yes thats so i guess say thats a fine dress gertie s got on tonight aint it say i been learning to play crokinole at ben rusks you got a board havent you would you like to play does the doctor play  indeed i havent the slightest idea but i have very little doubt that he doeshe plays tennis so beautifully he is going to teach gertrude in the spring she stopped and again held the scarf up to the light i am so glad that my girly that was so naughty once and ran away with youi dont think i shall ever get over the awful fright i had that nighti am so glad that now she is growing up clever people like dr doyle appreciate her so much so very much  she dropped her crochet to her lap and stared squarely at carl her warning that he would do exceedingly well to go home was more than plain he stared back agitated but not surrendering deliberately almost suavely with ten years of experience added to the sixteen years that he had brought into the room he said  ill see if theyd like to play he sauntered to the other end of the room abashed before the mystic woman and ventured i saw ray today i got to be going pretty quick but i was wondering if you two felt like playing some crokinole  gertie said slowly id like to carl butunless youd like to play doctor  why of course its comme il faut to play miss cowles but i was just hoping to have the pleasure of hearing you make some more of your delectable music bowed the dentist and gertie bowed back and their smiles joined in a glittery bridge of social aplomb  oh yes from carl thatyes dobut you hadnt ought to play too much if you havent been well  oh carl shrieked gertie ought not to not hadnt ought to  ought not to repeated mrs cowles icily while the dentist waved his hand in an amused manner and contributed  ought not to say hadnt ought to as my preceptor used to tell me id like to hear you sing longfellows psalm of life miss cowles  dont you think longfellows a bum poet growled carl bone stillman says longfellows the grindorgan of poetry like this life is real life is earnest tum te diddle dydle dum  carl ordered mrs cowles you will please to never mention that stillman person in my house  oh carl rebuked gertie she rose from the pianostool her essence of virginal femininity its pure and cloistered and whitecamisoled odor bespelled carl to fainting timidity and while he was thus defenseless the dentist thrust  why they tell me stillman doesnt even believe the bible  carl was not to retrieve his credit with gertie but he couldnt betray bone stillman hastily yes maybe that wayoh say doctor pete jordan was telling me liar that you were one of the best tennisplayers at the u  gertie sat down again  the dentist coyly fluffed his hair and deprecated oh no i wouldnt say that  carl had won instantly they three became a country club of urban aristocrats who laughed at the poor rustics of joralemon for knowing nothing of golf and polo carl was winning their tolerancethough not their close attentionby relating certain interesting facts from the inside pages of the local paper as to how far the tennisrackets sold in one year would extend if laid end to end when he saw gertie and her mother glance at the hall gertie giggled mrs cowles frowned he followed their glance  clumping through the hall was his second cousin lena the cowleses hired girl lena nodded and said hallo carl  gertie and the dentist raised their eyebrows at each other  carl talked for two minutes about something he did not know what and took his leave in the intensity of his effort to be resentfully dignified he stumbled over the hall hatrack he heard gertie yelp with laughter  i got to go to collegebe worthy of her he groaned all the way home and i cant afford to go to the u of m id like to be free like bone says but ive got to go to plato     chapter vi   plato college minnesota is as earnest and undistinguished as provincially dull and pathetically human as a spinster missionary its two hundred or two hundred and fifty students come from the furrows asking for spiritual bread and are given a greek root redbrick buildings designed by the architect of county jails are grouped about that high bare cupolacrowned graystone barracks the academic building like red and faded blossoms about a tombstone in the air is the scent of crabapples and meadowy prairies for a time but soon settles down a winter bitter as the learning of the rev s alcott wood dd the president the town and college of plato disturb the expanse of prairie scarce more than a group of haystacks in winter the walks blur into the general whiteness and the trees shrink to chilly skeletons and the college is like five blocks set on a frozen bedsheetno shelter for the warm and timid soul yet no windy peak for the bold the snow wipes out all the summertime individuality of place and the halls are lonelier at dusk than the prairie itselffar lonelier than the yellowlighted jerrybuilt shops in the town the students never lose for good or bad their touch with the fields from droning classrooms the victims of education see the rippling wheat in summer and in winter the impenetrable wall of sky footsteps and quick laughter of men and girls furtively flirting along the brick walls under the beautiful maples do make plato dear to remember they do not make it brilliant they do not explain the advantages of leaving the farm for another farm  to the freshman carl ericson descending from the dusty smokingcar of the m  d in company with tumultuous youths in pinhead caps and enormous sweaters the town of plato was metropolitan as he walked humbly up main street and beheld two fourstory buildings and a marble bank and an interurban trolleycar he had at last an idea of what minneapolis and chicago must be two men in sweaters adorned with a large p athletes generals heroes walked the streets in the flesh and he sawit really was there for himthe college book store whose windows were filled with leatherbacked treatises on greek logic and trigonometry and finally he was gaping through a sandstone gateway at four buildings each of them nearly as big as the joralemon high school surrounding a vast stone castle  he entered the campus he passed an old man with white sidewhiskers and a cord on his goldrimmed eyeglasses an aged old man who might easily be a professor a blithe student with y m c a receptn com large on his hatband rushed up to carl shook his hand busily and inquired  freshman old man got your room yet theres a list of roominghouses over at the y m come on ill show you the way  he was received in academe in arcadia in elysium in fact in plato college  he was directed to a large but decomposing house conducted by the widow of a college janitor and advised to take a room at 175 a week for his share of the rent that implied taking with the room a large solemn roommate fresh from teaching country school a heavy slowspoken serious man of thirtyone named albert smith registered as a smith and usually known as plain smith plain smith sat studying in his cotton socks and never emptied the washbasin he remarked during the first hour of their discourse in the groves of academe i hope you aint going to bother me by singing and skylarking around im here to work bub smith then returned to the large books which he was diligently scanning that he might find wisdom while carl sniffed at the brownblotched wallpaper the faded grass matting the shallow standing wardrobe he liked the house however it had a real bathroom he could for the first time in his life splash in a tub perhaps it would not be regarded as modern today perhaps effete souls would disdain its honest tin tub smeared with a paint that peeled instantly but it was elegance and the hesperides compared with the sponge and two lardpails of hot water from the ericson kitchen reservoir which had for years been his conception of luxurious means of bathing  also there were choicer spirits in the house one man who pressed clothes for a living and carried a large line of cigarettes in his room was second vicepresident of the sophomore class as smoking was dourly forbidden to all platonians the sophomores room was a refuge the sophomore encouraged carl in his natural talent for cheerful noises while plain smith objected even to singing while one dressed  like four of his classmates carl became a waiter at mrs henkels student boardinghouse for his board and two dollars a week the two dollars constituted his pinmoneya really considerable sum for plato where the young men were pure and smoked not neither did they drink where evening clothes were snobbish and sweaters thought rather well of where the only theatrical attractions were weekstand melodramas playing such attractions as poor but true or the rev sam j pitkinss celebrated lecture on the father of lies annually delivered at the ioof hall  carls father assured him in every letter that he was extravagant he ran through the two dollars in practically no time at all he was a member in good and regular standing of the informal club that hung about the corner drug store to drink coffee soda and discuss athletics and stare at the passing girls he loved to set off his clear skin and shining pale hair with linen collars though soft rollcollar shirts were in vogue and he was ready for any wild expedition though it should cost fifty or sixty cents with the sophomore second vicepresident and john terry of the freshman class usually known as the turk he often tramped to the large neighboring town of jamaica mills to play pool smoke turkish cigarettes and drink beer they always chorused plato songs in longdrawn close harmony once they had imported english ale out of bottles and carried the bottles back to decorate and distinguish their rooms  carls work at the boardinghouse introduced him to pretty girl students and cost him no social discredit whatever the little college had the virtue of genuine democracy so completely that it never prided itself on being democratic mrs henkel proprietor of the boardinghouse occasionally grew sarcastic to her student waiters as she stooped redfaced and loosened of hair over the range she did suggest that they kindly wash up a few of the dishes now and then before they went gallivantin off but songs arose from the freshmen washing and wiping dishes they chucklingly rehashed jokes they discussed the value of the classical course versus the scientific course while they waited on table they shared the laughter and arguments that ran from student to student through mrs henkels diningrooma sunny room bedecked with a canary a pussycat a gilded rope porti√®re a comfortable rocker with a plato cushion a garland stove with nickel ornaments two geraniums and an oakframed photograph of the champion plato football team of 1899  carl was readily accepted by the men and girls who gathered about the piano in the evening his gracefulseeming body his puppyish awkwardness his quietly belligerent dignity his eternal quest of new things won him respect though he was too boyish to rouse admiration except in the breast of fat pretty cheerful fuzzyhaired candyeating mae thurston mae so influenced carl that he learned to jest casually and he practised a new dance called the boston which mae had brought from minneapolis though as a rival to the waltz and twostep the new dance was ridiculed by every one he mastered all the savoir faire of the boardinghouse but he was always hurrying away from it to practise football to prowl about the plato powerhouse to skim through magazines in the y m c a readingroom even to study  beyond the dishwashing and furnacetending set he had no probable social future though everybody knew everybody at plato those immaculate upperclassmen murray cowles and howard griffin never invited him to their room in a house on elm street with a screened porch and piano sounds he missed ben rusk who had gone to oberlin college and joe jordan who had gone to work for the joralemon specialty manufacturing company  life at plato was suspicious prejudiced provincial as it affected the ambitious students and for the weaker brethren it was philandering and vague the class work was largely pure rotarbitrary mathematics antiquated botany hesitating german and a veritable military drill in the conjunction of greek verbs conducted by a man with a noncom soul a pompous sandywhiskered manikin with cold eyes and a perpetual cold in the nose who had inflicted upon a patient world the fourmillionth commentary on xenophon few of the students realized the futility of it all certainly not carl who slept well and believed in football  the life habit justifies itself one comes to take anything as a matter of course to take ones neighbors seriously whether one lives in plato or persia in mrs henkels kitchen or a focsle the platonians raced toward their various goals of highschool teaching or law or marriage or permanently escaping their parents they made love and were lazy and ate and swore off bad habits and had religious emotions all quite naturally they were not much bored rarely exhilarated always ready to gossip about their acquaintances precisely like a duke or a delicatessenkeeper they played out their game but it was so tiny a game so played to the exclusion of all other games that it tended to dwarf its victimsand the restless children such as carl instinctively resent this dwarfing they seek to associate themselves with other rebels carls unconscious rebel band was the group of rowdyish freshmen who called themselves the gang and loafed about the room of their unofficial captain john terry nicknamed the turk a swarthy largefeatured youth with a loud laugh a habit of slapping people upon the shoulder an ingenious mind for deviltry and considerable promise as a football end  most small local colleges and many good ones have their gangs of boys who presumably become honorable men and fathers yet who in college days regard it as heroic to sneak out and break things and as humorous to lead countryside girls astray in sordid amours the more cloistered the seat of learning the more vicious are the active boys to keep up with the swiftness of life forces the turks gang painted the statues of the memorial arch they stole signs they were the creators of noises unexpected and intolerable during small quiet hours of moonlight  as the silkworm draws its exquisite stuff from dowdy leaves so youth finds beauty and mystery in stupid days carl went out unreservedly to practise with the football squad he had a joy of martyrdom in tackling the dummy and peeling his nose on the frozen ground he knew a sacred aspiration when mr bjorken the coach a former university of minnesota star told him that he might actually make the team in a year or two that he had twice as much chance as ray cowles whowhile carl was thinking only of helping the scrub team to winwas too engrossed in his own dignity as a highschool notable to get into the scrimmage  at the games among the gang on the bleachers carl went mad with fervor he kept shooting to his feet and believed that he was saving his country every time he yelled in obedience to the st vitus gestures of the cheerleader or sang on the goalline of plato to the tune of on the sidewalks of new york tears of a real patriotism came when at the critical moment of a losing game against the minnesota military institute with sunset forlorn behind bare trees the veteran cheerleader flung the hoarse plato rooters into another defiant yell it was the neversaydie of men who rose with clenched hands and arms outstretched to the despairing need of their college and thenlord they hurled up to their feet in frenzy as pete madlund got away with the ball for a long run and victory the next week when the university of keokuk whipped them 40 to 10 carl stood weeping and cheering the defeated plato team till his throat burned  he loved the laughter of the turk mae thurstons welcome experiments in the physics laboratory and he was sure that he was progressing toward the state of grace in which he might aspire to marry gertie cowles  he did not think of her every day but she was always somewhere in his thoughts and the heroines of magazine stories recalled some of her virtues to his mind invariably the dentist who had loved her had moved away she was bored she occasionally wrote to carl but she was still superiortried to influence him for good and advised him to cultivate nice people  he was convinced that he was going to become a lawyer for her sake but he knew that some day he would be tempted by the desire to become a civil or a mechanical engineer                                       a january thaw carl was tramping miles out into the hilly country north of plato he hadnt been able to persuade any of the gang to leave their smoky loafingplace in the turks room but his own lungs demanded the open with his heavy boots swashing through icy pools calling to an imaginary dog and victoriously running olympic races before millions of spectators he defied the chill of the day and reached hiawatha mound a hill eight miles north of plato  toward the top a man was to be seen crouched in a pebbly sunny arroyo peering across the bleak prairie a lone watcher ascending carl saw that it was eugene field linderbeck a plato freshman that amused him he grinningly planned a conversation every one said that genie linderbeck was queer a precocious boy of fifteen yet the head of his class in scholarship reported to be interested in greek books quite outside of the course fond of drinking tea and devoid of merit in the three manly artsathletics flirting and breaking rules by smoking genie was small anemic and too well dressed he stuttered slightly and was always peering doubtfully at you with large and childish eyes that were made more eerie by his pale bulbous forehead and the penthouse of tangled mousebrown hair over it the gang often stopped him on the campus to ask mockpolite questions about his ambition which was to be a teacher of english at harvard or yale not very consistently but without ever wearying of the jest they shadowed him to find out if he did not write poetry and while no one had actually caught him he was still suspect  genie said nothing when carl called hlo son and sat on a neighboring rock  whats trouble genie you look worried  why dont any of you fellows like me  carl felt like a bug inspected by a german professor wwhy how dyou mean genie  none of you take me seriously you simply let me hang around and you think im a grind im not i like to read thats all perhaps you think i shouldnt like to go out for athletics if i could i wish i could run the way you can ericson darn it i was happy out here by myself on the mound where every prospect pleases andn now here i am again envying you  why son ii guessi guess we admire you a whole lot more than we let on to cheer up old man when youre valedictorian and on the debating team and wallop hamlin youll laugh at the gang and well be proud to write home we know you carl was hating himself for ever having teased genie linderbeck youve helped me a thundering lot whenever ive asked you about that blame greek syntax i guess were jealous of you youuhyou dont want to let em kid you  carl was embarrassed before genies steady youthful trusting gaze he stooped for a handful of pebbles with which he pelted the landscape maundering say why dont you come around to the turks room and get better acquainted with the gang  when shall i come  when oh why thunderyou know geniejust drop in any time  ill be glad to  carl was perspiring at the thought of what the gang would do to him when they discovered that he had invited genie but he was game come up to my room whenever you can and help me with my boning he added you mustnt ever get the idea that were conferring any blooming favor by having you around its you that help us our necks are pretty well sandpapered im afraid come up to my room any time ill have to be hiking on if im going to get much of a walk come over and see me tonight  i wish youd come up to mr frazers with me some sunday afternoon for tea ericson  henry frazer ma yale associate professor of english literature was a college mystery he was a thinhaired young man with a consuming love of his work which was the saving of souls by teaching lycidas and comus this was his first year out of graduate school his first year at platoand possibly his last it was whispered about that he believed in socialism and the president the rev dr s alcott wood had no patience with such silly fads  carl marveled do you go to frazers  why yes  thought everybody was down on him they say hes an anarchist and i know he gives fierce assignments in english lit thats what all the fellows in his classes say  all the fools are down on him thats why i go to his house  dont the fellowsuhkind of  yes piped genie in his most childish tone of anger his tendency to stammer betraying him they kkid me for liking frazer heshes the only tteacher here that isnt ppp  spit  provincial  what dyou mean by provincial  narrow villagey do you know what bernard shaw says  never read a word of him my son and let me tell you that my idea of no kind of conversation is to have a guy spring have you read on me every few seconds and me coming back with no i havent aint it interesting if thats the brand of converse at prof frazers you can count me out  genie laughed think how much more novelty you get out of roasting me like that than telling terry hes got bats in his belfry ten or twelve times a day  all right my son you win maybe ill go to frazers with you sometime  the sunday following carl went to tea at professor henry frazers  the house was platonian without plain and dumpy with gingerbread gothic on the porch blistered paint and the general lines of a prairie barn but the livingroom was more nearly beautiful than any room carl had seen in accordance with the ideal of that era it had mission furniture with large leather cushions brown woodwork and tan oatmeal paper scattered with german color prints instead of the patent rockers and carbon prints of roman monuments which adorned the houses of the other professors while waiting with genie linderbeck for the frazers to come down carl found in a rack on the oak table such books as he had never seen exquisite books from england bound in terracotta and olivegreen cloth with intricate gold designs heavylooking but astonishingly light to the hand books about celtic legends and proven√ßal jongleurs and japanese prints and other matters of which he had never heard so different from the stained textbooks and the shallow novels by brisk ladies which had constituted his experiences of literature that he suddenly believed in culture  professor frazer appeared walking into the room after his fragile wife and gracious sisterinlaw and carl drank tea with lemon instead of milk in it and listened to bewildering talk and to a few stanzas heroic or hauntingly musical by a new poet w b yeats an irishman associated with a thing called the gaelic movement professor frazer had a funny easy friendliness his sisterinlaw a diana in brown respectfully asked carl about the practicability of motorcars and all of them including two newly come highbrow seniors listened with nodding interest while carl bashfully analyzed each of the nine cars owned in plato and jamaica mills at dusk the diana in brown played macdowell and the light of the silkenshaded lamp was on a print of a fairy swiss village  that evening carl wrestled with the turk for one hour catchascatchcan on the turks bed and under it and nearly out of the window to prove the value of professor frazer and culture next morning carl and the turk enrolled in frazers optional course in modern poetry a desultory series of lectures which did not attempt tennyson and browning so carl discovered shelley and keats and walt whitman swinburne and rossetti and morris he had to read by crawling from word to word as though they were icecakes in a cataract of emotion the allusiveness was agonizing but he pulled off his shoes rested his feet on the footboard of his bed drummed with a pair of scissors on his knee and persisted in his violent pursuit of the beautiful meanwhile his roommate plain smith flapped the pages of a latin lexicon or took a little recreation by reading the rev mr todds students manual that gem of the alarmclock and waterbucket epoch in american colleges  carl never understood genie linderbecks conviction that words are living things that dream and sing and battle but he did learn that there was speech transcending the barking of the gang  in the spring of his freshman year carl gave up waiting on table and drove a motorcar for a town banker he learned every screw and spring in the car he also made genie go out with him for track athletics carl won his place on the college team as a halfmiler and viciously assaulted two freshmen and a junior for laughing at genies legs which stuck out of his large runningpants like straws out of a lemonadeglass  in the great meet with hamlin university though plato lost most of the events carl won the halfmile race he was elected to the exclusive fraternity of ray cowles and howard griffin omega chi delta just before commencement that excited him less than the fact that the turk and he were to spend the summer up north in the hardwheat country stringing wire for the telephone company with a gang of minneapolis wiremen  oh yes and he would see gertie in joralemon she had written to him with so much enthusiasm when he had won the halfmile     chapter vii   he saw gertie two hours after he had reached joralemon for a weeks stay before going north they sat in rockers on the grass beside her stoop they were embarrassed and rocked profusely and chattily mrs cowles was surprised and not much pleased to find him but gertie murmured that she had been lonely and carl felt that he must be nobly patient under mrs cowless slight he got so far as to sigh o gertie but grew frightened as though he were binding himself for life he wished that gertie were not wearing so many combs stuck all over her pompadoured hair he noted that his rocker creaked at the joints and thought out a method of strengthening it by braces she bubbled that he was going to be the big man in his class he said aw rats and felt that his collar was too tight he went home his father remarked that carl was late for supper that he had been extravagant in plato and that he was unlikely to make money out of all this runnin races but his mother stroked his hair and called him her big boy he tramped out to bone stillmans shack impatient for the handclasp of the pioneer and grew eloquent for the first time since his homecoming as he described professor frazer and the delights of poesy a busy week carl had in joralemon adelaide benner gave a porchsupper for him they sat under the trees laughing while in the dimly lighted street bicycles whirred and boxelders he had always known whispered that this guest of honor was carl ericson come home a hero  the cycling craze still existed in joralemon carl rented a wheel for a week from the blue front hardware store once he rode with a party of boys and girls to tamarack lake once he rode to wakamin with ben rusk home from oberlin college the ride was not entirely enjoyable because oberlin had nearly two thousand students and ben was amusedly superior about plato they did however enjoy the stylishness of buying bottles of strawberry pop at wakamin  twice carl rode to tamarack lake with gertie they sat on the shore and while he shied flat skippingstones across the water and flapped his old cap at the hovering horseflies he babbled of the turks stunts and the bankers car and the misty hinterlands of professor frazers lectures gertie appeared interested and smiled at regular intervals but so soon as carl fumbled at one of frazers abstract theories she interrupted him with highly concrete joralemon gossip he suspected that she had not kept up with the times true she referred to new york but as the reference was one she had been using these two years he still identified her with joralemon he did not even hold her hand though he wondered if it might not be possible her hand lay so listlessly by her skirt on the sand they rode back in twilight of early june carl was cheerful as their wheels crunched the dirt roads in a long crisp hum the stilly rhythm of frogs drowned the clank of their pedals and the sky was vast and pale and wistful  gertie however seemed less cheerful  on the last evening of his stay in joralemon gertie gave him a hayride party they sang seeing nelly home and merrily we roll along and suwanee river and my old kentucky home and my bonnie lies over the ocean and in the good old summertime under a delicate new moon in a sky of applegreen carl pressed gerties hand she returned the pressure so quickly that he was embarrassed he withdrew his hand as quickly as possible ostensibly to help in the unpacking of the basket of gingerale and chicken sandwiches and three cakes whitefrosted chocolate layer and banana cake  the same group said goodby to carl at the m  d station as the train started carl saw gertie turn away disconsolately her shoulders so drooping that her blouse was baggy in the back he mourned that he had not been more tender with her that week he pictured himself kissing gertie on the shore of tamarack lake enfolded by afternoon and the mystery of sex and a protecting reverence for gerties loneliness he wanted to go backback for one more day one more ride with gertie but he picked up a mechanics magazine glanced at an article on gliders read in the first paragraph a prophecy about aviation slid down in his seat with his head bent over the magazineand the idyl of gertie and afternoon was gone  he was reading the article on gliders in june 1905 so early in the history of air conquest that its suggestions were miraculous to him for it was three years before wilbur wright was to startle the world by his flights at le mans four years before bl√©riot was to cross the channelthough indeed it was a year and a half after the wrights first secret ascent in a motordriven aeroplane at kittyhawk and fourteen years after lilienthal had begun that epochal series of gliderflights which was followed by the experiments of pilcher and chanute langley and montgomery  the article declared that if gasoline or alcohol engines could be made light enough we should all be aviating to the office in ten years that now was the time for youngsters to practise gliding as pioneers of the new age carl guessed that flying would be even better than automobiling he made designs for three revolutionary new aeroplanes drawing on the margins of the magazine with a toothmarkpitted pencil stub  gertie was miles back concealed behind piles of triplanes and helicopters and followingsurface monoplanes which the wizard inventor c ericson was creating and ruthlessly destroying a small boy was squalling in the seat opposite and carl took him from his tired mother and lured him into a game of tittattoe  he joined the turk and the wirestringers at a prairie hamletstraggly rows of unpainted frame shanties the stores with tincorniced false fronts that pretended to be two stories high there were pigpens in the dooryards and the single church had a square low white steeple like the paper cap which labor wears in the posters farmwagons were hitched before a gloomy saloon carl was exceeding glum but the turk introduced him to a university of minnesota pharmacy school student who was with the crew during vacation and the three went tramping across breezy flowered prairies so began for carl a galloping summer  the crew strung telephone wire from pole to pole all day playing the jokes of hardy men and on sunday loafed in haystacks recalling experiences from winnipeg to el paso carl resolved to come back to this life of the open with gertie after graduation he would buy a ranch on time or the turk and carl would go exploring in alaska or the orient law he would ask himself in monologues law me in a stuffy office not a chance  the crew stayed for four weeks in a boom town of nine thousand installing a complete telephone system southeast of the town lay rolling hills as carl talked with the turk and the pharmacy school man on a hilltop the first evening of their arrival he told them the scientific magazines prophecies about aviation and noted that these hills were of the sort lilienthal would probably have chosen for his gliderflights  say by the great jim hill lets make us a glider he exulted sitting up his eyelids flipping rapidly  sure said the pharmacy man how would you make one  whyuhi guess you could make a frame out of willowhave to the willows along the creeks are the only kind of trees near here youd cover it with varnished cottonthats what lilienthal did anyway but darned if i know how youd make the planes curvedcamberedlike he did you got to have it that way i suppose youd use curved stays like a quarter barrelhoop i guess it would be better to try to make a chanute gliderjust a plain pair of suprimposed planes instead of one all combobulated like a bats wings like lilienthals glider was or we could try some experiments with paper modelsoh no thunder lets make a glider  they did  they studied with aching heads the drylooking tables of lift and resistance for which carl telegraphed to chicago stripped to their undershirts they worked all through the hot prairie evenings in the oilsmelling greasy engineroom of the local powerhouse in front of the dynamos which kept evilly throwing out green sparks and rumbling the mystic syllable ommmm to greet their modern magic  they hunted for threequarterinch willow rods but discarded them for seasoned ash from the lumberyard they coated cotton with thin varnish they stopped to dispute furiously over angles of incidence bellowing well look here then you muttonhead ill draw it for you  on their last sunday in the town they assembled the glider singlesurfaced like a monoplane twentytwo feet in span with a tail and with a double bar beneath the plane by which the pilot was to hang his hands holding cords attached to the entering edge of the plane balancing the glider by movements of his body  at dawn on monday they loaded the glider upon a wagon and galloped with it out to a fortyfoot hill they stared down the easy slope which grew in steepness and length every second and thought about lilienthals death  wwwell shivered the turk who tries it first  all three pretended to be adjusting the lashings waiting for one another till carl snarled oh all right ill do it if i got to  course it breaks my heart to see you swipe the honor the turk said but im unselfish ill let you do it brrrr its as bad as the first jump into the swimminghole in spring  carl was smiling at the comparison as they lifted the glider with him holding the bars beneath the plane was instantly buoyed up like a cork on water as the fifteenmile headwind poured under it he stopped smiling this was a dangerous living thing he was going to guide it jerked at him as he slipped his arms over the suspended bars he wanted to stop and think this all over get it done he snapped at himself and began to run downhill against the wind  the wind lifted the plane again with a shock carl knew that his feet had left the ground he was actually flying he kicked wildly in air all his body strained to get balance in the air to control itself to keep from falling of which he now felt the worldold instinctive horror  the plane began to tip to one side apparently irresistibly like a sheet of paper turning over in the wind carl was sick with fear for a tenth of a second every cell in his body shrank before coming disaster he flung his legs in the direction opposite to the tipping of the plane with this counterbalancing weight the glider righted it was running on an even keel twentyfive feet above the sloping ground while carl hung easily by the double bar beneath like a circus performer with a trapeze under each arm he ventured to glance down the turf was flowing beneath him a green and sunny blur he exulted flying  the glider dipped forward carl leaned back his arms widespread a gust struck the plane head on overloaded at the back it tilted back then soared up to thirtyfive or forty feet slowseeming inevitable the whole structure turned vertically upward  carl dangled there against a flimsy sheet of wood and cotton which for part of a second stuck straight up against the wind like a paper on a screendoor  the plane turned turtle slithered sidewise through the air and dropped horizontal now but upside down carl on top  thirtyfive forty feet down  im up against it was his only thought while he was falling  the left tip of the plane smashed against the ground crashing horribly jarring but it broke the fall carl shot forward and landed on his shoulder  he got up rubbing his shoulder wondering at the suspended life in the faces of the other two as they ran downhill toward him  jiminy he said glad the glider broke the fall wish we had time to make a new glider with wingwarp say well be late on the job better beat it p d q  the others stood gaping     chapter viii   a pile of shoes and noseguards and bicyclepumps and broken hockeysticks a wall covered with such stolen signs as east college avenue and pants presser ladys garments carefully done and dr sloats liniment for young and old a brokenbacked couch with a redandgreen afghan of mangy tassels an inkspattered wooden table burnt in small black spots along the edges a plaster bust of martha washington with a mustache added in ink a few books an inundation of sweaters and old hats and a large expensive mouthorgansuch were a few of the interesting characteristics of the room which carl and the turk were occupying as roommates for sophomore year at plato  most objectionable sounds came from the room constantly the gangs songs suggestive laughter imitations of cats and fowls and foghorns these noises were less ingenious however than the devices of the gang for getting rid of tobaccosmoke such as blowing the smoke up the stove  carl was happy in this room he encouraged stammering genie linderbeck to become adaptable here he scribbled to gertie and ben rusk little notes decorated with badly drawn caricatures of himself loafing here with the turk he talked out half the night planning future glory in engineering carl adored the turk for his frankness his lively speech his interest in mechanicsand in carl  carl was still out for football but he was rather light for a team largely composed of onehundredandeightypound norwegians he had a chance however he drove the bankers car two or three evenings a week and cared for the bankers lawn and furnace and cow he still boarded at mrs henkels as did jolly mae thurston whom he took for surreptitious rides in the bankers car after which he wrote extralong and pleasant letters to gertie it was becoming harder and harder to write to gertie because he had in freshman year exhausted all the things one can say about the weather without being profane when in october a new bank clerk stormed meteorlike the joralemon social horizon and became devoted to gertie as faithfully reported in letters from joe jordan carl was melancholy over the loss of a comrade but he strictly confined his mourning to leisure hoursand with books football and chores for the banker he was a busy young man after about ten days it was a relief not to have to plan letters to gertie the emotions that should have gone to her carl devoted to professor frazers new course in modern drama  this course was officially announced as a study of bernard shaw ibsen strindberg pinero hauptmann sudermann maeterlinck dannunzio and rostand but unofficially announced by professor frazer as an attempt to follow the spirit of today wherever it should be found in contemporary literature carl and the turk were bewildered but staunchly enthusiastic disciples of the course they made every member of the gang enroll in it and discouraged inattention in the lectureroom by dexterous sidekicks  even to his exroommate plain smith the grim and slovenly schoolteacher who had called him bub and discouraged his confidences carl presented the attractions of professor frazers lectures when he met him on the campus smith looked quizzical and guessed that plays and playactin were useless if not actually immoral  yes but this isnt just plays my young friend said carl with a hauteur new but not exceedingly impressive to plain smith he takes up all these new stunts all this new philosophy and stuff they have in london and paris theres something besides shakespeare and the bible he added intending to be spiteful it may be stated that he did not like plain smith  what new philosophy  the spirit of brotherhood i suppose youre too orthodox for that  oh no sonny not for that not for that and it aint so very new thats what christ taught no sonny i aint so orthodox but what im willing to have em show me anything that tries to advance brotherhood not that i think its very likely to be found in a lot of noo york plays but ill look in at one lesson anyway and plain smith clumped away humming greenlands icy mountains  professor frazers modern drama course began with ibsen the first five lectures were almost conventional they were an attempt to place contemporary dramatists with reflections on the boxoffice standpoint but his sixth lecture began rather unusually  there was an audience of sixtyfour in lectureroom aearnest girl students bringing out notebooks and spectaclecases frivolous girls feeling their back hair and the men settling down with a come lets get it over air or glowing up worshipingly like eugene field linderbeck or determined not to miss anything like carlthe captious college audience credulous as to statements of fact and heavily unresponsive to the spirit professor frazer younger than half a dozen of the plowtrained undergraduates thin of hair and sensitive of face sitting before them with one hand in his pocket and the other nervously tapping the small readingtable spoke quietly  im not going to be a lecturer today im not going to analyze the plays of shaw which i assigned to you youre supposed to have read them yourselves i am going to imagine that i am at tea in new haven or down in new york at dinner in the basement of the old brevoort talking with a bunch of men who are trying to find out where the world is going and why and when and how and asking who are the prophets who are going to show it the way wed be getting excited over shaw and wells theres something really worth getting excited over  these men have perceived that this world is not a crazyquilt of unrelated races but a collection of human beings completely related with all our interestsfood and ambitions and the desire to playabsolutely in common so that if we would take thought all together and work together as a football team does we would start making a perfect world  thats what socialismof which youre beginning to hear so much and of which youre going to hear so much moremeans if you feel genuinely impelled to vote the republican ticket thats not my affair of course indeed the socialist party of this country constitutes only one branch of international socialism but i do demand of you that you try to think for yourselves if you are going to have the nerve to vote at allthink of itto vote how this whole nation is to be conducted doesnt that tremendous responsibility demand that you do something more than inherit your way of voting that you really think think hard why you vote as you do pardon me for getting away from the subject properyet am i actually for just what i have been saying is one of the messages of shaw and wells  the great vision of the glory that shall be not in one sudden millennium but slowly advancing toward joys of life which we can no more prevision than the aboriginal medicineman could imagine the xray i wish that this were the time and the place to rhapsodize about that vision as william morris has done in news from nowhere you tell me that the various brands of socialists differ so much in their beliefs about this future that the bewildered layman can make nothing at all of their theories very well they differ so much because there are so many different things we can do with this human race the defeat of death the life period advancing to tenscore years all crowded with happy activity the solution of labors problem increasing safety and decreasing hours of toil and a way out for the unhappy consumer who is ground between labor and capital a real democracy and the love of work that shall come when work is not relegated to wageslaves but joyously shared in a community inclusive of the living beings of all nations france and germany uniting precisely as saxony and prussia and bavaria have united and most of all a general realization that the fact that we cannot accomplish all these things at once does not indicate that they are hopeless an understanding that one of the wonders of the future is the fact that we shall always in all ages have improvements to look forward to  fellowstudents object as strongly as you wish to the petty narrowness and vituperation of certain streetcorner ranters but do not be petty and narrow and vituperative in doing it  now to relate all this to the plays of bernard shaw when he says                                       professor frazers utterances seem tamely conservative nowadays but this was in 1905 in a small intensely religious college among the furrows imagine a devout pastor when his son kicks the family bible and you have the mental state of half the students of plato upon hearing a defense of socialism carl catching echoes of his own talks with bone stillman in the lecture exultantly glanced about and found the class staring at one another with frightened anxiety he saw the grim plain smith not so much angry as ill he saw two class clowns snickering at the ecstasy in the eyes of genie linderbeck                                       in the corner drugstore popularly known as the club where all the college bloods gather to drink lemon phosphate an excited old man whose tieless collar was almost concealed by his tobaccostained beard pushed back his black slouchhat with the g a r cord and banged his fist on the prescriptioncounter shouting half at the clerk and half at the students matching pennies on the sodacounter ive lived in plato man and boy for fortyseven yearsever since it want nothing but a frontier tradingpost i packed logs on my back and i tramped fiftythree miles to get me a yoke of oxen i remember when the indians went raiding during the war and the cavalry rode here from st paul and this town has always stood for decency and law and order but when things come to such a pass that this fellow frazer or any of the rest of these infidels from one of these here eastern colleges is allowed to stand up on his hind legs in a college building and bray about anarchism and tell us to trample on the old flag that we fought for and none of these professors that call themselves reverends step in and stop him then let me tell you im about ready to pull up stakes and go out west where theres patriotism and decency still and where theyd hang one of these foreign anarchists to the nearest lamppost yes sir and this fellow frazer too if he encouraged them in their crank notions got no right in the country anyway better deport em if they aint satisfied with the way we run things i wont stand for preaching anarchism and never knew any decent place that would never since i was a baby in canada yes sir i mean it im an old man but id pull up stakes and go plugging down the santa fe trail first and i mean it  heres your bog bitters mr goff said the clerk hastily as a passerby was drawn into the store by the old mans tirade  mr goff stalked out muttering and the college sports at the sodacounter grinned at one another but gus osberg of the junior class remarked to carl ericson at that though theres a good deal to what old goff says bet a hat prexy wont stand for prof frazers talking anarchy fellow in the class told me it was fierce stuff he was talking reglar anarchy  rats it wasnt anything of the kind protested carl i was there and i heard the whole thing he just explained what this bernard shaw that writes plays meant by socialism  well even so dont you think its kind of unnecessary to talk publicly right out in a college lectureroom about socialism inquired a senior who was high up in the debating society  well thunder was all carl said as the whole group stared at him he felt ridiculous he was afraid of seeming to be a crank he escaped from the drugstore  when he arrived at mrs henkels boardinghouse for supper the next evening he found the students passing from hand to hand a copy of the town paper the plato weekly times which bore on the front page what the town regarded as a redhot news story  plato professor  talks seditiously       as we go to press we learn that rumors are flying about the      campus that the powers that be are highly incensed by the      remarks of a wellknown member of the local faculty praising      socialism and other form of anarchy it is said that one of      the older members of the faculty will demand from the erring      teacher an explanation of his remarks which are alleged to      have taken the form of a defense of the english anarchist      bernhard shaw those on the que vive are expecting      sensational developments and campus talk is so extensively      occupied with discussions of the affair that the important      coming game with st johns college is almost forgotten       while the times has always supported plato college as one of      the chief glories in the proud crown of minnesota learning      we can but illy stomach such news it goes without saying      that we cannot too strongly disapprove express our      disapproval of such incendiary utterances and we shall      fearlessly report the whole of this fair let the chips fall      where they may  there mr ericson said mrs henkel a plump decent disapproving person who had known too many generations of great platonians to be impressed by anything you see what the public thinks of your professor frazer i told you people wouldnt stomach such news and i wouldnt wonder if they strongly disapproved  this aint anything but gossip said carl feebly but as he read the account in the weekly times he was sick and frightened such was his youthful awe of print he wanted to beat the mossywhiskered editor of the times who always had white foodstains on his lapels when he raised his eyes the coquette mae thurston tried to cheer him it ll all come out in the wash eric dont worry these editors have to have something to write about or they couldnt fill up the paper  he pressed her foot under the table he was chatty and helped to keep the general conversation away from the frazer affair but he was growing more and more angry with a desire for effective action which expressed itself within him only by ill show em makes me so sore                                       everywhere they discussed and rediscussed professor frazer in the dressingroom of the gymnasium where the football squad dressed in the sweatreeking air and shouted at one another balancing each on one leg before small lockers and rubbing themselves with brown unclean turkish towels in the neat rooms of girl coeds with their banners and cushions and pink comforters and chafingdishes of nut fudge and photographic postalcards showing the folks at home in the close horsesmelling laprobe and whip scattered office of the town liverystable where mr goff droned with the editor of the times  everywhere carl heard the echoes and resolved ive got to do something     chapter ix   the day of professor frazers next lecture a rainsodden day at the end of october with the stubblefields bleakly shelterless beyond the campus the rain splashed up from pools on the worn brick walks and dripped from trees and whipped about buildings soaking the legs and leaving them itchingly wet and the feet sloshily uncomfortable carl returned to his room at one talked to the turk his feet thrust against the side of their rusty stove he wanted to keep three oclock the hour of frazers lecture from coming i feel as if i was in for a fight and scared to death about it listen to that rain outside gee but the old dame keeps these windows dirty i hope frazer will give it to them good and hard i wish we could applaud him i do feel funny like something tragic was going to happen  oh tie that dog outside yawned the turk stanch adherent of carl and therefore of professor frazer but not imaginative come on young kerl ill play you a slick little piece on the mouthorgan heh  oh thunder im too restless to listen to anything except a cannon carl stumped to the window and pondered on the pool of water flooding the graying grass stems in the shabby yard  when it was time to start for professor frazers lecture the turk blurted why dont we stay away and forget about it get her off your nerves lets go down to the bowlingalley and work up a sweat  not a chance turk hell want all the supporters hes got and youd hate to stay away as much as i would i feel cheered up now all ready for the scrap yip come on  all right governor i like the scrap all right but i dont want to see you get all worked up  through the rain across the campus an unusual number of students in shining cheap black raincoats were hastening to the three oclock classes clattering up the stone steps of the academic building talking excitedly glancing up at the arched door as though they expected to see something startling dozens stared at carl he felt rather important it was plain that he was known as a belligerent a supporter of professor frazer as he came to the door of lectureroom a he found that many of the crowd were deserting their proper classes to attend the frazer event he bumped down into his own seat gazing back superciliously at the outsiders who were edging into unclaimed seats at the back of the room or standing about the doorstudents from other classes town girls the young instructor in french german and music a couple of town clubwomen in glasses and galoshes and woolen stockings bunchy at the ankles every one was rapidly whispering watching every one else peeping often at the platform and the small door beside it through which professor frazer would enter carl had a smile ready for him but there was no chance that the smile would be seen there must have been a hundred and fifty in the room seated and standing though there were but seventy in the course and but two hundred and fiftysix students in the whole college that year  carl looked back he clenched his fist and pounded the soft side of it on his thigh drawing in his breath puffing it out with a long exasperated hellll for the greek professor the commasized sandywhiskered martinet to whom nothing that was new was moral and nothing that was old was to be questioned by any undergraduate stalked into the room like indignant napoleon posing before two guards and a penguin at st helena a student in the back row thriftily gave the greek god his seat the god sat down with a precise nod instantly a straggly man with a celluloid collar left the group by the door whisked over to the greek professor and fawned upon him it was the fearless editor and owner also parttime typesetter of the plato weekly times who dated back to the days of washington flatbed handpresses and pure jeffersonian politics and feared neither man nor devil though he was uneasy in the presence of his landlady he ostentatiously flapped a wad of copypaper in his left hand and shook a spatter of inkdrops from a fountainpen as he interviewed the greek professor who could be seen answering pompously carl was hating them both fearing the greek as a faculty spy on frazer picturing himself kicking the editor when he was aware of a rustling all over the room of a general turning of heads toward the platform  he turned he was smiling like a shy child in his heroworship professor frazer was inconspicuously walking through the low door beside the platform frazers lips were together he was obviously selfconscious his motions were jerky he elaborately did not look at the audience he nearly stumbled on the steps up to the platform his hand shook as he drew papers from a leather portfolio and arranged them on the small readingtable one of the papers escaped and sailed off the platform nearly to the front row nearly every one in the room snickered frazer flushed a girl student in the front row nervously bounded out of her seat picked up the paper and handed it up to frazer they both fumbled it and their heads nearly touched most of the crowd laughed audibly  professor frazer sat down in his low chair took out his watch with a twitching hand and compared his time with the clock at the back of the roomand so closely were the amateur executioners observing their victim that every eye went back to the clock as well even carl was guilty of that imitation consequently he saw the editor standing at the back make notes on his copypaper and smirk like an illbred hound stealing a bone and the greek professor stared at frazers gauche movements with a grim smugness that indicated quite the sort of thing i expected the greeks elbows were on the arm of the seat and he held up before his breast a small redleathercovered notebook which he superciliously tapped with a thin pencil he was waiting like a judge of the inquisition  old greek s going to take notes and make a report to the faculty about what frazer says reflected carl if i could only get hold of his notes and destroy them  carl turned again it was just three professor frazer had risen usually he sat while lecturing fifty whispers commented on that fact fifty regular members of the course became selfimportant through knowing it frazer was leaning slightly against the table it moved an inch or two with his weight but by this time every one was too highstrung to laugh he was pale he rearranged his papers he had to clear his throat twice before he could speak in the now silent vulturishly attentive room smelling of wet secondrate clothes  the gusty rain could be heard they all hitched in their seats  oh frazer cant be going to retract groaned carl but hes scared  carl suddenly wished himself away from all this useless conflict out tramping the wet roads with the turk or slashing through the puddles at thirtyfive miles an hour in the bankers car he noted stupidly that genie linderbecks hair was scarcely combed he found he was saying frazer ll flunk flunk flunk hes going to flunk flunk flunk  then frazer spoke his voice sounded harsh and unrhythmical but soon swung into the natural periods of a public speaker as he got into his lecture  my friends said he a part of you have come here legitimately to hear a lecture a part to satisfy the curiosity aroused by rumors to the effect that i am likely to make indecorous and indecent remarks which your decorum and decency make you wish to hear and of which you will carry away evil and twisted reports to gain the reputation of being fearless defenders of the truth it is a temptation to gratify your desire and shock youa far greater temptation than to be repentant and reactionary only it occurs to me that this place and time are supposed to be devoted to a lecture by henry frazer on his opinions about contemporary drama it is in no sense to be given to the puling defense of a martyr nor to the sensational selfadvertisement of either myself or any of you i have no intention of devoting any part of my lecture aside from these introductory adumbrations to the astonishing number of new friends whose bright and morning faces i see before me i shall neither be so insincerely tactful as to welcome you nor so frightened as to ignore you nor shall i invite you to come to me with any complaints you have about me i am far too busy with my real work  i am not speaking patiently i am not patient with you i am not speaking politely truly i do not think that i shall much longer be polite  wait that sounds now in my ears as rhetorical forgive me and translate my indiscretions into more colloquial language  though from rumors i have overheard i fancy some of you will do that anyway and now i think you see where i stand  now then for such of you as have a genuine interest in the brilliant work of bernard shaw i shall first continue the animadversions on the importance of his social thought endeavor to link it with the great and growing vision of h g wells novelist and not dramatist though he is because of the significance of his new books kips and mankind in the making and point out the serious purpose that seems to me to underlie shaws sarcastic pictures of lifes shams  in my last lecture i endeavored to present the destructive side of present social theories as little as possible to dwell more on the keen desire of the modern thinkers for constructive imagination but i judge that i was regarded as too destructive which amuses me and to which i shall apply the antidote of showing how destructive modern thought is and must bewhether running with sootily smoking torch of individuality in bakunin or hissing in nietzsche or laughing at olympus in bernard shaw my radicalism has been spoken of radical do you realize that i am not suggesting that there might possibly some day be a revolution in america but rather that now i am stating that there is this minute and for some years has been an actual state of warfare between capital and labor do you know that daily more people are saying openly and violently that we starve our poor we stuff our own children with useless bookishness and work the children of others in mills and let them sell papers on the streets in redlight districts at night and thereby prove our state nothing short of insane if you tell me that there is no revolution because there are no barricades i point to actual battles at homestead pullman and the rest if you say that there has been no declaration of war open war i shall read you editorials from the appeal to reason  mind you i shall not say whether i am enlisted for or against the revolutionary army but i demand that you look about you and understand the significance of the industrial disturbances and religious unrest of the time never till then will you understand anythingcertainly not that shaw is something more than an enfant terrible ibsen something more than an illnatured old man with dyspepsia and a silly lack of interest in skating then you will realize that in the most extravagant utterances of a redshirted strikeleader there may be more fervent faith and honor oftentimes than in the virgin prayers of a girl who devoutly attends christian endeavor but presumes to call emma goldman that dreadful woman follow the laborleader or fight him good and hard but do not overlook him  but i must be more systematic when john tanners independent chauffeur of whom you havei hope you haveread in man and superman                                       carl looked about many were frowning a few leaning sidewise to whisper to neighbors with a perplexed headshake that plainly meant i dont quite get that wet feet were shifted carefully breaths caught quickly hands nervously played with lower lips the greek professor was writing something carls exroommate plain smith was rigid staring unyieldingly at the platform carl hated smiths sinister stillness                                       professor frazer was finishing his lecture  if it please you flunk this course dont read a single play i assign to you be disrespectful disbelieve all my contentions and i shall still be content but do not as you are living souls blind yourself to the fact that there is a worldwide movement to build a wider new worldand that the world needs itand that in jamaica mills on land owned by a director of plato college there are two particularly vile saloons which you must wipe out before you disprove me silence for ten seconds then that is all  the crowd began to move hesitatingly while professor frazer hastily picked up his papers and raincoat and hurried out through the door beside the platform voices immediately rose in a web of talk manycolored hotcolored  carl babbled to the man next him he sure is broad he doesnt care whether theyre conservative or not and some sensation at the end  heh what him the sophomore was staring  yes why sure whadya mean demanded carl  well and wha do you mean by broad sure hes broad just like a razor edge  heh echoed the next man down the row a y m c a senior do you mean to say you liked it  why sure why not didnt you  oh yes yes indeed all he said was that scarlet women like emma goldman were better than a c e girl and that he hoped his students would bluff the course and flunk it and that we could find booze at jamaica mills and a few little things like that thats all sure thats the sort of thing we came here to study the senior was buttoning his raincoat with angry fingers thatswhy the man was insane and the way he denounced decency andoh i cant talk about it  wwwwell by gosh of all thethe spluttered carl you and your y m c acalling yourself religious and misrepresenting like thatyou and yourwhy you aint worth arguing with i dont believe you came to study anything you know it all already passionate but bewildered trying not to injure the cause of frazer by being nasty he begged straight didnt you like his spiel didnt it give you some new ideas  the senior vouchsafed no me and my y m didnt like it now dont let me keep you ericson i suppose youll be wanting to join dear mr frazer in a highball youre such a pet of his did he teach you to booze i understand youre good at it  you apologize or ill punch your face off said carl i dont understand professor frazers principles like i ought to im not fighting for them probly would if i knew enough but i dont like your face its too long its like a horses face its an insult to frazer to have a horsefaced guy listen to him you apologize for having a horse face see  youre bluffing you wouldnt start anything here anyway  apologize carls fist was clenched people were staring  cut it out will you i didnt mean anything  you wouldnt snapped carl and rammed his way out making wistful boyish plans to go to frazer with devotion and offers of service in a fight whose causes grew more confused to him every moment beside him as he hurried off to football practice strode a big lineman of the junior class cajoling  calm down son you cant lick the whole college  but it makes me so sore  oh i know but it strikes me that no matter how much you like frazer he was going pretty far when he said that anarchists had more sense than decent folks  he didnt you didnt get him he meanto lord whats the use  he did not say another word as they hastened to the gymnasium for indoor practice  he was sure that they who knew of his partisanship would try to make him lose his temper dear lord please just let me take out just one bonehead and beat him to a pulp and then ill be good and not open my head again was his perfectly reverent prayer as he stripped before his locker  carl and most of the other substitutes had to wait and most of them gossiped of the lecture they all greedily discussed frazers charge that some member of the corporation owned saloon lots and tried to decide who it was but not one of them gave frazer credit twenty times carl wanted to deny twenty times speech rose in him so hotly that he drew a breath and opened his mouth but each time he muttered to himself oh shut up youll only make em worse students who had attended the lecture declared that professor frazer had advocated bombthrowing and obscenity and the others believed marveling well well well well with unctuous appreciation of the scandal  still carl sat aloof on a pair of horizontal bars swinging his legs with agitated quickness while the others covertly watched himslim wiredrawn his chinablue eyes blurred with fury his fair norse skin glowing dull red his chest strong under his tight football jersey a cleancarved boy  the rubber band of his noseguard snapped harshly as he plucked at it playing a song of hatred on that hard little harp  an insignificant thing made him burst out tommy la croix the french canuck a quick grinning evilspoken tobaccochewing rather likeable young thug stared directly at carl and said loudly nother thing i noticed was that frazer didnt have his pants pressed funny aint it that when even these dudes from yale get to be cranks theyre short on baths and tailors  carl slid from the parallel bars he walked up to the line of substitutes glanced sneeringly along them dramatized himself as a fighting rebel remarked half of you are too dumm to get frazer and the other half are oldwoman gossips and ought to be drinking tea and gloomed away to the dressingroom while behind him the substitutes laughed and some one called sorry you dont like us but well try to bear up going to lick the whole college ericson  his ears burned in the dressingroom he did not feel that they had been much impressed                                       to tell the next day or two in detail would be to make many books about the mixed childishness and heroic fineness of carls partisanship to repeat a thousand rumors running about the campus to the effect that the faculty would demand frazers resignation to explain the reason why frazers charge that a plato director owned land used by saloons was eagerly whispered for a little while then quite forgotten while frazers reputation as a crank was never forgotten so much does muck resent the muckraker to describe carls brief call on frazer and his confusing discovery that he had nothing to say to repeat the local papers courageous reports of the frazer affair turks great oath to support frazer through hell and high water turks repeated defiance well by golly well show the mutts but i wish we could do something to chronicle dreary classes whose dullness was evident to carl now after his interest in frazers lectures                                       returning from genie linderbecks room carl found a letter from gertie cowles on the blackwalnut hatrack without reading it but successfully befooling himself into the belief that he was glad to have it he went whistling up to his room  ray cowles and howard griffin those great seniors sat tilted back in wooden chairs and between them was the lord of the world mr bjorken the football coach a large amiable rather religious young man who believed in football foreign missions and the democratic party  hello waiting for me or the turk faltered carl gravely shaking hands all round  just dropped up to see you for a second said mr bjorken  sorry the turk wasnt here carl had an illdefined feeling that he wanted to keep them from becoming serious as long as he could  ray cowles cleared his throat never again would the blackhaired adonis blossom of the flower of joralemon be so old and sadly sage as then we want to talk to you seriously about somethingfor your own sake you know ive always been interested in you and howard and course were interested in you as frat brothers too for old joralemon and plato eh mr bjorken believesmight as well tell him now dont you think mr bjorken  the coach gave a regally gracious nod hitching about on the woodbox carl felt the bottom drop out of his anxious stomach  well mr bjorken thinks youre practically certain to make the team next year and maybe you may even get put in the hamlin game for a few minutes this year and get your p  honest  yes if you do something for old plato same s you expect her to do something for you ray was quite sincere but not if you put the team discipline on the bum and disgrace omega chi of course i cant speak as an actual member of the team but still as a senior i hear things  how dyou mean disgrace  dont you know that because youve been getting so savage about frazer the whole team s getting mad said the coach cowles and griffin and i have been talking over the whole proposition your boosting frazer  look here from carl i wont crawl down on my opinion about frazer folks havent understood him  lord love you son soothed howard griffin we arent trying to change your opinion of frazer were your friends you know were proud of you for standing up for him only thing is now that hes practically fired just tell me how its going to help him or you or anybody else now to make everybody sore by roasting them because they cant agree with you boost dont knock dont make everybody think youre a crank  to be frank added mr bjorken youre just as likely to hurt frazer as to help him by stirring up all this bad blood look here i suppose that if the faculty had already fired frazer youd still go ahead trying to buck them  hadnt thought about it but suppose i would  afraid it might be that way but havent you seen by this time about how much good it does for one lone sophomore to try and run the faculty it was the coach talking again but the gravely nodding mandarinlike heads of howard and ray accompanied him mind you i dont mean to disparage you personally but you must admit that you cant hardly expect to boss everything just what good ll it do to go on shouting for frazer quite aside from the question of whether he is likely to get fired or not  well grunted carl nervously massaging his chin i dont know as it will do any direct goodexcept maybe waking this darn conservative college up a little but it does make me so doggone sore  yes yes we understand old man the coach said but on the other hand heres the direct good of sitting tight and playing the game ive heard you speak about kipling well youre like a young officera subaltern they call it dont theyin a kipling story a fellow thats under orders and its part of his game to play hard and keep his mouth shut and to not criticize his superior officers aint it  oh i suppose so but  well its just the same with you cant you see that think it over what would you think of a lieutenant that tried to boss all the generals just same thing besides if you sit tight you can make the team this year i can practically promise you that do understand this now it isnt a bribe we want you to be able to play and do something for old plato in a real wayin athletics but you most certainly cant make the team if youre going to be a disorganizer  all we want you to do put in ray cowles is not to make a public spectacle of yourselfas im afraid youve been doing admire frazer all you want to and talk about him to your own bunch and dont back down on your own opinions only dont think youve got to go round yelling about him people get a false idea of you i hate to have to tell you this but several of the fellows even in omega chi have spoken about you and wondered if you really were a regular crank of course he isnt you poor cheese i tell em but i cant be around to answer every one all the time and you cant lick the whole college that aint the way the world does things you dont know what a bad impression you make when youre too brash see how i mean  as the council of seers rose carl timidly said to ray straight now have quite a lot of the fellows been saying i was a goat  good many im afraid all talking about you its up to you all you got to do is not think you know it all and keep still keep still till you understand the facultys difficulties just a little better savvy dont that sound fairly reasonable     chapter x   they were gone carl was full of the nauseating shame which a matteroffact man who supposes that he is never pilloried knows when a conscientious friend informs him that he has been observed criticized that his enthusiasms have been regarded as eccentricities his affectionate approaches toward friendship as impertinence  there seemed to be hundreds of people in the room nudging one another waiting agape for him to do something idiotic a welladvertised fool on parade he stalked about now shamefaced now bursting out with a belligerent aw rats ill show em now plaintively beseeching i dont suppose i am helping frazer but it makes me so darn sore when nobody stands up for himand he teaches stuff they need so much here gee im coming to think this is a pretty roughneck college hes the first teacher i ever got anything out ofandoh hang it what d i have to get mixed up in all this for when i was getting along so good and if it isnt going to help him  his right hand became conscious of gerties letter crumpled in his pocket as turning the letter over and over gave him surprisingly small knowledge of its contents he opened it       dear carlyou are just silly to tease me about any bank      clerk i dont like him any more at all and he can go with      linda all he likes much i care       we are enjoying good health though it is getting quite cold      now and we have the furnace running now and it feels pretty      good to have it we had such a good time at adelaides      party she wore such a pretty dress she flirted terribly      with joe jordan though of course youll call me a cat for      telling you because you like her so much better than me       all       oh i havent told you the news yet joe has accepted a      position at st hilary in the mill there       i have some pretty new things for my room a beautiful      handpainted picture before joe goes there is going to be a      party for him at seminas i wish you could come i suppose      you have learned to dance well of course you go to lots of      parties at plato with all the pretty girls  forget all      about me       i wish i was in minneapolis it is pretty dull here  such      good talks you and me had didnt we       oh carl dear ray writes us you are sticking up for that      crazy professor frazer i know it must take lots of courage       i admire you lots for it even if ray doesnt but oh carl      dear if you cant do any good by it i hope you wont get      everybody talking about you without its doing any good will      you carl       i do so expect you to succeed wonderfully  i hope you wont      blast your career even to stand up for folks when its too      late  wont do any good       we all expect so much of youwe are waiting you are our      knight  you arent going to forget to keep your armor      bright nor forget  yours as ever  gertie  mmm remarked carl dunno about this knightandarmor business id look swell i would with a washboiler and a few more tons of junk on mmm expect you to succeed wonderfully oh i dont suppose i had ought to disappoint em dont see where i can help frazer anyway not a bit  the frazer affair seemed very far from him very hysterical  two of the gang ambled in with noisy proposals in regard to a game of poker penny ante but the thought of cards bored him leaving them in possession one of them smoking the turks best pipe which the turk had been so careless as to leave in sight he strolled out on the street and over to the campus  there was a light in the facultyroom in the academic building yet it was not a first and third thursday dates on which the faculty regularly met therefore it was a special meeting therefore  promptly without making any plans carl ran to the back of the building shinned up a waterspout humming just before the battle mother pried open a classroom window with his large jackknife of the variety technically known as a toadstabber changing his tune to onward christian soldiers climbed in tiptoed through the room stopping often to listen felt along the plaster walls to find the door eased the door open calmly sat down in the corridor pulled off his shoes said ouch its cold on the feets slipped into another classroom in the front of the building put on his shoes crawled out of the window walked along a limestone ledge one foot wide to a window of the facultyroom and peeped in  all of the eleven assistant professors and full professors except frazer were assembled with president s alcott wood in the chair and the greek professor addressing them referring often to a redleathercovered notebook  um making a report on frazers lecture said carl clinging precariously to the rough faces of the stones a gust swooped around the corner of the building he swayed gripped the stones more tightly and looked down he could not see the ground it was thirtyfive or forty feet down almost fell he observed gosh my hands are chilly as he peered in the window again he saw the greek professor point directly at the window while the whole gathering startled turned stared a young assistant professor ran toward the door of the room  going to cut me off doggone it said carl theyll wait for me at the mathroom window hooray ive started something  he carefully moved along the ledge to a point halfway between windows and waited flat against the wall  again he glanced down from the high windy narrow ledge it d be a long drop my hands are cold i could slip funny i aint really much scared though say whered i do just this before oh yes he saw himself as little carl lost with gertie in the woods caught by bone stillman at the window he laughed out as he compared the bristly virile face of bone with the pasty face of the young professor seems almost as though i was back there doing the same thing right over funny but im not quite as scared as i was then guess im growing up hello heres our cunning spanish inquisition rubbering out of the next window  the window of the mathematics classroom next to the facultyroom had opened the young professor who was pursuing carl peppered the night with violent words delivered in a rather pedagogic voice well sir we have you you might as well come and give yourself up  carl was silent  the voice said conversationally hes staying out there ill see who it is carl half made out a head thrusting itself from the window then heard in sotto voce i cant see him loudly again the pursuing professor yapped ah i see you youre merely wasting time sir you might just as well come here now i shall let you stay there till you do softly hurry back into the facultyroom and see if you can get him from that side bet its one of the sneaking frazer faction  carl said nothing did not budge he peeped at the ledge above him it was too far for him to reach it he tried to discern the mass of the ground in the confusing darkness below it seemed miles down he did not know what to do he was lone as a mateless hawk there on the ledge against the wall whose stones were pinchingly cold to the small of his back and his spreadeagled arms he swayed slightly realized with trembling nausea what would happen if he swayed too much he remembered that there was pavement below him but he did not think about giving himself up  from the mathematicsroom window came watch him im going out after him  the young professors shoulders slid out of the window carl carefully turned his head and found that now a form was leaning from the facultyroom window as well  got me on both sides darn it well when they haul me up on the carpet ill have the pleasure of telling them what i think of them  the young professor had started to edge along the ledge he was coming very slowly he stopped and complained to some one back in the mathematicsroom this beastly ledge is icy im afraid  carl piped look out yre slipping  in a panic the professor slid back into the window as his heels disappeared through it carl dashed by the window running sidewise along the ledge while the professor was cautiously risking his head in the night air outside the window again gazing to the left where he had reason to suppose carl would have the decency to remain carl was rapidly worming to the right he reached the corner of the building felt for the tin waterpipe and slid down it with his coattail protecting his hands halfway down the cloth slipped and his hand was burnt against the corrugated tin considable slide he murmured as he struck the ground and blew softly on his raw palm  he walked awaynot at all like a melodramatic hero of a slidebynight but like a matteroffact young man going to see some one about business of no great importance he abstractedly brushed his left sleeve or his waistcoat now and then as though he wanted to appear neat  he tramped into the telephonebooth of the corner drugstore called up professor frazer  hello professor frazer this is one of your students in modern drama ive just learnedi happened to be up in the academic building and i happened to find out that professor drood is making a report to the facultyspecial meetingabout your last lecture ive got a hunch hes going to slam you i dont want to butt in but im awfully worried i thought perhaps you ought to know who oh im just one of your students youre welcome oh say professor ggood luck gby  immediately without even the excuse that some evil mind in the gang had suggested it he prowled out to the greek professors house and tied both the front and back gates now the fence of that yard was high and strong and provided with sharp pickets and the professor was short and dignified carl regretted that he could not wait for the pleasure of seeing the professor fumble with the knots and climb the fence but he had another errand  he walked to the house of professor frazer he stood on the walk before it his shoulders straightened his heels snapped together and he raised his arm in a formal salute  he had saluted the gentleness of henry frazer he had saluted his own soul he cried i will stick by him as long as the turk or any of em i wont let omega chi and the coach scare menot the whole caboodle of them ioh i dont think they can scare me     chapter xi   the students of plato were required to attend chapel every morning president s alcott wood earnestly gave out two hymns and between them informed the almighty of the more important news events of the past twentyfour hours with a worried advisory manner which indicated that he felt something should be done about them at once  president wood was an honest anxious body something like a small learned scotch linendraper he was given to being worried and advisory and to sitting up till midnight in his unventilated library grinding at the task of putting new wrong meanings into perfectly obvious statements in the bible he was a series of circlesround head with smooth gray hair that hung in a bang over his round forehead round face with round red cheeks absurdly heavy gray mustache that almost made a circle about his puerile mouth round button of a nose round heavy shoulders round little stomach in a gray sacksuit round dumplings of feet in congress shoes that were never quite freshblacked or quite dusty a harassed honorable studious ignorant humorless jokepopping genuinely conscientious thumb of a man his prayers were long and intimate  after the second hymn he would announce the coming social eventsclass prayermeetings and lanternslide lectures by missionaries during the prayer and hymns most of the students hastily prepared for firsthour classes with lists of dates inside their hymnbooks or they read tightfolded copies of the minneapolis journal or tribune but when the announcements began all plato college sat up to attention for prexy wood was very likely to comment with pedantic sarcasm on student peccadillos on cards and vneck gowns and the unforgivable crime of smoking                                       as he crawled to the bare unsympathetic chapel the morning after spying on the facultyroom carl looked restlessly to the open fields sniffed at the scent of burning leaves watched a thin stream of blackbirds in the windy sky he sat on the edge of a pew nervously jiggling his crossed legs  during the prayer and hymns a spontaneously born rumor that there would be something sensational in president woods announcements went through the student body the president as he gave out the hymns did not look at the students but sadly smoothed the neat green cloth on the readingstand his prayer timid sincere was for guidance to comprehend the will of the lord  carl felt sorry for him poor man s fussed ought to be id be too if i tried to stop a teninch gun like frazer hes singing hard announcements now whats he waiting for jiminy i wish hed spring it and get it over suppose he said something about last nightme  president wood stood silent his glance drifted from row to row of students they moved uneasily then his dry precise voice declaimed  my friends i have an unpleasant duty to perform this morning but i have sought guidance in prayer and i hope  carl was agonizing he does know its me hell ball me out and fire me publicly sit tight ericson hold y nerve think of good old turk carl was not a hero he was frightened in a moment now all the eyes in the room would be unwinkingly focused on him he hated this place of crowding curious young people and drab texthung walls in the last row he noted the pew in which professor frazer sat infrequently he could fancy frazer there pale and stern im glad i spied on em might have been able to put frazer wise to something definite if i could just have overheard em  president wood was mincing on  and so my friends i hope that in devotion to the ideals of the baptist church we shall strive ever onward and upward in even our smallest daily concerns per aspera ad astra not in a spirit of materialism and modern unrest but in a spirit of duty  i need not tell you that there has been a great deal of rumor about the socalled faculty dissensions but let me earnestly beseech you to give me your closest attention when i assure you that there have been no faculty dissensions it is true that we have found certain teachings rather out of harmony with the ideals of plato college the word of god in the bible was good enough for our fathers who fought to defend this great land and the bible is still good enough for us i guessand i cannot find anything in the bible about such doctrines as socialism and anarchism and evolution probably most of you have been fortunate enough to not have wasted any time on this theory called evolution if you dont know anything about it you have not lost anything absurd as it may seem evolution says that we are all descended from monkeys in spite of the fact that the bible teaches us that we are the children of god if you prefer to be the children of monkeys rather than of god well all i can say is i dont laughter  but the old fellow satan is always busy going to and fro even in colleges and in the unrestrained overgrown secularized colleges of the east they have actually been teaching this doctrine openly for many years indeed i am told that right at the university of chicago though it is a baptist institution they teach this same silly twaddle of evolution and i cannot advise any of you to go there for graduate work but these scientific fellows that are too wise for the bible fall into the pits they themselves have digged sooner or later and they have been so smart in discovering new things about evolution that they have contradicted almost everything that darwin who was the high priest of this abominable cult first taught and they have turned the whole theory into a hodgepodge of contradictions from which even they themselves are now turning in disgust indeed i am told that darwins own son has come out and admitted that there is nothing to this evolution well we could have told him that all along and told his father and saved all their time for now they are all coming right back to the bible we could have told them in the first place that the word of god definitely explains the origin of man and that anybody who tried to find out whether we were descended from monkeys was just about as wise as the man who tried to make a silk purse out of a sows ear  carl was settled down in his pew safe  president wood was in his stride all this evolutionary fad becomes ridiculous of course when a mind that is properly trained in clear thinking by the diligent perusal of the classics strips it of its pseudoscientific rags and shows it straight out from the shoulder in the fire of common sense and sound religion and here is the point of my disquisition  on this selfsame evolution this bombast of the selfpushing scientists are founded all such unchristian and unamerican doctrines as socialism and anarchism and the lusts of feminism with all their followers such as shaw and the fellow who tried to shoot mr frick and all the other atheists of the stripe that think so well of themselves that they are quite willing to overthrow the grand old institutions that our forefathers founded on the constitution and they want to set up insteadoh theyre quite willing to tell us how to run the government they want to set up a state in which all of us who are honest enough to do a days work shall support the lazy rascals who arent yet they are very clever men they can pull the wool over your eyes and persuade youif you let themthat a universal willingness to let the other fellow do the work while you paint pictures of flowers and write novels about the abominations of babylon is going to evolute a superior race well when you think they are clever this shaw and this fellow wells and all of them that copy robert g ingersoll just remember that the cleverest fellow of them all is the old satan and that hes been advocating just such lazy doctrines ever since he stirred up rebellion and discontent in the garden of eden  if these things are so then the teachings of professor henry frazer however sincere he is are not in accordance with the stand which we have taken here at plato my friends i want you all to understand me certain young students of plato appear to have felt that the faculty have not appreciated professor frazer one of these students i presume it was one of them went so far as to attempt to spy on faculty meeting last night who that man is i have means of finding out at any time but i do not wish to for i cannot believe that he realized how dishonest was such sneaking  i wish to assure the malcontents that i yield to no one in my admiration of professor frazers eloquence and learning in certain subjects only we have not found his doctrines quite consistent with what we are trying to do they may be a lot more smart and newfangled than what we have out here in minnesota and we may be a lot of old fogies but we are not narrow and we wish to give him just as much right of free speechwe wishthere isuhno slightestuhdesire in fact to impose any authority on any one but against any perversive doctrine we must in all honesty take a firm stand  we carefully explained this to professor frazer and permit me to inform those young men who have taken it upon themselves to be his champions that they would do well to follow his example for he quite agrees with us as to the need of keeping the plato college doctrine consistent in fact he offered his resignation which we reluctantly accepted very very reluctantly it will take effect the first of the month and owing to illness in his family he will not be giving any lectures before then students in his classes by the way are requested to report to the dean for other assignments and so you see how little there is to the cowardly rumors about faculty dissensions  liar liar dear god theyve smothered that kind straight frazer carl was groaning  now my friends i trust you understand our position anduh  president wood drew a breath slapped the readingstand and piped angrily  we have every desire to permit complete freedom of thought and speech among the students of plato but on my word when it comes to a pass where a few students can cause this whole great institution to forget its real tasks and devote all its time to quarreling about a fad like socialism then its time to call a halt  if there are any students here who now that i have explained that professor frazer leaves us of his own free will still persist in their stubborn desire to create trouble and still feel that the faculty have not treated professor frazer properly or that we have endeavored to coerce him then let them stand up right here and now in chapel i mean it let them stop this cowardly running to and fro and secret gossip let them stand right up before us in token of protest hereandnow or otherwise hold their peace  so well trained to the authority of schoolmasters were the students of plato including carl ericson that they sat as uncomfortable as though they were individually accused by the plump pedant who was weakly glaring at them his round childish hand clutching the sloping edge of the oak readingstand his sackcoat wrinkled at the shoulders and sagging back from his low linen collar carl sighted back at frazers pew hoping that he would miraculously be there to confront the dictator the pew was empty as before there was no one to protest against the ousting of frazer for saying what he believed true  then carl was agitated to find that carl ericson a backyard boy was going to rise and disturb all these learned people he was frightened again but he stood up faced the president affectedly folded his arms hastily unfolded them and put his hands in his pockets one foot before the other one shoulder humped a little higher than the other  the whole audience was staring at him he did not dare peep at them but he could hear their murmur of amazement now that he was up he rather enjoyed defying them  well young man so you are going to let us know how to run plato teetered the president im sure everybody will feel much obliged to you  carl did not move he was aware of genie linderbeck rising to his left no one else was up but with genies frail adherence carl suddenly desired to rouse every one to stand for frazer and freedom he glanced over at the one man whom he could always trust to follow himthe turk a tiny movement of carls lips a covert uptoss of his head warned the turk to rise now  the turk moved started to rise slowly as though under force he looked rather shamefaced he uncrossed his legs and put his hands on the pew on either side of his legs  shame trembled a girls voice in the junior section  sit down two or three voices of men softly snarled with a rustle of mobmuttering  the turk hastily crossed his legs and slumped down in his seat carl frowned at him imploringly then angrily he felt spiritually naked to ask support so publicly but he had to get the turk up the turk shook his head beseechingly carl could fancy him grunting aw thunder id like to stand up but i dont want to be a goat  another man rose ill be darned thought carl it was the one man who would be expected not to support the heretic frazerit was carls rustic exroommate plain smith genie was leaning against the pew in front of him but plain smith bulked more immovable than carl  no one joined the three all through the chapel was an undertone of amazed comment and a constant low hissing of sssssit down  the president facing them looked strained it occurred to carl that s alcott wood had his side of the question he argued about the matter feeling detached from his stolidly defiant body then he cursed the president for keeping them there he wanted to sit down he wanted to cry out  president wood was speaking is there any one else stand up if there is no one else very well young men i trust that you are now satisfied with your heroism which we have all greatly appreciated i am sure laughter chapel dismissed  instantly a swirl of men surrounded carl questioning what j do it for why didnt you keep still  he pushed out through them he sat blind through the firsthour quiz in physics with the whole class watching him the thought of the turks failure to rise kept unhappy vigil in his mind the same sequence of reflections ran around like midnight mice in the wall  just when i needed him after all his talk and us so chummy sitting up all hours last night and then the turk throws me down when hed said so many times he just wanted the chance to show how strong he was for frazer damn coward ill go room with genie by goshoh i got to be fair to the turk i dont suppose he could have done much real good standing up course it does make you feel kind of a poor nut doing it genie lookedyes by the jim hill there you are poor little scrawny genieoh yes sure it was up to him to stand up he wasnt afraid and the turk the big stiff he was afraid to just when i needed him after all our talk about frazer sitting up all hours  through the black whirlpool in his head pierced an irritated mr ericson i said have you gone to sleep i understood you were excellent at standing up what is your explanation of the phenomenon the professor of physics and mathematicsthe same who had pursued carl on the ledgewas speaking to him  carl mumbled sullenly not prepared the class sniggered he devoted a moment to hating them as pariahs hate then through his mind went whirling again just wait till i see the turk     chapter xii   a notice from the presidents office commanding carls instant presence was in his postoffice box he slouched into the waitingroom of the offices of the president and dean he was an incarnate desire to say exactly what he thought to the round woolly president wood  plain albert smith was leaving the waitingroom he seized carls hand with his plowmans paw and goodby boy he growled there was nothing gallant about his appearancehis blueflannel shirt dusty with white fuzz his wrinkled brickred neck the oysterlike ear at which he kept fumbling with a seamy fingernail of his left hand but carls salute was a salute to the new king  how dyou mean goodby al  ive just resigned from plato carl  howd you happen to do that did they summon you here  no just resigned said plain smith one time when i was schoolteaching i had a setto with a school committee of farmers about teaching the kids a little botany they said the three rs were enough i won out but i swore id stand up for any teacher that tried to be honest the way he seen it i dont agree with frazer about these socialists and allfellow thats worked at the plow like i have knows a man wants to get ahead for his woman and himself first of all and let the walkingdelegates go to work too but i think hes honest all right and well i stood up and that means losing my scholarship they wont try to fire me guess ill mosey on to the u of m cant probably live there as cheap as here but a cousin of mine owns a big shoestore and maybe i can get a job with him boy you were plucky to get up glad weve got each other finally i feel as though youd freed me from something god bless you  to the deans assistant in the waitingroom carl grandly stated ericson 1908 im to see the president  its been arranged youre to see the dean instead sit down deans engaged just now  carl was kept waiting for a halfhour he did not like the transference to the dean who was no anxious old lamb like s alcott wood but a young collegiate climber with a clipped mustache a gold eyeglass chain over one ear a curt voice many facts a spurious appreciation of music and no mellowness he was a graduate of the university of chicago and aggressively proud of it he had earned his way through college which all tradition and all fiction pronounce the perfect manner of acquiring a noble independence and financial ability indeed the blessing of early poverty is in general praised as the perfect training for acquiring enough wealth to save ones own children from the curse of early poverty it would be safer to malign george washington and the boy scouts professional baseball and the y m c a than to suggest that working ones way through college is not necessarily manlier than playing and dreaming and reading ones way through  diffidently without generalizing the historian reports this fact about the dean he had lost the graciousness of his rustic clergyman father and developed an itchingly bustling manner a tremendous readiness for taking charge of everything in sight by acquiring during his undergraduate days a mastery of all the petty ways of earning money such as charging meek and stupid wealthy students too much for private tutoring and bullying his classmates into patronizing the laundry whose agent he was the dean stuck his little finger far out into the air when drinking from a cup and liked to be taken for a welldressed man of the world  the halfhour of waiting gave carl a feeling of the power of the authorities and he kept seeing plain smith in his cousins shoestore trying to fit womens shoes with his large red hands when he was ordered to step into the deans office now he stumbled in pulling at his soft felt hat  with his back to carl the dean was writing at a rolltop desk the burnished top of his narrow slightly bald head seemed efficient and formidable not glancing up the dean snapped sit down young man  carl sat down he crumpled his hat again he stared at a framed photograph and moved his feet about trying to keep them quiet  more waiting  the dean inspected carl over his shoulder he still held his pen the fingers of his left hand tapped his desktablet he turned in his swivelchair deliberately as though he was now ready to settle everything permanently  well young man are you prepared to apologize to the president and faculty  apologize what for the president said those that wanted to protest  now we wont have any blustering if you please ericson i havent the slightest doubt that you are prepared to give an exhibition of martyrdom that is why i asked the privilege of taking care of you instead of permitting you to distress president wood any further we will drop all this posing if you dont mind i assure you that it doesnt make  i  the slightest impression on me ericson lets get right down to business you know perfectly well that you have stirred up all the trouble you  i  could in regard to mr frazer and i think i really think that we shall either have to have your written apology and your promise to think a little more before you talk hereafter or else we shall have to request your resignation from college i am sorry that we apparently cant run this college to suit you ericson but as we cant why im afraid we shall have to ask you not to increase our inefficiency by making all the trouble you can wait now lets not have any melodrama you may as well pick up that hat again it doesnt seem to impress me much when you throw it down though doubtless it was veree dramatically done oh yes indeed veree dramatic see here i know you and i know your type my young friend and i havent  look here why do i get picked out as the goat the one to apologize because i stood up first when prexy said to  oh not at all say its because you quite shamelessly made motions at others while you stood there and did your best to disaffect men who hadnt the least desire to join in your troublemaking now im very busy young man and i think this is all the time i shall waste on you i shall expect to find your written  say honest dean carl suddenly laughed may i say just one thing before i get thrown out  certainly we have every desire to deal justly with you and to always givealways to give you every opportunity  well i just wanted to say in case i resign and dont see you again that i admire you for your nerve i wish i could get over feeling like a sophomore talking to a dean and then i could tell you i hadnt supposed there was anybody could talk to me the way you have and get away with it id always thought id punch their head off and here youve had me completely buffaloed its wonderful honestly it never struck me till just this second that there isnt any law that compels me to sit here and take all this you had me completely hypnotized  you know i might retort truthfully and say i am not accustomed to have students address me in quite this manner im glad however to find that you are sensible enough not to make an amusing show of yourself by imagining that you are making a noble fight for freedom by decision of the president and myself i am compelled to give you this one chance only unless i find your apology in my letterbox here by five this evening i shall have to suspend you or bring you up before the faculty for dismissal but my boy i feel that perhaps for all your mistaken notions you do have a certain amount of courage and i want to say a word  the dean did say a word in fact he said a large number of admirable words regarding the effect of carls possible dismissal on his friends his family and with an almost tearful climax on his mother  now go and think it over pray over it unselfishly my boy and let me hear from you before five  only  the reason why carl did visualize his mother the reason why the ericson kitchen became so clear to him that he saw his tiredfaced mother reaching up to wind the alarmclock that stood beside the ball of odd string on the shelf above the waterpail the reason why he felt cavedin at the stomach was that he knew he was going to leave plato and did not know where in the world he was going                                       a time of quick action of bursting the bonds even of friendship he walked quietly into genie linderbecks neat room with its rosehued comforter on a narrow brass bed passepartouted copley prints and a small oak table with immaculate green deskblotter and said goodby his hidden apprehension the cold empty feeling of his stomach the nervous intensity of his motions told him that he was already on the long trail that leads to fortune and bowery lodginghouses and death and happiness even while he was warning himself that he must not go that he owed it to his folks to apologize and stay he was stumbling into the bank and drawing out his ninetytwo dollars it seemed a great sum while waiting for it he did sums on the back of a depositslip                    9200 out of bank                    227 in pocket             about   10 at room                           tot  9437          owe tailor      145            turk         25         to  mpls       305 to chi probably 15 to 1800         to n y 20 to 3000 to europe steerage   4000          total about  9275would take me to europe  golly i could go to europe to europe now if i wanted to and have maybe two plunks over for grub on the railroad but id have to allow something for tips i guess maybe it wouldnt be as much as forty dollars for steerage ought to allowoh thunder ive got enough to make a mighty good start seeing the world anyway  on the street a boy was selling extras of the plato weekly times with the heading  president crushes student rebellion  plato demonstration for anarchist handled without gloves  carl read that he and two other students who are alleged to have been concerned in several student pranks had attempted to break up a chapel meeting but had been put to shame by the famous administrator s alcott wood he had never seen his name in the press except some three times in the local items of the joralemon dynamite it looked so intimidatingly public that he tried to forget it was there he chuckled when he thought of plain smith and genie linderbeck as concerned in student pranks but he was growing angry he considered staying and fighting his opponents to the end then he told himself that he must leave plato after having announced to genie that he was going he had made all of his decision except the actual deciding  he omitted his noonday dinner and tramped into the country trying to plan how and where he would go as evening came cloudy and chill in a low wooded tract miles north of plato with dead boughs keening and the uneasy air threatening a rain that never quite came the loneliness of the land seemed to befog all the possibilities of the future he wanted the lamplit security of his room with the turk and the gang in red sweaters singing ragtime with the frazer affair a bad dream that was forgotten the world outside plato would all be like these lowering woods and dreary swamps  he turned he could find solace only in making his mind a blank sullen dull he watched the sunset watched the bellying cumulus clouds mimic the grand ca√±on he had to see the grand ca√±on he would he had turned the corner his clammy heart was warming he was slowly coming to understand that he was actually free to take youths freedom  he saw the vision of the america through which he might follow the trail like the pioneers whose spiritual descendant he was how noble was the panorama that thrilled this onegeneration american can be understood only by those who have smelled our brown soil not by the condescending gods from abroad who come hither to gather money by lecturing on our evil habit of moneygathering and return to europe to report that america is a land of irish politicians jewish theatrical managers and mining millionaires who invariably say i swan to calculate all of them huddled in unfriendly hotels or in hovels set on hopeless prairie not such the america that lifted carls chin in wonder  cities of tall towers tawny deserts of the southwest and the flawless sky of cornflower blue over sagebrush and painted butte silent forests of the northwest golden china dragons of san francisco old orchards of new england the oily gulf of mexico where tramp steamers puff down to rio a snowpiled cabin among somber pines of northern mountains elsewhere elsewhere elsewhere beyond the skyline under larger stars where men ride jesting and women smile names alluring to the american he repeatedshenandoah santa ynez the little big horn baton rouge the great smokies rappahannock arizona cheyenne monongahela androscoggin ca√±on and bayou sycamore and mesquite broadway and el camino real  he hurled along into plato he went to mrs henkels for supper he smiled at the questions dumped upon him and evaded answering he took mae thurston aside and told her that he was leaving plato he wanted to call on professor frazer he did not dare from a pleasant gentleman drinking tea frazer had changed to a prophet whom he revered  carl darted into his room the turk was waiting for him carl cut short the turks apologies for not having supported frazer with the dreadful curt pleasantness of an alienated friend and as he began packing his clothes in two old suitcases insisted its all rightwas your biz whether you stood up in chapel or not he hunted diligently through the back of the closet for a nonexistent shoe in order to get away from the shamefaced melancholy which covered the turk when carl presented him with all his books his skees and his pet hockeystick he prolonged the search because it had occurred to him that as it was now eleven oclock and the train north left at midnight the minneapolis train at 2 am it might be well to decide where he was going when he went away well minneapolis and chicago beyond thathed wait and see anywherehe could go anywhere in all the world now  he popped out of the closet cheerfully  while the turk mooned carl wrote short honest notes to gertie to his banker employer to bennie rusk whom he addressed as friend ben he found himself writing a long and spirited letter to bone stillman who came out of the backwater of ineffectuality as a man who had dared frankly he wrote to his motherhis mammy he wistfully called her to his father he could not write with quick thumps of his fist he stamped the letters then glanced at the turk he was gay mature businesslike ready for anything ill pull out in half an hour now he chuckled  gosh sighed the turk i feel as if i was responsible for everything oh say heres a letter i forgot to give you came this afternoon  the letter was from gertie       dear carli hear that you are standing for that frazer      just as much as ever and really carl i think you might      consider other peoples feelings a little and not be so  selfish  without finishing it carl tore up the letter in a fury then poor kid guess she means well he thought and made an imaginary bow to her in farewell  there was a certain amount of the milk of humankindness in the frozen husk he had for a time become but he must be blamed for icily rejecting the turks blundering attempts to make peace he courteouslycourtesy between these twodeclined the turks offer to help him carry his suitcases to the station that was like a slap  goodby hang on tight he said as he stooped to the heavy suitcases and marched out of the door without looking back  by some providence he was saved from the crime of chilly selfrighteousness on the darkness of the stairs he felt all at once how responsive a chum the turk had been he dropped the suitcases not caring how they fell rushed back into the room and found the turk still staring at the door he cried  old man i wassay you yahoo are you going to make me carry both my valises to the depot  they rushed off together laughing promising to write to each other  the minneapolis train pulled out with carl trying to appear commonplace none of the sleepy passengers saw that the golden fleece was draped about him or that under his arm he bore the harp of ulysses he was merely a young man taking a train at a waystation     part ii  the adventure of adventuring     chapter xiii   there are today in the mind of carl ericson many confused recollections of the purposeless wanderings which followed his leaving plato college for more than a year he went down down in the social scale down to dirt and poverty and association with the utterly tough and reckless but day by day his young joy of wandering matured into an ease in dealing with whatever man or situation he might meet he had missed the opportunity of becoming a respectable citizen which plato offered now he did all the grubby things which plato obviated that her sons might rise to a place in society to eighteen hundred dollars a year and the possession of evening clothes and a knowledge of greek but the light danced more perversely in his eyes every day of his roving  the following are the several jobs for which carl first applied in chicago all the while frightened by the roar and creeping shadows of the city  tutoring the children of a millionaire brewer keeping time on the italian and polack washers of a windowcleaning company reporting on an evanston newspaper driving a taxicab a motortruck keeping books for a suburban realestate firm he had it ground into him as grit is ground into your face when you fall from a bicycle that every one in a city of millions is too busy to talk to a stranger unless he sees a sound reason for talking he changed the joralemon dynamites phrase accept a position to get a joband he got a job as packer in a department store big as the whole of joralemon since the street throngs had already come to seem no more personal and separable than the bricks in the buildings he was not so much impressed by the crowds in the store as by the number of things for women to hang upon themselves he would ramble in at lunchtime to stare at them and marvel you cant beat it  from eight till twelvethirty and from one till six or seven during nearly two months carl stood in a long brickwalled stuffy room inundated by floods of things to pack wondering why he had ever left plato to become the slave of a swede foreman the great world as he saw it through a tiny hole in one of the opaque wireglass windows consisted of three bars of a rusty fireescapelanding against a yellow brick wall with a smudge of black on the wall below the landing  within two days he was calling the packingroom a prison the ceaseless rattle of speckled gray wrappingpaper the stamp of feet on the gray cement floor the greasy gray hair of the packer next to him the yellowstained cracked gray washbowl that served for thirty men such was his food for dreams  because his muscles were made of country earth and air he distanced the packers from the slums however he became incredibly swift at nailing boxes and crates and smashing the heavy wrappingpaper into shape about odd bundles the foreman promised to make carl his assistant but on the cold december saturday when his elevation was due he glanced out of a window and farewell all ambition as a packer  the window belonged to the florida bakery and lunch room where carl was chastely lunching there was dirty sawdust on the floor six pine tables painted red and adorned with catsupbottles whose mouths were clotted with dried catsup and a long counter scattered with bread and white cakes and petrified rolls behind the counter a snuffling illnatured fat woman in slippers handed bags of crullers to shrillvoiced children who came in with pennies the tables were packed with overworked and underpaid men to whom lunch was merely a means of keeping themselves from feeling inconveniently emptya state to which the leadlike viands of the florida lunch room were a certain prevention  carl was gulping down salty beef stew and bitter coffee served in handleless cups half an inch thick beside him elbow jogging elbow was a surlyfaced man in overalls the old german waiters shuffled about and bawled zwei bif stew ein cheesecake dishes clattered incessantly the sickysweet scent of old pastry of coffeerings with stony raisins and buns smeared with dried cocoanut fibers seemed to permeate even the bitter coffee  carl got down most of his beef stew attacked and gave up a chunk of hard boiled potato and lighted a cheap virginia cigarette he glanced out of the dirty window before it making inquiries of a big leisurely policeman was a slim exquisite girl of twenty rosycheeked smart of hat impeccable of gloves with fluffy white furs beneath her chin which cuddled into the furs with a hint of a life bright and spacious she laughed as she talked to the policeman she shrugged her shoulders with the exhilaration of winter and skipped away  bet shed be a peach to know fat chance id have to meet her wrapping up babycarriages for the north shore commuters all day all day well guess im going to honorably discharge myself  he left the job that afternoon  his satiny norse cheeks shone as he raced home through a rising blizzard after dinner at the florida lunch room where he had allowed himself a tencent dessert for celebration  but when he lolled in his hall bedroom with his eyes attracted as usual to the three cracks in the bluepainted ceiling which made a rough map of africa when he visioned lands where there were lions and desert instead of departmentstore packages his happiness wilted in face of the fact that he had only 1042 with 800 due him from the store the following tuesday several times he subtracted the 300 he owed the landlady from 1842 but the result persisted in being only 1542 he could not make 1542 appear a reasonable sum with which to start life anew  he had to search for a new job that evening onlyhe was so tired it was so pleasant to lie there with his sore feet cooling against the wall picturing a hunt in africa with native servants bringing him things to eat juicy steaks and frenchfried potatoes and gallons of ale a repast which he may have been ignorant in assigning to the african jungles but which seemed peculiarly well chosen after a lunchroom dinner of watery cornedbeef hash burnt germanfried potatoes and indigestible hot mincepie his thoughts drifted off to plato but carl had a certain resoluteness even in these loose days he considered the manoeuvers for a new job he desired one which would permit him to go to theaters with the girl in white furs whom he had seen that noonthe unknown fairy of his discontent  it may be noted that he took this life quite seriously though he did not suppose that he was going to continue dwelling in a hall bedroom yet never did he regard himself as a collegian harounalraschid on an amusing masquerade pretending to be no better than the men with whom he worked carl was no romantic hero incog he was a workman and he knew it was not his father a carpenter his fathers best friend a tailor had he not been a waiter at plato  but not always a workman carl had no conception of worldwide classconsciousness he had no pride in being a proletarian though from bones musings and frazers lectures he had drawn a vague optimism about a worldsyndicate of nations he took it for granted that he was going to be rich as soon as he could  job he had to have a job he got stiffly up from the iron bed painfully drew on his shoes after inspecting the hole in the sole of the left shoe and the ripped seam at the back of the right he pulled tight the paperthin overcoat which he had bought at a secondhand dealers shop and dared a chicago blizzard with needles of snow thundering by on a sixtymile gale through a street of unutterably drab stores and saloons he plowed to the unallied taxicab companys garage he felt lonely cold but he observed with ceaseless interest the new people different people who sloped by him in the dun web of the blizzard the american marveled at a recently immigrated slavs astrachan cap  he had hung about the unallied garage on evenings when he was too poor to go to vaudeville he had become decidedly friendly with the night washer a youngster from minneapolis trotting up to the washer who was digging caked snow from the shoes of a car he blurted  say coogan ive beat my job at s hows chances for getting a taxi to drive you know i know the game  you driving a taxi stammered the washer why say there was a guy that was a roadtester for the blix company and hes got a cousin that knows bathhouse john and that guy with all his pull has been trying to get on drivin here for the last six months and aint landed it so you see about how much chance you got  gosh it dont look much like i had much chance for a fact  tell you what ill do though why dont you get on at some automobile factory and then you could ring in as a chauffeur soon s you got some recommends you could take to the y m c a employment bureau the washer gouged at a clot of ice with his heel swore profusely and went on here you go over to the lodestar motor companys office over on la salle monday and ask for bill coogan on the sales end hes me cousin and you tell him to give you a card to the foreman out at the works and i guess maybe youll get a job all right  tuesday morning after a severe questioning by the foreman carl was given a weeks tryout without pay at the lodestar factory he proved to be one of those muchsought freaks in the world of mechanics a natural filer the uninspired filer unaware of the niceties of the art saws up and down whereas the instinctive filer like carl draws his file evenly across the metal and the result fits its socket truly so he was given welcome paid twentyfive cents an hour and made full member of exactly such a gang as he had known at plato after he had laughed away the straw boss who tried to make him go ask for a lefthanded monkeywrench he roomed at a machinists boardinghouse and enjoyed the furious discussions over religion and the question of air versus water cooling far more than he had ever enjoyed the polite jesting at mrs henkels  he became friendly with the foreman of the repairshop and was promised a chance while the driver who made the roadtests of the cars was ill carl was called on as a substitute the older workmen warned him that no one could begin roadtesting so early and hold the job but carl happened to drive the vicepresident of the firm he discussed bassfishing in minnesota with the vicepresident and he was retained as roadtester getting his chauffeurs license two months later when he was helping in the overhauling of a car in the repairshop he heard a fullbodied man with a smart english overcoat and a supercilious red face ask curtly of the shop foreman where he could get a crack shuffer right away one that can give the traffic cops something to do for their money  the foreman always stopped to scratch his chin when he had to think this process gave carl time to look up from his repairs and blandly remark thats me want to try me  half an hour later carl was engaged at twentyfive dollars a week as the ruddy ones driver before monday noon he had convinced the ruddy one that he was no servant but a mechanical expert he drove the ruddy one to his investments and securities office in the morning and back at five to restaurants in the evening not infrequently with the wind whooping about corners he slept peacefully in the car till two in the morning outside a caf√© and he was perfectly happy he was at last seeing the great world as he manoeuvered along state street he rejoiced in the complications of the traffic and tooted his horn unnecessarily as he waited before tall buildings at noon he gazed up at them with a superior air of boredombecause he was so boyishly proud of being a part of all this titanic life that he was afraid he might show it he gloried in every new road in driving along the lake shore where the horizon was bounded not by unimaginative land but by restless water  then the ruddy ones favorite roads began to be familiar to carl too familiar and he so hated his sot of an employer that he caught himself muttering while driving thank the lord i sit in front and dont have to see that chunk of raw beefsteak he calls a neck  while he waited for the fifth time before a certain expensive but not exclusive roadhouse with the bouncing giggles of girls inside spoiling the spring night he studied the background as once he had studied his fathers woodshed he was not unfortunately shocked by wine and women but he was bored by boxtrees there was a smugly clipped boxtree on either side of the carriage entrance the leaves like cheap green lacquer in the glare of the arclight which brought out all the artificiality of the grayandblack cinder drive he felt that five pilgrimages to even the best of boxtrees were enough it would be perfectly unreasonable for a free man to come here to stare at boxtrees a sixth time all right he growled i guess mywanderingboytonight is going to beat it again  while he drove to the garage he pondered is it worth twentyfive plunks to me to be able to beat it tonight instead of waiting four days till payday nope im a poor man  but at 5 am he was hanging about the railroadyards at hammond recalling the lessons of youth in flipping trains and at seven he was standing on the bumpers between two freightcars clinging to the brakerod looking out to the open meadows of indiana laughing to see farmhouses ringed with appleblossoms and sweet with april morning the cinders stormed by him as he swung with the cars on curves he saw the treacherous wheels grinding beneath him but to the chuckachuck chuckachuck chuckachuck of the trucks he hummed never turn back never tur back never tur back     chapter xiv   a young hobo named carl ericson crawled from the rods of an n  w freightcar at roanoke virginia on a may day with spring at full tide and the judastrees a singing pink on the slopes of the blue ridge  hm grunted the young hobo i like these mountains guess ill stay here awhile virginia plantations and civil war history and richmond and everything and me here  a frowzy old hobo poked a somnolent head up from a pile of lumber near the tracks and yawned welcome to the recruit hello slim hows tricks  pretty good whats the best section to batter for a pokeout billy  to the right over that way and straight out  much bliged said slimerstwhile ericson say j know of any jobs in this  any whats  jobs  jobs you looking forsay you beat it gwan chase yourself gwan now dont stand there you aint no decent bo youre another of those unfortunate workmen thats spoiling the profesh the veteran stared at carl reprovingly yet with a little sadness too at the thought of how bitterly he had been deceived in this young comrade and his uncombed head slowly vanished amid the lumber  carl grinned and started uptown he walked into four restaurants at noon in white jacket he was bustling about as waiter in the diningroom of the waskahominie hotel which had white service as a feature  within two days he was boon companion of a guest of the waskahominieparker heye an actor famous from cape charles to shockeysville now playing heavies at roanoke in the great riley tent show presenting a popular repertoire of famous melodramas under canvas rain or shine admittance twentyfive cents section reserved for colored people the best show under canvas this week only  when parker heye returned from the theater carl sat with him in a room which had calicolike wallpaper a sunken bed with a comforter out of which oozed a bit of its soiled cotton entrails a cracked waterpitcher on a staggering washstand and a beautiful new cuspidor of white china handpainted with pink mossroses tied with narrow blue ribbon  carl listened credulously to heyes confidences as to how jealous was riley the actormanager of heyes art how heye had knocked them all down in a stock company at newport news and what e h sothern had said to him when they met in richmond as guests of the seven pines club  say rasped heye youre a smart young fellow goodlooking ejucated why dont you try to get an engagement ill knock you down to riley the second juvenile s going to leave on saturday and there aint hardly time to get anybody from norfolk  golly that d be great cried carl who like every human being since eden with the possible exceptions of calvin and richard mansfield had a secret belief that he could be a powerful actor  well ill see what i can do for you said heye at parting alternately snapping his suspenders and scratching his head though he was in his stockingfeet and coatless though the back of his neck was a scraggle of hair parker heye was preferable to the three swiss waiters snoring in the hot room under the eaves with its door half open opposite the halfopen door of the room where negro chambermaids tumbled and snorted in uncouth slumber carls nose wrinkled with bitter fastidiousness as he pulled off his clothes sticky with heat and glared at the swathed forms of the waiters he was the aristocrat among proletarians going back to his own peopleof the great riley tent show                                       as second juvenile of the tent show carl received only twelve dollars a week but mr riley made him promises rich as the orient beryl and permitted him to follow the example of two of the bandsmen and pitch a cot on the trampled hay flooring of the dressingroom tent behind the stage there also carl prepared breakfast on an alcoholstove the canvas creaked all night negroes and small boys stuck inquisitive heads under the edge of the canvas but it was worth itto travel on again to have his mornings free except for an hours rehearsal to climb to upland meadows of virginia and kentucky among the pines and laurel and rhododendron tramping up past the log cabins plastered with mud where pickaninnies stared shyly past glens shining with dogwood and friendly streams once he sat for an hour on easter knob gazing through a distant pass whose misty blue he pretended was the ocean once he heard there were moonshiners back in the hills he talked to bearded dunkards and their sunbonneted wives and when he found a confederate veteran he listened to the tale of the defense of richmond delighted to find that the boys in gray were not merely names in the historybooks  of all these discoveries he wrote to his mother wishing that her weary snowbleached life might know the southern sun and the first five dollars he saved he sent to her  but as soon as carl became an actor parker heye grew jealous of him and was gratingly contemptuous when he showed him how to make up among the cheap actors jammed in the mens dressingroom before a pine board set on two sawhorses under the light of a flaring kerosenetorch carl came to hate heye and his splotched face his pale large eyes and yellow teeth and the bang on his forehead his black string tie that was invariably askew his slovenly blue suit his foppishly shaped tan button shoes with bulldog toes heye invariably jeered dont make up so heavy well put a little rouge on your lips what dyou think you are a blooming redlipped venus try to learn to walk across the stage as if you had one leg that wasnt wood anyway its customary to go to sleep when youre playing a listening r√¥le but dont snore oh youre a swell actor think of me swallering your story about having been t college dont make up your eyebrows so heavy you fool why you ever wanted to be an actor  the great riley agreed with all that heye said and marveled with heye that he had ever tried an amateur carl found the dressingroom a haydusty hell but he enjoyed acting in the widows penny alabama nell the moonshiners daughter and the crooks revenge far more than he had enjoyed picking phrases out of shakespeare at a vaguely remembered plato since in joralemon and plato he had been brought up on melodrama he believed as much as did the audience in the plays it was a real mountain cabin from which he fired wonderfully loud guns in the moonshiners daughter and when the old mountaineer cried they aint going to steal mah gal carl was damp at the eyes and swore with real fervor the oath to protect the girl sure that in the ravine behind the backdrop his bearded foemen were lurking  the crooks revenge was his favorite for he was cast as a young millionaire and wore evening clothes secondhand he held off a mob of shrieking gangsters crouched behind an overturned table in a gamblingden he coolly stroked the lovely hair of the ing√©nue miss evelyn lewysse with one hand leveled a revolver with the other and made fearless jests the while to the infinite excitement of the audience especially of the hyahhyahhyahing negroes whose faces under the flicker of lowered calciumcarbide lights made a segregated strip of yellowblack polkadotted with white eyeballs  when the people were before him respectful to art under canvas carl could love them but even the tiniest raggedbreeched darky was bold in his curiosity about the strolling players when they appeared outside and carl was selfconscious about the giggles and stares that surrounded him when he stopped on the street or went into a drugstore for the comfortable solace of a banana split he was in a rage whenever a welldressed girl peeped at him amusedly from a onelunged runabout the staring so flustered him that even the pride of coming from chicago and knowing about motors did not prevent his feeling feeble at the knees as he tried to stalk by the grinning motored aristocracy he would return to the showtent to hate the few tawdry drops and flatsthe patch of green spattered with dirty white which variously simulated a daisyfield a mountainside and that part of central park directly opposite the fifth avenue residence of the millionaire counterfeiter who you remember always comes out into the street to plot with his confederates carl hated with peculiar heartiness the anemic palely varnished folding garden bench which figured now as a seat in the moonshiners den and now with a cotton leopardskin draped over it as a fauteuil in the luxurious drawingroom of mrs van antwerp the garden bench was however associated with his learning to make stage love to miss evelyn lewysse  it was difficult to appear unconscious of fifty small boys all smacking their lips in unison while he kissed the air one centimeter in front of miss lewysses lips but he learned the art indeed he began to lessen that centimeter of safety  miss evelyn lewysse christened lena ludwig and heir presumptive to one of the best delicatessens in newport news reveled in lovemaking on and off carl was attracted by her constantly uncomfortably she smiled at him in the wings smoothed her fluffy blond hair at him and told him in confidence that she was a highschool graduate that she was used to much oh much better companies and was playing under canvas for a lark she bubbled ach louie say aint it hot honest mr ericson i dont see how you stand it like you do say honest that was swell business you pulled in the third act last night say i know what lets dolets get up a swell act and get on the peanut circuit wed hit broadway with a noise like seventeen marine bands say honest mr ericson you do awful well fori bet you aint no amachoor i bet you been on before  he devoured it  one night finding that miss evelyn made no comment on his holding her hand he lured her out of the tent during a long wait trembled and kissed her her fingers gripped his shoulders agitatedly plucked at his sleeve as she kissed him back she murmured oh you hadnt ought to do that but afterward she would kiss him every time they were alone and she told him with confidential giggles of parker heyes awkward attempts to win her heyes most secret notes she read till carl seriously informed her that she was violating a trust miss evelyn immediately saw the light and promised she would never never never do anythin like that again and honest she hadnt realized she was doing anythin dishonable but heye is such an old pest which was an excuse for her weeping on his shoulder and his kissing the tears away  all day he looked forward to their meetings yet constantly the law of the adventurer which means the instinct of practical decency warned him that this was no amour for him that he must not make love where he did not love that this goodhearted vulgarian was too kindly to tamper with and too absurd to love onlyand again his breath would draw in with swift exultation as he recalled how elastic were her shoulders to stroke  it was summer now and they were back in virginia touring the eastern shore carl the prairieborn had been within five miles of the open atlantic though he had not seen it along the endless flat potatofields broken by pinegroves under whose sultry shadow negro cabins sweltered the heat clung persistently the showtent was always filled with a stale scent of people  at the town of nankiwoc the hotel was not all it might have been evelyn lewysse announced that she was good and sick of eating a vaudeville dinner with the grub acts stuck around your plate in a lot of birds bathtubslittle mess of turnips and a dab of spinach and a fried cockroach and when it comes to sleeping another night on a bed like a gridiron nothankyou and believe me if i see that old rube hotelkeeper comb his whiskers at the hall hatrack againhe keeps a baby comb in his vest pocket with a leadpencil and a cigar some drummer gave himif i have to watch him comb that alfalfa again ill bite his ears off and get pinched by the s p c a  with mrs lubley the old lady and complacent unofficial chaperon of the show eve was going to imitate carl and the two bandsmen and sleep in the dressingroom tent over half of which was devoted to the women of the company  every day carl warned himself that he must go no farther but every night as eve and he parted to sleep with only a canvas partition between them he cursed the presence of the show chaperon and of the two bandsmen always distressingly awake and talking till after midnight  a hot june night the whole company had been invited to a dance at the u c v hall the two bandsmen were going the chaperonlively old lady with experience on the burlesque circuitwas gaily going carl and eve were not it had taken but one glance between them to decide that  they sat outside the silent tent on a wardrobe trunk what manner of night it was whether starlit or sullen carl did not know he was aware only that it was oppressive and that eve was in his arms in the darkness he kissed her moist hot neck he babbled incoherently of the show people but every word he said meant that he was palpitating because her soft body was against his he knewand he was sure that she knewthat when they discussed heyes string tie and pretended to laugh they were agitatedly voicing their intoxication  his voice unsteady carl said jiminy its so hot eve im going to take off this darn shirt and collar and put on a soft shirt ssay wwhy dont you put on a kimono or something be so much cooler  oh i dont know as i ought to she was frightened awed at bacchic madness ddo you think it would be all right  why not guess anybodys got a right to get coolnight like this besides they wont be back till 4 pm and you got to get cool come on  and he knewand he was sure that she knewthat all he said was pretense but she rose and said nebulously as she stood before him ruffling his hair well i would like to get cool if you think its all rightill put on something cooler anyway  she went carl could hear a rustling in the womens end of the dressingroom tent fevered he listened to it fevered he changed to an outingshirt open at the throat he ran out not to miss a moment with her she had not yet come he was too overwrought to heed a small voice in him a voice born of snowfields colored with sunset and trained in the quietudes of henry frazers house which insisted go slow stop a louder voice throbbed like the pulsing of the artery in his neck shes coming  through the darkness her light garment swished against the long grass he sprang up then he was holding her bending her head back he exulted to find that his gripping hand was barred from the smoothness of her side only by thin silk that glided and warmed under his fingers she sat on his knees and snuggled her loosened hair tinglingly against his bare chest he felt that she was waiting for him to go on  suddenly he could not would not go on  dearest we mustnt he mourned  o carl she sobbed and stopped his words with clinging lips  he found himself waiting till she should finish the kiss that he might put an end to this  perhaps he was checked by provincial prejudices about chivalry but perhaps he had learned a little selfcontrol in any case he had stopped for a second to think and the wine of love was gone flat he wished she would release him also her hair was tickling his ear he waited patiently till she should finish the kiss  her lips drew violently from his and she accused you dont want to kiss me  look here i want to kiss you all rightlord for a second his arms tightened then he went on cold but well both be good and sorry if we go too far it isnt just a cowardly caution itsoh you know  oh yes yes yes we mustnt go too far carl but cant we just sit like this o sweetheart i am so tired i want somebody to care for me a little that isnt wicked is it i want you to take me in your arms and hold me close close and comfort me i want so much to be comforted we neednt go any further need we  oh now good lord eve look here dont you know we cant go on and not go farther im having a hard enough time he sprang up shakily lighting a cigarette he stroked her hair and begged please go eve i guess i havent got very good control over myself please you make me  oh yes yes sure blame it on me sure i made you let me put on a kimono im leading your pure white shriveled peanut of a soul into temptation dont you ever dare speak to me again oh youyou  she flounced away  carl caught her in two steps see here child he said gravely if you go off like this well both be miserable you remember how happy we were driving out to the old plantation at powhasset  o gawd wont you men never say anything original remember it of course i remember it what do you suppose i wore that little branch of laurel you picked for me wore it here here at my breast and i thought youd care if i hid it here where there wasnt any grease paint and you dontyou dont careand we picnicked and i sang all the time i put up those sandwiches and hid the grapefruit in the basket to surprise you  o darling eve i dont know how to say how sorry i am so terribly sorry ive started things going it is my fault but cant you see ive got to stop it before its too late just for that reason lets be chums again  she shook her head her hand crept to his slid over it drew it up to her breast she was swaying nearer to him he pulled his hand free and fled to his tent  perhaps his fiercest gibe at himself was that he had had to play the r√¥le of virgin galahad rejecting love which is praised in books and ridiculed in clubs he mocked at his sincere desire to be fair to eve and between mockeries he strained to hear her moving beyond the canvas partition he was glad when the bandsmen came larruping home from the dance  next day she went out of her way to be chilly to him he did not woo her friendship he had resigned from the great riley show and he was goinggoing anywhere so long as he kept going     chapter xv   he had been a jolly mechanic again in denim overalls and jumper and a defiant black skullcap with long shiny vizor the tender of the motorboat fleet at an ontario summer hotel one day he had looked up sweating and greasy to see howard griffin of plato parading past in white flannels he had muttered i dont want them to know ive just been bumming around ill go some place else and ill do something worth while now he was on the train for new york meditating impersonally on his uselessness considering how free of moss his rolling had kept him he could think of no particularly masterful plan for accumulating moss if he had not bought a ticket through to new york he would have turned back to seek a position in one of the great automobile factories that now this early autumn of 1906 were beginning to distinguish detroit well he had enough money to last for one week in new york he would work in an automobile agency there later he would go to detroit and within a few years be president of a motor company rich enough to experiment with motorboats and to laugh at howard griffin or any other platonian  so he sketched his conquering entrance into new york unfortunately it was in the evening and having fallen asleep at poughkeepsie he did not awake till a brakeman shook his shoulder at the grand central station he had heard of the old grand union hotel and drowsily with the stuffy nose and sandy eyes and unclean feeling about the teeth that overpower one who sleeps in a smokingcar he staggered across to the hotel and spent his first conquering night in filling a dollar room with vulgar sounds of overweary slumber  but in the morning when he stared along fortysecond street when he breakfasted at a childs restaurant like a gigantic tiled bathroom and realized that the buckwheat cakes were new york buckwheats when he sighted the noble times building and struck out for broadway the magic name that promised marble palaces even if it provided twostory shacks when he bustled into a carburetor agency and demanded a jobthen he found the gateway of wonder  but he did not find a job  eight nights after his arrival he quietly paid his bill at the hotel tipped a curlyheaded bellboy checked his baggage which consisted of a shirt a razor and an illustrated catalogue of automobile accessories put his toothbrush in his pocket bought an evening paper in order to feel luxurious and walked down to the charity organization society with ten cents in his pocket  in the joint application bureau filled with desks and filingcabinets where poor men cease to be men and become cases carl waited on a long bench till it was his turn to tell his troubles to a keen kindly graybearded man behind a rolltop desk he asked for work work was it seemed the one thing the society could not give he received a ticket to the municipal lodging house  this was not the hygienic hostelry of today but a barracks on first avenue carl had a chunk of bread with too much soda in it and coffee with too little coffee in it from a contemptuous personage in a white jacket who though his cuffs were grimy showed plainly that he was too good to wait on bums carl leaned his elbows on the long scrubbed table and chewed the bread of charity sullenly resolving to catch a freight next day and get out of town  he slept in a narrow bunk near a man with consumption the room reeked of disinfectants and charity                                       the east side of new york a whirlwind of noise and smell and hovering shadows the jargon of jewish matrons in brown shawls and orthodox wigs chaffering for cabbages and black cotton stockings and gray woolen undershirts with excitable pushcart proprietors who had beards so prophetic that it was startling to see a frivolous cigarette amid the reverend mane the scent of fried fish and decaying bits of kosher meat and hallways as damnably rotten of floor as they were profitable to new yorks nicest circles the tall gloom of sixstory tenements that made a prison wall of dulled yellow bristling with beddingpiled fireescapes and the curious heads of frowzy women a potpourri of russian signs yiddish newspapers synagogues with sixpointed gilt stars bakeries with piles of rye bread crawling with carawayseeds shops for renting wedding finery that looked as if it could never fit any one secondhand furnitureshops with folding iron beds a filthy baby holding a baby slightly younger and filthier mangy cats slinking from pile to pile of rubbish and a withered geranium in a tin can whose label was hanging loose and showed ruststains amid the dry paste on its back everywhere crowds of voluble jews in dark clothes and noisily playing children that catapulted into your legs the lungerblocks in which we train the victims of russian tyranny to appreciate our freedom a whirlwind of alien ugliness and foul smells and incessant roar and the deathless ambition of young jews to know ibsen and syndicalism it swamped the courage of hungry carl as he roamed through rivington street and essex and hester vainly seeking jobs from shopkeepers too poor to be able to bathe  he felt that he not these matteroffact crowds was alien he was hungry and tired there was nothing heroic to dojust go hungry there was no place where he could sit down the benches of the tiny hardtrodden parks were full if he could sit down if he could rest one little hour he would be able to go and find freightyards where there would be the clean clang of bells and rattle of trucks instead of gabbled yiddish then he would ride out into the country away from the brooding shadows of this town where there were no separable faces but only a fog of ceaselessly moving crowds  late that night he stood aimlessly talking to a hobo on a dirty corner of the bowery where the early september rain drizzled through the gaunt structure of the elevated he did not feel the hunger so much now but he was meekly glad to learn from his new friend the hobo that in one more hour he could get food in the breadline he felt very boyish and would have confided the fact that he was starving to any woman to any one but this transcontinental hobo the tramp royal trained to scorn hunger because he was one of them he watched incuriously the procession of vagrants in coats whose collars were turned up and fastened with safetypins against the rain the vagrants shuffled rapidly by their shoulders hunched their hands always in their trousers pockets their shoeheels always ground down and muddy  and incuriously he watched a saloonkeeper whose face was plastered over with a huge mustache come out and hang a sign porter wanted in am on the saloon door  as he slouched away to join the breadline a black deuce in the worlds discard carl was wondering how he could get that imperial appointment as porter in a bowery saloon he almost forgot it while waiting in the breadline so occupied was he in hating two collegians who watched the line with that open curiosity which nice clean respectable young men suppose the poor never notice he restrained his desire to go over and quote greek at them because they were ignorant and not to blame for being sure that they were of clay superior to any one in a breadline and partly because he had forgotten his greek  he came back to the bowery briskly alone with the manhood of a loaf of bread in him he was going to get that job as porter he planned his campaign as a politician plans to become a statesman he slipped the sign porter wanted in am from its nail and hid it beneath his coat he tramped the block all night and as suspicious characters always do to avoid seeming suspicious he begged a match from a policeman who was keeping an eye on him the policeman chatted with him about baseball and advised him to keep away from liquor and missions  at 5 am carl was standing at the saloon door when the bartender opened it carl bounced in slightly dizzy conscious of the slime of mud on his fraying trouserends  the saloon had an air of cheap crime and a floor covered with clotted sawdust the bar was a slab of darkbrown wood so worn that semicircles of slivers were showing the nasty gutter was still filled with cigarends and puddles of beer and bits of freelunch cheese  i want that job as porter said carl  oh you do do you well you wait and see who else comes to get it  nobody else is going to come  how do you know they aint  carl drew the sign from beneath his coat and carefully laid it on the bar thats why  well you got nerve you got the nerve of a republican on fourteenth street like the fellow says you must want it well all right i guess you can have it if the boss dont kick  carl was accepted by the boss who gave him a quarter and told him to go out and get a regular feed he hummed over breakfast he had been accepted again by all men when he had been accepted by the proprietor of a bowery saloon he was going to hold this job no matter what happened the rolling stone was going to gather moss  for three months carl took seriously the dirtiest things in the world he worked sixteen hours a day for eight dollars a week cleaning cuspidors scrubbing the floor scattering clean sawdust cutting the more rotten portions off the freelunch meat as he slopped about with halffrozen brittle rags hoboes pushed him aside and spat on the floor he had just cleaned  of his eight dollars a week he saved four he rented an airshaft bedroom in the flat of a jewish sweatshop worker for one dollar and seventyfive cents a week it was occupied daytimes by a cook in an allnight restaurant who had taken a bath in 1900 when at coney island on an excursion of the pip ogilligan association the room was unheated and every night during january carl debated whether to go to bed with his shoes on or off  the sublandlords daughter was a dwarfish blotchedfaced passionate child of fifteen with moist eyes and very lowcut waists of coarse voile which she pronounced voyle she would stop carl in the dark railroad hallway and chewing gum rapidly chatter about the aisleman at wanamacys and what a swell time there would be at the coming ball of the thomas j monahan literary and social club tickets twentyfive cents for lady and gent including hatcheck she let carl know that she considered him closefisted for never taking her to the movies on sunday afternoons but he patted her head and talked to her like a big brother and kept himself from noticing that she had clinging hands and would be rather pretty and he bought her a wholesome womans magazine to readnot an entirely complete solution to the problem of what to do with the girl whom organized society is too busy to nourish but the best he could contrive just then  sundays when he was free for part of the day he took his book of recipes for mixed drinks to the readingroom of the tompkins square library and gravely studied them for he was going to be a bartender  every night when he staggered from the comparatively clean air of the street into the fetid chill of his room he asked himself why heson of northern tamaracks and quiet bookswent on with this horrible imitation of living and each time answered himself that whether there was any real reason or not he was going to make good on one job at least and that the one he held and admonished himself that he was very well paid for a saloon porter  if carl had never stood in the breadline if he had never been compelled to clean a saloon gutter artistically in order to keep from standing in that breadline he would surely have gone back to the commonplaceness for which every one except bone stillman and henry frazer had been assiduously training him all his life they who know how naturally life runs on in any sphere will understand that carl did not at the time feel that he was debased he lived twentyfour hours a day and kept busy with no more wonder at himself than is displayed by the professional burglar or the man who devotes all his youth to learning greek or soldiering nevertheless the work itself was so much less desirable than driving a car or wandering through the moonlight with eve lewysse in days wonderful and lost that to endure it to conquer it he had to develop a control over temper and speech and body which was to stay with him in windy mornings of daring  within three months carl had become assistant barkeeper and now he could save eight dollars a week he bought a couple of motor magazines and went to one vaudeville show and kept his sublandlords daughter from running off with a cadet wondering how soon she would do it in any case and receiving a depressing insight into the efficiency of society for keeping in the mire most of the people born there  three months later at the end of winter he was ready to start for panama  he was going to panama because he had read in a sunday newspaper of the canals marvels of engineering and jungle  he had avoided making friends there was no one to give him farewell when he emerged from the muck but he had one task to performto settle with the saloon snob  petey mcguff was the name of this creature he was an oldish and wicked man born on the bowery he had been a heavyweight prizefighter in the days of john l sullivan then he had met john and been ever since an honest crook who made an excellent living by conducting a boxingschool in which the real work was done by assistants he resembled a hound with a neat black bow tie and he drooled tobaccojuice down his big rawlooking moist bristly toomasculine chin every evening from eleven to midnight petey mcguff sat at the round table in the mildewed corner at the end of the bar drinking oldfashioned whisky cocktails made with bourbon playing canfield staring at the nude models pasted on the milky surface of an old mirror and teasing carl  here boy come ere an wipe off de whisky you spilled come on you tissycat get on de job you look like sundayschool harry mammas little rosycheeked boy some day im going to bust your beezer gawd it makes me sick to sit here and look at dose goilygoily cheeks come ere lizzie an wipe dis table again on de jump daughter  carl held himself in hundreds of times he snarled to himself i wont hit him i will make good on this job anyway he created a grin which he could affix easily  now he was leaving he had proven that he could hold a job had answered the unspoken criticisms from plato from chicago garages from the great riley show for the first time since he had deserted college he had been able to write to his father to answer the grim carpenters unspoken criticisms of the son who had given up his chance for an education and proudly he had sent to his father a little check he had a beautiful new fifteendollar suit of blue serge at home in his pocket was his ticketsteerage by the p r r line to colonand he would be off for bluewater next noon his feet danced behind the bar as he filled schooners of beer and scraped off their foam with a celluloid ruler he saw himself in panama with a clean mans job talking to cosmopolitan engineers against a background of greenandscarlet jungle and oh yes he was going to beat petey mcguff that evening and get back much of the belligerent selfrespect which he had been drawing off into schooners with the beer  old petey rolled in at two minutes past eleven warmed his hands at the gasstove poked disapprovingly at the pretzels on the freelunch counter and bawled at carl hey keep away from dat

panama had passed watlings island and steamed into storyland on the whitescrubbed deck aft of the wheelhouse carl sat with his friends of the steeragesturdy men all used to open places old ed the rockdriller long irish hugehanded irate kindly harry the young mechanic from cleveland ed and an oiler were furiously debating about the food aboard  aw its rotten all of it  look here ed how about the chicken they give the steerage on sunday  chicken i didnt see no chicken i see some seagull though no wonder they aint no more seagulls following us they shot em and cooked em on us  say mused harry makes me think of when i was shipbuilding in phillyno it was when i was broke in k cand a guy  carl smiled in content exulting in the talk of the men of the road exulting in his new blue serge suit his new silvergray tie with no smell of the saloon about it fingernails that were growing pink againand the sunset that made glorious his petty prides a vast plane of unrippling plumcolored sea was set with mirrorlike pools where floated treebranches so suffused with light that the glad heart blessed them his first flyingfish leaped silvery from silver sea and carl cried almost aloud this is what ive been wanting all my life  aloud to harry say whats it like in kansas im going down through there some day he spoke harshly but the real carl was robed in light and the murmurous wake of evening with the tropics down the skyline                                       lying in his hot steerage bunk stripped to his undershirt carl peered through the stateroom window to the swishing night sea conscious of the rolling of the boat of the engines shaking her of bolts studding the white iron wall of lifepreservers over his head of stokers singing in the gangway as they dumped the clinkers overboard the panama was pounding on on on and he rejoiced this is just what ive wanted always                                       they are creeping in toward the wharf at colon he is seeing panama first a point of palms then the hospital the red roofs of the i c c quarters at cristobal and negroes on the sunblistered wharf  at last he is free to go ashore in wonderlanda medley of colon and cristobal panama and the canal zone of 1907 spiggoty policemen like monkeys chattering bad spanish and big smiling canal zone policemen in khaki with the air of soldiers jamaica negroes with conical heads and brown barbados negroes with cockney accents english engineers in lordly pugrees and tourists from new england who seem servants of their own tortoiseshell spectacles comfortable ebon mammies with silver bangles and kerchiefs of stabbing scarlet dressed in starched pinkandblue gingham vending guavas and green toboga island pineapples carl gapes at panamanian nuns and chilean consuls french peasant laborers and indignant irish foremen and german concessionaries with dueling scars and high collars gold spanish signs and spiggoty money and hotels with american cuspidors and jobhunters tin roofs and arcades shops open to the street in front but mysterious within giving glimpses of the canny chinese proprietors smoking tiny pipes trains from towns along the canal and sometimes the black funeralcar bound for monkey hill cemetery gamblinghouses where it is considered humorous to play where is my wandering boy tonight on the phonograph while wandering boys sit at poker and less cleanly places named after the various states negro wenches in yellow calico dancing to fiddled tunes older than voodoo indian planters coming sullenly in with palegreen bananas memories of the spanish main and morgans raid of pieces of eight and cutlasses ho capes of cocoanut palms running into a welter of surf huts on piles streaked with moss round whose bases landcrabs scuttle with a dry rattling that carries far in the hot moist still air and suggests the corpses of disappeared men found half devoured  then for contrast the transplanted north with its seriousness about the service the american avenues and cool breezes of cristobal where fat bald chiefs of the i c c drive pompously with political guests who in 1907 are still incredulous about the success of the military socialism of the canal and where wives from oklahoma or boston seated in grand rapids goldenoak rockers on the screened porches of bungalows talk of hats and children and mailorders and cards and the colonel and malarial fever and chautauqua and the culebra slide  colon a kaleidoscope of crimson and green and dazzling white warmhued peoples and sizzling roofs with echoes from the high endeavor of the canal and whispers from the unknown bush drenched with sudden rain like escaping steam or languid under the desert glare of the sky where hangs a gyre of buzzards whose slow circles are stiller than death and calmer than wisdom  lord sighs carl ericson from joralemon this is what ive wanted ever since i was a kid                                       at pedro miguel which the canal employees always called peter mcgill he found work first as an unofficial timekeeper presently after examinations as a stationery engineer on the roll of the i c c within a month he showed no signs of his bowery experiences beyond a shallow hollow in his smooth cheeks he lived in quarters like a college dormitory communistic and jolly littered with shoes and cubecut tobacco and college banners clean youngsters dropping in for an easy chatand behind it all the mystery of the bush his roommate a conductor on the p r r was a globetrotter and through him carl met the adventurers whom he had been questing ever since he had run away from oscar ericsons woodshed there was a young engineer from boston tech who swore every morning at 707 when it rained boiling water as enthusiastically as though it had never done such a thing before that he was going to chihuahua mining there was cockeye corbett an exsailor who was immoral and a lancashireman and knew more about blackbirding and copra and kanakas and the rumholes from nagasaki to mombasa than it is healthy for a civil servant to know  every sunday a sadfaced man with ashcolored hair and bony fingers who had been a lieutenant in the peruvian navy a teacher in st johns college china and a subcontractor for railroad construction in montana and who was now a minor clerk in the cool lofty offices of the materials and supplies department came over from colon relaxed in a tiltedback chair and fingered the masonic charm on his horsehair watchguard while he talked with the p r r conductor and the others about rubyhunting and the relief of peking and where is hector macdonald and is john orth dead and shall we try to climb chimborazo and creussot guns and pigsticking and swahili tribal lore these were a few of the topics regarding which he had inside information the others drawled about various strange things which make a man discontented and bring him no good  carl was full member of the circle because of his tales of the bowery and the great riley show and because he pretended to be rather an authority on motors for dirigibles about which he read in aeronautics at the y m c a readingroom it is true that at this time early 1907 the wrights were still working in obscurity unknown even in their own dayton though they had a completely successful machine stowed away and as yet glenn curtiss had merely developed a motor for captain baldwins military dirigible but langley and maxim had endeavored to launch powerdriven heavierthanair machines lively santos dumont had flipped about the eiffel tower in his dirigible and actually raised himself from the ground in a ponderous aeroplane and in may 1907 a sculptor named delagrange flew over six hundred feet in france various crank inventors were solving the problem of flight every day man was fluttering on the edge of his earthy nest ready to plunge into the air carl was able to make technicalsounding predictions which caught the imaginations of the restless children                                       the adventurers kept moving the beachcombing exsailor said that he was starting for valparaiso started for san domingo and landed in tahiti whence he sent carl one postcard worded what price t t the engineer from boston tech kept his oath about mining in chihuahua he got the appointment as assistant superintendent of the tres reyes mineand he took carl with him  carl reached mexico and breathed the air of highlying desert and hill he found rare days purposeless and wonderful as the voyages of ancient norse ericsens days of learning spanish and sitting quietly balancing a 3220 marlin waiting for bandits to attack the joy of repairing machinery and helping to erect a new crusher nursing peons with broken legs and riding cowponies down black mountain trails at night under an exhilarating splendor of stars it never seemed to him that the machinery desecrated the mountains stern grandeur  stolen hours he gave to the building of boxkites with cambered wings after rapturously learning in the autumn of 1908 that in august a lanky american mechanic named wilbur wright had startled the world by flying an aeroplane many miles publicly in france that before this on july 4 1908 another yankee mechanic glenn curtiss had covered nearly a mile for the scientific american trophy after a series of trials made in company with alexander graham bell j a d mccurdy casey baldwin and augustus post  he might have gone on until death dealing with excitable greasers and hysterical machinery but for the coming of a new mine superintendentone of those englishmen stolid redmustached pipesmoking eyebrowlifting who at first seem beefily dull but prove to have known every one from george moore to marconi he inspected carl hundreds of times then told him that the period had come when he ought to attack a city conquer it build up a reputation cumulatively that he needed a contrast to platonians and bowery bums and tropical tramps and even to his beloved engineers  you can do everything but order a petit d√Æner √† deux but you must learn to do that too go make ten thousand pounds and study pall mall and the boulevards and then come back to us in mexico ill be sorry to have you gowith your damned old silky hair like a womans and your wink when guittrez comes up here to threaten usbut dont let the hinterland enslave you too early  a month later in january 1909 aged twentythree and a half carl was steaming out of el paso for california with one thousand dollars in savings a beautiful new stetson hat and an ambition to build up a motor business in san francisco as the desert sky swam with orange light and a whitebrowed woman in the seat behind him hummed musettas song from la boh√®me he was homesick for the outlanders whom he was deserting that he might stick for twenty years in one street and grub out a hundred thousand dollars     chapter xvii   on a grassy sidestreet of oakland california was jones  ericsons garage gasoline and repairs motor cycles and bicycles for rent oakland agents for bristow magnetos  it was perhaps the cleverest garage in oakland and berkeley for the quick repairing of motorcycles and newly wed owners of family runabouts swore that carl ericson could make a carburetor out of a tomatocan and even be agreeable when called on for repairs at 2 am he had doubled old joness business during the nine monthsfebruary to november 1909that they had been associated  carl believed that he thought of nothing but work and the restaurants and theaters of civilization no more rolling for him until he had gathered moss he played that he was a confirmed business man the game had hypnotized him for nearly a year he whistled as he cleaned plugs and glanced out at the eucalyptustrees and the sunny road without wanting to run away but just today just this glorious raincleansed november day with high blue skies and sunlight on the feathery peppertrees he was going to sneak away from work and have a celebration all by himself  he was going down to san mateo to see his first flyingmachine  november 1909 bl√©riot had crossed the english channel mccurdy had in march 1909 calmly pegged off sixteen miles in the silver dart biplane paulhan had gone eightyone miles and had risen to the incredible height of five hundred feet to be overshadowed by orville wrights sixteen hundred feet glenn curtiss had won the gordon bennett cup at rheims  california was promising to be in the van of aviation she was remembering that her own montgomery had been one of the pioneers los angeles was planning a giant meet for january a dozen cowpasture aviators were taking credulous young reporters aside and confiding that next day or next week or at latest next month they would startle the world by ascending in machines on entirely new and revolutionary principles on which they had been working for ten years sometimes it was for eight years they had been working but always they remarked that the model from which the machine will be built has flown perfectly in the presence of some of the most prominent men in the locality these machines had a great deal to do with the mysterious qualities of gyroscopes and helicopters  now dr josiah bagby the san francisco physician and oilburningmarineengine magnate had really brought three genuine bl√©riot monoplanes from france with carmeau graduate of the bl√©riot school and licensed french aviator for working pilot and was experimenting with them at san mateo near san francisco where the grandsons of the fortyniners play polo it had been rumored that he would open a school for pilots and build bl√©riottype monoplanes for the american market  carl had lain awake for an hour the night before picturing the wonder of flight that he hoped to see he rose early put on his politest garments and informed grumpy old jones that he was off for a froliche wasnt sure he said whether he would get drunk or get married he crossed the bay glad of the seagulls the glory of mt tamalpais and san franciscos hill behind fairy hill he consumed a pacific sund√¶ with a feeling of holiday and hummed mandalay on the trolley to san mateo he read over and over the newspaper accounts of bagbys monoplanes  walking through san mateo carl swung his cocky green hat and scanned the sky for aircraft he saw none but as he tramped out on the flyingfield he began to run at the sight of two wide cambered wings rounded at the ends like the end of ones thumb attached to a fragile long body of open framework men were gathered about it a man with a short crisp beard and a tight woolen toboggancap was seated in the body the wings stretching on either side of him he scratched his beard and gesticulated a mechanic revolved the propeller and the unmuffled motor burst out with a trrrrrrrr whose music rocked carls heart black smoke hurled back along the machine the draught tore at the hair of two men crouched on the ground holding the tail they let go the monoplane ran forward along the ground and suddenly was off it a foot up ten feet upreally flying carl could see the aviator calmly staring ahead working his arms as the machine turned and slipped away over distant trees  his first impression of an aeroplane in the air had nothing to do with birds or dragonflies or the miracle of it because he was completely absorbed in an impression of carl ericson which he expressed after this wise  iamgoingtobeanaviator  and later yes thats what ive always wanted  he joined the group in front of the hangartent workmen were hammering on wooden sheds back of it he recognized the owner dr bagby from his pictures a lean man of sixty with a sallow complexion a gray mustache like a rattail a broad black countrified slouchhat on the back of his head a gray sacksuit which would have been respectable but unfashionable at any period whatsoever he looked like a country lawyer who had served two terms in the state legislature his shoes were black but not blackened and had no toecapsthe comfortable shoes of an oldish man he was tapping his teeth with a thin corded forefinger and remarking in a monotonous voice to a mexican youth plump and polite and well dressed wellll tony i guess those plugs were better i guess those plugs were better heh bagby turned to the others marveled at them as if trying to remember who they were and said slowly i guess those plugs were all right heh  the monoplane was returning for a time apparently not moving like a black mark painted on the great blue sky then soaring overhead the sharply cut outlines clear as a penandink drawing then landing bouncing on the slightly uneven ground  as the french aviator climbed out dr bagbys sad face brightened and he suggested those plugs went better munseer heh ive been thinking maybe you been giving her too rich a mixture  while they were wiping the gn√¥me engine carl shyly approached dr bagby he felt frightfully an outsider wondered if he could ever be intimate with the magician as was the plump mexican youth they called tony he said uh once or twice and blurted i want to be an aviator  yes yes said dr bagby gently glancing away from carl to the machine he went over twanged a supportingwire and seemed to remember that some one had spoken to him he returned to the fevered carl walking sidewise staring all the while at the resting monoplane so efficient yet so quiet now and slender and feminine yes yes so youd like to be an aviator so youd likelikehey boy dont touch thatto be an aviator yes yes they all would m boy they all would well maybe you can be some day maybe you can be some day  i mean now right away heard you were going t start a school want to join  hm hm sighed dr bagby tapping his teeth jingling his heavy gold watchchain brushing a trail of cigarashes from a lapel then staring abstractedly at carl who was turning his hat swiftly round and round so flushed of cheek so excited of eye that he seemed twenty instead of twentyfour yes yes so youd like to join tst but that would cost you five hundred dollars you know  right  well you go talk to munseer about it munseer carmeau he is a very good aviator he is a licensed aviator he knows henry farman he studied under bl√©riot he is the boss here im just the poor old fellow that stands around sometimes munseer takes me up for a little ride in our machine sometimes he takes me up but he is the boss he is the boss my friend youll have to see him and dr bagby walked away apparently much discouraged about life  carl was not discouraged about life he swore that now he would be an aviator even if he had to go to dayton or hammondsport or france  he returned to oakland he sold his share in the garage for 1150  before the end of january he was enrolled as a student in the bagby school of aviation and monoplane building  on an impulse he wrote of his wondrous happiness to gertie cowles but he tore up the letter then proudly he wrote to his father that the lost boy had found himself for the first time in all his desultory writing of homeletters he did not feel impelled to defend himself     chapter xviii   crude were the surroundings where carmeau turned out some of the best monoplane pilots america will ever see there were two rude shedhangars in which they kept the three imported bl√©riotsa singleseat racer of the latest type a bl√©riot xii passengercarrying machine with the seat under the plane and ptite marie the school machine which they usually kept throttled down to four hundred or five hundred but in which carmeau made such spirited flights as the one carl had first witnessed back of the hangars was the workshop which had little architecture but much machinery here the pupils were building two bl√©riottype machines and trying to build an eightcylinder v motor all these things had bagby given for the good of the game expecting no profit in return he was one of the real martyrs of aviation this sapless oldish man never knowing the joy of the air yet devoting a lifetime of ability to helping man sprout wings and become superman  his generosity did not extend to livingquarters most of the students lived at the hangars and dined on hamburg sandwiches fried eggs and mexican enchiladas served at a lunchwagon anchored near the field that lunchwagon was their club here squatted on high stools treating one another to gingerale they argued over torque and angles of incidence and monoplanes vs biplanes except for two unpopular aristocrats who found boardinghouses in san mateo they slept in the hangars in their overalls sprawled on mattresses covered with horseblankets it was bed at eightthirty at four or five carmeau would crawl out scratch his beard start a motor and set every neighborhood dog howling the students would gloomily clump over to the lunchwagon for a hamandegg breakfast the first flights began at dawn if the day was clear at eight when the wind was coming up they would be heard in the workshop adjusting and readjusting machining down bearings testing wing strength humming and laughing and busy a life of gasoline and hammers and straining attempts to get balance exactly right a happy life of good fellows and the achievements of machinery and preparation for daring the upper air a life of very ordinary mechanics and of sheer romance  it is a grievous heresy that aviation is most romantic when the aviator is portrayed as a young god of noble rank and a collar high and spotless carelessly driving a transatlantic machine of perfect efficiency the real romance is that a perfectly ordinary young man the sort of young man who cleans your car at the garage a prosaically real young man wearing overalls faded to a thin blue splitting his infinitives and frequently having for idol a bouncing ing√©nue should in a rickety structure of wood and percale be able to soar miles in the air and fulfil the dream of all the creeping ages  in english and american fiction there are now nearly as many aeroplanes as rapiers or roses the fictional aviators are society amateurs wearers of evening clothes frequenters of the club journalists and civil engineers and lordlings and international agents and gentlemen detectives who drawl oh yes i fly a bitnew sensation y knowtired of polo and immediately thereafter use the aeroplane to raid arsenals rescue a maiden from robbers or a large ruby from its lawful but heathenish possessors or prevent a zeppelin from raiding the coast but they never by any chance fly these machines before gumchewing thousands for hire in england they absolutely must motor from the club to the flyingfield in a powerful rollsroyce car the british aviators of fiction are usually from oxford and eton they are splendidly languid and modest and smartly dressed in society but when they condescend to an adventure or to a coincidence they are very devils six feet of steel and sinew boys of the bulldog breed with a strong trace of hummingbird like their english kindred the americans take up aviation only for gentlemanly sport and they do go about rescuing things nothing is safe from their rescuing but they do not have rollsroyce cars  carl and his class at bagbys were not of this gilded race carls flying was as sordidly real as laying brick for a onestory laundry in a milltown therefore being real it was romantic and miraculous  among carls class was hank odell the senior student tall thin hopelessly plain of face a drawling roughhaired eaglenosed yankee who grinned shyly and whose adams apple worked slowly up and down when you spoke to him an unimaginative lover of dogs and machinery the descendant of lexington and gettysburg and a flinty vermont farm an exfireman exsergeant of the army and exteamster he always wore a khaki shirtthe wrinkles of which caught the grease in black lines like veinswith black trousers blunttoed shoes and a pipe the most important part of his costume  there was the round anxious polite mexican tony beanno called tony beanwealthy simple fond of the violin and of fast motoring there was the school grouch surly jack ryan the chunky exchauffeur there were seven nondescriptsa clever jew from seattle two college youngsters an apricotranchers son a circus acrobat who wanted a new line of tricks a dull ensign detailed by the navy and an earnest student of aerodynamics aged forty who had written marvelously dull books on aircurrents and had shrinkingly made himself a fair balloon pilot the navy ensign and the student were the snobs who lived away from the hangars in boardinghouses  there was lieutenant forrest haviland detailed by the armyhaviland the perfect gentle knight the wellbeloved the nearest approach to the gracious fiction aviator of them all yet never drawling in affected modesty never afraid of grease smiling and industrious and reticent smooth of hair and cameo of face wearing khaki ridingbreeches and tan puttees instead of overalls always a gentleman even when he tried to appear a workman he pretended to be enthusiastic about the lunchwagon and never referred to his three generations of army officers but most of the others were shy of him and jack ryan the school grouch was always trying to get him into a fight  finally there was carl ericson who slowly emerged as star of them all he knew less of aerodynamics than the timid specialist less of practical mechanics than hank odell but he loved the fun of daring more he was less ferocious in competition than was jack ryan but he wasted less of his nerve he was less agile than the circus acrobat but knew more of motors he was less compactly easy than lieutenant haviland but he took better to overalls and sleeping in hangars and mucking in greasehe whistled ragtime while forrest haviland hummed macdowell                                       carls earliest flights were in the school machine ptite marie behind carmeau the instructor reporters were always about talking of impressions and carl felt that he ought to note his impressions on his first ascent but all that he actually did notice was that it was hard to tell at what instant they left the ground that when they were up the wind threatened to crush his ribs and burst his nostrils that there must be something perilously wrong because the machine climbed so swiftly and when they were down that it had been worth waiting a whole lifetime for the flight  for days he merely flew with the instructor till he was himself managing the controls at last his first flight by himself  he had been ordered to try a flight three times about the aerodrome at a height of sixty feet and to land carefully without pancakingand be sure monsieur be veree sure you do not cut off too high from the ground said carmeau  it was a day when five reporters had gathered and carl felt very much in the limelight waiting in the nacelle of the machine for the time to start the propeller was revolved carl drew a long breath and stuck up his handand the engine stopped he was relieved it had seemed a terrific responsibility to go up alone he wouldnt now not for a minute or two he knew that he had been afraid the engine was turned over once moreand once more stopped carl raged and never again in all his flying did real fear return to him what the deuce is the matter he snarled again the propeller was revolved and this time the engine hummed sweet the monoplane ran along the ground its tail lifting in the blast till the whole machine seemed delicately poised on its tiptoes he was off the ground his rage leaving him as his fear had left him  he exulted at the swiftness with which a distant group of trees shot at him under him he turned and the machine mounted a little on the turn which was against the rules but he brought her to even keel so easily that he felt all the mastery of the man who has finally learned to be natural on a bicycle he tilted up the elevator slightly and shot across a series of fields climbing it was perfectly easy he would go upup it was all automatic nowcloche toward him for climbing away from him for descent toward the wing that tipped up in order to bring it down to level the machine obeyed perfectly and the footbar for steering to right and left responded to such light motions of his foot he grinned exultantly he wanted to shout  he glanced at the barometer and discovered that he was up to two hundred feet why not go on  he sailed out across san mateo and the sense of people below running and waving their hands increased his exultation he curved about at the end somewhat afraid of his ability to turn but having all the air there was to make the turn in and headed back toward the aerodrome already he had flown five miles  half a mile from the aerodrome he realized that his motor was slackening missing fire that he did not know what was the matter that his knowledge had left him stranded there two hundred feet above ground that he had to come down at once with no chance to choose a landingplace and no experience in gliding the motor stopped altogether  the ground was coming up at him too quickly  he tilted the elevator and rose but as he was volplaning this cut down the speed and from a height of ten feet above a field the machine dropped to the ground with a flat plop something gave waybut carl sat safe with the machine canted to one side  he climbed out cold about the spine and discovered that he had broken one wheel of the landingchassis  all the crowd from the flyingfield were running toward him yelling he grinned at the foolish sight they made with their legs and arms strewn about in the air as they galloped over the rough ground lieutenant haviland came up panting all right o man good he seized carls hand and wrung it carl knew that he had a new friend  three reporters poured questions on him how far had he flown was this really his first ascent by himself what were his sensations how had his motor stopped was it true he was a mining engineer a wealthy motorist  hank odell the shy eaglenosed yankee running up as jerkily as a cow in a plowed field silently patted carl on the shoulder and began to examine the fractured landingwheel at last the instructor m carmeau  carl had awaited m carmeaus praise as the crown of his long flight but carmeau pulled his beard opened his mouth once or twice then shrieked what the davil you tink you are a millionaire that we build machines for you to smash them i tole you to fly tree time aroundyou fly to algiers an backyou tink you are another farman brotheryou are a damn fool suppose your motor he stop while you fly over san mateo where you land in a well in a chimney hein you know nauting yet next time you do what i tal you zut that was a flight a flight you make a flight that was fine fine you make the heart to swell but nex time you break the chassis and keel yourself nom dun tonnerre i scol you  carl was humble but the courier reporter spread upon the front page the story of marvelous first flight by bagby student and predicted that a new curtiss was coming out of california under a halftone ran the caption ericson the new hawk of the birdmen  the camp promptly nicknamed him hawk they used it for plaguing him at first but it survived as an expression of fondnesshawk ericson the cheeriest man in the school and the coolest flier     chapter xix   not all their days were spent in work there were mornings when the wind would not permit an ascent and when there was nothing to do in the workshop they sat about the lunchwagon wrangling endlessly or like carl and forrest haviland wandered through fields which were all one flame with poppies  lieutenant haviland had given up trying to feel comfortable with the naval ensign student who was one of the solemn worthies who clear their throats before speaking and then speak in measured terms of brands of cigars and weather gradually working side by side with carl haviland seemed to find him a friend in whom to confide once or twice they went by trolley to san francisco to explore chinatown or drop in on soldier friends of haviland at the presidio                                       from the porch of a studio on telegraph hill in san francisco they were looking down on the islands of the bay waiting for the return of an artist whom haviland knew inarticulate dreamers both they expressed in monosyllables the glory of bluewater before them the tradition of r l s and frank norris the future of aviation they gave up the attempt to explain the magic of san franciscothat citypersonality which transcends the opal hills and rare amber sunlight festivals and the transplanted italian hilltown of telegraph hill liners sailing out for japan and memories of the fortyniners it was too subtle a spirit too much of it lay in human life with the passion of the riviera linked to the strength of the north for them to be able to comprehend its spell but regarding their own ambitions to do they became eloquent  i say hesitated haviland why is it i cant get in with most of the fellows at the camp the way you can ive always been chummy enough with the fellows at the point and at posts  because youve been brought up to be afraid to be anything but a gentleman  oh i dont think its that i can get fond as the deuce of some of the commonest common soldiersand lord some of them come from the bowery and all sorts of impossible places  yes but you always think of them as common they dont think of each other that way suppose id workedwell just suppose id been a bowery bartender could you be loafing around here with me could you go off on a bat with jack ryan  well maybe not maybe working with jack ryan is a good thing for me im getting now so i can almost stand his stories i envy you knocking around with all sorts of people oh i wish i could call ryan jack and feel easy about it i cant perhaps ive got a little of the subaltern snob some place in me  you youre a prince  if youve elevated me to a princedom the least i can do is to invite you down home for a weekenddown to the san spirito presidio my fathers commandant there  oh id like to buti havent got a dresssuit  buy one  yes i could do that butoh rats forrest ive been knocking around so long i feel shy about my table manners and everything id probably eat pie with my fingers  you make me so darn tired hawk you talk about my having to learn to chum with people in overalls youve got to learn not to let people in evening clothes put anything over on you thats your difficulty from having lived in the backcountry these last two or three years you have an instinct for manners but i did notice that as soon as you found out i was in the army you spent half the time disliking me as a militarist and the other half expecting me to be haughtylord knows what over it took you two weeks to think of me as forrest haviland im ashamed of you if youre a socialist you ought to think that anything you like belongs to you  thats a new kind of socialism  so much the better me and karl marx the economic inventors but i was saying if you act as though things belong to you people will apologize to you for having borrowed them from you and youve got to do that hawk youre going to be one of the bestknown fliers in the country and youll have to meet all sorts of big gunsgenerals and senators and female climbers that work the peace societies for social position and so on and youve got to know how to meet them anyway i want you to come to san spirito  to san spirito they went during the three days preceding carl was agonized at the thought of having to be polite in the presence of ladies no matter how brusquely he told himself im as good as anybody he was uneasy about forks and slang and fingernails and looked forward to the ordeal with as much pleasure as a man about to be hanged hanged in a good cause but thoroughly  yet when colonel haviland met them at san spirito station and carl heard the kindly salutation of the gracious fat old indianfighter he knew that he had at last come home to his own peoplean impression that was the stronger because the house of oscar ericson had been so much house and so little home the colonel was a widower and for his only son he showed a proud affection which included carl the three of them sat in state after dinner on the porch of quarters no 1 smoking cigars and looking down to a spur of the santa lucia mountains where it plunged into the foam of the pacific they talked of aviation and eugenics and the ben√©tmercier gun of the post doctors sister who had come from the east on a visit and of a ridingtest but their hearts spoke of affection usually it is a man and a woman that make home but three men a stranger one of them talking of motors on a porch in the enveloping dusk made for one another a home to remember always  they stayed over monday night for a hop and carl found that the officers and their wives were as approachable as hank odell they did not seem to be waiting for young ericson to make social errors when he confessed that he had forgotten what little dancing he knew the sister of the post doctor took him in hand retaught him the waltz and asked with patent admiration how does it feel to fly dont you get frightened im terribly in awe of you and mr haviland i know i should be frightened to death because it always makes me dizzy just to look down from a high building  carl slipped away to be happy by himself and hid in the shadow of palms on the porch lapped in the flutter of peppertrees the orchestra began a waltz that set his heart singing he heard a girl cry oh goody the blue danube we must go in and dance that  the blue danube the name brought back the novels of general charles king as he had read them in highschool days flashed the picture of a lonely post yellowlighted like a topaz on the nightswathed desert a rude ballroom a young officer dancing to the blue danubes intoxication a hotriding dusty courier hurling in with news of an apache outbreak a few minutes later a troop of cavalry slanting out through the gate on horseback with a farewell burning the young officers lips he was in just such an army story now  the scent of royal climbingroses enveloped carl as that picture changed into others san spirito presidio became a vast military encampment over which hawk ericson was flying from his monoplane he saw a fairy town with red roofs rising to a tower of fantastic turrets that was doubtless the memory of a magazinecover painted by maxfield parrish he was wandering through a poppyfield with a girl dusky of eyes soft black of hair ready for any jaunt pictures bright and various as tropic shells born of music and peace and his affection for the havilands pictures which promised him the world for the first time hawk ericson realized that he might be a personage instead of a backyard boy the girl with twilight eyes was smiling                                       the bagby camp broke up on the first of may with all of them except one of the nondescript collegians and the aircurrent student more or less trained aviators carl was going out to tour small cities for the george flying corporation lieutenant haviland was detailed to the army flyingcamp  parting with haviland and kindly hank odell with carmeau and anxiously polite tony bean was as wistful as the last night of senior year till the old moon rose sad behind tuliptrees they sat on packingboxes by the larger hangar singing in close harmony sweet adeline teasing ive been working on the railroad hayride classics with barbershop chords the songs are called but tears were in carls eyes as the minors sobbed from the group of comrades who made fun of one another and were prosaic and pounded their heels on the packingboxesand knew that they were parting to face death carl felt forrest havilands hand on one shoulder then an awkward pat from tough jack ryans paw as tony beans violin turned the plaintive halflight into music and broke its heart in the moonlight sonata     chapter xx   yuh pistonring burnt off and put the exhaustvalve on the blink that means one cylinder out of business growled hawk ericson i could fly maybe but i dont like to risk it in this wind it was bad enough this morning when i tried it  oh this hick town s going to be the death of us all rightand riverport tomorrow with a contract nice as pie if we can only get there groaned his manager dick george a fat man with much muscle and more diamonds listen to that crowd yelling for blood sounds like a bunch of lumberjacks with the circus slow in starting  the headline feature of the onamwaska county spring fair was hawk ericson showing the most marvelous aerial feats of the ages with the scientific marvels of aviation in his famous french bl√©riot flyingmachine the first flyingmachine ever seen in this state no balloon or fake come to onamwaska by the st l  n the spring fair was usually a small gathering of farmers to witness races and new agricultural implements but this time every road for thirtyfive miles was dustfogged with buggies and democrat wagons and small motorcars ten thousand people were packed about the racetrack  it was carls third aviation event a neat though not imposing figure in a snug blue flannel suit with his cap turned round on his head he went to the flap of the rickety tent which served as his hangar a fierce cry of fly fly why dont he fly was coming from the long black lines edging the track and from the mound of people on the small grand stand the pink blur of their faces turned toward himhim carl ericson all of them demanding him the five meek police of onamwaska were trotting back and forth keeping them behind the barriers carl was apprehensive lest this tenthousandfold demand drag him out make him fly despite a wind that was blowing the flags out straight and whisking up the litter of newspapers and crackerjack boxes and pink programs while he stared out an official crossing the track fairly leaned up against the wind which seized his hat and sailed it to the end of the track  some wind carl grunted stolidly and went to the back of the silent tent to reread the local papers accounts of his arrival at onamwaska it was a picturesque narrative of the cheering mob following him down the street gee that was me they followed crowding into the office of the astor house and making him autograph hundreds of cards of girls throwing roses humph geraniums is more like it from the windows  a young man wrote an enthusiastic female reporter handsome as a greek god but honestly i believe he is still in his twenties and he is as slim and straight as a soldier flaxenhaired and rosycheekedthe birdman the god of the air  handsome as a greek carl commented i look like a minnesota norwegian and that aint so bad but handsomeurrrrrg sure they love me all right hear em yell oh they love me like a dog does a bone saint jemima talk about football rooting come on greek god buck up  he glanced wearily about the tent its flooring of long dry grass stained with ugly darkblue lubricatingoil under the tan light coming through the canvas his manager was sitting on a suitcase pretending to read a newspaper but pinching his lower lip and consulting his watch jogging his foot ceaselessly their temporary mechanic who had given up trying to repair the lame valve squatted with bent head biting his lip harkening to the bloodhungry mob carls own nerves grew tauter and tauter as he saw the managers restless foot and the mechanics tension he strolled to the monoplane his back to the tentopening  he started as the manager exclaimed here they come after us  outside the tent a sound of running  the secretary of the fair a german hardwaredealer with an automobilecap like a yachtingcap panted in gasping come quick they wont wait any longer i been trying to calm em down but they say you got to fly theyre breaking over the barriers into the track the plice cant keep em back  behind the secretary came the chairman of the entertainment committee a popular dairyman who was pale as he demanded you got to play ball mr ericson i wont guarantee what ll happen if you dont play ball mr ericson you got to make him fly mr george the crowd s breaking  behind him charged a black press of people they packed before the tent trying to peer in through the halfclosed tentopening like a crowd about a house where a policeman is making an arrest furiously  wheres the coward fake bring im out why dont he fly hes a fake his flyingmachines never been off the ground hes a fourflusher run im out of town fake fake fake  the secretary and chairman stuck out deprecatory heads and coaxed the mob carls manager was an old circusman he had removed his collar tie and flashy diamond pin and was diligently wrapping the thong of a blackjack about his wrist their mechanic was crawling under the side of the tent carl caught him by the seat of his overalls and jerked him back  as carl turned to face the tent door again the manager ranged up beside him trying to conceal the blackjack in his hand and casually murmuring scared hawk  nope too mad to be scared  the tentflap was pulled back tossing hands came through the secretary and chairman were brushed aside the mobleader a redfaced loudvoiced town sport very drunk shouted come out and fly or well tar and feather you  yuh come on you fake you fourflusher echoed the voices  the secretary and chairman were edging back into the tent beside carls cowering mechanic  something broke in carls hold on himself with his arm drawn back his fist aimed at the point of the mobleaders jaw he snarled you cant make me fly you stick that ugly mug of yours any farther in and ill bust it ill fly when the wind goes downyou would would you  as the mobleader started to advance carl jabbed at him it was not a very good jab but the leader stopped the manager blackjack in hand caught carls arm and ordered dont start anything they can lick us just look ready dont say anything well hold em till the cops come but nix on the punch  right capn said carl  it was a strain to stand motionless facing the crowd not answering their taunts but he held himself in and in two minutes the yell came cheese it the cops the mob unwillingly swayed back as onamwaskas heroic little band of five policemen wriggled through it requesting their neighbors to desist they entered the tent and after accepting cigars from carls manager coldly told him that carl was a fake and lucky to escape that carl would better jump right out and fly if he knew what was good for him also they nearly arrested the manager for possessing a blackjack and warned him that hed better not assault any of the peaceable citizens of beautiful onamwaska  when they had coaxed the mob behind the barriers by announcing that ericson would now go up carl swore i wont move they cant make me  the secretary of the fair who had regained most of his courage spoke up pertly then you better return the five hundred advance pretty quick sudden or ill get an attachment on your fake flyingmachine  you gonix nix hawk dont hit him he aint worth it you go to hell brother said the manager mechanically but he took carl aside and groaned gosh we got to do something its worth two thousand dollars to us you know besides we havent got enough cash in our jeans to get out of town and well miss the big riverport purse still suit yourself old man maybe i can get some money by wiring to chicago  oh lets get it over carl sighed id love to disappoint onamwaska well make fifteen thousand dollars this month and next anyway and we can afford to spit em in the eye but i dont want to leave you in a hole here you mechanic open up that tentflap all the way across no not like that you boob so come on now help me push out the machine here you mr secretary hustle me a couple of men to hold her tail  the crowd rose the fickle crowd scenting the promised blood and applauded as the monoplane was wheeled upon the track and turned to face the wind the mechanic and two assistants had to hold it as a dustfilled gust caught it beneath the wings as carl climbed into the seat and the mechanic went forward to start the engine another squall hit the machine and she almost turned over sidewise  as the machine righted the manager ran up and begged you never in the world can make it in this wind hawk better not try it ill wire for some money to get out of town with and onamwaska can go soak its head  nope im gettin sore now dick hey you mechanic hurt that wing when she tipped all right start her quick while its calm  the engine whirred the assistants let go the tail the machine labored forward but once it left the ground it shot up quickly the headwind came in a terrific gust the machine hung poised in air for a moment driven back by the gale nearly as fast as it was urged forward by its frantically revolving propeller  carl was as yet too doubtful of his skill to try to climb above the worst of the wind if he could only keep a level course  he fought his way up one side of the racetrack he crouched in his seat meeting the sandy blast with bent head the parted lips which permitted him to catch his breath were stubborn and hard about his teeth his hands played swiftly incessantly over the control as he brought her back to even keel he warped the wings so quickly that he balanced like an acrobat sitting rockingly on a tightwire he was too busy to be afraid or to remember that there was a throng of people below him but he was conscious that the grand stand at the side of the track halfway down was creeping toward him  more every instant did he hate the clamor of the gale and the stream of minute drops of oil blown back from the engine that spattered his face his ears strained for misfire of the engine if it stopped he would be hurled to earth and one cylinder was not working he forgot that kept the cloche moving fought the wind with his will as with his body  now he was aware of the grand stand below him now of the people at the end of the track he flew beyond the track and turned the whole force of the gale was thrown behind him and he shot back along the other side of the racetrack at eighty or ninety miles an hour instantly he was at the end then a quarter of a mile beyond the track over plowed fields where upward currents of warm air increased the pitching of the machine as he struggled to turn her again and face the wind  the following breeze was suddenly retarded and he dropped forty feet tail down  he was only forty feet from the ground falling straight when he got back to even keel and shot ahead how safe the nest of the nacelle where he sat seemed then almost gaily he swung her in a great wavering circleand the wind was again in his face hating him pounding him trying to get under the wings and turn the machine turtle  twice more he worked his way about the track the conscience of the beginner made him perform a diffident dutch roll before the grand stand but he was growling and thats all theyre going to get see  as he soared to earth he looked at the crowd for the first time his vision was so blurred with oil and windsoreness that he saw the people only as a mass and he fancied that the stretch of slouchhats and derbies was a field of mushrooms swaying and tilted back he was curiously unconscious of the presence of women he felt all the spectators as men who had bawled for his death and whom he wanted to hammer as he had hammered the wind  he was almost down he cut off his motor glided horizontally three feet above the ground and landed while the cheers cloaked even the honking of the parked automobiles  carls manager fatly galloping up shrilled how was it old man  oh it was pretty windy said carl crawling down and rubbing the kinks out of his arms but i think the wind s going down tell the announcer to tell our dear neighbors that ill fly again at five  but werent you scared when she dropped you went down so far that the fence plumb hid you couldnt see you at all ugh sure thought the wind had you werent you scared then you dont look it  then oh then oh yes sure i guess i was scared all right say we got that seat padded so shes darn comfortable now  the crowd was collecting carls manager chuckled to the president of the fair association well that was some flight eh  oh he went down the opposite side of the track pretty fast but why the dickens was he so slow going up my side my eyes aint so good now that it does me any good if a fellow speeds up when hes a thousand miles away and wheres all these tricks in the air  that murmured carl to his manager is the identical man that stole the blind cripples crutch to make himself a toothpick     chapter xxi   the great belmont park aero meet which woke new york to aviation in october 1910 was coming to an end that clever new american flier hawk ericson had won only sixth place in speed but he had won first prize in duration by a flight of nearly six hours driving round and round and round the pylons hour on hour safe and steady as a train never taking the risk of sensational banking nor spiraling like johnstone but amusing himself and breaking the tedium by keeping an eye out on each circuit for a fat woman in a bright lavender topcoat who stood out in the dark line of people that flowed beneath when he had descendedacclaimed the winnerthousands of heads turned his way as though on one lever the pink faces flashing in such october sunshine as had filled the back yard of oscar ericson in joralemon when a lonely carl had performed duration feats for a sparrow that same shy carl wanted to escape from the newspapermen who came running toward him he hated their incessant questionsalways the same were you cold could you have stayed up longer  yet he had seen all new york go mad over aviationrather over news about aviation the newspapers had spread over front pages his name and the names of the other fliers carl chuckled to himself with bashful awe gee can you beat itthats me when he beheld himself referred to in editorial and interview and picturecaption as a superman a god he heard crowds rustle look theres hawk ericson as he walked along the barriers he heard cautious predictions from fellowfliers and loud declarations from outsiders that he was the coming crosscountry champion he was introduced to the mayor of new york two cabinet members an assortment of senators authors bank presidents generals and society railbirds he regularly escaped from themand their questionsto help the bricknecked hank odell from the bagby school who had entered for the meet but smashed up on the first day and ever since had been whistling and working over his machine and encouraging carl good work bud youve got em all going  with vast secrecy and a perception that this was twice as stirring as steadily buzzing about in his bl√©riot he went down to the bowery and in front of the saloon where he had worked as a porter four years before he bought a copy of the evening world because he knew that on the third page of it was a large picture of him and a signed interview by a specialwriter he peered into the saloon windows to see if petey mcguff was there but did not find him he went to the street on which he had boarded in the hope that he might do something for the girl who had been going wrong the tenement had been torn down with blocks of others to make way for a bridgeterminal and he saw the vision of the citys pitiless progress this quest of old acquaintances made him think of joralemon he informed gertie cowles that he was now in the aviation game and everything is going very well he sent his mother a check for five hundred dollars with awkward words of affection  a greater spiritual adventure was talking for hours over a small table in the basement of the brevoort to lieutenant forrest haviland who was attending the belmont park meet as spectator theirs was the talk of tried friends droning on for a time in amused comment rising to sudden tablepounding enthusiasms over aviators or explorers with exclamations of is that the way it struck you too im awfully glad to hear you say that because thats just the way i felt about it they leaned back in their chairs and played with spoons and reflectively broke up matches and volubly sketched plans of controls drawing on the tablecloth  carl took the sophisticated atmosphere of the brevoort quite for granted why shouldnt he be there and after the interest in him at the meet it did not hugely abash him to hear a group at a table behind him ejaculate i think thats hawk ericson the aviator yes sir thatswhoitis  finally the gods gave to carl a new mechanic a prince of mechanics martin dockerill martin was a tall thin hatchetfaced tousleheaded slowspoken irreverent irishyankee from fall river the perfect type of american aviators for while england sends out its stately soldiers of the air and france its short excitable geniuses practically all american aviators and aviation mechanics are either longfaced and lanky like martin dockerill and hank odell or slim goodlooking youngsters of the college trackteam type like carl and forrest haviland  martin dockerill ate punkin pie with his fingers played marching through georgia on the mouthorgan admired burlesqueshow women in sausageshaped pink tights and wore balbriggan socks that always reposed in wrinkles over the tops of his black shoes with frayed laces but he probably could build a very decent motor in the dark out of four tin cans and a crowbar in ad 1910 he still believed in hell and plush albums but he dreamed of wireless powertransmission he was a free and independent american citizen who called the count de lesseps hey lessup but he would have gone with carl aeroplaning to the south pole upon five minutes noticefour minutes to devote to the motor and one minute to write with purple indelible pencil a postcard to his aunt in fall river he was precise about only two thingsmotortiming and calling himself a mechanician not a mechanic he became very friendly with hank odell helped him repair his broken machine went with him to vaudeville or stood with him before the hangar watching the automobile parties of pretty girls with lordly chaperons that came to call on grahamewhite and drexel some heartwinners them guys but i back my boss against them and evbody else hank martin would say                                       the meet was over the aviators were leaving carl had said farewell to his new and wellloved friends the pioneers of aviationlatham moisant leblanc mccurdy ely de lesseps mars willard drexel grahamewhite hoxsey and the rest he was in the afterglow of the meet for with titherington the englishman and tad warren the wright flier he was going to race from belmont park to new haven for a tenthousanddollar prize jointly offered by a new haven millionaire and a new york newspaper at new haven the three competitors were to join with tony bean of the bagby school and walter macmonnies flying a curtiss in an exhibition meet  enveloped in baggy overalls over the blue flannel suit which he still wore when flying carl was directing martin dockerill in changing his sparkplugs which were fouled about him the aviators were having their machines packed laughing playing tricks on one anotherboys who were virile men mechanics in denim who stammered to the reporters oh well i dont know yet who were for the time more celebrated than roosevelt or harry thaw or bernard shaw or champion jack johnson  before 945 am when the race to new haven was scheduled to start the newspapermen gathered but there were not many outsiders carl felt the lack of the stimulus of thronging devotees he worked silently and sullenly it was the morning after he missed forrest haviland  he began to be anxious could he get off on time  exactly at 945 titherington made a magnificent start in his henry farman biplane carl stared till the machine was a dot in the clouds then worked feverishly tad warren the second contestant was testing out his motor ready to go at that moment martin dockerill suggested that the carburetor was dirty  ill fly with her the way she is carl snapped shivering with the racefever  a cub reporter from the city news association piped like a foxterrier what time ll you get off hawk  ten sharp  no i mean what time will you really get off  carl did not answer he understood that the reporters were doubtful about him the youngster from the west who had been flying for only six months at last came the inevitable pest the familiarly suggestive outsider a welldressed wellmeaning old bore he was a complete stranger he put his podgy hand on carls arm and puffed well hawk my boy give us a good flight today not but what youre going to have trouble theres something i want to suggest to you if youd use a gyroscope  oh beat it snarled carl he was ashamed of himselfbut more angry than ashamed he demanded of martin aside all right heh can i fly with the carburetor as she is heh  all right boss calm down boss calm down  what do you mean  look here hawk i dont want to butt in you can have old martin for a choppingblock any time you want to cut wood but if you dont calm down youll get so screwed up mit nerves that you wont have any control aw come on boss speak pretty just keep your shirt on and ill hustle like a steamengine  well maybe youre right but these assistant aviators in the crowd get me wild all right hoorray here goes say dont stop for anything after i get off leave the boys to pack up and you hustle over to sea cliff for the speedboat you ought to be in new haven almost as soon as i am  calmer now he peeled off his overalls drew a woollined leather jacket over his coat climbed into the cockpit and inspected the indicators as he was testing the spark tad warren got away  third and last was carl the racefever shook him  he would try to save time like the others he had planned to fly from belmont park across long island to great neck and cross long island sound where it was very narrow he studied his map by flying across to the vicinity of hempstead harbor and making a long diagonal flight over water straight over to stamford he would increase the factor of danger but save many miles and the specifications of the race permitted him to choose any course to new haven thinking only of the new route taking time only to nod goodby to martin dockerill and hank odell he was off into the air  as the ground dropped beneath him and the green clean spaces and innumerous towns of long island spread themselves out he listened to the motor its music was clear and strong here at least the wind was light  he would risk the long overwater flightvery long they thought it in 1910  in a few minutes he sighted the hills about roslyn and began to climb up to three thousand feet it was very cold his hands were almost numb on the control he descended to a thousand feet but the machine jerked like a canoe shooting rapids in the gust that swept up from among the hills the landscape rose swiftly at him over the ends of the wings now on one side now on the other as the machine rolled  his arms were tired with the quick incessant wingwarping he rose again then he looked at the sound and came down to three hundred feet lest he lose his way for the sound was white with fog no wind out there water and cloud blurred together and the skyline was lost in a mass of somber mist which ranged from filmy white to the cold dead gray of old cigarashes he wanted to hold back not dash out into that dangerfilled twilight but already he was roaring over graygreen marshes then was above fishingboats that were slowly rocking in water dully opaque as a dim old mirror he noted two men on a sloop staring up at him with foolish gaping mistwet faces instantly they were left behind him he rose to get above the fog even the milky sulky water was lost to sight  he was horribly lonely abominably lonely  at five hundred feet altitude he was not yet entirely above the fog land was blotted out above him gray sky and thin writhing filaments of vapor beneath him only the fogbank erupting here and there like the unfolding of great white flowers as warm currents of air burst up through the mistblanket  completely solitary all his friends were somewhere far distant in a place of solid earth and sunwarmed hangars the whole knowable earth had ceased to exist there was only slatey void through which he was going on for ever or perhaps he was not moving always the same coil of mist about him he was horribly lonely  he feared that the fog was growing thicker he studied his compass with straining eyes he was startled by a gulls plunging up through the mist ahead of him and disappearing he was the more lonely when it was gone his eyebrows and cheeks were wet with the steam drops of moisture shone desolately on the planes it was an unhealthy shine he was horribly lonely  he pictured what would happen if the motor should stop and he should plunge down through that flimsy vapor his pontoonless frail monoplane would sink almost at once it would be cold swimming how long could he keep up what chance of being found he didnt want to fall the cockpit seemed so safe with its familiar watch and mapstand and supportingwires it was home the wings stretching out on either side of him seemed comfortingly solid adequate to hold him up but the body of the machine behind him was only a framework not even inclosed and cut in the bottom of the cockpit was a small hole for observing the earth he could see fog through it in unpleasant contrast to the dull yellow of the cloth sides and bottom not before had it daunted him to look down through that hole now however he kept his eyes away from it and while he watched the compass and oilgauge and kept a straight course he was thinking of how nasty it would be to drop drop down there and have to swim it would be horribly lonely swimming about a wrecked monoplane hearing steamers foghorns hopeless and afar  as he thought that he actually did hear a steamer hoarsely whistling and swept above it irresistibly he started his shoulders drooped  more than once he wished that he could have seen forrest haviland again before he started he wished with all the poignancy of mans affection for a real man that he had told forrest when they were dining at the brevoort how happy he was to be with him he was horribly lonely  he cursed himself for letting his thoughts become thin and damp as the vapor about him he shrugged his shoulders he listened thankfully to the steady purr of the engine and the whir of the propeller he would get across he ascended hoping for a glimpse of the shore the fogsmothered horizon stretched farther and farther away he was unspeakably lonely  through a tear in the mist he saw sunshine reflected from houses on a hill directly before him perhaps one mile distant he shouted he was nearly across safe and the sun was coming out  two minutes later he was turning north between the water and a town which his map indicated as stamford the houses beneath him seemed companionable friendly were the handwaving crowds and factorywhistles gave him raucous greeting  instantly now that he knew where he was the racefever caught him again despite the strain of crossing the sound he would not for anything have come down to rest he began to wonder how afar ahead of him were titherington and tad warren  he spied a train running north out of stamford swung over above it and raced with it the passengers leaned out of the windows trainmen hung perilously from the opened doors of vestibuled platforms the engineer tooted his frantic greetings to a fellowmechanic who above him in the glorious bird sent telepathic greetings which the engineer probably never got the engineer speeded up the engine puffed out vast feathery plumes of dull black smoke but he drew away from the train as he neared south norwalk  he was ascending again when he noted something that seemed to be a biplane standing in a field a mile away he came down and circled the field it was titheringtons farman biplane he hoped that the kindly englishman had not been injured he made out titherington talking to a group about the machine relieved he rose again amused by the anthill appearance as hundreds of people like black bugs ran toward the stalled biplane from neighboring farms and from a trolleycar standing in the road  he should not have been amused just then he was too low directly before him was a hillside crowned with trees he shot above the trees cold in the stomach muttering gee that was careless  he sped forward the racefever again could he pass tad warren as he had passed titherington he whirled over the towns shivering but happy in the mellow cool october air far enough from the water to be out of what fog the brightening sun had left the fields rolled beneath him so far down that they were turned into continuous and wonderful masses of brown and gold he sang to himself he liked titherington he was glad that the englishman had not been injured but it was good to be second in the race to have a chance to win a contest which the whole country was watching to be dashing into a rosy dawn of fame but while he sang he was keeping a tense lookout for tad warren he had to pass him  with the caution of the scotchlike norwegian he had the cloche constantly on the jiggle with ceaseless adjustments to the wind which varied constantly as he passed over different sorts of terrain once the breeze dropped him sidewise he shot down to gain momentum brought her to even keel and as he set her nose up again laughed boisterously  never again would he be so splendidly young never again so splendidly sure of himself and of his medium of expression he was to gain wisdom but never to have more joy of the race  he was sure now that he was destined to pass tad warren  the sun was ever brighter the horizon ever wider rimming the saucershaped earth when he flew near the sound he saw that the fog had almost passed the water was gentle and colored like pearl lapping the sands smoking toward the radiant sky he passed over summer cottages vacant and asleep with fantastic holiday roofs of red and green gulls soared like flying sickles of silver over the opal sea even for the racer there was peace  he made out a mass of rock covered with autumnhued trees to the left then a like rock to the right west and east rocknew haven he cried  the city mapped itself before him like square buildingblocks on a dark carpet with railroad and trolley tracks like flashing spiderwebs under the october noon  so he had arrived thenand he had not caught tad warren he was furious  he circled the city looking for the green where in this day before the aero club of america battled against overcity flying he was to land he saw the yale campus lazy beneath its elms its towers and turrets dreaming of oxford his anger left him  he plunged down toward the greenand his heart nearly stopped the spectators were scattered everywhere how could he land without crushing some one with trees to each side and a church in front he was too far down to rise again his back pressed against the back of the little seat and seemed automatically to be trying to restrain him from this tragic landing  the people were fleeing in front there was a tiny space but there was no room to sail horizontally and come down lightly he shut off his motor and turned the monoplanes nose directly at the earth she struck hard bounced a second her tail rose and she started with dreadful deliberateness to turn turtle with a vault carl was out of the cockpit and clear of the machine as she turned over  oblivious of the clamorous crowd which was pressing in about him cutting off the light replacing the clean smell of gasoline and the upper air by the hot odor of many bodies he examined the monoplane and found that she had merely fractured the propeller and smashed the rudder  some one was fighting through the crowd to his sidetony beantony the round polite mexican from the bagby school he was crying hombre what a landing you have saved lives get out of the way all you people  carl grinned and said good to see you tony what time did tad warren get here wheres  he ees not here yet  what huh hows that do i win thatsay gosh i hope he hasnt been hurt  yes you win  a newspaperman standing beside tony said warren had to come down at great neck he sprained his shoulder but thats all  thats good  but you insisted tony arent you badly jarred hawk  not a bit  the gaping crowd hanging its large collective ear toward the two aviators was shouting hoorray hes all rightas their voices rose carl became aware that all over the city hundreds of factorywhistles and bells were howling their welcome to himthe victor  the police were clearing a way for him as a police captain touched a goldflashing cap to him carl remembered how afraid of the police that hobo slim ericson had been  tony and he completed examination of the machine with tonys mechanician and sent it off to a shop to await martin dockerills arrival by speedboat and racingautomobile carl went to receive congratulationsand a checkfrom the prizegiver and a reception by yale officials on the campus before him along his lane of passage was a kaleidoscope of hands sticking out from the wall of peoplehands that reached out and shook his own till they were sore hands that held out pencil and paper to beg for an autograph hands of girls with golden flowers of autumn hands of dirty eager small boysweaving interminable hands dizzy with a world peopled only by writhing hands yet moved by their greeting he made his way across the green through phelps gateway and upon the campus twisting his cap and wishing that he had taken off his leather flyingcoat he stood upon a platform and heard officials congratulating him  the reception was over but the people did not move and he was very tired he whispered to a professor is that a dormitory there behind us can i get into it and get away  the professor beckoned to one of the collegians and replied i think mr ericson if you will step down they will pass you into vanderbilt courtyardby the gate back of usand you will be able to escape  carl trusted himself to the bunch of boys forming behind him and found himself rushed into the comparative quiet of a tudor courtyard a charming youngster hatless and sleek of hair cried right this way mr ericsonup this staircase in the towerand well give em the slip  from the roar of voices to the dusky quietude of the hallway was a joyous escape suddenly carl was a youngster permitted to see yale a university so great that from plato college it had seemed an imperial myth he stared at the list of roomoccupants framed and hung on the first floor he peeped reverently through an open door at a suite of rooms  he was taken to a room with a large collection of pillows fireirons morris chairs sets of books in crushed levant tobaccojars and pipesa restless and boyish room but a real haven he stared out upon the campus and saw the crowd stolidly waiting for him he glanced round at his host and waved his hand deprecatingly then tried to seem really grown up really like the famous hawk ericson but he wished that forrest haviland were there so that he might marvel look at em will you waiting for me can you beat it some start for my yale course  in a big chair with a pipe supplied by the youngster he shyly tried to talk to a senior in the great world of yale he himself had not been able to climb to seniorhood even in plato while the awed youngster shyly tried to talk to the great aviator  he had picked up a yale catalogue and he vaguely ruffled its pages thinking of the difference between its range of courses and the petty inflexible curriculum of plato out of the pages leaped the name frazer he hastily turned back there it was henry frazer am phd assistant professor in english literature  carl rejoiced boyishly that after his defeat at plato professor frazer had won to victory he forgot his own triumph for a second he longed to call on frazer and pay his respects no he growled to himself ive been so busy hiking that ive forgotten what little booklearnin i ever had id like to see him butby gum im going to begin studying again  hidden away in the youngsters bedroom for a nap he dreamed uncomfortably of frazer and books that did not keep him from making a good altitude flight at the new haven meet that afternoon with his hastily repaired machine and a new propeller but he thought of new roads for wandering in the land of books as he sat tired and sleepy but trying to appear bright and appreciative at the big dinner in his honorthe first sacrificial banquet to which he had been subjectedwith earnest gentlemen in evening clothes glad for an excuse to drink just a little too much champagne with mayors and councilmen and bankers with the inevitable stories about the man who was accused of stealing umbrellas and about the two skunks on a fence enviously watching a motorcar  equally inevitable were the speeches praising carls flight as a remarkable achievement destined to live forever in the annals of sport and heroism and to bring one more glory to the name of our fair city  carl tried to appear honored but he was thinking rats ill live in the annals of nothin curtiss and brookins and hoxsey have all made longer flights than mine in this country alone and theyre aviators im not worthy to fill the gastanks of gee im sleepy got to look polite but i wish i could beat it lets see now look here young carl starting in tomorrow you begin to read oodles of books lets see ill start out with forrests favorites theres david copperfield and that book by wells tonobungay thats got aerial experiments in it and jude the ob obscure i guess it is and the damnation of theron ware wonder what he damned and mcteague and walden and war and peace and madame bovary and some turgenev and some balzac and something more serious guess ill try william jamess book on psychology  he bought them all next morning his other belongings had been suited to rapid transportation and martin dockerill grumbled thats a swell line of baggage all rightone toothbrush a change of socks and ninetyseven thousand books  two nights later in a hotel at portland maine carl was plowing through the psychology he hated study he flipped the pages angrily and ran his fingers through his corncolored hair but he sped on concentrated stopping only to picture a day when the people who honored him publicly would also know him in private somewhere among them he believed was the girl with whom he could play he would meet her at some aero race and she would welcome him as eagerly as he welcomed her had he perhaps already met her he walked over to the writingtable and scrawled a note to gertie cowlesregarding the beauty of the yale campus     chapter xxii   editors note the following pages are extracts from a diary kept by mr c o ericson in a desultory fashion from january 1911 to the end of april 1912 they are reprinted quite literally apparently mr ericson had no very precise purpose in keeping his journal at times it seems intended as materia for future literary use at others as comments for his own future amusement at still others as a sort of long letter to be later sent to his friend lieut forrest haviland usa i have already referred to them in my psychoanalysis of the subconscious with reference to active temperaments but here reprint them less for their appeal to us as a scientific study of reactions than as possessing doubtless for those interested in pure narrative a certain curt expression of somewhat unusual exploits however inferior is their style to a more critical thesis on the adventurous   may 9 1911 arrived at mineola flying field n y to try out new bagby monoplane i have bought not much accomodation here yet many of us housed in tents not enough hangars we sit around and tell lies in the long grass at night like a bunch of kids out camping went over and had a beer at peter mcloughlins today thats where glenn curtiss started out from to make his first flight for sci amer cup  like my new bagby machine better than bl√©riot in many respects has nonlifting tail as should all modern machines rudder and elevator a good deal like the nieuport one passenger roomy cockpit and enclosed fuselage bl√©riot control nearer streamline than any american plane yet span 336 ft length 24 chord of wing at fuselage 6¬¥ 5¬¥¬¥ chauviere propeller 6¬¥ 6¬¥¬¥ pitch 4¬¥ 5¬¥¬¥ dandy new gn√¥me engine 70 hp should develop 60 to 80 mph  martin dockerill my mechanician is pretty cute he said to me today when we were getting workbench up i bet a hat the spectators all flock here now not that youre any better flier than some of the other boys but you got the newest plane for them to write their names on  certainly a scad of people butting in come in autos and motor cycles and on foot and stand around watching everything you do till you want to fire a monkey wrench at them  hank odell has joined the associated order of the pyramid and just now he is sitting out in front of his tent talking to some of the grand worthy high mighties of it i guessfat old boy with a yachting cap and a big brass watch chain and an order of pyramid charm big as your thumb and a tough young fellow with a black sateen shirt and his hat on sideways with a cigarette hanging out of one corner of his mouth  since i wrote the above a party of sports the women in fadeaway gowns made to show their streamline forms came butting in poking their fingers at everything while the slob that owned their car explained everything wrong this is a biplane he says you can see theres a plane sticking out on each side of the place where the aviator sits its a new areoplane thats the way he pronounced it and that dingus in front is a whirling motor i was sitting here at the workbench writing hot as hell and sweaty and in khaki pants and soft shirt and black sneakers and the big boss comes over to me and says where is hawk ericson my man how do i know i says when will he be back says he as though he was thinking of getting me fired p d q for being fresh next week he aint come yet  he gets sore and says see here my man i read in the papers today that he has just joined the flying colony permit me to inform you that he is a very good friend of mine if you will ask him i am quite sure that he will remember mr porter carruthers who was introduced to him at the belmont park meet now if you will be so good as to show the ladies and myself about well i asked hawk and hawk seemed to be unable to remember his friend mr carruthers who was one of the thousand or so people recently introduced to him but he told me to show them about which i did and told them the gn√¥me was built radial to save room and the wires overhead were a frame for a little roof for bad weather and they gasped and nodded to every fool thing i said swallowed it hook line and sinker till one of the females showed her interest by saying how fascinating lets go over to the garden city hotel porter im dying for a drink i hope she died for it  may 10 up at three trying out machine smashed landing chassis in coming down shook me up a little interesting how when i rose it was dark on the ground but once up was a little red in the east like smoke from a regular fairy city  another author out today bothering me for what he called copy  must say ive met some darn decent people in this game though today there was a girl came out with billy morrison of the n y courier she is an artist but crazy about outdoor life etc named istra nash a red haired girl slim as a match but the strangest face pale but it lights up when shes talking to you took her up and she was not scared most are  may 11 miss istra nash came out by herself shes thinking quite seriously about learning to fly she sat around and watched me work and when nobody was looking smoked a cigarette has recently been in europe paris london etc  somehow when im talking to a woman like her i realize how little i see of women with whom i can be really chummy tho i meet so many people at receptions etc sometimes just after i have been flying before thousands of people i beat it to my hotel and would be glad for a good chat with the night clerk of course i can bank on martin dockerill to the limit but when i talk to a person like miss nash i realize i need some one who knows good art from bad though miss nash doesnt insist on talking like a highbrow indeed is picking up aviation technologies very quickly she talks german like a native  think miss nash is perhaps older than i am perhaps couple of years but doesnt make any difference  reading a little german tonight almost forgot what i learned of it in plato  may 14 sunday went into town this afternoon and went with istra to dinner at the lafayette she told me all about her experiences in paris and studying art she is quite discontented here in n y i dont blame her much it must have been bully over in paree we sat talking till ten like to see vedrines fly and the louvre and the gay grisettes too by heck istra ought not to drink so many cordials nix on the booze you learn when you try to keep in shape for flying though tad warren doesnt seem to learn it after ten we went to studio where istra is staying on washington sq several of her friends there and usual excitement and fool questions about being an aviator it always makes me feel like a boob but they saw istra and i wanted to be alone and they beat it  this is really dawn but ill date it may 14 which is yesterday no sleep for me tonight im afraid going to fly around ny in aerial derby this afternoon must get plenty sleep now  may 15 won derby not much of an event though struck rotten currents over harlem river machine rolled like a whaleback  istra out here tomorrow glad but after last night afraid ill get so i depend on her and the aviator that keeps his nerve has to be sort of a friendless cuss some ways  may 16 istra came out here seems very discontented im afraid shes the kind to want novelty and attention incessantly she seems to forget that im pretty busy  may 17 saw istra in town she forgot all her discontent and her everlasting dignity and danced for me then came over and kissed me she is truly a wonder can hum a french song so you think youre among the peasants but she expects absolute devotion and constant amusing and i must stick to my last if a mechanic like me is to amount to anything  may 18 istra out here she sat around and looked bored wanted to make me sore i think when i told her i had to leave tomorrow morning for rochester and couldnt come to town for dinner etc she flounced home im sorry im mighty sorry poor kid shes always going to be discontented wherever she is and always getting some one and herself all wrought up she always wants new sensations yet doesnt want to work and the combination isnt very good itd be great if she really worked at her painting but she usually stops her art just this side of the handle of a paintbrush  curious thing is that when shed gone and i sat thinking about her i didnt miss her so much as gertie cowles i hope i see gertie again some day she is a good pal  istra wanted me to name my new monoplane babette because she says it looks cunning which the lord knows it dont it may look efficient but not cunning but i dont think ill name it anything tho she says that shows lack of imagination  people especially reporters are always asking me this question do aviators have imagination im not sure i know what imagination is its like this stuff about sense of humor both phrases are pretty bankrupt now a few years ago when i was running a car i would make believe i was different people like a king driving through his kingdom but when im warping and banking i dont have time to think about making believe of course i do notice sunsets and so on a good deal but that is not imagination and i do like to go different places possibly i take the imagination out that wayi guess imagination is partly wanting to be places where you arentwell i go when i want to and i like that better  anyway darned if ill give my monoplane a name tad warren has been married to a musical comedy soubrette with ringlets of redbrown hair istras hair is quite bright red but this woman has dark red hair like the color of california redwood chips no maybe darker and she wears a slimpsy bright blue dress with the waistline nearly down to her knees and skirt pretty short showing a lot of ankle and a kind of hat i never noticed before must be getting stylish now i guess flops down so it almost hides her face like a basket shes a typical wife for a 10 hp aviator with exhibition fever she and tad go joy riding almost every night with a bunch of gasoline and alcohol sports and all have about five cocktails and dance a new calif dance called the turkey trot this bunch have named tads new wright sammy and they think its quite funny to yell hello sammy how are you come have a drink  i guess ill call mine a monoplane and let it go at that                                       july 14 quebec lost race toronto to quebec had fair chance to win but motor kept misfiring couldnt seem to get plugs that would work and smashed hell out of elevator coming down on tail when landing here glad hank odell won since i lost hank has designed new rockerarm for severn motor valves all of us invited to usual big dinner never did see so many uniforms also members of canadian parliament i dont like to lose a race but thunder it doesnt bother me long good filet of sole at dinner sat near a young lieutenant leftenant i suppose it is who made me think of forrest haviland i miss forrest a lot hes doing some good flying for the army flying curtiss hydro now and trying out muffler for military scouting what i like as much as anything about him is his ease i hope im learning a little of it anyway this stuff is all confused but must hustle off to reception at summer school of royal college for females must send all this to old forrest to read some dayif you ever see this forrest hello dear old man i thought about you when i flew over military post  later big reception felt like an awful nut so shy i didnt hardly dare look up off the ground after the formal reception i was taken around the campus by the lady president nice old lady with white hair and diamond combs in it what seemed more than a million pretty girls kept dodging out of doorways and making snapshots of me good thing ive been reading quite a little lately as the lady principal that was it not lady president talked very high brow she asked me what i thought of this terrible lower class unrest told her i was a socialist and she never batted an eyeof course an aviator is permitted to be a nut wonder if i am a good socialist as a matter of fact i do know that most governments maybe all permit most children to never have a chance start them out by choking them with dirt and tb germs but how can we make international solidarity seem practical to the dub average voters how  letter from gertie tonight forwarded here she seems sort of bored in joralemon but is working hard with village improvement committee of womans club for rest room for farmers wives also getting up pe sunday school picnic be good for istra if she did common nice things like that since she wont really get busy with her painting but how shed hate me for suggesting that she be what she calls burjoice guess gertie is finding herself hope yours truly but sleepy is finding himself too how i love my little bed     chapter xxiii  the diary of mr ericson continuededitor   august 20 1911 as before big chicago meet over they sure did show us a good time never saw better meet won finals in duration today also am second in altitude but nix on the altitude again im pretty poor at it im no lincoln beachey dont see how he breathes his 11578 ft was some climb  tomorrow starts my biggest attempt by far biggest distance flight ever tried in america and rather niftier than even the european circuit and british circuit that beaumont has won  to fly as follows chicago to st louis to indianapolis to columbus to washington to baltimore to philadelphia to atlantic city to new york the new york chronicle in company with papers along line gives prize of 40000 ought to help bank account if win in spite of big expenses to undergo now have 30000 stowed away and have sent mother 3000  to fly against my good old teacher m carmeau and tony bean walter macmonnies m beaufort the frenchman tad warren billy witzer chick bannard aaron solomons and other good men special ny chronicle reporter fellow named forbes assigned to me and he hangs around all the time sort of embarrassing hurray spelled it right i guess but im getting used to the reporters  martin dockerill has an ambition he said to me today say hawk if you win the big race you got to give me five plunks for my share and then by gum im going to buy two razorstrops what for i said oh i bet there aint anybody else in the world that owns two razorstrops  not much to say about banquet lots of speeches good grub  what tickles me more than anything is my new flying garmentsnot clothes but garments by heck im going to be a regular little old aviator in a melodrama ive been wearing plain suits and a cap same good old cap always squeegee on my head but for the big race ive got riding breeches and puttees and a silk shirt and a tweed norfolk jacket and new leather coat and french helmet with both felt and springs inside the leatherthis last really valuable the real stage aviator thats me watch the photographers fall for it i bet tad warrens norfolk jacket is worth 10000 a year to him  i pretended to martin that i was quite serious about the clothes the garments i mean i dolled myself all up last night and went swelling into my hangar and anxiously asked martin if he didnt like the getup and he nearly threw a fit good lord he groans you look like an aviator on a ladies home journal cover guaranteed not to curse swear or chaw tobacco whats become of that girl you was kissing last time i seen you on the cover  august 25 not much time to write diary on race like this its just saw wood all the time or lose  bad wind today sometimes the wind dont bother me when i am flying and sometimes like today it seems as though the one thing in the whole confounded world is the confounded wind that roars in your ears and makes your eyes water and sneaks down your collar to chill your spine and goes scooting up your sleeves unless you have gauntlets and makes your ears sting roar roar roar the winds worse than the noisiest old castiron tincan vrenskoy motor you want to duck your head and get down out of it and lord it tires you soaviation isnt all brilliant risks and daring dives and that kind of blanketyblank circus business not by a long shot it aint lots of it is just sticking there and bucking the wind like a taxi driver speeding for a train in a storm tired tonight and mad  september 5 new york i win plenty smashes but only got jarred i beat out beaufort by eight hours and aaron solomons by nearly a day carmeaus machine hopelessly smashed in columbus but he was not hurt but poor tad warren killed crossing illinois  september 8 had no time to write about my reception here in new york till now  ive been worrying about poor tad warrens wife bunch of us got together and made up a purse for her nothing more pathetic than these poor little women that poke down the cocktails to keep excited and then go to pieces  i dont believe i was very decent to tad sitting here alone in a hotel room it seems twice as lonely after the fuss and feathers these last few days a fellow thinks of all the rotten things he ever did poor old tad too late now to cheer him up too late wonder if they shouldnt have called off race when he was killed  wish istra wouldnt keep calling me up have i got to be rude to her id like to be decent to her but i cant stand the cocktail life lord that time she danced though  poor tad was see transcribers note  oh hell to get back to the reception it was pretty big parade of the aero club and squadron a me in an openface hack feeling like a boob while sixty leven billion people cheered then reception by mayor me delivering letter from mayor of chicago which i had cutely sneaked out in chicago and mailed to myself here n y general delivery so i wouldnt lose it on the way then biggest dinner ive ever seen must have been a thousand there at the astor me very natty in a new dress suit hey bo i fooled them it was readymade and cost me just 3750 and fitted like my skin  mayor presidents of boroughs of ny district attorney vice president of us lieut governor of ny five or six senators chief of ordnance usa arctic explorers and hundreds like that but most of all forrest haviland whom i got them to stick right up near me speeches mostly about me i nearly rubbed the silver off my flossy new cigarette case keeping from looking foolish while they were telling about me and the future of aviation and all them interesting subjects  forrest and i sneaked off from the reporters next afternoon had quiet dinner down in chinatown  we have a bully plan if we can make it and if he can get leave we will explore the headwaters of the amazon with a twopassenger curtiss flying boat maybe next year  now the reception fans have done their darndest and all the excitement is over including the shouting and im starting for newport to hold a little private meet of my own backed by thomas j watersell the steel magnate and by tomorrow night ny will forget me i realized that after the big dinner i got on the subway at times square jumped quick into the car just as the doors were closing and the guard yapped at me what are you trying to do billy kill yourself he wasnt spending much time thinking about famous hawk ericson and i got to thinking how comfortable ny will manage to go on being when they no longer read in the morning paper whether i dined with the governor or with martin dockerill at bazoo junction depot lunch counter  they forget us quick and already theres a new generation of aviators some of the old giants are gone poor moisant and hoxsey and johnstone and the rest killed and theres coming along a bunch of youngsters that can fly enough to grab the glory and they spread out the glory pretty thin they go us old fellows except beachey a few better on aerial acrobatics and thats what the dear peepul like for a socialist i certainly do despise the peepuls taste i wont do any flipflops in the air no matter what the county fair managers write me somehow id just as soon be alive and exploring the amazon with old forrest as dead after brilliant feats of fearless daring go to it kids good luck only test your supporting wires and dont try to rival lincoln beachey hes a genius  glad got a secretary for a couple days to handle all this mail hundreds of begging letters and mash notes from girls since i won the big prize makes me feel funny one nice thing out of the mailletter from the turk jack terry that i havent seen since plato he didnt graduate his old man died and he is assistant manager of quite a good sized fisheries out in oregon glad to hear from him again funny i havent thought of him for a year  i feel lonely and melancholy tonight in spite of all i do to cheer up let up after reception etc i suppose i feel like calling up istra after all but mustnt i ought to hit the hay but i couldnt sleep poor tad warren  the following words appear at the bottom of a page in a faint fine handwriting unlike mr ericsons usual scrawlthe editor  whatever spirits there be of the present world or the future take this prayer from a plain man who knows little of monism or trinity or logos and give to tad another chance as a child who never grew up                                       september 11 off to kokomo to fly for farmers alliance  easy meet here newport ri yesterday just straight flying and passenger carrying dandy party given for me after it by thomas j watersell the steel man have read of such parties bird party in a garden watersell has many acres in his place and big house with a wonderful brick terrace and more darn convenient things than i ever saw before breakfast room out on the terrace and swimming pool and little gardens one outside of each guest room rooms all have private doors house is mission style built around patio all the newport swells came to party dressed as birds and i had to dress as a hawk they had the costume all ready wonder how they got my measurements girls in the dance of the birds much silk stockings very pretty at end of dance they were all surrounding me in semicircle i stood out on lawn beside mrs watersell and they bowed low to me fluttering their silk wings and flashing out many colored electric globes concealed in wings and looked like hundreds of rainbow colored fireflies in the darkness just then the big lights were turned on again and they let loose hundreds of all kinds of birds and they flew up all around me surprised me to death then for grub best sandwiches i ever ate  felt much flattered by it all somehow did not feel so foolish as at banquets with speeches  after the party was all over quite late i went with watersell for a swim in his private pool most remarkable thing i ever saw he said everybody has roman baths and pompei baths and he was going to go them one better so he has an egyptian bath the pool itself like the inside of an ancient temple long vista of great big green columns and a big idol at the end and the pool all in green marble with lights underneath the water and among the columns and the water itself just heat of air so you cant tell where the water leaves off and the air above it begins hardly and feel as though you were swimming in air through a green twilight darndest sensation i ever felt and the idol and columns sort of awe you  i enjoyed the swim and the room they gave me but i had lost my toothbrush and that kind of spoiled the end of the party  i noticed watersell only half introduced his pretty daughter to me they like me as a lion butand yet they seem to like me personally well enough too if i didnt have old martin trailing along smoking his corncob pipe and saying what he thinks id die of loneliness sometimes on the hike from meet to meet other times have jolly parties but id like to sit down with the cowleses and play poker and not have to explain who i am  funnynever used to feel lonely when i was bumming around on freights and so on not paying any special attention to anybody  october 23 i wonder how far ill ever get as an aviator the newspapers all praise me as a hero hero hell im a pretty steady flier but so would plenty of chauffeurs be this hero business is mostly bunk it was mostly chance my starting to fly at all dont suppose it is all accident to become as great a flier as garros or vedrines or beachey but im never going to be a garros i guess like the man that can jump twelve feet but never can get himself to go any farther  december 1 carmeau killed yesterday flying at san antone motor backfire machine caught fire burned him to death in the air he was the best teacher i could have had patient and wise i cant write about him and i cant get this insane question out of my mind was his beard burned i remember just how it looked and think of that when all the time i ought to remember how clever and darn decent he was carmeau will never show me new stunts again  and ely killed in october cromwell dixon gonethe plucky youngster professor montgomery nieuport todd shriver whom martin dockerill and hank odell liked so much and many others all dead like moisant i dont think i take any undue risks but it makes me stop and think and hank odell with a busted shoulder captain paul beck once told me he believed it was mostly carelessness these accidents and he certainly is a good observer but when i think of a careful constructor like nieuport  punk money im making thank heaven there will be one more good year of the game 1912 but i dont know about 1913 looks like the exhibition game would blow up thennearly everybody that wants to has seen an aeroplane fly once now and thats about all they want so good bye aviation except for military use and flying boats for sportsmen at least good bye during a slump of several years  hope to thunder forrest and i will be able to make our south american hike even if it costs every cent i have that will be something like it seeing new country instead of scrapping with fair managers about money  december 22 hoorray christmas time at sea quite excite to smell the ocean again and go rolling down the narrow gangways between the white stateroom doors off for a months flying in brazil and argentine with tony bean will look up data for coming exploration of amazon headwaters martin dockerill like a regular beau brummel in new white flannels parading the deck making eyes at pretty greaser girls its good to be going                                       feb 22 1912 geo ws birthday hed have busted that nolie proviso if hed ever advertised an aero meet  start of flight new orleans to st louis looks like really big times old fashioned jubilee all along the road and lots of prizes though take a chance only measly little 2500 prize guaranteed but vague promises of winnings at towns all along where stop for short exhibitions each of contestants has to fly at scheduled towns for percentage of gate receipts  feb 23 what a rotten flight today small crowd out to see me off no sooner up than trouble with plugs wanted to land but nothing but bayous rice fields cane breaks and marshes farmer shot at my machine soon motor stopped on me and had to come down awhooping on a small plowed field smashed landing gear and got an awful jar nothing serious though it was two hours before a local blacksmith and i repaired chassis and cleaned plugs i started off after coaching three scared darkies to hold the tail while the blacksmith spun the propeller he would give it a couple of bats then dodge out of the way too soon while i sat there and tried not to look mad which by gum i was plenty mad landed in this bum town called  fourth in the race and found sweet  refuge in this chills and fever hotel wish i was back in new orleans cheer up having others ahead of me in the race just adds a little zip to it watch me tomorrow and im not the only hard luck artist aaron solomons busted propeller and nearly got killed  later cable tony bean is dead killed flying my god tony impossible to think of him as dead just a few days ago we were flying together and calling on senoritas and he playing the fiddle and laughing always so polite like he used to fiddle us into good nature when we got discouraged at bagbys school seems like it was just couple minutes ago we drove in his big car through avenida de mayo and everybody cheered him he was hero of buenos aires yet he treated me as the big chief cablegram forwarded from new orleans dated yesterday beanno killed fell 200 feet  and tomorrow ill have to be out and jolly the rustic meet managers again want to go off some place and be quiet and think wish i could get away be off to south america with forrest  february 24 rotten luck continues back in same town again got up yesterday and motor misfired had to make quick landing in a bayou and haul out machine myself aided by scared kids got back here and found gasoline pipe fouled small piece of tin stuck in it  martin feels as bad as i do at tonys death tho he doesnt say much of anything gosh and tony such a nice little cuss was about all he said but he looked white around the gills  feb 25 another man has dropped out i am third but still last in the race race fever got me today didnt care for anything but winning got off to a good start then took chances machine wobbled like a board in the surf am having some funny kind of chicken creole i guess it is for lunch writing this in hotel dining room  later passed aaron solomons am now second in the race landed here just three hours behind walter macmonnies three letters forwarded here from forrest he is flying daily at army aviation camp also from gertie cowles she and her mother are in minneapolis attending a week of grand opera also to my surprise short note from jack ryan the grouch saying he has given up flying and gone back into motor business  there wont be much more than money to pay expenses on this trip  tomorrow ill show them some real flying  later telegram from a st l newspaper sweet business says that promoters of race have not kept promise to remove time limit as they promised doubt if either walter macmonnies or i can finish in time set  feb 26 bad luck continues but made fast flight after two forced descents one of

mem write to colonel haviland when i can  must when i can     part iii  the adventure of love     chapter xxiv   in october 1912 a young man came with an enthusiastic letter from the president of the aero club to old stephen vanzile vicepresident and general manager of the vanzile motor corporation of new york the young man was quiet selfpossessed an expert in regard to motors used to meeting prominent men he was immediately set to work at a tentative salary of 2500 a year to develop the plans of what he called the touricaran automobile with all camping accessories which should enable motorists to travel independent of inns add the joy of camping to the joy of touring anda feature of nearly all inventionsadd money to the purse of the inventor  the young man was carl ericson whom mr vanzile had seen fly at new orleans during the preceding february carl had got the idea of the touricar while wandering by motorcycle through scandinavia and russia  he was at this time twentyseven years old not at all remarkable in appearance nor to be considered handsome but so clean so well bathed so well setup and evenly tanned that one thought of the swimming dancing tennisplaying city men of good summer resorts an impression enhanced by his sleek cornsilk hair and small pale mustache his clothes came from london his watchchain was a thin line of platinum and gold his cigarettecase of silver engraved in inconspicuous bandsa modest and sophisticated cigarettecase which he had possessed long enough to forget that he had it he was apparently too much the easy wellbred rather inexperienced yale or princeton man not harvard there was a tiny twang in his voice and he sometimes murmured gee to know much about life or work as yet and his smooth rosy cheeks made it absurdly evident that he had not been away from the college insulation for more than two years  but when he got to work with draftsman and stenographers when a curt kindliness filled his voice he proved to be concentrated unafraid of responsibility able to keep many people busy trained to something besides family tradition and the collegians na√Øve belief that it matters who wins the next game  his hands would have given away the fact that he had done things they were large broad the knuckles heavy the palms calloused by something rougher than oar and tennisracket the microscopic traces of black grease did not for months quite come out of the cracks in his skin and two of his wellkept but thick nails had obviously been smashed  the men of the same rank as himself in the office captains and first lieutenants of business said that he simply ate up work they fancied with the eager oldwomanishness of office gossip that he had a secret sorrow for though he was pleasant enough he kept very much to himself the cause of his retirement from aviation was the theme of many romantic legends they did not know precisely what it was he had done in the prehistoric period of a year before but they treated him with reverence instead of the amused aloofness with which an office usually waits to see whether a new man will prove to be a fool or a grouch a clown or a good fellow the stenographers and filinggirls and telephonegirls followed with yearning eyes the heros straight back the girl who discovered in an old new york chronicle lining a bureau drawer an interview with carl became very haughty over its possession and lent it only to her best lady friends the older women who knew that carl had had a serious accident whispered in cloakroom confidences poor fellow and so brave about it  yet all the while carls chinablue eyes showed no trace of pain nor sorrow nor that detestable appeal for sympathy called being brave about his troubles                                       there were many thoughtful features which fitted the touricar for use in campingextrasized baggagebox whose triangular shape made the car more nearly streamline special folding silk tents folding aluminum cookingutensils electric stove run by current from the car electricbattery light attached to a curtainrod but the distinctive feature the one which carl could patent was the means by which a bed was made up inside the car as pullman seats are turned into berths the back of the front seat was hinged and dropped back to horizontal the upholstery back of the back seat could be taken out and also placed on the horizontal with blankets spread on the level space thus provided with the extraheavy top and side curtains in place and the electric light switched on tourists had a refuge cleaner than a country hotel and safer than a tent  the first touricar was being built carl was circularizing a list of possible purchasers and corresponding with makers of camping goods  because he was not officebroken he did not worry about the risks of the new enterprise the stupid details of affairs had for him a soulthe adventure of business  to be consulted by draftsmen and shop foremen to feel that if he should not arrive at 830 am to the second the most important part of all the worlds business would be halted and stenographers loll in expensive idleness to have the chief old vanzile politely anxious as to how things were going to plan ways of making a million dollars and not have the plans seem fantasticall these made it interesting to overwork and hypnotized carl into a feeling of responsibility which was less spectacular than flying before thousands but more in accordance with the spirit of the time and place  inside the officebusy and reaching for success outside the officefrankly bored  carl was a dethroned prince he had been accustomed to a more than royal court of admirers now he was a nobody the moment he went twenty feet from his desk he was forgotten he did not seek out the many people he had met when he was an aviator and a somebody he believed perhaps foolishly that they liked him only as a personage not as a person he sat lonely at dinner in cheap restaurants with stains on the tablecloths for he had put much of his capital into the new touricar company mothered by the vanzile corporation and aeroplanes accessories travelingexpenses and the like had devoured much of his large earnings at aviation before he had left the game  in his large shabby fairly expensive furnished room on seventyfifth street he spent unwilling evenings working on touricar plans or reading frenchfrench technical motor literature light novels balzac anything  he tried to keep in physical form and much though the routine and silly gestures of gymnasium exercises bored him he took them three times a week he could not explain the reason but he kept his identity concealed at the gymnasium giving his name as o ericson  even at the aero club where scores knew him by sight he was a nobody aviation like all pioneer arts must look to the men who are doing new things or planning new things not to heroes past carl was often alone at lunch at the club any group would have welcomed him but he did not seek them out for the first time he really saw the interior decorations of the club in the old days he had been much too busy talking with active comrades to gaze about but now he stared for five minutes together at the stampedleather wallcovering of the diningroom he noted much too carefully for a happy man the trophies of the loungingroom but at one corner he never glanced for here was a framed picture of the forgotten hawk ericson landing on governors island winner of the flight from chicago to new york such a beautiful swoop  there is no doubt of the fact that he disliked the successful new aviators and did so because he was jealous of them he admitted the fact but he could not put into his desire to be a good boy onequarter of the force that inspired his resentment at being a lonely man and a nobody but since he knew he was envious he was careful not to show it not to inflict it upon others he was gracious and added a wrinkle between his brows and said gosh and aint much less often  he had few friends these days death had taken many and he was wary of lionhunters who in dull seasons condescend to exlions and dethroned princes but he was fond of a couple of aero club men an automobile exracer who was a sellingagent for the vanzile corporation and charley forbes the brighteyed curlyheaded busy dissipated little reporter who had followed him from chicago to new york for the chronicle occasionally one of the men with whom he had flownhank odell or walter macmonnies or lieutenant rutledge of the navycame to town and carl felt natural again as for women the only girl whom he had known well in years istra nash the painter had gone to california to keep house for her father till she should have an excuse to escape to new york or europe again  inside the officea hustling optimistic young business man for the rest of the timea dethroned prince such was carl ericson in november 1912 when a letter from gertrude cowles which had pursued him all over america and europe finally caught him   west 157th st  new york  carl dearoh such excitement we have come to new york to live ray has such a good position with a big ny real estate co  mama  i are going to make a home for him even if its only just a flat but its quite a big one  looks out on the duckiest old house that must have been adorning harlem for heaven knows how long  our house has all modern conveniences elevator  all  think carl im going to study dancing at madame vashkowskas schoolshe was with the russian ballet  really is almost as wonderful a dancer as isadora duncan or pavlova perhaps ill teach all these ducky new dances to children some day im just terribly excited to be here like the silliest gushiest little girl in the world and i do hope so much you will be able to come to ny  honor us with your presence at dinner famous aviatorour carl  we are so proud of youif you will still remember simple people like us do come any time wonder where you will be when this reaches you  i read in the papers that your accident isnt serious but i am worried oh carl you must take care of yourself  yours as ever  gertie  ps mama sends her best regards so does ray he has a black mustache now we tease him about it dreadfully  g  one minute after reading the letter in his room carl was standing on the chaste blackandwhite tiles of the highly respectable whitearched hall downstairs asking information for the telephone number of  west 157th street while his landlord a drybearded goat of a physician who had failed in the practise of medicine and was now failing in the practise of roominghouses listened from the front of the hall  glad to escape from the funereally genteel house carl hastily changed his collar and tie and like the little boy carl whom gertie had known dogtrotted to the subway which was going to take him home     chapter xxv   before the twelvestory bendingo apartments carl scanned the rows of windows which pierced the wall like bankswallows nests in a bold cliff one group of those windows was homejoralemon and memories gerties faith and understanding it was she who had always understood him in anticipation he loitered through the big marbleandstucco rug and rubbertree negro hallboy and jew tenant hallway what would the cowleses be like now  gertie met him in the coatsmelling private hall of the cowles apartment greeted him with both hands clasping his and her voice catching in oh carl its so good to see you behind gertie was a swishing stiffbacked mrs cowles piping in a high worn voice mr ericson a friend from home and such a famous friend  gertie drew him into the livingroom he looked at her  he found not a girl but a woman of thirty plump solid with the tiniest wrinkles of past unhappiness or ennui at the corners of her mouth but her eyes radiant with sweetness and her hair appealingly soft and brown above her wide calm forehead she was gowned in lavender cr√™pe de chine with panniers of satin elaborately sprinkled with little bunches of futurist flowers long jet earrings a lowcut neck that hinted of a comfortable bosom eyes shining hands firm on his arm voice ringing she was unaffectedly glad to see himher childhood playmate whom she had not beheld for seven years  mrs cowles was waiting for them to finish their greetings carl was startled to find mrs cowles smaller than he had remembered her hair nearly white and not perfectly matched her face crisscrossed with wrinkles deeper than her age justified but her old disapproval of carl son of a carpenter and cousin of a hired girl was gone she even laughed mildly like a kitten sneezing and from a room somewhere beyond ray shouted  be right there in a second old man crazy to have a look at you  carl did not really see the livingroom their background indeed he never really saw it there was nothing to seechairs and a table and pictures of meadows and roses it was comfortable however and had conveniencesa folding cardtable a cribbageboard scorepads for whist and five hundred a humidor of cigars a large morris chair and an ugly but wellpadded couch of green tufted velvetine  they sat about in chairs talking  ray came in slapped carl on the back roared well heres the stranger holy mike have you got a mustache too better shave it off before gert starts kidding you about it have a cigar  carl felt at home for the first time in a year for the first time talked easily  say gertie tell me about my folks and bone stillman  why i saw your father just before we left carl you know he still does quite a little business we got your mother to join the nautilus clubshe doesnt go very often but she had a nice paper about java and its products and she helps us a lot with the restroom i havent seen mr stillman for a long long time ray what has  ray why i think old bones off on some expedition r other fellow told me bone was some kind of a forest ranger or mine inspector or some darn thing up in the big woods he must be pretty well along toward seventy now at that  carl so dads getting along well his letters arent very committal oh say gertie what ever became of ben rusk ive lost track of him

settled just think shes to have a whole year here studying domestic science and then shes to have a perfectly dandy position teaching in the fargo high school im not supposed to tellyou mustnt breathe a word of it  mrs cowles interrupting adelaide is a good girlray dont tilt your chair  gertie yes isnt she mamma well i was just saying between you and me carl she is to have the position in fargo all ready and waiting for her though of course they cant announce it publicly with all the cats that would like to get it and all isnt that fine  carl certainly is member the time we had the may party at adelaides and all i could get for my basket was rag babies and may flowers gee but i felt out of it  gertie we did have some good parties didnt we  ray dont call that much of a good party for carl ring off gert you got the wrong number that time all right  gertie flushing oh i didnt meanbut we did have some good times oh carl will you ever forget the time you and i ran away when we were just babies  carl ill never forget  mrs cowles ill never forget that time my lands i thought i should die i was so frightened  carl youve forgiven me now though havent you  mrs cowles my dear boy of course i have she wiped away a few tears with a gentlewoman handkerchief of lace and thin linen carl crossed the room and kissed her paleveined silvery old hand abashed he subsided on the couch and trying to look as though he hadnt done it  carl ohhhhh say whatever did become ofoh i cant think of his nameoh you knowi know his name well as i do my own but its slipped me just for the momentyou know he ran the billiardparlor the son of the  from mrs cowles a small disapproving sound from ray a grin of knowing naughtiness and a violent headshake  gertie gently yes hehas left joralemon klemm you mean  carl hastily wondering what eddie klemm had done oh i see have there been many changes in joralemon  mrs cowles do you write to your father and mother carl you ought to  carl oh yes i write to them quite often now though for a time i didnt  mrs cowles im glad my boy its pretty good after all to have home folks that you can depend on isnt it when i first went to joralemon i thought it was a little pokey but now im older and ive been there so long and all that im almost afraid of new york and i declare i do get real lonely for home sometimes id be glad to see dr ruskbens father i mean the old doctordriving by though of course you know i lived in minneapolis a great many years and i do feel i ought to take advantage of the opportunities here and ive thought quite seriously about taking

mothers love my boy  ray say look here carl i want to hear something about all this aviation how does it feel to fly anyway id be scared to death its funny i cant look off the top of a skyscraper without feeling as though i wanted to jump gosh i  gertie now you just let carl tell us when he gets ready you big bad brother carl wants to hear all about home first all these years you were asking about the changes there havent been so very many you know its a little slow there oh of course i almost forgot why you havent been in joralemon since they built up what used to be tubbss pasture  carl not the old pasture by the lake well well is that a fact why gee i used to snare gophers there  gertie oh yes why you simply wouldnt know it carl its so much changed there must be a dozen houses on it

cigar old man say speaking of plato of course you know they ousted old s alcott woodski from the presidency for heresy something about baptism and the dean succeeded him poor old cuss he wasnt as mean as the dean anyway say carl ive always thought they gave you a pretty raw deal there  gertie interrupting perfectly dreadful ray dont put your feet on that couch i brushed it thoroughly just this morning it was simply terrible carl ive always said that if plato couldnt appreciate her greatest son  mrs cowles sleepily outrageous and dont put your feet on that chair ray  ray oh leave my feet alone everybody knew you were dead right in standing up for prof frazer you remember how i roasted all the fellows in omega chi when they said you were nutty to boost him and when you stood up in chapellord that was nervy  gertie indeed you were right and now youve got so famous i guess  carl oh i aint so  mrs cowles i was simply amazed children if you dont mind im afraid i must leave you mr ericson im so ashamed to be sleepy so early when we lived in minneapolis before mr cowles passed beyond he was a regular nighthawk and we used to sitsit a yawnsit up till all hours but tonight  gertie oh must you go so soon i was just going to make carl a rarebit carl has never seen one of my rarebits  mrs cowles make him one by all means my dear and you young people sit up and enjoy yourselves just as long as you like good night all ray will you please be sure and see that that window is fastened before you go to bed i get so nervous whenmr ericson im very proud to think that one of our joralemon boys should have done so well sometimes i wonder if the lord ever meant men to flywhat with so many accidents and you know aviators often do get killed and all i was reading the other daysuch a large percentagebut we have been so proud that you should lead them all i was saying to a lady on the train that we had a friend who was a famous aviator and she was so interested to find that we knew you good night  they had the welsh rarebit with beer and carl helped to make it gertie summoned him into the scoured kitchen saying with a beautiful casualness as she tied an apron about him  we cant afford a hired girl i suppose i should say a maid because mamma has put so much of our money into rays business so you mustnt expect anything so very grand but youd like to help wouldnt you youre to chop the cheese cut it into weenty cubes  carl did like to help he boasted that he was the champion cheesechopper of harlem and the bronx onethirtythree ringside while gertie was toasting crackers and ray was out buying bottles of beer in a newspaper it all made carl feel more than ever at home it was good to be with people of such divine understanding that they knew what he meant when he said i suppose there have been worse teachers than prof larsen  when the rabbit lay pale in death a saddening d√©b√¢cle of hardened cheese and they sat with their elbows on the modified mission diningtable gertie exclaimed  oh ray you must do that new stunt of yours for carl its screamingly funny carl  ray rose had his collar and tie off in two jocund jerks buttoned his collar on backward cheerily turned his waistcoat back side foremost lengthened his face to an expression of unctuous sanctimoniousness and turned abouttransformed in one minute to a fair imitation of a stage curate with his hands folded ray droned naow sistern it behooveth us heuh in st timothees chutch while carl pounded the table in his delight at seeing old ray the broadshouldered the ladykiller the capable business man drop his eyes and yearn  now you must do a stunt shrieked ray and gertie and carl hesitatingly sang what he remembered of forrest havilands foolish song      i went up in a balloon so big     the people on the earth they looked like a pig     like a mice like a katydid like flieses and like fleasen  then without solicitation gertie decided to dance gather the golden sheaves which she had learned at the school of mme vashkowska late though not very late of the russian ballet  she explained her work outlined the theory of sensuous and esthetic dancing mentioned the backgrounds of bakst and the glories of nijinsky told her ambition to teach the new dancing to children carl listened with awe and with awe did he gaze as gertie gathered the golden sheavespurely hypothetical sheaves in a field occupying most of the livingroom  after the stunts ray delicately vanished it was not so much that he statedly went off to bed as that presently he was not there gertie and carl were snugly alone and at last he talkedof forrest haviland and tony bean of flying and falling of excited crowds and the fogfilled airlanes  in turn she told of her ambition to do something modern and urban she had hesitated between dancing and making exotic jewelry she was glad she had chosen the former it was so human it put one in touch with people she had recently gone to dinner with real bohemians spirits of fire splendidly in contrast with the dull plodders of joralemon the dinner had been at a marvelous place on west tenth streetvery foreign every one drinking wine and eating spaghetti and little red herrings and the women fearlessly smoking cigarettessome of them she had gone with a girl from mme vashkowskas school a glorious creature from london nebraska who lived with the most fascinating girls at the three arts club they had met an artist with black hair and languishing eyes who had a yankee name but sang italian songs divinely upon the slightest pretext so bubbling was he with joie de vivre  carl was alarmed gosh he protested i hope you arent going to have much to do with the longhaired bunch ive invented a name for themthe hobohemians  oh noo i dont take them seriously at all i was just glad to go once  of course some of them are clever  oh yes arent they clever  but i dont think they last very well  oh no im sure they dont last well oh no carl im too old and fat to be a bohemiana hobohemian i mean so  nonsense you look sooh thunder i dont know just how to express itwell so real its wonderfully comfortable to be with youall again i dont mean youre just the so good to her mother sort you understand but i mean youre dependable as well as artistic  oh indeed i wont take them too seriously besides i suppose lots of the people that go to bohemian restaurants arent really artists at all they just go to see the artists theyre just as bromidic as can bedont you hate bromides of course i want to see some of that part of life but i thinkoh dont you think those artists and all are dreadfully careless about morals  well  yes she breathed reflectively no i keep up with my church and allindeed i do oh carl you must come to our churchst orguls its too sweet for anything its just two blocks from here and it isnt so far up here you know not with the subwaynot like commuting it has the loveliest chapel and the most wonderful reredos and the services are so inspiring and highchurch not like that horrid st timothys at home i do think a church service ought to be beautiful dont you it isnt as though we were like a lot of poor people who have to have their souls saved in a mission what church do you attend you will come to st orguls some time wont you  be glad tooh say gertie before i forget it what is semina doing now is she married  apropos of this subject gertie let it be known that she herself was not betrothed  carl had not considered that question but when he was back in his room he was glad to know that gertie was free                                       at the omega chi delta club carl lunched with ray cowles two nights later ray and gertie took carl and gerties friend the glorious creature from london nebraska to the opera carl did not know much about opera in other words being a normal young american who had been waterproofed with college culture he knew absolutely nothing about it but he gratefully listened to gerties clear explanation of why mme vashkowska preferred wagner to verdi  he had in the mean time received a formal invitation for a party to occur at gerties the coming friday evening  thursday evening gertie coached him in a new dance the turkey trot she also gave him a lesson in the boston with a new dip invented by mme vashkowska which was certain to sweep the country because of course vashkowska was the only genuinely qualified ma√Ætresse de danse in america  it was a beautiful evening home ray came in and the three of them had coffee and thin sandwiches at gerties suggestion ray again turned his collar round and performed his clergyman stunt while the impersonation did not perhaps seem so humorous as before carl was amused and he consented to sing the i went up in a balloon so big song so that ray might learn it and sing it at the office  it was captivating to have gertie say quietly as he left i hope youll be able to come to the party a little early tomorrow carl you know we count on you to help us     chapter xxvi   the party was on at the cowles flat  people came they all set to it having a party being lively and gay whether they wanted to or not they all talked at once and had delicious shocks over the girl from london nebraska who having moved to washington place just a block or two from ever so many artists was now smoking a cigarette and wearing a gown that was black and clinging it was no news to her that men had a tendency to become interested in her ankles but she still went to church and was accepted by quite the nicest of the st orguls set to whom gertie had introduced her  she and gertie were the only thoroughly qualified representatives of art but beauty and gallantry and wit were common the conspirators in holding a party were on the male side  an insurance adjuster who was a fratbrother to carl and ray though he came from melanchthon college a young lawyer ever so jolly with a banjo a bantling clergyman who was spoken of with masculine approval because he smoked a pipe and said charmingly naughty things johnson of the homes and long island real estate company and his brother of the martinhurst development company four older men ranging from thinhaired to very bald who had come with their wives and secretly looked at their watches while they talked brightly with one anothers wives five young men whom carl could not tell apart as they all had smooth hair and eyeglasses and smart dressshirts and obliging smiles and complimentary references to his aviating he gave up trying to remember which was which  it was equally hard to remember which of the women gertie knew as a result of her girlhood visit to new york which from their membership in st orguls church which from their relation to minnesota they all sat in rows on couches and chairs and called him you wicked man for reasons none too clear to him he finally fled from them and joined the group of young men who showed an illbred and disapproved tendency to sneak off into rays room for a smoke he did not however escape one young woman who stood out from the m√™l√©ea young woman with a personality almost as remarkable as that of the glorious creature from london nebraska this was the more or less married young woman named dorothy and affectionately called tottykins by all the st orguls group she was of the kind who look at men appraisingly and expect them to come up be unduly familiar and be crushed she had seven distinct methods of getting men to say indiscreet things and three variations of reply of which the favorite was to remark with wellbred calmness im afraid you have made a slight error mr uh i didnt quite catch your name perhaps they failed to tell you that i attend st orguls evvvvry sunday and have a husband and child and am not at all really you know i hope that there has been nothing i said that has given you the idea that i have been looking for a flirtation  a thin small female with bobbed hair was tottykins who kept her large husband and her fat white grub of an infant somewhere in the back blocks she fingered a long gold religious chain with her square stubby hand while she gazed into mens eyes with what she privately termed daring frankness  tottykins the fair tottykins the modern tottykins who had read three weeks and nearly all of a wicked novel in french and wore a large gold cross tottykins who worked so hard in her little flat that she had to rest all of every afternoon and morning tottykins the advanced and liberalyet without any of the extremes of socialists and artists and vegetarians and other illconditioned persons who do not attend st orguls tottykins the firmly domestic whose husband grew more worried every year tottykins the intensely cultured and inquisitive about life the primitively free and pervasively original who announced in public places that she wanted always to live like the spirit of the dancing bacchante statue but had the assistant rector of st orguls in for coffee every fourth monday evening  tottykins beckoned carl to a corner and said with her manner of amused condescension now you sit right down here hawk ericson and tell me all about aviation  carl was not vastly sensitive he had not disliked the nice young men with eyeglasses not till now did he realize how tottykinss shrill references to the dancing bacchante and the bacchanting of her mudcolored dutchfashioned hair had bored him ennui was not of course an excuse but it was the explanation of why he answered in this wise very sweetly looking tottykins in the eyes and patting her hand with a brotherlike and altogether maddening condescension  no no that isnt the way dorothy its quite pass√© to ask me to tell you all about aviation that isnt done not in 1912 oh dorothy oh no no noo no no first you should ask me if im afraid when im flying oh always begin that way then you say that theres a curious fact about youwhen youre on a high building and just look down once then you get so dizzy that you want to jump then after youve said thatlets see youre a church member arent you well then next youd say just how does it feel to be up in an aeroplane or if you dont say that then youve simply got to say just how does it feel to fly anyway but if youre just terribly interested dorothy you might ask about biplanes versus monoplanes and do i think therell ever be a flight across the atlantic but whatever you do dorothy dont fail to ask me if ill give you a free ride when i start flying again and well fly and flylike birds you know or like the dancing bacchante thats the way to talk about aviation and now you tell me all about babies  really im afraid babies is rather a big subject to tell all about at a party really you know  that was the only time carl was not bored at the party and even then he had spiritual indigestion from having been rude  for the rest of the time  every one knew everybody else and took carl aside to tell him that everybody was the most conscientious man in our office ericson why the boss would trust him with anything it saddened carl to hear the insurance adjuster boom oh you tottykins across the room at tenminute intervals like a human foghorn on the sea of ennui  they were all so uniformly polite so neatminded and churchgoing and dull nearly all the girls did their hair and coquetries one exactly like another carl is not to be pitied he had the pleasure of martyrdom when he heard the younger johnson tell of martinhurst the suburb beautiful he believed that he had reached the nadir of boredom but he was mistaken  after simple and pleasing refreshments of the woodenplate and papernapkin school gertie announced now were going to have some stunts and youre each to give one i know you all can and if anybody tries to beg offmy what will happen my brother has a new one  for the third time that month carl saw ray turn his collar round and become clerical while every one rustled with delight including the jolly bantling clergyman  and for the fourth time he saw gertie dance gather the golden sheaves she appeared shy and serious in bloomers and flat dancingshoes which made her ample calves bulge the more she started at sight of the harvest moon and well she may have been astonished if she did indeed see a harvest moon there above the gilded buffalo horns on the unit bookcase rose to her toes flapped her arms and began to gather the sheaves to her breast with enough plump and panting energy to enable her to gather at least a quartersection of them before the whistle blew  it was not only esthetic but close to the soil  then to banjo accompaniment the insurance adjuster sighed for his old kentucky home which carl judged to have been located in brooklyn the whole crowd joined in the chorus and  suddenly with a shock that made him despise himself for the cynical superiority which he had been enjoying carl remembered that forrest haviland tony bean hank odell even surly jack ryan and the alien carmeau had sung my old kentucky home on their last night at the bagby school he felt their beloved presences in the room he had to fight against tears as he too joined in the chorus then weep no more my lady he was beside a california poppyfield the blossoms slumbered beneath the moon and on his shoulder was the hand of forrest haviland  he had repented he became part of the group he spoke kindly to tottykins but presently tottykins postponed her welladvertised return to her husband and baby and gave a tenminute dramatic recital from byron and the younger johnson sang a swiss mountaineer song with yodels  gertie looked speculatively at carl twice during this offering he knew that the gods were plotting an abominable thing she was going to call upon him for the stunt which had been inescapably identified with him the song i went up in a balloon so big he met the crisis heroically he said loudly as the shaky strains of the swiss ballad died on the midnight mountain air of 157th street while the older men concealed yawns and applauded and the family in the adjoining flat rapped on the radiator im sorry my throat s so sore tonight otherwise id sing a song i learned from a fellow in californiaballoon s big  gertie stared at him doubtfully but passed to a kittenfaced girl from minnesota who was quite ready to give an imitation of a child whose doll has been broken her stunt was greeted with oh how cunning please do it again  she prepared to do it again carl made hasty motions of departure pathetically holding his throat  he did not begin to get restless till he had reached ninetysixth street and had given up his seat in the subway to a woman who resembled tottykins he wondered if he had not been at the old home long enough at seventysecond street on an inspiration that came as the train was entering the station he changed to a local and went down to fiftyninth street he found an allnight garage hired a racingcar and at dawn he was driving furiously through long island a hundred miles from new york on a roadway perilously slippery with falling snow     chapter xxvii   carl wished that adelaide benner had never come from joralemon to study domestic science he felt that he was a sullen brute but he could not master his helpless irritation as he walked with adelaide and gertie cowles through central park on a snowy sunday afternoon of december adelaide assumed that one remained in the state of mind called joralemon all ones life that however famous he might be the son of oscar ericson was not sufficiently refined for miss cowles of the big house on the hill though he might improve under cowles influences he was still a person who had run away from plato but that assumption was far less irritating than one into which adelaide threw all of her faded yearningthat gertie and he were in love  adelaide kept repeating with coy slyness isnt it too bad you two have me in the way and dont mind poor me auntie will turn her back any time you want her to  and gertie merely blushed murmuring dont be a silly  at eightieth street adelaide announced now i must leave you children im going over to the metropolitan museum of art i do love to see art pictures ive always wanted to now be as good as you can you two  gertie was mechanical about replying oh dont run away addy dear  oh yes you two will miss an old maid like me terribly and adelaide was off a small sturdy undistinguished figure with an unyielding loyalty to gertie and to the idea of marriage  carl looked at her bobbing back with wrinkles in her cloth jacket over the shoulders as she melted into the crowd of glossy furtrimmed newyorkers he comprehended her goodness her devotion he sighed if shed only stop this hinting about gertie and me he was repentant of his irritation and said to gertie who was intimately cuddling her arm into his adelaides an awfully good kid sorry she had to go  gertie jerked her arm away averted her profile grated if you miss her so much perhaps youd better run after her really i wouldnt interfere not for worlds  why hello gertie what seems to be the matter dont i detect a chill in the atmosphere so sorry youve gone and gotten refined on me i was just going to suggest some lowbrow amusement like tea at the casino  well you ought to know a lady doesnt  oh now gertie dear not lady  i dont think youre a bit nice carl ericson i dont to be making fun of me when im serious and why havent you been up to see us mamma and ray have spoken of it and youve only been up once since my party and then you were  oh please lets not start anything sorry i havent been able to get up oftener but ive been taking work home you know how it isyou know when you get busy with your dancingschool  oh i meant to tell you im through just through with vashkowska and her horrid old school shes a cat and i dont believe she ever had anything to do with the russian ballet either what do you think she had the effrontery to tell me she said that i wasnt practising and really trying to learn anything and ive been working myself intoreally my nerves were in such a shape i would have been in danger of a nervous breakdown if i had kept on tottykins told me how she had a nervous breakdown and had me see her doctor such a dear dr st claire so refined and sympathetic and he told me i was right in suspecting that nobody takes vashkowska seriously any more and besides i dont think much of all this symbolistic dancing anyway and at last ive found out what i really want to do oh carl its so wonderful im studying ceramics with miss deitz shes so wonderful and temperamental and she has the dearest studio on gramercy park of course i havent made anything yet but i know im going to like it so much and miss deitz says i have a natural taste for vahzes and  huh oh yes vases i get you  dont be vulgarim going to go down to her studio and work every other day and she doesnt think you have to work like a scrubwoman to succeed like that horrid vashkowska did miss deitz has a temperament herself and oh carl she says that gertrude isnt suited to me and gertie certainly isnt and she calls me eltruda dont you think thats a sweet name would you like to call me eltruda sometimes  look here gertie i dont want to butt in and im guessing at it but looks to me as though one of these artistic grafters was working you what do you know about this deitz person has she done anything worth while and honestly gertieby the way i dont want to be brutal but i dont think i could stand eltruda it sounds like tottykins  now really carl  wait a second how do you know youve got what you call a temperament go to it and good luck if you can get away with it but how do you know it isnt simply living in a flat and not having any work to do except developing a temperament why dont you try working with ray in his office hes a mighty good business man this is just a sugges  now really this is  look here gertie the thing ive always admired about you is your wholesomeness and  wholesome oh that word as miss deitz was saying just the other day its as bad  but you are wholesome gertie that is if you dont let new york turn your head and if youd use your ability on a real job like helping ray or teachingyes or really sticking to your ceramics or dancing and leave the temperament business to those who can get away with it no wait i know im butting in i know that people wont go and change their natures because i ask them to but you see youand ray and adelaideyou are the friends i depend on and so i hate to see  now carl dear you might let me talk said gertie in tones of maddening sweetness as i think it over i dont seem to recall that youve been an authority on temperament for so very long i seem to remember that you werent so terribly wonderful in joralemon im glad to be the first to honor what youve done in aviation but i dont know that that gives you the right to  never said it did carl insisted with fictitious good humor  assume that you are an authority on temperament and art im afraid that your head has been just a little turned by  oh hell oh im sorry that just slipped  it shouldnt have slipped you know im afraid it cant be passed over so easily gertie might have been a bustling joralemon schoolteacher pleasantly bidding the dirty ericson boy now go and wash the little hands  carl said nothing he was bored he wished that he had not become entangled in their vague discussion of temperament  even more brightly gertie announced im afraid youre not in a very good humor this afternoon im sorry that my plans dont interest you of course i should be very temperamental if i expected you to apologize for cursing and swearing so i think ill just leave you here and when you feel better she was infuriatingly cheerful i should be pleased to have you call me up goodby carl and i hope that your walk will do you good  she turned into a footpath left him muttering in tones of youthful injury jiminy ive done it now  he was in joralemon  a victoria drove by with a dowager who did not seem to be humbly courting the best set in joralemon a grin lightened carls face he chuckled by golly gertie handled it splendidly im to call up and be humble and thenbingthe least i can do is to propose and be led to the altar and teach a sundayschool class at st orguls for the rest of my life come hither hawk ericson let us hold council heres the way gertie will dope it out i guess eltruda ill dine in solitary regret for saying hellno first im to walk downtown alone and busy repenting and then ill feed alone and by eight oclock ill be so tired of myself that ill call up and beg pretty rats its rotten mean to dope it out like that but just the sameme that have done what ive doneworried to death over one accidental hell hey there you taxi  grandly he rode through the park and in an unrepentant manner bowed to every pretty woman he saw to the disapproval of their silkhatted escorts  he forgot the existence of gertie cowles and the old home folks  but he really could not afford a taxicab and he had to make up for it by economy at seventhirty he gloomily entered miggletons restaurant on fortysecond street the least unbearable of the popular pricestables for ladies dens and slumped down at a table near the window there were few diners carl was as much a stranger as on the morning when he had first invaded new york to find work with an automobile company and had passed this same restaurant still was he a segregated stranger despite the fact that two blocks away in the aero club two famous aviators were agreeing that there had never been a more consistently excellent flight in america than hawk ericsons race from chicago to new york  carl considered the delights of the cowles flat rays stories about plato and business and the sentimental things gertie played on the guitar he suddenly determined to go off some place and fly an aeroplane as suddenly knew that he was not yet ready to return to the game he read the evening telegram and cheerlessly peered out of the window at the gray snowveil which shrouded fortysecond street  as he finished his dessert and stirred his coffee he stared into a streetcar stalled in a line of traffic outside within the car seen through the snowmist was a girl of twentytwo or three with satiny slim features and ashblond hair she was radiant in whitefox furs carl craned to watch he thought of the girl who asking a direction before the florida lunch room in chicago had inspired him to become a chauffeur  the girl in the streetcar was listening to her companion who was a darkhaired girl with humor and excitement about life in her face well setup not tall in a smartly tailored coat of brown ponyskin and a small hat that was all lines and no trimming both of them seemed amused possibly by the lofty melancholy of a traffic policeman beside the car who raised his hand as though he had high ideals and a slight stomachache the darkhaired girl tapped her round knees with the joy of being alive  the streetcar started carl was already losing in the city jungle the two acquaintances whom he had just made the car stopped again still blocked carl seized his coat dropped a fiftycent piece on the cashiers desk did not wait for his ten cents change ran across the street barely escaping a taxicab galloped around the end of the car swung up on the platform  as he took a seat opposite the two girls he asked himself just what he expected to do now the girls were unaware of his existence and why had he hurried the car had not started again but he studied his unconscious conquests from behind his newspaper vastly content  in the unnatural quiet of the stalled car the girls were irreverently discussing george he heard enough to know that they were of the rather smart rather cultured class known as newyorkersthey might be russianamerican princesses or social workers or illpaid governesses or actresses or merely persons with one motorcar and a useful papa in the family  but in any case they were not of the kind he could pick up  the tall girl of the ashblond hair seemed to be named olive being quite unolive in tint while her livelier companion was apparently christened ruth carl wearied of olives changeless beauty as quickly as he did of her silverhandled umbrella she merely knew how to listen but the less spectacular less beautiful less languorous darkhaired ruth was born a good comrade her laughter marked her as one of the women whom earthquake and flood and childbearing cannot rob of a sense of humor she would have the inside view the sophisticated understanding of everything  the car was at last free of the traffic it turned a corner and started northward carl studied the girls  ruth was twentyfour perhaps or twentyfive not tall slight enough to nestle but strong and selfreliant she had quantities of darkbrown hair crisp and glinty though not sleek with eyebrows noticeably dark and heavy her smile was made irresistible by her splendidly shining teeth fairly large but closeset and white and not only the corners of her eyes joined in her smile but even her nose her delicate yet piquant nose which could quiver like a deers when she laughed carl noted ruth had a trick of lifting her heavy lids quickly and surprising one with a glint of blue eyes where brown were expected her smooth healthy creamcolored skin was rosy with winter and looked as though in summer it would tan evenly without freckles her chin was soft but without a dimple and her jaws had a clean boyish leanness her smooth neck and delicious shoulders were curved not fatly but with youth and happiness they were square capable shoulders with no midvictorian droop about them her waist was slender naturally not from stays her short but not fat fingers were the ideal instruments for the piano slim were her crossed feet and her unwrinkled pumps foolish footgear for a snowy evening seemed eager to dance  there was no hint of the coquette about her physical appeal this ruth had but it was the allure of sunlight and meadows of tennis and a boat with bright canted sails not of boudoir nor garden dizzyscented with jasmine she was young and clean sweet without being sprinkled with pink sugar too young to know much about the worlds furious struggle too happy to have realized its inevitable sordidness yet born a woman who would not always wish to be protected and round whom all her circle of life would center  so carl inarticulately mused with the intentness which one gives to strangers in a quiet car till he laughed i feel as if i knew her like a book the centurys greatest problem was whether he would finally prefer her to olive if he knew them if he could speak to thembut that was in new york more difficult than beating a policeman or getting acquainted with the mayor he would lose them  already they were rising going out  he couldnt let them be lost he glanced out of the window sprang up with an elaborate pretense that he had come to his own street he followed them out still conning headlines in his paper his grave absorption said plain that all might behold that he was a respectable citizen to whom it would never occur to pursue strange young women  his new friends had been close to him in the illuminated car but they were alien unapproachable when they stood on an unfamiliar streetcrossing snowdimmed and silent with night he stared at a streetsign and found that he was on madison avenue up in the fifties as they turned east on fiftyblankth street he stopped under the streetlight took an envelope from his pocket and found on it the address of that dear old friend living on fiftyblankth on whom he was going to call this was to convince the policeman of the perfect purity of his intentions the fact that there was no policeman nearer than the man on fixed post a block away did not lessen carls pleasure in the makebelieve he industriously inspected the housenumbers as he followed the quickly moving girls and frequently took out his watch nothing should make him late in calling on that dear old friend  not since adam glowered at the intruder eve has a man been so darkly uninterested in two charmers he stared clear through them he looked over their heads he observed objects on the other side of the street he indignantly told the imaginary policemen who stopped him that he hadnt even seen the girls till this moment that he was the victim of a plot  the block through which the cavalcade was passing was lined with shabbygenteel brownstone houses with high stoops and haughty dark doors and dressmakers placards or doctors cards in the windows carl was puzzled the girls seemed rather too cheerful to belong in this decayed and gloomy block which in the days when horsehair furniture and bankers had mattered had seemed imposing but the girls ascended the steps of a house which was typical of the row except that five motorcars stood before it carl passing went up the steps of the next house and rang the bell  what a funny place he heard one of the girlshe judged that it was ruthremark from the neighboring stoop it looks exactly like aunt emma when she wears an alexandra bang do we go right up oughtnt we to ring it ought to be the craziest partyanarchists  a party eh thought carl  ought to ring i suppose butyes theres sure to be all sorts of strange people at mrs hallets said the voice of the other girl then the door closed upon both of them  and an abashed carl realized that a maid had opened the door of the house at which he himself had rung and was glaring at him as he craned over to view the nextdoor stoop  wwheredoes dr brown live here he stuttered  no e dont the maid snapped closing the door  carl groaned he dont dear old brown not live here huh what shall i do  in remarkably good spirits he moved over in front of the house into which ruth and olive had gone people were coming to the party in twos and threes yes the men were in evening clothes he had his information  swinging his stick up to a level with his shoulder at each stride he raced to fiftyninth street and the nearest taxistand he was whirled to his room he literally threw his clothes off he shaved hastily singing will you come to the ball from the quaker girl and slipped into evening clothes and his suavest dressshirt seizing things all at oncetophat muffler gloves pocketbook handkerchief cigarettecase keysand hanging them about him as he fled down the decorous stairs he skipped to the taxicab and started again for fiftyblankth street  at the house of the party he stopped to find on the letterbox in the entry the name mrs hallet mentioned by olive there was no such name he tried the inner door it opened he cheerily began to mount steep stairs which kept on for miles climbing among slatecolored walls past empty wallniches with toeless plaster statues the hallways dim and high and snobbish and the dark old double doors scowled at him he boldly returned the scowl he could hear the increasing din of a talkparty coming from above when he reached the top floor he found a door open on a big room crowded with shrilly chattering people in florid clothes there was a hint of brassware and paintings and silken turkish rugs  but no sight of ruth or olive  a maid was bobbing to him and breathing that way please at the end of the hall he went meekly he did not dare to search the clamorous crowd for the girls as yet  he obediently added his hat and coat and stick to an uncomfortablelooking pile of wraps writhing on a bed in a small room that had a copley print of sargents prophets a calendar and an unimportant white rocker  it was time to go out and face the party but he had stagefright while climbing the stairs he had believed that he was in touch with the two girls but now he was separated from them by a crowd farther from them than when he had followed them down the unfriendly street and not till now did he quite grasp the fact that the hostess might not welcome him his glowing game was becoming very dulltoned he lighted a cigarette and listened to the beating surf of the talk in the other room  another man came in like all the rest he gave up the brilliant idea of trying to find an unpre√´mpted place for his precious newly ironed silk hat and resignedly dumped it on the bed he was a passable man with a gentlemanly mustache and good pumps carl knew that fact because he was comparing his own clothes and deciding that he had none the worst of it but he was relieved when the waxed mustache moved a couple of times and its owner said in a friendly way beastly jam may i trouble you for a match  carl followed him out to the hostess a small busy woman who made a business of being vivacious and letting the light catch the fringes of her gold hair as she nodded carl nonchalantly shook hands with her bubbling so afraid couldnt get here my playbut at last  he was in a panic but the hostess instead of calling for the police gushed so glad you could come combining a kittenish mechanical smile for him with a glance over his shoulder at the temporary butler i want you to meet miss moeller mruhmr  i knew youd forget it carl was brotherly and protecting in his manner ericson oscar ericson  oh of course how stupid of me miss moeller want you to meet mr oscar ericsonyou know  s happy meet you miss mmmmmmm said carl tremendously wellbred in manner can we possibly go over and be clever in a corner do you think  he had heard colonel haviland say that but his manner gave it no quotationmarks  presumably he talked to miss moeller about something usualthe snow or the party or owen johnsons novels presumably miss moeller had eyes to look into and banalities to look away from presumably there was something in the room besides people and talk and rugs hung over the bookcases but carl never knew he was looking for ruth he did not see her  within ten minutes he had manoeuvered himself free of miss moeller and was searching for ruth his nerves quivering amazingly with the fear that she might already have gone  how would he ever find her he could scarce ask the hostess say wheres ruth  she was nowhere in the fog of people in the big room if he could find even olive  strolling nodding to perfectly strange people who agreeably nodded back under the mistaken impression that they were glad to see him he systematically checked up all the groups ruth was not among the punchtable devotees who were being humorous and amorous over cigarettes not among the caustic wits exclusively assembled in a corner not among the shy sisters aligned on the davenport and wondering why they had come not in the general maelstrom in the center of the room  he stopped calmly to greet the hostess again remarking you look so beautifully sophisticated tonight and listened suavely to her fluttering remarks he was the picture of the cynical cityman who has to be nowhere at no especial time but he was not cynical he had to find ruth  he escaped and between the main room and the diningroom penetrated a small den filled with witty young men old stories cigarettesmoke and siphons then he charged into the diningroom where there were candles and plate much like silverand ruth and olive at the farther end     chapter xxviii   he wanted to run forward take their hands cry at last he seemed to hear his voice wording it but not glancing at them again he established himself on a chair by the doorway between the two rooms  it was safe to watch the two girls in this babel where words swarmed and battled everywhere in the air ruth was in a brown velvet frock whose golden tones harmonized with her brown hair she was being enthusiastically talked at by a man to whom she listened with a courteously amused curiosity carl could fancy her nudging olive who sat beside her on the jacobean settee and was attended by another talkingman carl told ruth though she did not know that he was telling her that she had no right to be so blasted newyorkishly superior and condescending but he admitted that she was scarcely to blame for the man made kindergarten gestures and emitted conversation like air from an exploded tire  the important thing was that he heard the man call her miss winslow  great got her nameruth winslow  watching the mans lips occasionally trying to find an excuse for eavesdropping and giving up the quest because there was no excuse he discovered that ruth was being honored with a thrilling account of aviation the talkingman it appeared knew a great deal about the subject carl heard through a rift in the cloud of words that the man had once actually flown as a passenger with henry odell for five minutes on end judging by the motions with which he steered a monoplane through perilous abysses the reckless spirit kept flying as a passenger ruth winslow was obviously getting bored and the man showed no signs of volplaning as yet olives man departed and olive was also listening to the parlor aviator who was unable to see that a terrific fight was being waged by the hands of the two girls in the space down between them it was won by ruths hand which got a deathgrip on olives thumb and held it to olives agony while both girls sat up straight and beamed propriety  carl walked over and smoothly ignoring the pocket entertainer said so glad to see you miss winslow i think this is my dance  yyes from miss winslow while the entertainer drifted off into the flotsam of the party olive went to join a group about the hostess who had just come in to stir up mirth and jocund merriment in the diningroom as it had settled down into a lower state of exhilaration than the canons of talkparties require  said carl to ruth not that theres any dancing but i felt youd get dizzy if you climbed any higher in that aeroplane  ruth tried to look haughty but her dark lashes went up and her unexpected blue eyes grinned at him boyishly  gee shes clever carl was thinking since to date her only remark had been yyes he may have been premature  that was a bully strangle hold you got on miss olives hand miss winslow  you saw our hands  perhaps tell me a good way to express how superior you and i are to this fool party and its noise isnt it a fool party  im afraid it really is  whats the purpose of it anyway do the people have to come here and breathe this air i wonder i asked several people that and im afraid they think im crazy  but you are here do you come to mrs salisburys often  never been before never seen a person here in my life beforeexcept you and miss olive came on a bet chap bet i wouldnt dare come without being invited i came bowed to the hostess and told her i was so sorry my playrehearsals made me late and she was so glad i could come after allyou know shes never seen me in her life  oh are you a dramatist  i wasin the other room but i was a doctor out in the hall and a sculptor on the stairs so im getting sort of confused myselfas confused as you are trying to remember who i am miss winslow you really dont remember me at all tea atwasnt it at the vanderbilt or the plaza  oh yes that must have beeni was trying to remember  carl grinned the chap who introduced me to you called me mr ummm because he didnt remember my name either so youve never heard it it happens to be ericson im on a mission serious one im planning to go out and buy a mediumsized bomb and blow up this bunch i suspect theres poets around  i do too sighed ruth i understand that mrs salisbury always has seven lawyers and nineteen advertising men and a dentist and a poet and an explorer at her affairs are you the poet or the explorer  im the dentist i thinkyou dont happen to have done any authoring do you  well nothing except an epic poyem on jonah and the whale which i wrote at the age of seven most of it consisted of a conversation between them while jonah was in the whales stomach which i think showed agility on the part of the whale  then maybe its safe to say what i think of authorsand more or less of poets and painters and so on one time i was in charge of some mechanical investigations and a lot of writers used to come around looking for what they called copy thats where i first got my grouch on them and ive never really got over it and coming here tonight and hearing the littery talk ive been thinking how these authors have a sort of an admiration trust they make authors the heroes of their stories and so on and so they make people think that writing is sacred im so sick of reading novels about how young bill as had a pure white soul came to new york and had an orrible time till his great novel was accepted authors seem to think theyre the only ones that have ideals now im in the automobile business and i help to make people get out into the countrybet a lot more of them get out because of motoring than because of reading poetry about spring but if i claimed a temperament because i introduce the motorists soul to the daisy every one would die laughing  but dont you think that art is theoh the object of civilization and that sort of thing  i do not honestly miss winslow i think it would be a good stunt to get along without any art at all for a generation and see what we miss we probably need dance music but i doubt if we need opera funny how the world always praises its operasingers so much and pays em so well and then starves its shoemakers and yet it needs good shoes so much more than it needs operaor war or fiction id like to see all the shoemakers get together and refuse to make any more shoes till people promised to write reviews about them like all these bookreviews then just as soon as peoples shoes began to wear out theyd come right around and youd read about the new masterpieces of mr regal and mr walkover and mr stetson  yes i can imagine it this laced boot is one of the most vital and gripping and wholesome shoes of the season and probably all the young shoemakers would sit around caf√©s looking quizzical and artistic but dont you think your theory is dangerous mr ericson you give me an excuse for being content with being a commonplace upperwestsider and arent authors better than commonplaceness youre so serious that i almost suspect you of having started to be an author yourself  really not as a matter of fact im the kiddy in patched overalls you used to play with when you kept house in the willows  oh of course in the forest of arden and you had a toad that you traded for my hairribbon  and we ate bread and milk out of blue bowls  oh yes she agreed blue bowls with bunnyrabbits painted on them  and giants and a sixcylinder castle with warders and a donjon keep and jack the giantkiller but certainly bunnies  do you really like bunnies her voice caressed the word  i like them so much that when i think of them i know that theres one thing worse than having a cutrate literary salon and thats to be too respectable  too upperwestside  to dare to eat bread and milk out of blue bowls  yes i think i shall have to admit you to the blue bowl league mr ericson speaking of whichtell me who did introduce us you and me i feel so apologetic for not remembering  maynt i be a mystery miss winslow at least as long as i have this new shirt which you observed with some approval while i was drooling on about authors it makes me look like a count you must admit or maybe like a knight of the order of the bunny rabbit please let me be a mystery still  yes you may life has no mysteries left except olives coiffure and your beautiful shirt does one talk about shirts at a second meeting  apparently one does  yes tonight i must have a mystery do you swear as a man of honor that you are at this party dishonorably uninvited  i do princess  well so am i olive was invited to come with a man but he was called away and she dragged me here promising me i should see  anarchists  yes and the only nice lovable crank ive foundexcept you with your vulgar prejudice against the whole race of authorsis a darkeyed female who sits on a couch out in the big room like a mrs st simeon stylites in a tight skirt and drags you in by her glittering eye looking as though she was going to speak about theosophy and then asks you if you think a highball would help her cold  i think i know the one you mean when i saw her she was talking to a man whose beating whiskers dashed high on a stern and rockbound face thank you i like that fairly well too but unfortunately i stole it from a chap named haviland my own idea of witty conversation is some car you got whats your magneto  look olive dunleavy seems distressed the number of questions i shall have to answer about you well olive and i felt very low in our minds today we decided that we were tired of select associations and that we would seek the primitive and maybe even life in the raw olive knows a woman mountainclimber who always says she longs to go back to the wilds so we went down to her flat we expected to have rawmeat sandwiches at the very least but the savage woman gave us suchong and deviledchicken sandwiches and pink cakes and nabiscos and told us how well her son was doing in his old french course at columbia so we got lower and lower in our minds and we decided we had to go down to chinatown for dinner we went too ive done a little settlement workdear me im telling you too much about myself o man of mystery it isnt quite done im afraid  please miss winslow in the name of thewhat was itorder of the blue bowl he was making a mental note that olives last name was dunleavy  well ive done some settlement workdid you ever do any by any chance  i once converted a chinaman to lutheranism i think that was my nearest approach said carl  my work was the kind where you go in and look at three dirty children and teach them that theyll be happy if theyre good when you know perfectly well that their only chance to be happy is to be bad as anything and sneak off to go swimming in the east river but it kept me from being very much afraid of the bowery we went down on the surface cars but olive was scared beautifully there was the dearest most inoffensive old man in the most perfect state of intoxication sitting next to us in the car and when olive moved away from him he winked over at me and said honor your shruples maam ver good form i think olive thought he was going to murder usshe was sure he was the wild dying remnant of a noble race or something but even she was disappointed in chinatown  we had expected opiumfiends like the melodramas they used to have on fourteenth street before the movies came but we had a disgustingly clean table with a mad reckless picture worked in silk showing two doves and a boiled lotos flower hanging near us to intimidate us the waiter was a harvard graduate i knowperhaps oxfordand he said may i sugges ladies velly nize china dinner he suggested chowmainwe thought it would be either birds nests or rats tails and it was simply crisp noodles with the most innocuous sauce and the people they were all stupid tourists like ourselves except for a jap with his cunnin sunday tie and his little trousers all so politely pressed and his clean pockethanky and he was reading the presbyterian then we came up here and it doesnt seem so very primitive here either its most aggravating it seems to me ive been telling you an incredible lot about our silly adventuresyoure probably the man who won the indianapolis motorrace or discovered electricity or something  through her narrative her eyes had held his but now she glanced about noted olive and seemed uneasy  im afraid im nothing so interesting he said but i have wanted to see new places and new thingsand ive more or less seen em when ive got tired of one town ive simply up and beat it and when i got therewherever there wasive looked for a job andwell i havent lost anything by it  have you really thats the most wonderful thing to do in the world my travels have been cooks tours with our own little thomas cook and son right in the familyive never even had the mad freedom of choosing between a tour of the irish bogs and an educational pilgrimage to the shrines of celebrated brewers my people have always chosen for me but ive wantedone doesnt merely go without having an objective or an excuse for going i suppose  i do declared carl butmay i be honest  yes  intimacy was about them they were two travelers from a far land come together in the midst of strangers  i speak of myself as globetrotting said carl i have been but for a good many weeks ive been here in new york knowing scarcely any one and restless yet i havent felt like hiking off because i was sick for a time and because a chap that was going to brazil with me died suddenly  to brazil exploring  yesjust a stab at it pure amateur im not at all sure im just makingbelieve when i speak of blue bowls and so on tell me in the west one would speak of seeing the girls home how would one say that gracefully in newyorkese so that i might have the chance to beguile miss olive dunleavy and miss ruth winslow into letting me see them home  really were not a bit afraid to go home alone  i wont tease butmay i come to your house for tea some time  she hesitated it came out with a rush yes do come up nnext sunday if youd like  she bobbed her head to olive and rose  and the address he insisted   west ninetysecond street good night i have enjoyed the blue bowl  carl made his decent devoirs to his hostess and tramped uptown through the flying snow swinging his stick like an orchestra conductor and whistling a waltz  as he reached home he thought again of his sordid parting with gertie in the parkyears ago that afternoon but the thought had to wait in the anteroom of his mind while he rejoiced over the fact that he was to see his new playmate the coming sunday     chapter xxix   like a country small boy waiting for the coming of his city cousin who will surely have new ways of playing indians carl prepared to see ruth winslow and her background what was she who where he pictured her as dwelling in everything from a millionaires imitation ch√¢teau with footmen and automatic elevators to a bachelor girls flat in an oldfashioned redbrick harlem tenement but more than that what would she herself be like against that background  monday he could think of nothing but the joy of having discovered a playmate the secret popped out from behind everything he did tuesday he was worried by finding himself unable to remember whether ruths hair was black or dark brown yet he could visualize olives ashblond why wednesday afternoon when he was sleepy in the office after eating too much beefsteak and kidney pie drinking too much coffee and smoking too many cigarettes at lunch with mr vanzile when he was tortured by the desire to lay his head on his arms and yield to drowsiness he was suddenly invaded by a fear that ruth was snobbish it seemed to him that he ought to do something about it immediately  the rest of the week he merely waited to see what sort of person the totally unknown miss ruth winslow might be his most active occupation outside the office was feeling guilty over not telephoning to gertie  at 330 pm sunday he was already incased in funereal morningclothes and warning himself that he must not arrive at miss winslows before five his clothes were new stiff as though they belonged to a wax dummy their lines were straight and without individuality he hitched his shoulders about and kept going to the mirror to inspect the fit of the collar he repeatedly re brushed his hair regarding the unclean state of his military brushes with disgust about six times he went to the window to see if it had started to snow  at ten minutes to four he sternly jerked on his coat and walked far north of ninetysecond street then back  he arrived at a quarter to five but persuaded himself that this was a smarter hour of arrival than five  ruth winslows home proved to be a rather ordinary threestoryandbasement gray stone dwelling with heavy russian net curtains at the broad clearglassed windows of the first floor and an attempt to escape from the stern drabness of the older type of new york houses by introducing a boxstoop and steps with a carved stone balustrade at the top of which perched a meek old lion of 1890 with battered ears and a truly sensitive stone nose a typical house of the very welltodo yet not wealthy upper middle class a house predicating one motorcar three not expensive maids brief european tours and the best preparatory schools and colleges for the sons  a maid answered the door and took his carda maid in a frilly apron and black uniformneither a butler nor a slatternly biddy in the hall as the maid disappeared upstairs carl had an impression of furnace heat and respectability rather shy uncomfortable anxious to be acceptable warning himself that as a famous aviator he need not be in awe of any one but finding that the warning did not completely take he drew off his coat and gloves and after a swift inspection of his tie gazed about with more curiosity than he had ever given to any other house  for all the stone lion in front this was quite the oldline englishbasement house with the inevitable front and back parlorsthough here they were modified into drawingroom and diningroom the walls of the hall were decked with elaborate meaningless scrolls in plaster basrelief echoed by raised circles on the ceiling just above the hanging chandelier which was expensive and hideous a clutter of brass and knobby redandblue glass the floor was of hardwood in squares dark and richly polished highly selfrespectinga floor that assumed civic responsibility from a republican point of view and a sound conservative business established since 1875 or 1880 by the door was a huge japanese vase convenient either for depositing umbrellas or falling over in the dark then a long mirror in a dullred mahogany frame and a table of mahogany so refined that no one would ever dream of using it for anything more useful than callingcards it might have been the table by the kings bed on which he leaves his crown on a little purple cushion at night solid and ostentatious  the drawingroom to the left was dark and still and unsympathetic and expensive a vista of brocadecovered frenchgilt chairs and a marquetry table and a table of onyx top on which was one book bound in ooze calf and one vase creamcolored heavy carpet and a crystal chandelier fairly meretricious paintings of rocks and thatched cottages and ragged newsboys with faces like daniel webster all of them in large gilt frames protected by shadowboxes in a corner was a cabinet of gilt and glass filled with dresdenchina figurines and toy tables and a carven swiss musical powderbox the fireplace was of smooth chilly white marble with an ormolu clock on the mantelpiece and a firescreen painted with watteau shepherds and shepherdesses making silken unreal love and scandalously neglecting silky unreal sheep by the hearth were shiny fireirons which looked as though they had never been used the whole room looked as though it had never been usedexcept during the formal calls of overdressed matrons with cardcases and prejudices the one human piece of furniture in the room a couch soft and slightly worn on which lovers might have sat and small boys bounced was trying to appear useless too under its row of stiff satin cushions with gold cords welldusted chairs on which no one wished to sit expensive fireplace that never shone prized pictures with less imagination than the engravings on a bondthat drawingroom had the soul of a banker with sidewhiskers  carl by no means catalogued all the details but he did get the effect of ingrowing propriety it is not certain that he thought the room in bad taste it is not certain that he had any artistic taste whatever or that his attack upon the pretensions of authors had been based on anything more fundamental than a personal irritation due to having met blatant campfollowers of the arts and it is certain that one of his reactions as he surveyed the abject respectability of that room was a slight awe of the solidity of social position which it represented and which he consciously lacked but whether from artistic instinct or from ignorance he was sure that into the room ought to blow a sudden great wind with the scent of forest and snow he shook his head when the maid returned and he followed her upstairs surely a girl reared here would never run away and play with him  he heard lively voices from the library above he entered a room to be lived in and be happy in with a jolly fire on the hearth and friendly people on a big brown davenport ruth winslow smiled at him from behind the colonial silver and thin cups on the teatable and as he saw her lightfilled eyes saw her cock her head gaily in welcome he was again convinced that he had found a playmate  a sensation of being pleasantly accepted warmed him as she cried so glad and introduced him gave him tea and a cake with nuts in it from a wingchair carl searched the room and the people there were two paintingsa pale night sea and an arching japanese bridge under slanting rain both imaginative and welldone there was a mahogany escritoire which might have been stiff but was made human by scattered papers on the great blotter and books crammed into the shelves other books were heaped on a table as though people had been reading them later he found how amazingly they were assortedthe latest novel of robert chambers beside h g wellss first and last things a dusty expensive book on italian sculpture near a cheap reprint of dodo  the chairs were capacious the piano a workmanlike upright not dominating the room but ready for music and in front of the fire was an english setter an aristocrat of a dog with the light glittering in his slowly waving tail the people fitted into the easy life of the room they were newyorkers and unlike over half of the population born there considering new york a village where one knows everybody and remembers when fourteenth street was the shoppingcenter olive dunleavy was shinily present her ashblond hair in a new coiffure she was arguing with a man of tight morningclothes and a highbred face about the merits of parsifal which olive declared no one ever attended except as a matter of conscience  now georgie she said issa georgie you shall have your operaand you shall jolly well have it alone too olive was vivid about it all but carl saw that she was watching him and he was shy as he wondered what ruth had told her  olives brother philip dunleavy a clearfaced slender wellbathed boy of twentysix with too high a forehead with discontent in his face and in his thin voice carelessly welldressed in a softgray suit and an impressionistic tie was also inspecting carl while talking to a pretty commonplace finishingschoolfinished girl carl instantly disliked philip dunleavy and was afraid of his latent sarcasm  indeed carl felt more and more that beneath the friendliness with which he was greeted there was no real welcome as yet save possibly on the part of ruth he was taken on trial he was a mr ericson not any mr ericson in particular  ruth while she poured tea was laughing with a man and a girl carl himself was part of a hashgroupan older woman who seemed to know rome and paris better than new york and might be anything from a milliner to a mondaine a keenlooking youngster with tortoiseshell spectacles finally ruths elder brother mason j winslow jr a tall thin solemn intensely wellintentioned man of thirtyseven with a long cleanshaven face and a long narrow head whose growing baldness was always spoken of as a result of his hard work mason j winslow jr spoke hesitatingly worried over everything and stood for morality and good business he was rather dull in conversation rather kind in manner and accomplished solid things by unimaginatively sticking at them he didnt understand people who did not belong to a good club  carl contributed a few careful platitudes to a frivolous discussion of whether it would not be advisable to solve the womansuffrage question by taking the vote away from men and women both and conferring it on children mason winslow ambled to the big table for a cigarette and carl pursued him while they stood talking about the times are bad carl was spying upon ruth and the minute her current group wandered off to the davenport he made a dash at the teatable and got there before olives brother philip dunleavy who was obviously manoeuvering like himself philip gave him a covert who are you fellow glance took a cake and retired  from his wicker chair facing ruths carl said gloomily it isnt done  yes said ruth i know it but still some very smart people are doing it this season  but do you think the woman that writes what the man will wear in the theater programs would stand for it  not gravely considered ruth if there were black stitching on the dressglove yet there is some authority for frilled shirts  you think it might be considered then  i will not come between you and your haberdasher mr ericson  this is a foolish conversation but since you think the better classes do itgee its getting hard for me to keep up this kind of dolly dialogue what i wanted to do was to request you to give me concisely but fully a sketch of who is miss ruth winslow and save me from making any pet particular breaks and hereafter i warn you im going to talk like my cousin the carpetslipper model  name ruth winslow age between twenty and thirty father mason winslow manufacturing contractor for concrete brothers mason winslow jr whose poor dear head is getting somewhat bald as you observe and bobby winslow neerdoweel who is engaged in subverting discipline at medical school and who dances divinely my mother died three years ago i do nothing useful but i play a good game of bridge and possess a voice that those as know pronounce passable i have a speaking knowledge of french a reading knowledge of german and a singing knowledge of italian i am wearing an imported gown for which the house of winslow will probably never pay i live in this house and am episcopaliannot so much high church as highly infrequent church i regard the drawingroom downstairs as the worst example of latevictorian abominations in my knowledge but i shall probably never persuade father to change it because mason thinks it is sacred to the past my ambition in life is to be catty to the newport set after ive married an english diplomat with a divine mustache never having met such a personage outside of tatler and vogue i cant give you very many details regarding him oh yes of course hell have to play a marvelous game of polo and have a ch√¢teau in proven√ße and also a ranch in texas where i shall wear ridingbreeches and live next to nature and have a chinese cook in blue silk i think thats my whole history oh i forgot i play at the piano and am very ignorant and completely immersed in the worst traditions of the wealthy micks of the upper west side and i always pretend that i live here instead of on the upper east side because the air is better  what is this upper west side is it a state of mind  indeed it is not its a state of pocketbook the upper west side is composed entirely of people born in new york who want to be in society whatever that is and cant afford to live on fifth avenue you know everybody and went to school with everybody and played in the park with everybody and mostly your papa is in wholesale trade and haughty about people in retail you go to europe one summer and to the jersey coast the next all your clothes and parties and weddings and funerals might be described as elegant thats the upper west side now the dread truth about you do you know after the unscrupulous way in which you followed up a mere chance introduction at a tea somewhere i suspect you to be a wellbehaved young man who leads an entirely blameless life or else youd never dare to jump the fence and come and play in my back yard when all the other boys politely knock at the front door and get sent home  mewell im a wageslave of the vanzile motor people in charge of the touricar department age twentyeightalmost habits all bad no ill tell you im one of those stern silent men of granite you read about and only my man knows the human side of me because all the guys on wall street tremble in me presence  yes but then how can you belong to the blue bowl sodality  um yesive got it you must have read novels in which the stern silent man of granite has a secret tenderness in his heart and he keeps the band of the first cigar he ever smoked in a little safe in the wall and the first dollar he ever made in a framethats me  of course the cigar was given him by his flaxenhaired sweetheart back in jenkins corners and in the last chapter he goes back and marries her  not always i hope of what carl was thinking is not recorded well as a matter of fact ive been a fairly industrious young man of granite the last few months getting out the touricar  what is a touricar it sounds like an island inhabited by cannibals exports hemp and cocoanut see pink dot on the map nor by noreast of mogador  carl explained  im terribly interested said ruth but she made it sound as though she really was i think its so wonderful i want to go off tramping through the berkshires im so tired of going to the same old places  some time when youre quite sure im an estimable young y m c a man im going to try to persuade you to come out for a real tramp  she seemed to be considering the idea not seriously but  philip dunleavy eventuated  for some time philip had been showing signs of interest in ruth and carl now he sauntered to the table begged for another cup of tea said agreeable things in regard to putting orange marmalade in tea and calmly established himself ruth turned toward him  carl had fancied that there was for himself in ruths voice something more friendly in her infectious smile something more intimate than she had given the others but when she turned precisely the same cheery expression upon philip carl seemed to have lost something which he had trustingly treasured for years he was the more forlorn as olive dunleavy joined them and ruth philip and olive discussed the engagement of one mary meldon olive recalled miss meldon as she had been in school days at the convent of the sacred heart philip told of her flirtations at the old long beach hotel  the names of new york people whom they had always known the names of country clubsbaltusrol and meadow brook and peace waters the names of streets with a sharp differentiation between seventyfourth street and seventyfifth street durlands riding academy the rink of a monday morning and other souvenirs of a new york childhood the score of the last american polo team and the coming dancesthese things shut carl out as definitely as though he were a foreigner he was lonely he disliked phil dunleavys sarcastic references he wanted to run away  ruth seemed to realize that carl was shut out said she to phil dunleavy i wish you could have seen mr ericson save my life last sunday i had an experience  what was that asked the man whom olive called georgie joining the teatable set  the whole room listened as ruth recounted the trip to chinatown mrs salisburys party and the hero who had once been a passenger in an aeroplane  throughout she kept turning toward carl it seemed to reunite him to the company as she closed he said  the thing that amused me about the parlor aviator was his laying down the law that the atlantic will be crossed before the end of 1913 and his assumption that well all have aeroplanes in five years i know from my own business the automobile business about how much such prophecies are worth  dont you think the atlantic will be crossed soon asked the keenlooking man with the tortoiseshell spectacles  phil dunleavy broke in with an air of amused sophistication i think the parlor aviator was right really you know aviation is too difficult a subject for the layman to make any predictions abouteither what it can or cant do  oh yes admitted carl and the whole room breathed oh yes  dunleavy went on in his thin overbred insolent voice now i have it on good authority from a man whos a member of the aero club that next year will be the greatest year aviation has ever known and that the wrights have an aeroplane up their sleeve with which theyll cross the atlantic without a stop during the spring of 1914 at the very latest  thats unfortunate because the aviation game has gone up completely in this country except for hydroaeroplaning and military aviation and possibly it never will come back said carl a hint of pique in his voice  what is your authority for that phil turned a large bizarre ring round on his slender left little finger and the whole room waited testing this positivespoken outsider  well drawled carl i have fairly good authority walter macmonnies for instance and he is probably the best flier in the country today except for lincoln beachey  oh yes hes a good flier said phil contemptuously with a shadowy smile for ruth still hes no better than aaron solomons and he isnt half so great a flier as that chap with the same surname as your own hawk ericson whom i myself saw coming up the jersey coast when he won that big race to new york you see ive been following this aviation pretty closely  carl saw ruths head drop an inch and her eyes close to a slit as she inspected him with sudden surprise he knew that it had just occurred to her who he was their eyes exchanged understanding she does get things he thought and said lightly  well i honestly hate to take the money mr dunleavy but im in a position to know that macmonnies is a better flier today than ericson is be  but see here  because i happen to be hawk ericson  what a chump i am groaned the man in tortoiseshell spectacles of course i remember your picture now  phil was openmouthed ruth laughed the rest of the room gasped mason winslow long and bald was worrying over the question of how to receive aviators at tea  and carl was shy as a small boy caught stealing the jam     chapter xxx   at home early that evening carls doctorlandlord gave him the message that a miss gertrude cowles had called him up but had declined to leave a number the landlords look indicated that it was no fault of his if carl had friends who were such fools that they didnt leave their numbers carl got even with him by going out to the corner drugstore to telephone gertie instead of giving him a chance to listen  hello said gertie over the telephone oh hello carl i just called up to tell you adelaide is going to be here this evening and i thought perhaps you might like to come up if you havent anything better to do  carl did have something better to do he might have used the whole evening in being psychological about ruth and phil dunleavy and englishbasement houses with creamcolored drawingrooms but he went up to gerties  they were all theregertie and adelaide ray and his mother and miss greene an unidentified girl from minneapolis all playing parcheesi explaining that they thought it not quite proper to play cards on sunday but that parcheesi was different ray winked at carl as they said it  the general atmosphere was easy and livable carl found himself at home again adelaide told funny anecdotes about her school of domestic science and the chief teacher who wore her hair in a walnut on top of her head and interrupted a lecture on dietetics to chase a cockroach with a ruler  as the others began to disappear gertie said to carl dont go till i read you a letter from ben rusk i got yesterday lots of news from home joe jordan is engaged  they were left alone gertie glanced at him intimately he stiffened he knew that gertie was honest kindly with enough sense of display to catch the tricks of a new environment but to her matrimony would be the inevitable sequence of a friendship which ruth or olive could take easily pleasantly for its own sake and carl the young man just starting in business was unheroically afraid of matrimony  yet his stiffness of attitude disappeared when gertie had read the letter from joralemon and mused chin on hand dreamily melancholy i can just see them out sleighing sometimes i wish i was out there honest carl for all the sea and the hills here dont you wish sometimes it were august and you were out home camping on a wooded bluff over a lake  yes he cried ive been away so long now that i dont ever feel homesick for any particular part of the country but just the same i would like to see the lakes and i do miss the prairies sometimes oh i was reading something the other dayfellow was trying to define the different sorts of terrainhere it is cut it out of the paper he produced from among a bunch of pocketworn envelopes and memorandums a clipping hacked from a newspaper with a nailfile and read  the combat and mystery of the sea the uplift of the hills and their promise of wonder beyond the kindliness of late afternoon nestling in small fields or on ample barns where red clovertops and long grasses shine against the gray foundation stones and small boys seek for hidden entrances to this castle of the farm the deep holiness of the forest whose leaves are the stained glass of a cathedral to grave saints of the open all these i love but nowhere do i find content save on the midwestern prairie where the light of sky and plain drugs the senses where the sound of meadowlarks at dawn fulfils my desire for companionship and the easy creak of the buggy as we top rise after rise bespells me into an afternoon slumber which the nervous town shall never know  i cut the thing out because i was thinking that the prairies stretching out the way they do make me want to go on and on in an aeroplane or any old thing lord lord i guess before long ill have to be beating it againlike the guy in kipling that always got sick of reading the same page too long  oh but carl you dont mean to say youre going to give up your business when youre doing so well and aviation shows what you can do if you stick to a thing carl and not just wander around like you used to do we do want to see you succeed  his reply was rather weak well gee i guess ill succeed all right but i dont see much use of succeeding if you have to be stuck down in a greasy city street all your life  thats very true carl but do you appreciate the city have you ever been in the metropolitan museum of art or gone to a single symphony concert at carnegie hall  carl was convinced that gertie was a highly superior person that she was getting far more of the good of new york than he he would take her to a concert have her explain the significance of the music  it was never to occur sharply to him that though gertie referred frequently to concerts and pictures she showed no vast amount of knowledge about them she was a fixed fact in his mind had been for twenty years he could have a surface quarrel with her because he knew the fundamental things in her and with these he was sure no one could quarrel his thoughts of ruth and olive were delightful surprises his impression of gertie was stable as the rockies                                       carl wasnt sure whether upper west side young ladies could be persuaded to attend a theater party upon short acquaintance but he tried and arranged a party of ruth and olive and himself walter macmonnies in town on his way from africa to san diego charley forbes of the chronicle and for chaperon the cosmopolitan woman whom he had met at ruths and who proved to be a mrs tirrell a dismayingly smart dressmaker  when he called for ruth he expected such a gay girl as had poured tea he was awed to find her a grande dame in black velvet more dignified apparently inches taller and in a viceregally bad temper as they drove off she declared  sorry im in such a villainous temper i hadnt a single pair of decent white gloves and i tore some old black spanish lace on the gown i was going to wear and my entire family whom god unquestionably sent to be a trial to test me clustered about my door while i was dressing and bawled in queries about laundry and other horribly vulgar things  carl did not see much of the play he was watching ruths eyes listening to her whispered comments she declared that she was awed by the presence of two aviators and a newspaper man actually she was working working at bringing out macmonnies a shy broadshouldered inarticulate youth who supposed that he never had to talk  carl had planned to go to the ritz for aftertheater supper but ruth and olive persuaded him to take them to the caf√© of the rectors of that time for they said they had never been in a broadway caf√© and they wanted to see the famous actors with their makeups off  at the table carl carried ruth off in talk like a young lochinvar out of the middle west around them was the storm of highballs and brandy and club soda theatrical talk and a confused mass of cigarsmoke shirtfronts white shoulders and drab waiters yet here was a quiet refuge for the eternal force of life  carl was asking would you rather be a perfect lady and have blue bowls with bunnies on them for your very worst dissipation or be like your mountainclimbing woman and have anarchists for friends one day and be off hiking through the clouds the next  oh i dont know i know im terribly susceptible to the nice things of life but i do get tired of being nice especially when i have a bad temper as i had tonight im not at all imprisoned in a harem and as for social aspirations im a nobody but still i have been brought up to look at things that arent like the home life of our dear queen as impossible and im quite sure that father believes that poor people are poor because they are silly and dont try to be rich but ive been reading and ive madeto you it may seem silly to call it a discovery but to me its the greatest discovery ive ever made that people are just people all of themthat the little mousey clerk may be a hero and the hero may be a nobodythat the motorman that lets his beastly car spatter mud on my nice new velvet skirt may be exactly the same sort of person as the swain who commiserates with me in his cunnin harvard accent do you think that  i know it most of my life ive been working with men with dirty fingernails and the only difference between them and the men with clean nails is a nailcleaner and that costs just ten cents at the corner drugstore seriouslyi remember a cook i used to talk to on my way down to panama once  panama how id like to go there  and he had as much culture as anybody ive ever met  yes but generally do you find very muchoh courtesy and that sort of thing among mechanics as much as among what calls itself the better class  no i dont  you dont why i thoughtthe way you spoke  why blessed what in the world would be the use of their trying to climb if they already had all the rich have you cant be as gracious as the man thats got nothing else to do when youre about one jump ahead of the steamroller every second thats why they ought to take things if i were a union man i wouldnt trust all these writers and college men and so on that try to be sympathetic not for one minute they mean well but they cant get what it means to a real workman to have to be up at five every winter morning with no heat in the furnished housekeeping room or to have to see his woman sick because he cant afford a doctor  so they talked boy and girl wondering together what the world really is like  i want to find out what we can do with life she said surely its something more than working to get tired and then resting to go back to work but im confused about things she sighed my settlement worki went into it because i was bored but it did make me realize how many people are hungry and yet we just talk and talk and talkolive and i sit up half the night when she comes to my house and when were not talking about the new neglig√©es were making and the gorgeous teagowns were going to have when were married we rescue the poor and think were dreadfully advanced but does it do any good to just talkdear me i split that poor infinitive right down his middle  i dont know but i do know i dont want to be just stupidly satisfied and talking does keep me from that anyway see here miss winslow suppose some time i suggested that we become nice and earnest and take up socialism and single tax and thiswhat is itoh syndicalismand really studied them would you do it make each other study  love to  does dunleavy think much  she raised her eyebrows a bit but hesitated oh yesno i dont suppose he does or anyway mostly about the violin he played a lot when he was in yale  thus was carl encouraged to be fatuous and he said in a manner which quite dismissed phil dunleavy i dont believe hes very deep rather light id say  her eyebrows had ascended farther do you think so im sorry  why sorry  oh hes always been rather a friend of mine olive and phil and i rollerskated together at the age of eight  but  and i shall probablymarryphilsome day before long she turned abruptly to charley forbes with a question  lost already lost was the playmate a loss that disgusted him with life he beat his spirit cursed himself as a clumsy mechanic he listened to olive only by selfcompulsion it was minutes before he had the ability and the chance to say to ruth  forgive mein the name of the blue bowl mr dunleavy was rather rude to me and ive been just as rudeand to you and without his excuse for he naturally would want to protect you from a wild aviator coming from lord knows where  you are forgiven and phil was rude and youre not a lordknowswhere im sure  almost brusquely carl demanded come for a long tramp with me on the palisades next saturday if you can and if its a decent day you said you liked to run away and we can be back before dinner if you like  whylet me think it over oh i would like to ive always wanted to do just thatthink of it the palisades just opposite and i never see them except for a walk of half a mile or so when i stay with a friend of mine laura needham at winklehurst up on the palisades my mother never approved of a wilder wilderness than central park and the habitive never been able to get olive to explore but it isnt conventional to go on long tramps with even the nicest new johnnies is it  no but  i know youll say who makes the convention and of course theres no answer but they but they are so allpresent theyoh yes yes yes i will go but you will let me get back by dinnertime wont you will you call for me about two and can youi wonder if a hawk out of the windy skies can understand how daring a dove out of ninetysecond street feels at going walking on the palisades     chapter xxxi   the iron hudson flowed sullenly far below the iceenameled rock on the palisades where stood ruth and carl shivering in the abrupt wind that cut down the defile the scowling slatey river was filled with icefloes and chunks of floating waterdrenched snow that broke up into bobbing sheets of slush the sky was solid cold gray with no arch and no hint of the lost sun crows winging above them stood out against the sky like pencilmarks on clean paper the estates in upper new york city across the river were snowcloaked the trees chilly and naked the houses standing out as though they were freezing and longing for their summer wrap of ivy and naked were the rattling trees on their side of the river on the palisades but the cold breeze enlivened them the sternness of the swift cruel river and miles of brown shore made them gravely happy as they tramped briskly off atop the cliffs toward the ferry to new york five miles away they talked with a quiet quick seriousness which discovered them to each other it was too cold for conversational fencing it was too splendidly open for them not to rejoice in the freedom from new york streets and feel like heroes conquering the miles  carl was telling of joralemon of plato of his first flights before country fairs something of what it meant to be a newspaper hero and of his loneliness as a dethroned prince ruth dropped her defenses of a chaperoned young woman confessed that now that she had no mother to keep her mobilized and in the campaign to get nearer to society and a decent marriage she did not know exactly what she wanted to do with life she spoke tentatively of her vague settlement work in all she said she revealed an honesty as forthright as though she were a gaunteyed fanatic instead of a livelyvoiced girl in a blue corduroy jacket with collar and cuffs of civet and buttons from venice  then carl spoke of his religionthe memory of forrest haviland he had never really talked of him to any one save colonel haviland and titherington the english aviator but now this girl who had never seen forrest seemed to have known him for life carl made vivid by his earnestness the golden hours of work together in california the confidences in new york restaurants his long passion for their brazilian trip ruths eyes looked up at him with swift comprehension and there was a tear in them as he told in ten words of the message that forrest was dead  they turned gay ruths sturdy charming shoulders shrugging like a frenchmans with the exhilaration of fast walking and keen air while her voice light and cheerful with graceful modulations and the singers freedom from twang rejoiced  im so glad we came im so glad we came but im afraid of the wild beasts i see in the woods there they have no right to have twilight so early i know a big newspaper man who lives at pompton n j and im going to ask him to write to the governor about it the legislature ought to pass a law that dusk shant come till seven saturday afternoons do you know how glad i am that you made me come and how honored i am to have you tell melieutenant havilandand the very bad carl that lived in joralemon  itsim gladsay gee well have to hurry like the dickens if were going to catch a ferry in time to get you home for dinner  i have an idea i wonder if we darei have a friend sort of a distant cousin who married her a husband at winklehurst on the palisades not very far from the ferry i wonder if we couldnt make her invite us both for dinner of course shell want to know all about you but well be mysterious and that will make it all the more fun dont you think i do want to prolong our jaunt you see  i cant think of anything id rather do but do you dare impose a perfectly strange man on her  oh yes i know her so well that shes told me what kind of a tie her husband had on when he proposed  lets do it  a telephone theres some shops ahead there in that settlement ought to be a telephone there ill make her give us a good dinner if laura thinks shell get away with hash and a custard with a red cherry in it shed better undeceive herself  they entered a tiny wayside shop for the sale of candy and padlocks and mittens while ruth telephoned to her friend mrs laura needham carl bought redandblue and lemoncolored allday suckers and a sugar mouse and a candy kitten with green ears and real whiskers he could not but hear ruth telephoning and they grinned at each other like conspirators her eyelids in little wrinkles as she tried to look wicked her voice amazingly innocent as she talked carl carefully arraying his purchases before her making the candy kitten pursue the sugar mouse round and round the telephone  hello hello is mrs needham there hello oh hello laura dear this is ruth i fine i feel fine but chillery listen laura ive been taking a tramp along the palisades am i invited to dinner with a swain what oh yes i am certainly im invited to dinner well my dear go in town by all means with my blessing but that shant prevent you from having the opportunity to enjoy being hospitable i dont know what ferry do you catch the 720 nno i dont think we can get there till after that so you can go right ahead and have the biddy get ready for us all right that is good of you dear to force the invitation on me she flushed as her eyes met carls she continued but seriously will it be too much of a tax on the biddy if we do come were drefful cold and its a long crool way to town thank you dear it shall be returned unto youafter not too many days what who oh a man why yes it might be but id be twice as likely to go tramping with olive as with phil no it isnt oh as usual hes getting to be quite a dancingman well if you must knowoh i cant give you his name hes she glanced at carl appraisingly hes about five feet tall and he has a long french shovel beard and a lovely red nose and hes listening to me describe him  carl made the kitten chase the mouse furiously  perhaps ill tell you about him some time goodby laura dear  she turned to carl rubbing her cold ear where the telephonereceiver had pressed against it and caroled her husband is held late at the office and laura is going to meet him in town and theyre going to the theater so well have the house all to ourselves exciting she swung round to telephone home that she would not be there for dinner  as they left the shop went over a couple of blocks for the winklehurst trolley and boarded it carl did some swift thinking he was not above flirting or if the opportunity offered carrying the flirtation to the most delicious exciting uncertain lengths he could here with dinner in their own house with a girl interesting yet unknown there was a feeling of sudden intimacy which might mean anything onlywhen their joined eyes had pledged mischief while she telephoned she had been so quiet so frank so evidently free from a shamefaced erotic curiosity that now he instantly dismissed the query how far could i go what does she expect which outside of pureminded romances really does come to men it was a wonderful relief to dismiss the query a simplification to live in the joy each moment gave of itself the hour was like a poem yet he was no extraordinary person he had in the lonely hours of a dead room been tortured with the unmoral longings which good or bad men do feel  as they took their seats in the car and ruth beat on her knees with her furlined gloves he laughed back altogether happy not pretending as he had pretended with eve lewysse  happy but hungry  mrs needham should have been graciously absent by the time they reached her housea suburban residence with a large porch but as they approached ruth cried  shhhh there seems to be somebody moving around in the living room i dont believe laura s gone yet that would spoil it come on lets peep lets be indian scouts  cautioning each other with warning pats they tiptoed guiltily to the side of the house and peered in at the diningroom window where the shade was raised a couple of inches above the sill a noise at the back of the house made them start and flatten against the wall  big chief whispered carl the redskins are upon us but old brown barrel shall make many an one bite the dust  hush silly oh its just the maid see shes looking at the clock and wondering why we dont get here  but maybe mrs needham s in the other room  no because the maids sniffing aroundthere shes reading a postcard some one left on the sidetable oh yes and shes chewing gum laura has certainly departed probably laura is chewing gum herself at the present moment now that shes out from under the eye of her maid laura always was reefined but i wouldnt trust her to be proof against the feeling of wild dissipation you can get out of chewing gum if you live in winklehurst  they had rung the doorbell on the porch by now  im so glad said ruth that laura is gone she is very literalminded she might not understand that we could be hastily married and even lease a house this way and still be only tea acquaintances  the maid had not yet answered waiting in the still porch winter everywhere beyond it carl was all excited anticipation he hastily pressed her hand and she lightly returned the pressure laughing breathing quickly they started like convicted lovers as the maid opened the door the consciousness of their starting made them the more embarrassed and they stammered before the maid ruth fled upstairs while carl tried to walk up gravely though he was tingling with the game  when he had washed discovering as every one newly discovers after every long chilly walk that water from the cold tap feels amazingly warm on hands congealed by the tramp and was loitering in the upper hall ruth called to him from mrs needhams room  i think youll find hairbrushes and things in jacks room to the right oh i am very stupid i forgot this was our house i mean in your room of course  he had a glimpse of her twisting up a strand of naturally wavy brown hair a silverbacked hairbrush bright against it her cheeks flushed to an even crimson her blue corduroy jacket off and warmly intimate in its stead a blouse of blue satin opening in a shallow triangle at her throat with a tender bigbrotherliness he sought the room that was his not jacks no longer was this the house of other people but one in which he belonged  no he heard himself explain she isnt beautiful istra nash was nearer that but golly she is such a good pal and she is beautiful if an english lane is oh stop rambling if i could kiss that little honey place at the base of her throat  yes miss winslow coming am i ready for dinner watch me  she confided as he came out into the hall isnt it terribly confusing to have our home and even three tobychildren all readymade for us this way  her glanceeyes that always startled him with blue where darkbrown was expected even teeth showing head cocked sidelong cheeks burning with fire of december snowher glance and all her manner trusted him the outlaw it was not as an outsider but as her comrade that he answered  golly have we a family too i always forget so sorry but you knowget so busy at the office  why i think we have one ill go look in the nursery and make sure but im almost positive  no ill take your word for it youre around the house more than i am but oh say speaking of that that reminds me woman if you think that im going to buy you a washingmachine this year when ive already bought you a napkinring and a portrait of martha washington  oh weh i knew i should have a cruel husband whojoy i think the maid is prowling about and trying to listen shhh the story laura will get out of her  while the maid served dinner there could scarce have been a more severely correct pair though carl did step on her toe when she was saying to the maid in her best offhand manner oh leah will you please tell mrs needham that i stole a handkerchief from myi mean from her room  but when the maid had been unable to find any more imaginary crumbs to brush off the table and had left them alone with their hearts and the dessert a most rowdy young married couple quarreled violently over the washingmachine he still refused to buy for her  carl insisted that as suburbanites they had to play cards and he taught her pinochle which he had learned from the bartender of the bowery saloon but the cards dropped from their fingers and they sat before the gaslog in the livingroom in a lazy perfect happiness when she said  all the while weve been playing cardsand playing the still more dangerous game of being marriedive been thinking how glad i am to know about your life somehowi wonder if you have told so very many  practically no one  i doim really not fishing for compliments but i do want to be found understanding  theres never been any one so understanding  silent then carl glanced about the modern room ruths eyes followed she nodded as he said  but its really an old farmhouse out in the hills where the snow is deep and theres logs in the fireplace  yes and rag carpets  and oh ruth listen a bobsled withgolly i suppose it is a little premature to call you ruth but after our being married all evening i dont see how i can call you miss winslow  no im afraid it would scarcely be proper under the circumstances then i must be mrs ericson ooh it makes me think of norse galleys and northern seas of courseyour galley was the aeroplane mrs eric her voice ran down she flushed and said defensively what time is it i think we must be starting i telephoned i would be home by ten her tone was conventional as her words  but as they stood waiting for a trolleycar to the new york ferry on a street corner transformed by an arclight that swung in the wind and cast wavering films of radiance among the vague wintry trees of a woodlot ruth tucked her arm under his small beside his great ulster and sighed like a child  i am veree cold  he rubbed her hand protectingly her mouselike hand in its furlined glove his canny selfdefensive scotchlike norse soul opened its gates he knew a longing to give a passion to protect her a whelming desire to have shy secrets with this slim girl all the poetry in the world sounded its silver harps within him because his eyes were opened and it was given to him to see her face gently he said  yes its cold and theres big gray ghosts hiding there in the trees with their leathery wings that were made out of seafog by the witches folded in front of them and theyre glumming at us over the bony knobly joints on top their wings with big round platter eyes and the wind is calling usits trying to snatch us out on the arctic snowfields to freeze us but ill fight them all off i wont let them take you ruth  im sure you wont carl  andohyou wont let phil dunleavy keep you from running away not for a while yet  mmaybe not  the sky had cleared she tilted up her chin and adored the starsstars like the hard cold fighting sparks that fly from a trolleywire carl looked down fondly noting how fairskinned was her forehead in contrast to her thick dark brows as the arclights brilliance rested on her worshiping faceher lips atremble and slightly parted she raised her arms her fingers widespread praising the stargods she cried only oh all this but it was a prayer to a greater god pan shaking his snowincrusted beard to the roar of northern music to carl her cry seemed to pledge faith in the starred sky and the long trail and a glorious restlessness that by a dead fireplace of white smooth marble would never find content  like swordpoints those stars are he said then  then they heard the trolleycars flat wheels grinding on a curve its searchlight changed the shadowhaunted woodland to a sad group of scanty trees huddling in front of an old billboard with its top broken and the tattered posters flapping the wanderers stepped from the mystical romance of the open night into the exceeding realism of the carhighly realistic wooden floor with small muddy pools from lumps of dirty melting snow hot air a smell of italian workmen a german conductor with the sniffles a row of shoes mostly wet and all wrinkled they had to stand most realistic of all they read the glossy carsigns advertising soap and little cigars and the enterprising local advertisement of wm p smith  sons all northern new jersey real estate cheaper than rent so instantly the children of the night turned into two sophisticated young newyorkers who apologizing for freshair yawns talked of the theatrical season  but for a moment a strange look of distance dwelt in ruths eyes and she said i wonder what i can do with the winter stars weve found will ninetysecond street be big enough for them     chapter xxxii   for a weekthe week before christmascarl had seen neither ruth nor gertie but of the office he had seen too much they were rushing work on the touricar to have it on the market early in 1913 every afternoon or evening he left the office with his tongue scaly from too much nervous smoking poked dully about the streets not much desiring to go any place nor to watch the crowds after all the curiosity had been drawn out of him by hours of work several times he went to a supermovie a cinema palace on broadway above seventysecond street with an entrance in new york colonial architecture and crowds of welltodo jewish girls in operacloaks  on the two bright mornings of the week he wanted to play truant from the office to be off with ruth over the hills and far away both mornings there came to him a picture of gertie wanting to slip out and play like ruth but having no chance he felt guilty because he had never bidden gertie come tramping and guiltily he recalled that it was with her that the boy carl had gone to seekourfortunes he told himself that he had been depending upon gertie for the breadandbutter of friendship and begging for the opportunity to give the stranger ruth winslow dainties of which she already had too much  when he called sunday evening he found gertie alone reading a lovestory in a womans magazine  im so glad you came she said i was getting quite lonely she was as gratefully casual as ever  say gertie ive got a plan wouldnt you like to go for some good long hikes in the country  oh yes that would be fine when spring comes  no i mean now in the winter  she looked at him heavily why isnt it pretty cold dont you think  he prepared to argue but he did not think of her as looking heavily he did not draw swift comparisons between gerties immobility and ruths lightness he was used to gertie was in her presence comfortably understanding and understood could find whatever he expected in her as easily as one finds the editorial pageor the sporting pagein a familiar newspaper he merely became mildly contentious and made questioning noises in his throat as she went on  you know it is pretty cold here they can say all they want to about the cold and all that out in minnesota but really the humidity  rats it isnt so very cold not if you walk fast  well maybe anyway i guess it would be nice to explore some  all right lets  i do think people are so conventional dont you said gertie while carl discerningly stole one of rays best cigars out of the humidor awfully conventional not going out for good long walks dorothy gibbons and i did find the nicest place to walk up in bronx park and theres such a dear little restaurant right on the water of course the water was frozen but it seemed quite wild you know for new york we might take that walk whenever youd like to  ohbronx parkgee gertie i cant get up much excitement over that i want to get away from this tame city and forget all about offices and parks and people and everything like that  nnnnow she clucked in a patronizing way we mustnt ask new york to give us wilderness you know im afraid that would be a little too much to ask of it dont you think so yourself  carl groaned to himself i wont be mothered  he was silent his silence was positively noisy he wanted her to hear it but it is difficult to be sulky with a bland plump woman of thirty who remembers your childhood trick of biting your nails and glances up at you from her embroidery occasionally patting her brown silk hair or smoothing her brown silk waist in a way which implies a good digestion a perfect memory of the mornings lesson of her sundayschool class and a mild disbelief in men as anything except relatives providers cardplayers and nurslings carl gave up the silencecure  he hummed about the room running over the advertising pages of magazines discussing plato fraternities and waiting till it should be time to go home their conversation kept returning to the fraternities there wasnt much else to talk about before tonight they had done complete justice to all other topicsjoralemon bennie rusk joe jordans engagement adelaide benner and symphony concerts gertie embroidered patted her hair smoothed her waist looked cheerful rocked and spoke embroidered patted her hair smoothed her sleeve looked amiable rocked and spokeembroidered pat  at a quarter to ten carl gave himself permission to go said he ill have to get on the job pretty early tomorrow not much taking it easy here in new york the way you can in joralemon eh so i guess id better  im sorry you have to go so early gertie carefully stuck her embroidery needle into her doily rolled up the doily meticulously laid it down on the centertable straightened the pile of magazines which carl had deranged and rose but im glad you could drop up this evening come up any time you havent anything better to do ohwhat about our tramp if you know some place that is better than bronx park we might try it  whyuhyeswhy sure well have to some time  and carl youre coming up to have your christmas turkey with us arent you  id like to a lot but darn it ive accepted nother invitation  that was absolutely untrue and carl was wondering why he had lied when the storm broke  gerties right arm affectedly held out from the elbow the hand drooping in the attitude of a refined hostess saying goodby dropped stiffly to her side slowly she thrust out both arms shoulderhigh on either side with her fists clenched her head back and slightly on one side her lips open in agonythe position of crucifixion her eyes looked up unseeing then closed tight she drew a long breath like a sigh that was too weary for sound and her plump placid left hand clutched her panting breast while her right arm dropped again all the passion of tragedy seemed to shriek in her hopeless gesture and her silence was a wail muffled and despairing  carl stared twisting his watchchain with nervous fingers wanting to flee  it was raw woman with all the proprieties of joralemon and st orguls cut away who spoke her voice constantly rising  oh carlcarl oh why why why oh why dont you want me to go walking with you now why dont you want to go anywhere with me any more have i displeased you oh i didnt mean to why do i bore you so  ohgertieohgeethunder whimpered a dismayed youth a more mature hawk ericson struggled to life and soothed her gertie honey i didnt meanlisten  but she moaned on standing rigid her left hand on her breast her eyes red moist frightened fixed we always played together and i thought here in the city we could be such good friends with all the different new things to do togetherwhy i wanted us to go to chinatown and theaters and i would have been so glad to pay my share ive just been waiting and hoping you would ask me and i wanted us to play and seeoh so many different new things togetherit would have been so sweet so sweetwe were good friends at first and then youyou didnt want to come here any more andoh i couldnt help seeing it more and more and more and more ive been seeing it but i didnt want to see it but now i cant fool myself any more i was so lonely till you came tonight and when you spoke about trampingand then it seemed like you just went away from me again  why gertie you didnt seem  and long ago i really saw it the day we walked in the park and i was wicked about trying to make you call me eltrudaoh carl dear indeed you neednt call me that or anything you dont likeand i tried to make you say i had a temperament and about adelaide and all and you went away and i thought you would come back to me that eveningoh i wanted you to come so much and you didnt even phoneand i waited up till after midnight hoping you would phone i kept thinking surely you would and you never did you never did and i listened and listened for the phone to ring and every time there was a noisebut it never was you it never rang at all  she dropped back in the morris chair her eyes against the cushion her hair disordered both her hands gripping the left arm of the chair her sobs throatcatching and longthrobthrobthrob in the deathstill air  carl stared at her praying for a chance to escape then he felt an instinct prompting him to sob with her pity embarrassment disgust mingled with his alarm he became amazed that gertie easygoing gertie cowles had any passion at all and indignant that it was visited upon himself  but he had to help he moved to her chair and squatting boyishly on its arm stroked her hair begging gertie gertie i did mean to come up that night indeed i did honey i would have come up but i met some friendscouldnt break away from them all evening a chill ran between his shoulderblades it was a shock to the pride he took in ruths existence the evening in question had found ruth for him it seemed as though gertie had dared with shrewish shrillness to intrude upon his beautiful hour but pity came to him again stroking her hair he went urgently on dont you see why blessed i wouldnt hurt you for anything just tonightwhy you remember first thing i wanted us to plan for some walks reason i didnt say more about it was i didnt know as youd want to much why gertie anybody would be proud to play with you you know so much about concerts and all sorts of stuff anybodyd be proud to he wound up with a fictitious cheerfulness well have some good long hikes together heh its better now isnt it kiddy youre just tired tonight has something been worrying you tell old carl all about  she wiped her tears away with the adorable gesture of a child trying to be good and like a childs was her glance bewildered hurt yet trusting as she said in a small shy voice would folks really be proud to play with me we did use to have some dear times didnt we do you remember how we found some fools gold and we thought it was gold and hid it on the shore of the lake and we were going to buy a ship do you remember you havent forgotten all our good times while youve been so famous have you  oh no no  but why dontcarl why dont youwhy cant you care more now  why i do care youre one of the bulliest pals i have you and ray  and ray  she flung his hand away and sat bolt up angry  carl retired to a chair beside the morris chair fidgeting can you beat it is this gertie and me he inquired in a parenthesis in his heart for a second as she stared haughtily at him he spitefully recalled the fact that gertie had once discarded him for a gleeclub dentist but he submerged the thought and listened with a rather forced bigbrother air as she repented of her anger and went on  carl dont you understand how hard it is for a woman to forget her pride this way the hauteur of being one of the √©lite of joralemon again flashed out maybe if youll think real hard youll remember i used to could get you to be so kind and talk to me without having to beg you so hard why id been to new york and known the nicest people before youd ever stirred a foot out of joralemon you wereoh please forgive me carl i didnt mean to be snippy i just dont know what to think of myselfand i did used to think i was a lady and here i am practically up and telling you and  she leaned from her chair toward his and took his hand touching it finding its hard bony places and the delicate white hollows of flesh between his coarsened yet shapely fingers tracing a scarceseen vein on the back exploring a wellbeloved yet illknown country carl was unspeakably disconcerted he was thinking that to him gertie was set aside from the number of women who could appeal physically quite as positively as though she were some old aunt who had for twenty years seemed to be the same adult plump uninteresting age gerties solid flesh the monotony of her voice the unimaginative fixity of her round cheeks a certain increasing slackness about her waist even the faint stuffy domestic scent of herthey all expressed to him her lack of humor and fancy and venturesomeness she was crystallized in his mind as a good friend with a plain soul and sisterly tendencies awkwardly he said  you mustnt talk like that gee gertie well be in a regular scene if you dont watch out were just good friends and you can always bank on me same as i would on you  but why must we be just friends  he wanted to be rude but he was patient mechanically stroking her hair again leaning forward most uncomfortably from his chair he stammered oh ive beenoh you know ive wandered around so much that its kind of put me out of touch with even my best friends and i dont know where im at i couldnt make any alliancesgee that sounds affected i mean ive got to sort of start in now all over finding where im at  but why must we be just friends then  listen child its hard to tell i guess i didnt know till now what it does mean but theres a girlwait listen theres a girlat first i simply thought it was good fun to know her but now lord gertie youd think i was pretty sentimental if i told you what i think of her god i want to see her so much right now i havent let myself know how much i wanted her shes everything shes sister and chum and wife and everything  itsbut i am glad for you will you believe that and perhaps you understand how i felt now im very sorry i let myself go i hope you willoh please go now  he sprang up only too ready to go but first he kissed her hand with a courtly reverence and said with a sweetness new to him dear will you forgive me if ive ever hurt you and will you believe how very very much i honor you and when i see you again there wont bewell both forget all about tonight wont we well just be the old carl and gertie again tell me to come when  yes i will goodnight  good night gertie god bless you                                       he never remembered where he walked that night when he had left gertie the exercise the chill of the night gradually set his numbed mind working again but it dwelt with ruth not with gertie now that he had given words to his longing for ruth to his pride in her he understood that he had passed the hidden border of that misty land called being in love which cartographers have variously described as a fruitful tract of comfortable harvests as a labyrinth with walls of rose and silver and as a tenebrous realm of unhappy ghosts  he stopped at a street corner where above a saloon with a large beersign stretched dim tenement windows toward a dirty sky and on that drab corner glowed for a moment the mystic light of the rose of all the worldbefore a tammany saloon chin high yearning toward a girl somewhere off to the south carl poignantly recalled how ruth had worshiped the stars his soul soared lark and hawk in one triumphant over the matteroffactness of daily life carl ericson the mechanic standing in front of a saloon with a laundry to one side and a cigarsandstationery shop round the corner was one with the young priest saying mass one with the suffragist woman defying a jeering mob one with ruth winslow listening to the ringing stars  godhelpmetobeworthyofher  nothing more did he say in words yet he was changed for ever  changed true that when he got home half an hour later and in the dark ran his nose against an opened door he said damn it very naturally true that on monday back in the office that awaits its victims equally after sundays golden or dreary he forgot ruths existence for hours at a time true that at lunch with two vanzile automobile salesmen he ate wiener schnitzel and shot dice for cigars with no signs of a mystic change it is even true that dining at the brevoort with charley forbes he though of istra nash and for a minute was lonely for istras artistic dissipation yet the change was there     chapter xxxiii   from titherington the aviator in his devonshire home from a millionaire amateur flier among the orangegroves at pasadena from his carpenter father in joralemon and from gertie in new york carl had invitations for christmas but none that he could accept vanzile had said pleasantly going out to the country for christmas  yes cal had lied  again he saw himself as the dethroned prince and remembered that one year ago sailing for south america to fly with tony bean he had been the lion at a christmas party on shipboard while martin dockerill his mechanic had been a friendly slave  he spent most of christmas eve alone in his room turning over old letters and aviation magazines with pictures of hawk ericson wondering whether he might not go back to that lost world josiah bagby jr son of the eccentric doctor at whose school carl had learned to fly was experimenting with hydroaeroplanes and with bombdropping devices at palm beach and imploring carl as the steadiest pilot in america to join him the dully noiseless room echoed the music of a steady motor carrying him out over a blue bay carls own answer to the tempter vision was rats i cant very well leave the touricar now and i dont know as ive got my flying nerve back yet besides ruth  always he thought of ruth uneasy with the desire to be out dancing laughing playing with her he was tormented by a question he had been threshing out for days might he permissibly have sent her a christmas present  he went to bed at ten oclockon christmas eve when the streets were surging with voices and gay steps when rollicking pianotunes from across the street penetrated even closed windows and a german voice as rich as milk chocolate was caressing oh tannenbaum oh tannenbaum wie gr√ºn sind deine bl√§tter then slept for nine hours woke with rapturous remembrance that he didnt have to go to the office and sang the banks of the saskatchewan in his bath when he returned to the house after breakfast he found a letter from ruth      the day before xmas  all thru the mansion     the maids with turkey are stirringplease pardon the scansion       dear playmateyou said on our tramp that i would make a      good playmate but im sure that i should be a very poor one      if i did not wish you a gloriously merry xmas  a new year      that will bring you all the dear things you want i shall be      glad if you do not get this letter on xmas day itself if      that means that you are off at some charming country house      having a most katische is that the way it is spelled      probably not time but if by any chance you are in town      wont you make your playmates shout to you from her back      yard a part of your xmas she feels shy about sending this      effusive greeting with all its characteristic sloppiness of      writing but she does want you to have a welcome to xmas      fun  wont you please give the touricar a pair of warm      little slippers from  ruth gaylord winslow       ps mrs tirrell has sent me an angel miniature jap garden      with a tiny pergola  real dwarf trees  a bridge that you      expect an alfred noyes lantern on  oh carl an issa      goldfish in a pool  miss r winslow  all the dear things i want carl repeated standing tranced in the hall oblivious of the doctorlandlord snooping at the back ruth blessed do you know the thing i want most say great ill hustle out and send her all the flowers in the world or no ive got it he was already out of the house hastening toward the subway ill send her one of these lingerie teabaskets with all kinds of baby pots of preserves and teaballs and stuff wonder what dunleavy sent her rats i dont care jiminy im happy me to palm beach to fly not a chance  he had christmas dinner in state with the california exiles club he was craftily careless about the manner in which he touched a letter in his pocket for gloves which tailors have been inspired to put on the left side of dressclothes                                       twice carl called at ruths in the two weeks after christmas once she declared that she was tired of modern life that socialism and agnosticism shocked her that the world needed the courtly stiffness of midvictorian days as so ably depicted in the works of mrs florence barclayneeded haircloth as a scourge for white tangodancing backs as for her ruth announced she was going to be midvictorian just as soon as she could find a hairlocket silk mitts and an elderly female tortoiseshell cat with an instinctive sense of delicacy she sat boltupright on the front of the most impersonal frenchgilt chair in the drawingroom and asserted that phil dunleavy with his safe ancestry of two generations of wholesalers and strong probabilities about the respectability of still another generation was her ideal of a christian gentleman she wore a full white muslin gown with a blue sash her hair primly parted in the middle her right hand laid flat over her left in her lap her vocabulary was choice for a second when she referred to winter sports at lake placid she forgot herself and tucked one smooth silkclad unmidvictorian leg under her but instantly she recovered her poise of a vicarage remarking i have been subject to very careless influences lately she called him neither carl nor mr ericson nor anything else and he dared not venture on ruth  he went home in bewilderment as he crossed broadway he loitered insolently as though challenging the flying squadron of taxicabs to run him down what do i care if they hit me he inquired savagely of his sympathetic and applauding self every word she had said he examined finding double and triple meanings warning himself not to regard her mood seriously but unable to make the warning take  on his next call there was a lively ruth who invited him up to the library read extracts from stephen leacocks nonsense novels turned companionably serious and told him how divided were her sympathies between her fatherthe conscientiously worried employerand a group of strikers in his factory she made coffee in a fantastic percolator and played d√©bussy and ragtime at tenthirty the hour at which he had vehemently resolved to go they were curled in two big chairs eating chocolate peppermints and talking of themselves apropos of astronomy and the touricar and lincoln beacheys daring and mason winslow and patriotism and joralemon ruths father drifted in from his club at a quarter to eleven carl now met him for the first time he was a largestomached bald sober friendly man with a gladstone collar a huge watchchain kindly trousers and painfully smart tan boots a father of the kind who gives cigars and noncommittal encouragement to daughters suitors                                       it takes a voice with personality and modulations to make a fifteenminute telephone conversation tolerable and youth to make it possible ruth had both for fifteen minutes she discussed with carl the question of whether she should go to marion brownes dinnerdance at delmonicos as phil wished or go skeeing in the westchester hills as carl wished the coming saturdaythe first saturday in february 1913 carl won                                       they arrived at a station in the bedford hills bearing long carvedprowed norwegian skees which seemed to hypnotize the other passengers to carls joy for he associated that suit with the palisades and their discovery of each other ruth was in her blue corduroy with highlace boots and a gray sweater jacket of silky wool carl displayed a tweed norfolk jacket a great sweater and mittens unabashed he had a mysterious pack which he informed the excited ruth contained rolands sword and the magic rug of bagdad together they were applecheeked chattering children of outdoors  for all the horizons weight of dark clouds clear sunshine lay on clear snow as they left the train and trotted along the road carrying their skees beyond the outskirts of the town country sleighbells chinkled down a hill children shouted and made snow houses elders stamped their feet and clucked fine day new york was far off and ridiculously unimportant carl and ruth reached an open sloping field where the snow that partly covered a large rock was melting at its lacy crystaled edges staining the black rock to a shiny wetness that was infinitely cheerful in its tiny reflection of the blue sky at the zenith on a tree whose bleak bark the sun had warmed vagrant sparrows in handmedown feathers discussed rumors of the establishment of a breadcrumb line and the better day that was coming for all proletarian sparrows a rounded drift of snow stood out against a red barn the litter of cornstalks and straw in a barnyard was transformed from disordered muck to a tessellation of warm silver and old gold not the delicate red and browns and grays alone but everywhere the light as well caressed the senses a distant dog barked goodnatured greeting to all the world the thawing land stirred with a promise that spring might in time return to lovers  oh today is beautiful asasits beautiful as frosting on a birthdaycake cried ruth as she slipped her feet into the straps of her skees preparing for her first lesson these skees seem so dreadfully long and unmanageable now i get them on like sevenfoot tableknives and my silly feet like orange seeds in the middle of the knives  the skees were unmanageable  one climbed up on the other and ruth tried to lift her own weight when she was sliding down a hillock they spread apart eager to chase things lying in entirely different directions ruth came down between them her pretty nose plowing the wet snowcrust carl speeding beside her his obedient skees exactly parallel lifted her and brushed the snow from her furs and her nose she was laughing  falling getting up learning at last the zest of coasting and of handling those gigantic skates on level stretches she accompanied him from hill to hill through fences skirting thickets till they reached a hollow at the heart of a farm where a brooklet led into deeper woods the afternoon was passing the swarthy clouds marched grimly from the east but the low sun redlettered the day the countrybred carl showed her how thin sheets of ice formed on the bank of the stream and jutted out like shelves in an elfin cupboard delicate and curiousedged as venetian glass and how through an opening in the ice she could spy upon a secret world of clear water not dead from winter but alive with piratical black bugs over sand of exquisitely pale gray like lilliputian submarines in a fairy sea  a rabbit hopped away among the trees beyond them and carl following its trail read to her the forest hieroglyphicstracks of rabbit and chipmunk and crow of fieldmouse and housecat in the snowpaved city of night animals with its edifices of twiggy underbrush  the setting sun was overclouded now the air sharp the grove uneasily quiet branches contracting in the returning cold ticked like a solemn clock of the woodland and about them slunk the homeless mysteries that at twilight revisit even the tiniest forest to wail of the perished wilderness  i know theres indians sneaking along in there she whispered and wolves and outlaws and maybe a hudson bay factor coming in a red mackinaw coat  and maybe a mounted policeman and a lost girl  saying which remarked ruth the brave young man undid his pack and disclosed to the admiring eyes of the hungry lassmeaning me especially the hungrythe wonders of his pack which she had been covertly eying amid all the perils of the afternoon  carl did not know it but all his life he had been seeking a girl who would without apologetic explanation begin a story with herself and him for its characters he instantly continued her tale  and from the pack the brave young hero whose new norfolk jacket she admired such a lotas i said from the pack he pulled two clammy blue hardboiled eggs and a thermos bottle filled with tea into which ive probably forgotten to put any sugar  and then she stabbed him and went swiftly home ruth concluded the narration dont be frivolous about food just one hardboiled egg and you perish none of these gentle convenient shoebox picnics for me of course i ought to pretend that i have a birdlike appetite but as a matter of fact i could devour an english muttonchop four kidneys and two hot sausages and then some plumpudding and a box of chocolates assorted  if this were a story said carl knocking the crusted snow from dead branches and dragging them toward the center of a small clearing the young hero from joralemon would now remind the city gal that tis only among gods free hills that you can get an appetite and then the author would say nothing had ever tasted so good as those trout yanked from the brook and cooked to a turn on the sizzling coals she looked at the stalwart young man so skilfully frying the flapjacks and contrasted him with the effeminate fops she had met on fifth avenue but meanwhile squaw youd better tear some good dry twigs off this bush for kindling  gathering twigs while carl scrabbled among the roots for dry leaves ruth went on again with their story yes said the fair maid o the wilds obediently bending her poor patient back at the cruel behest of the stern man of granite may i put something into the story which will politely indicate how much the unfortunate lady appreciates this heavenly snowplace in contrast to the beastly city even though she is so abominably treated  yes but as i warned you nothing about the effect of outodoors on the appetite all youve got to do is to watch a city broker eat fourteen pounds of steak three pots of coffee and four black cigars at a broadway restaurant to realize that the effeminate city man occasionally gets up quite some appetite too  my dear she wailed aside from the vulgarity of the thingyou know that no one ever admits to a real interest in foodi am so hungry that if there is any more mention of eating i shall go off in a corner and howl you know how those adorable german christmas stories always begin es war weinachtsabend tiefer schnee lag am boden durch das wald kam ein armes m√§dchen das weinte bitterlich the reason why she weinted bitterlich was because her soul was hurt at being kept out of the secret of the beautiful beautiful food that was hidden in the heros pack now lets have no more imaginary menus lets discuss nijinsky and the musical asses till you are ready  all ready now he proclaimed kneeling by the pyramid of leaves twigs and sticks he had been erecting he lit a match and kindled a leaf fire ran through the mass and rosy light brightened the darkened snow by the way he said as with cold fingers he pulled at the straps of his pack im beginning to be afraid that well be a lot later getting home than we expected  well i suppose ill go to sleep on the train and wake up at every station and wail and make you uncomfortable and mason will be grieved and disapproving when i get home late but just now i dont care i dont its la belle aventure carl do you realize that never in my twentyfour almost twentyfive now never in all these years have i been out like this in the wilds in the dark not even with phil and yet i dont feel afraidjust terribly happy  you do trust me dont you  you know i do yet when i realize that i really dont know you at all  he had brought out from the pack graniteware plates and cups a stewpan and a coffeepot a ruddied paper of meat and a can of peas rolls johnnycake maple syrup a screwtop bottle of cream pasteboard boxes of salt and pepper and sugar lamb chops coiled in the covered stewpan loudly broiled in their own fat and to them the peas heated in their can were added when the coffee began to foam he dragged a large log to the side of the fire and ruth there sitting gorged shamelessly carl himself did not eat reticently  light snow was falling now driven by them on the rising wind the fire where hot coals had piled higher and higher was a refuge in the midst of the darkness carl rolled up another log for protection from the weather and placed it at right angles to the first  you were saying at mrs needhams that we ought to have an old farmhouse he remarked while she snuggled before the fire her back against a log her round knees up under her chin her arms clasping her legs lets build one right here  instantly she was living it in the angle between the logs she laid out an outline of twigs exclaiming here is my room with low ceiling and exposed rafters and a big open fireplace not a single touch of pale pink or rosebuds  then heres my room with a workbench and a bed nine feet long that i can lose myself in  then here outside my room said ruth im going to have a brick terrace and all around it heliotrope growing in pots on the brick wall  im sorry blessed but you cant have a terrace dont you realize that every brick would have to be carted two hundred miles through this wilderness  i dont care if you appreciated me youd carry them on your back if necessary  well ill think it over butoh look here im going to have a porch made out of fresh saplings outside of my room and it ll overlook the hills and it ll have outdoor cots with olivegray army blankets over them and when you wake up in the morning youll see the hills in the first sunlight  glorious ill give up my terrace though i do think i was weedled into it  seriously ruth wouldnt you like to have such a place back in the wilderness  love it id be perfectly happy there at least for a while i wouldnt care if i never saw another aigrette or a fat rhine maiden singing in thirty sharps  listen how would this be for a site let me stick some more wood there on your side of the fire once when i was up in the high sierras in california i found a wooded bluffyou looked a thousand feet straight down to a clear lake green as mintsauce pretty nearly not a wrinkle on it there wasnt a sound anywhere except when the leaves rustled then on the other side you looked way up to a peak covered with snow and a big eagle sailing overheadsailing and sailing hour after hour and you could smell the pine needles and sit there and look way offwould you like it  oh i cant tell you how much  have to go there some day  when youre president of the vanzile company you must give me a touricar to go in and perhaps i shall let you go too  right ill be chauffeur and cook and everything quietly exultant at her sweet unworded promise of liking he hastily said to cover that thrill even a poor old lowbrow mechanic like me does get a kind of poetic fervor out of a view like that  but you arent a lowbrow mechanic you make me so dreadfully weary when youre mockhumble as a matter of fact youre a famous man and im a poor little street waif for instance the way you talk about socialism when you get interested and let yourself go really excited id always thought that aviators and other sorts of heroes were such stolid dubs  gee itd be natural enough if i did like to talk imagine the training in being with the english superintendent at the mine that i was telling you about and hearing frazer lecture and knowing tony bean with his southamerican interests and most of all of course knowing forrest haviland if i had any pep in mecourse im terribly slangy i suppose but i couldnt help wading right in and wanting to talk to everybody about everything  yes yes of course im abominably slangy too i wonder if every one isnt except in books weve left our house a little unfinished carl  im afraid well have to blessed well have to be going its past seven now and we must be sure to catch the 809 and get back to town about nine  i cant tell you how sorry i am we must leave our house in the wilds  you really have enjoyed it he was cleaning the last of the dishes with snow and packing them away do you know he said cautiously i always used to feel that a girlyou say you arent in society but i mean a girl like youi used to think it was impossible to play with such a girl unless a man was rich which i excessively am not with my little money tied up in the touricar yet here we have an allday party and it costs less than three really good seats at the theater  i know phil is always saying that he is too poor to have a good time and yet his grandmother left him fifteen thousand dollars capital in his own right besides his allowance from his father and his salary from the law firm and he infuriates me sometimesaside from the tactlessness of the thingby quite plainly suggesting that im so emptyheaded that i wont enjoy going out with him unless he spends a lot of money and makes waiters and ushers obsequious there are lots of my friends who think that way both the girls and the men they never seem to realize that if they were just human beings as you and i have been today and not hidebound members of the danceandtea league they could beat that beastly artificial old city phil once told me that no manmind you no one at allcould possibly marry on less than fifteen thousand dollars a year simply proved it beyond a question  that lets me out  phil said that no one could possibly live on the west sideof course the fact that he and i are both living on the west side doesnt countand the cheapest good apartments near fifth avenue cost four thousand dollars a year and then one cant possibly get along with less than two cars and four maids and a chauffeur cant be done  hes right fawncy only three maids might as well be dead  the pack was ready now he was swinging it to his back and preparing to stamp out the fire but he dropped his burden and faced her in the low firelight ruth you wont make up your mind to marry phil till youre sure will you youll play with me awhile wont you cant we explore a few more  she laughed nervously trying to look at him as i said phil wont condescend to consider poor me till he has his fifteen thousand dollars a year and that wont be for some time i think considering he is too wellbred to work hard  but seriously you willoh i dont know how to put it you will let me be your playmate even as much as phil is while were still  carl ive never played as much with any one as with you you make most of the men i know seem very unenterprising it frightens me perhaps i oughtnt to let you jump the fence so easily  you wont let phil lock you up for a while  no mustnt we be going  thank you for letting the outlaw come to your party the fires out come  with the quenching of the fire they were left in smothering darkness where do we go she worried i feel completely lost i cant make out a thing i feel so lost and so blind after looking at the fire  her voice betrayed that he was suddenly a stranger to her  with hasty assurance he said sit tight see we head for that tall oak up the slope then through the clearing keeping to the right youll be able to see the oak as soon as you get the firelight out of your eyes remember i used to hunt every fall as a kid and come back through the dark dont worry  i can just make out the tree now  right now for it  let me carry my skees  no you just watch your feet his voice was pleasant quiet not too intimate dont try to guide yourself by your eyes let your feet find the safe ground your eyes will fool you in the dark  it was a hard pull the way back encumbered with pack and two pairs of skees which they dared not use in the darkness he could not give her a helping hand the snow was still falling not very thick nor savagely windborne yet stinging their eyes as they crossed open moors and the wind leaped at them once ruth slipped on a rock or a chunk of ice and came down with an infuriating jolt before he could drop the skees she struggled up and said dryly  yes it did hurt and i know youre sorry and theres nothing you can do  carl grinned and kept silence though with one hand as soon as he could get it free from the elusive skees he lightly patted her shoulder  she was almost staggering so cold was she and so tired and so heavy was the snow caked on her boots when they came to a sharp rise down which shone the radiance of an incandescent light  roads right up there blessed he cried cheerily  oh i cantyes i will  he dropped the skees put one arm about her shoulders and one about her knees and almost before she had finished crying oh no please dont carry me he was halfway up the slope he set her down safe by the road  they caught the 809 train with two minutes to spare its warmth and the dingy softness of the plush seats seemed palatial  ruth rubbed her cold hands with a smile deprecating intimate and her shoulder drooped toward him her whole being seemed turned toward him he cuddled her right hand within his murmuring see my hands a house where yours can keep warm her fingers curled tight and rested there contentedly like a drowsy kitten she looked down at their two hands a little brown house she said     chapter xxxiv   while scientists seek germs that shall change the world while war comes or winter takes earth captive even while love visibly flowers a power mighty as any of these lashes its human packtrain on the dusty road to futility the days work is the name of that power  all these days of first love carl had the office for lowering background the warm trust of ruths hand on a saturday did not make plans for the touricar any the less pressing on a monday the tyranny of nine to five is stronger more insistent in every department of life than the most officious oligarchy inspectors can be bribed judges softened and recruiting sergeants evaded but only the grace of god will turn 330 into 530 and mr ericson of the touricar company a not vastly important employee of the mothering vanzile corporation was not entitled to go home at 330 as a really rational man would have done when the sun goldmisted the windows and suggested skating  no longer was business essentially an adventure to carl doubtless he would have given it up and have gone to palm beach to fly a hydro for bagby jr had there been no ruth bagby wrote that he was coming north to prepare for the springs experiments wouldnt carl consider joining him  carl was now between his salary and his investment in the touricar company making about four thousand dollars a year and saving nearly half of it against the inevitable next change in his life whatever that should be he would probably climb to ten thousand dollars in five years the touricar was promising success several had been ordered at the automobile show the chicago boston and philadelphia agents of the company reported interest for no particular reason apparently milwaukee had taken them up first three milwaukee people had ordered cars an artist was making posters with beautiful gipsies and a touricar and tourists whose countenances showed lively appreciation of the efforts of the kind touricar manufacturers to please and benefit them but the head salesman of the company laughed at carl when he suggested that the touricar might not only bring them money but really take people off to a larger freedom  i dont care a hang where they go with the thing as long as they pay for it you cant be an idealist and make money you make the money and then you can have all the ideals you want to and give away some hospitals and libraries                                       they walked and talked ruth and carl they threaded the sundayafternoon throng on upper broadway where on every clear sunday all the apartmentdwellers if they have remembered to have their trousers pressed or their gloves cleaned in preparation promenade like stupid blackandwhite peacocks past uninteresting apartmenthouses and uninspiring upper broadway shops while two blocks away glorious riverside drive with its panorama of hudson and hills and billowing clouds its trees and secret walks and the soldiers and sailors monument is nearly deserted together they scorned the glossy welltodo merchant in his newly ironed tophat and were thus drawn together it is written that loving the same cause makes honest friendship but hating the same people makes alliances so delightful that one can sit up late nights talking  at the opening of the flying season carl took her to the hempstead plains aviation field and hearing his explanations she at last comprehended emotionally that he really was an aviator  they tramped through staten island they had tea at the manhattan carl dined with ruth and her father once he took her brother mason to lunch at the aero club  ruth was ill in march not with a mysterious and romantic malady but with grippe which she wrote carl made her hate the human race new york charity and shakespeare she could not decide whether to go to europe or to die in a swoon and be buried under a mossy headstone  he answered that he would go abroad for her and every day she received tokens bearing new york postmarks yet obviously coming from foreign parts a souvenir card from the pir√¶us stating that carl was visiting cousin t demetrieff philopopudopulos and we are enjoying our drives so much dem sends his love wish you could be with us an absurd string of beads from port sa√Ød and a box of syrian sweets a hindu puzzle guaranteed to amuse victims of the grippe and goldfabric slippers of china with long letters nonchalantly relating encounters with outlaws and wrecks and new varieties of disease  he called on her before her nose had quite lost the grippe or her temper the badness  phil dunleavy was there lofty and cultured in evening clothes apparently not eager to go he stayed till ten minutes to ten and by his manner of cold surprise when carl tried to influence the conversation was able to keep it to the kreisler violin recitals the architecture of st john the divines and whitneys polo while carl tried not to look sulky and manoeuvered to get out the excellent things he was prepared to say on other topics not unlike the small boy who wants to interrupt whistplayers and tell them about his new skates when phil was gone ruth sighed and said belligerently  poor phil he has to work so hard and all the people at his office even the firm are just as common as they can be common as the children at my beastly old settlementhouse  what do you mean by common bristled carl  not of our class  what do you mean by our class  and the battle was set  ruth refused to withdraw common carl recalled abraham lincoln and goldenrule jones and walt whitman on the subject of the common people though as to what these sages had said he was vague ruth burst out  oh you can talk all you like about theories but just the same in real life most people are common as dirt and just about as admissible to society its all very fine to be good to servants but you would be the first to complain if i invited the cook up here  give her and her children education for three generations  she was perfectly unreasonable and right in most of the things she said he was perfectly unreasonable and right in all of the things he said their argument was absurdly hot and hurt them pathetically it was difficult at first for carl to admit that he was at odds with his playmate surely this was a sham dissension of which they would soon tire which they would smilingly give up then he was trying not to be too contentious but was irritated into retorting after fifteen minutes they were staring at each other as at intruding strangers he remembering the fact that she was a result of city life she the fact that he wasnt a product of city life  and a fact which neither of them realized save subconsciously was in the background carl himself had come in a few years from oscar ericsons back yard to ruth winslows libraryhe had made the step naturally as only an american could but it was a step  she was loftily polite im afraid you cant quite understand what the niceties of life mean to people like phil im sorry he wont give them up to the first truckdriver he meets but im afraid he wont and occasionally its necessary to face facts niceties of the kind he has gr  nice  really her heavy eyebrows arched in a frown  if youre going to get nice on me of course youll have to be condescending and thats one thing i wont permit  im afraid youll find that one has to permit a great many things sometimes apparently i must permit great rudeness  have i been rude have  yes very  he could endure no more good night he growled and was gone  he was frightened to find himself out of the house the door closed between them no going back without ringing the bell he couldnt go back he walked a block slow incredulous he stood hesitant before the nearest corner drugstore shivering in the march wind wondering if he dared go into the store and telephone her he was willing to concede anything he planned apt phrases to use surely everything would be made right if he could only speak to her he pictured himself crossing the drugstore floor entering the telephonebooth putting five cents in the slot he stared at the redandgreen globes in the druggists window inspected a display of soaps and recollected the fact that for a week now he had failed to take home any shavingsoap and had had to use ordinary handsoap golly i must go in and get a shavingstick no darn it i havent got enough money with me i must try to remember to get some tomorrow he rebuked himself for thinking of soap when love lay dying but i must remember to get that soap just the same so grotesque is man the slave and angel for while he was sick with the desire to go back to the one comrade he sharply wondered if he was not merely acting all this agony he went into the store but he did not telephone to ruth there was no sufficiently convincing reason for calling her up he bought a silly icecream soda and talked to the man behind the counter as he drank it all the while a tragic ruth stood before him blaming him for he knew not what  he reluctantly went on regretting every step that took him from her but as he reached the next corner his shoulders snapped back into defiant straightness he thrust his hands into the side pockets of his topcoat and strode away feeling that he had shaken off a burden of niceness he had willynilly recovered his freedom he could go anywhere now mingle with any sort of people be common and comfortable he didnt have to take dancing lessons or fear the results of losing his job or of being robbed of his interests in the touricar he glanced interestedly at a pretty girl recklessly went into a cigarstore and bought a fifteencent cigar he was free again  as he marched on however his defiance began to ooze away he went over every word ruth or he had said and when he reached his room he sat deep in an armchair like a hurt animal crouching his coat still on his felt hat over his eyes his tie a trifle disarranged his legs straight out before him his hands in his trousers pockets while he disconsolately contemplated a photograph of forrest haviland in fulldress uniform that stood on the low bureau among tangled ties stray cigarettes a bronze aviation medal cuffbuttons and a haberdashers round package of new collars his gaze was steady and gloomy he was dramatizing himself as hero in a melodrama he did not know how the play would end  but his dramatization of himself did not indicate that he was not in earnest  forrests portrait suggested to him as it had before that he had no picture of ruth that he wanted one next time he saw her he would ask her then he remembered  he took out his new cigar turned it over and over gloweringly and chewed it without lighting it the right corner of his mouth vicious in appearance but his tone was plaintive as he mourned how did it all start anyway  he drew off his topcoat and shoes and put on his shabby though once expensive slippers slowly he lay on his bed he certainly did not intend to go to sleepbut he awoke at 2 am dressed the light burning his windows closed feeling sweaty and hot and dirty and drymoutheda victim of all the woes since tall troy burned he shucked off his clothes as you shuck an ear of corn  when he awoke in the morning he lay as usual greeting a shining new day till he realized that it was not a shining day it was an ominous day everything was wrong that something had happenedreally hadwas a fact that sternly patrolled his room his chief reaction was not repentance nor dramatic interest but a vexed longing to unwish the whole affair hang it he groaned  already he was eager to make peace he sympathized with ruth poor kid it was rotten to row with her her completely all in with the grippe  at three in the afternoon he telephoned to her house miss ruth he was informed was asleep she was not very well  would the maid please ask miss ruth to call mr ericson when she woke  certainly the maid would  but by bedtime ruth had not telephoned selfrespect would not let him call again for days and ruth never called him  he went about alternately resentful at her stubbornness and seeing himself as a lout cast out of heaven then he saw her at a distance on the platform of the subway station at seventysecond street she was with phil dunleavy she looked well she was talking gaily oblivious of old sorrows certainly not in need of carl ericson  that was the end he knew he watched them take a train stood there alone due at a meeting of the aeronautical society but suddenly not wishing to go not wishing to go anywhere nor do anything friendless bored driftwood in the city  so easily had the hawk swooped down into her life coming by chance but glad to remain so easily had he been driven away                                       for three days he planned in a headachy way to make an end of his job and join bagby jr in his hydroaeroplane experiments he pictured the crowd that would worship him he told himself stories unhappy and long about the renewed companionship of ruth and phil he was sure that he the stranger had been a fool to imagine that he could ever displace phil on the third afternoon suddenly apparently without cause he bolted from the office and at a public telephonebooth he called ruth it was she who answered the telephone  may i come up tonight he said urgently  yes she said that was all  when he saw her she hesitated smiled shamefacedly and confessed that she had wanted to telephone to him  together like a stage chorus they contested  i was grouchy  i was beastly  im honestly sorry  ll you forgive  what was it all about  really i donotknow  i agree with lots of the things you  no i agree with you but just at the timeyou know  her lively defensive eyes were tender he put his arm lightly about her shoulderslightly but his fingertips were sensitive to every thread of her thin bodice that seemed tissue as warmly living as the smooth shoulder beneath she pressed her eyes against his coat her coiled dark hair beneath his chin a longing to cry like a boy and to care for her like a man made him reverent the fear of phil vanished intensely conscious though he was of her hair and its individual scent he did not kiss it she was sacred  she sprang from him and at the piano hammered out a rattling waltz it changed to gentler music and under the shaded pianolamp they were silent happy he merely touched her hand when he went but he sang his way home wanting to nod to every policeman  ive found her again it isnt merely play now he kept repeating and ive learned something i dont really know what it is but its as though id learned a new language gee im happy     chapter xxxv   on an april saturday morning carl rose with a feeling of spring he wanted to be off in the connecticut hills among the silverygray wormfences with larks rising on the breeze and pools aripple and yellow crocusblossoms afire by the road where towns white and sleepy woke to find the elms misted with young green would there be any crocuses out as yet that was the only question worth solving in the world save the riddle of ruths heart the staid brownstone houses of the new york streets displayed few crocuses and fewer larks yet over them today was the bloom of romance carl walked down to the automobile district past central park sniffing wistfully at the damp grass pale green amid old gray marveling how a bare patch of brown earth without a single blade of grass could smell so stirringly of coming spring a girl on broadway was selling wild violets white and purple and in front of wretched old houses down a sidestreet in the negro district a darky in a tan derby and a scarlet tie was caroling      mandy in de spring     de mockingbirds do sing     an de flowers am so sweet along de ol bayou  above the darkys head elevated trains roared on the fiftythird street trestle and up broadway streaked a stripped motorcar all steel chassis and greasemottled board seat and lurid odor of gasoline but sparrows splashed in the pools of sunshine in a lull the darkys voice came again chanting passionately in de spring spring spring and carl clamored ive got to get out today terrible glad its a halfholiday wonder if i dare telephone to ruth  at a quarter to three they were rollicking down the smart side of fifth avenue one could see that they were playmates by her dancing steps and his absorption in her he bent a little toward her quick to laugh with her  ruth was in a frock of flowered taffeta i wont wait till easter to show off my spring clothes it isnt done any more she said its as stupid as bobbys not daring to wear a straw hat one single day after september fifteenth is an aviator brave enough to wear his after the fifteenth think i didnt know you thenlast september i cant understand it  but i knew you blessed because i was sure spring was coming again and that distinctly implied ruth  of course it did youve guessed my secret im the spirit of spring last wednesday when i lost my marquise ring i was the spirit of vitriol but nowim a poet ive thought it all out and decided that i shall be the american sappho at any moment i am quite likely to rush madly across the pavement and sit down on the curb and indite several stanzas on the back of a callingcard while the crowd galumps around me in an awed ring i feel like kidnapping you and making you take me aeroplaning but ill compromise youre to buy me a book and take me down to the maison √âpinay for tea and read me poetry while i yearn over the windowboxes and try to look like nicollette buy me a book with spring in it and a princess and a sky like thiscornflower blue with bunnyrabbit clouds  at least a few in the avenues flowergarden of pretty d√©butantes in pairs and young university men with expensive leatherlaced tan boots were echoing ruth in gay new clothes  i wonder who they all are they look like an aristocracy useless but made of the very best materials said carl  theyre like maids of honor and young knights disguised in modern costumes theyre charming  charmingly useless insisted our revolutionary but he did not sound earnest it was too great a day for earnestness about anything less great than joy and life a day for shameless luxuriating in the sun and for wearing bright things in shop windows with curtains of fluted silk were silver things and jade satin gowns and shoebuckles of rhinestones the sleek motorcars whisked by in an incessant line the traffic policemen nodded familiarly to hansomdrivers pools on the asphalt mirrored the delicate sky and at every corner the breeze tasted of spring  carl bought for her yeatss poems tucked it under his arm and they trotted off in madison square they saw a gallant and courtly old man with military shoulders and pink cheeks a debonair gray mustache and a smile of unquenchable youth greeting april with a narcissus in his buttonhole he was feeding the sparrows with crumbs and smiled to see one of them fly off carrying a long wisp of hay bustling away to build for himself and his sparrow bride a bungalow in the foothills of the metropolitan tower  i love that old man exclaimed ruth i do wish we could pick him up and take him with us i dare you to go over and say i prithee sir of thy good will come thou forthfaring with two vagabonds who do quest high and low the land of nowhere something like that go on carl be brave pretend youre brave as an aviator perhaps he has a map of arcadia go ask him  afraid to besides he might monopolize you  hell go with us without his knowing it anyway isnt it strange how you know people perfect strangers from seeing them once without even speaking to them you know them the rest of your life and play games with them  the maison √âpinay you must quest long but great is your reward if you find it here is no weak remembrance of a lost paris but a frenchcanadians desire to express what he believes paris must be therefore a superparis all in brown velvet and wicker tables and at the back a long window edged with boxes red with geraniums looking to a backyard garden where rosebeds lead to a dancingfaun terminal in a shrine of ivy  they sipped grenadine heavy essence of a thousand berries they had the place to themselves save for tony the waiter with his smile of benison and carl read from yeats  he had heard of yeats at plato but never had he known crying curlew and misty mere and the fluttering wings of love till now  his hand rested on her gloved hand tony the waiter rererearranged the servingtable when ruth broke the spell with you arent very reverent with perfectly clean gloves they chattered like blackbirds at sunset  carl discovered that being a newyorker she knew part of it as intimately as though it were a village and nothing about the rest she had taught him fifth avenue told him the history of the invasion by shops the social differences between east and west pointed out the pictures of friends in photographers wallcases now he taught her the various new yorks he had discovered in lonely rambles together they explored chelsea village section and the oxford quadrangles of general theological seminary where quiet meditation dwells in tudor corridors upper greenwich village the home of italian tables dh√¥te clerks socialworkers and radical magazines of alley rookeries and the ancient jewish buryingground lower greenwich village where rundown american families with italian lodgers live on streets named for kings in wooden houses with gambrel roofs and colonial fanlights from the same smallpaned windows where frowsy italian women stared down upon ruth ruths ancestors had leaned out to greet general george washington  on an open wharf near tenth street they were bespelled by april the woolworth tower to the south was an immortal shaft of ivory and gold against an unwinking blue sky challenging the castles and cathedrals of the old world and with its supreme art dignifying the commerce which built and uses it the hudson was lustrous with sun and a sweet wind sang from unknown jersey hills across the river moored to the wharf was a coalbarge with a tiny dwellingcabin at whose windows white curtains fluttered beside the cabin was a garden tended by the bargemans comely whitebrowed wife a dozen daisies and geraniums in two starchboxes  forging down the river a scarred tramp steamer whose rusty sides the sun turned to damask rose bobbed in the slight swell heading for open sea with the british flag aflicker and men chanting as they cleared deck  i wish we were going off with hermaybe to singapore or nagasaki carl said slipping his arm through hers as they balanced on the stringpiece of the wharf sniffing like deer at the breeze which for a moment seemed to bear from distant burgeoning woods a shadowy hint of burning leavesthe perfume of spring and autumn the eternal wandercall  yes ruth mused and moonlight in java and the himalayas on the horizon and the vale of cashmir  but im glad we have this blessed its a day planned for lovers like us  carl  yes lovers courting in spring like all lovers  really carl even spring doesnt quite let me forget the convenances are home waiting  were not lovers  no we  yet you enjoy today dont you  yes but  and youd rather be loafing on a dirty wharf looking at a tramp steamer than taking tea at the plaza  yes just now perhaps  and youre protesting because you feel its proper to  it  and you really trust me so much that youre having difficulty in seeming alarmed  really  and youd rather play around with me than any of the skull and bones or hasty pudding men you know or foreign diplomats with spade beards  at least they wouldnt  oh yes they would if youd let them which you wouldnt so to sum up then we are lovers and its spring and youre glad of it and as soon as you get used to it youll be glad im so frank wont you  i will not be bullied carl youll be having me married to you before i can scream for help if i dont start at once  probably  indeed you will not i havent the slightest intention of letting you get away with being masterful  yes i know blessed these masterful people bore me too but arent we modern enough so we can discuss frankly the question of whether id better propose to you some day  but boy what makes you suppose that i have any information on the subject that ive ever thought of it  i credit you with having a reasonable knowledge that there are such things as marriage  yes butoh im very confused youve bullied me into such a defensive position that my instinct is to deny everything if you turned on me suddenly and accused me of wearing gloves id indignantly deny it  meantime not to change the subject id better be planning and watching for a suitable day for proposing dont you think consider it heres this young ericsonsome sort of a clerk i believeno dont think hes a university manyou know discuss it clearly think it might be better to propose today i ask your advice as a woman  oh carl dear i think not today im sorry but i really dont think so  but some time perhaps  some time perhaps then she fled from him and from the subject  they talked after that only of the sailors that loafed on west street but in their voices was content  they crossed the city and on brooklyn bridge watched the suburbanites going home crowding surfacecar and elevated from their perch on the giant spiders web of steel they saw the long island sound steamers below them passing through a maelstrom of light on waves that trembled like quicksilver  they found a small italian restaurant free of localcolor hounds and what carl called hobohemians and discovered fritto misto and chianti and zabaglionea palebrown custard flavored like honey and served in tall thin curving glasseswhile the fat proprietress in a red shawl and a large brooch came to ask them everyting allaright eh carl insisted that walter macmonnies the aviator had once tried out a motor that was exactly like her including the italian accent there was simple and complete bliss for them in the dingy pineandplaster room adorned with flyspecked calendars and pictures of victor emmanuel and president mckinley copies of the bolletino della sera and large vinegar bottles  the theater was their destination but they first loitered up broadway shamelessly stopping to stare at shop windows pretending to be joe the shoeclerk and becky the cashier furnishing a bronx flat whether it was anything but a game to ruth will never be known but to carl there was a hidden high excitement in planning a flowerbox for the fireescape  apropos of nothing she said as they touched elbows with the sweethearting crowd you were right im sorry i ever felt superior to what i called common people people i love them all itscome we must hurry i hate to miss that one perfect second when the orchestra is quiet and the lights wink at you and the curtains going up  during the second act of the play when the heroine awoke to love carls hand found hers  and it must have been that night when standing between the inner and outer doors of her house carl put his arms about her kissed her hair timidly kissed her sweet cold cheek and cried bless you dear but for some reason he does not remember when he did first kiss her though he had looked forward to that miracle for weeks he does not understand the reason but there is the fact her kisses were big things to him yet possibly there were larger psychological changes which occulted everything else at first but it must have been on that night that he first kissed her for certainly it was when he called on her a week later that he kissed her for the second time  they had been animated but decorous that evening a week later he had tried to play an improvisation called the battle of san juan hill with a knowledge of the piano limited to the fact that if you struck alternate keys at the same time there appeared not to be a discord  i must go now he said slowly as though the bald words had a higher significance she tried to look at him and could not his arms circled her with frightened happiness she tilted back her head and there was the evernew surprise of blue irises under dark brows uplifted wonder her eyes spoke his head drooped till he kissed her lips the two bodies clamored for each other but she unwound his arms crying no no no  he was enfolded by a sensation that they had instantly changed from friendly strangers to intimate lovers as she said i dont understand it carl ive never let a man kiss me like that oh i suppose ive flirted like most girls and been kissed sketchily at silly dances but thisoh carl carl dear dont ever kiss me again tilloh not till i know why im scarcely acquainted with you i do know how dear you are but it appals me when i think of how little background you have for me dear i dont want to be sordid and spoil this moment but i do know that when youre gone ill be a coward and remember that there are families and things and want to wait till i know how they like you at the very least good night and i  good night dear blessed i know     chapter xxxvi   there were as ruth had remarked families  when carl was formally invited to dine at the winslows on a night late in april his only anxiety was as to the condition of his dinnercoat he arrived in a state of easy briskness planning apt and sensible remarks about the business situation for mason and mr winslow as the maid opened the door carl was wondering if he would be able to touch ruths hand under the table he had an anticipatory fondness for all of the small friendly family group which was about to receive him  and he was cast into a den of strangers most of them comprised in the one electric person of aunt emma truegate winslow  aunt emma truegate winslow was the generalcommanding in whatsoever group she was placed by providence with which she had strong influence at a white house reception she would pleasantly but firmly have sent the president about his business and have taken his place in the receiving line just now she sat in a prehistoric s chair near the center of the drawingroom pumping out of phil dunleavy most of the facts about his chiefs private lives  aunt emma had the soul of a sixfoot dowager duchess and should have had an eagle nose and a white pompadour actually she was of medium height with a not unduly maternal bosom a broad commonplace face hair the color of faded grass a blunt nose with slightly enlarged pores and thin lips that seemed to be a straight line when seen from in front but seen in profile puffed out like a fishs she had a habit of nodding intelligently even when she was not listening and another habit of rubbing her left knuckles with the fingers of her right hand not imposing in appearance was aunt emma truegate winslow but she was born to discipline a court  an impeccable widow was she speaking with a broad a and dressed exquisitely in a black satin evening gown  by such simplehearted traits as being always right about unimportant matters and idealistically wrong about important matters politely intruding into everything being earnest about the morality of the poor and auction bridge and the chaperonage of nice girls possessing a working knowledge of wagner and rodin wearing fifteendollar corsets and believing on her bended knees that the truegates and winslows were the noblest families in the social register aunt emma truegate winslow had persuaded the whole world including even her nearenglish butler that she was a superior woman family tradition said that she had only to raise a finger to get into really smart society upon the death of ruths mother aunt emma had taken it as one of her duties along with symphony concerts and committees to rear ruth properly she had been neglecting this duty so far as to permit the invasion of a barbarian named ericson only because she had been in california with her young son arthur just now while her house was being opened she was staying at the winslows with arthur and a peculiarly beastly japanese spaniel named takasan  she was introduced at carl she glanced him over and passed him on to olive dunleavy all in fortyfive seconds when carl had recovered from a sensation of being a kitten drowned in a sack he said agreeable things to olive and observed the situation in the drawingroom  phil was marked out for aunt emmas favors mr winslow sat in a corner apparently crushed with restorative conversation administered by ruth mason winslow was haltingly attentive to a plain welldressed amiable girl named florence crewden who had prematurely gray hair the weekend habit and a weakness for baby talk ruths medicalstudent brother bobby winslow was not there the more he saw of bobbys kind aunt emma the more carl could find it in his heart to excuse bobby for having escaped the family dinner  carl had an uncomfortable moment when aunt emma and mr winslow asked him questions about the development of the touricar but before he could determine whether he was being deliberately inspected by the family the ordeal was over  as they went in to dinner mr winslow taking in aunt emma like a small boy accompanying the school principal ruth had the chance to whisper my hawk be good please believe im not responsible its all aunt emmas doing this dreadfully stately family dinner dont let her bully you im frightened to death andyes phil im coming  the warning did not seem justified in view of the attractive tablecandles cut glass a mound of flowers on a beveled mirror silvery linen and grapefruit with champagne carl was at one side of aunt emma but she seemed more interested in mr winslow at the end of the table and on his other side carl had a safe companion in olive dunleavy across from him were florence crewden phil and ruthruth shimmering in a gown of yellow satin which broke the curves of her fine flushed shoulders only by a narrow band  the conversation played with people florence crewden told to applause and laughter of an exploratory visit to the college of the city of new york and her discovery of a strange race young jews mostly who went to college to study and had no sense of the nobility of making fraternities  such outsiders she said cant you imagine the sort of a party theyd havetheyd all stand around and discuss psychology and dissecting puppies and greek roots phil i think it would be a lovely punishment for you to have to join themto work in a laboratory all day and wear a celluloid collar  oh i know their sort greasy grinds we used to call them there were plenty of them in yale condescended phil  maybe they wear celluloid collarsif they dobecause theyre poor protested ruth  my dear child sniffed aunt emma with collars only twentyfive cents apiece dont be silly  mr winslow declared with portly timidity why em my collars dont cost me but fifteen  mason dear lets not discuss it at dinner tell me all of you the scandal ive missed by going to california which reminds me did i tell you i saw that miserable amy baslin you remember that married the porter or the superintendent or something in her fathers factory i saw her and her husband at pasadena and they seemed to be happy of course amy would put the best face she could on it but they must have been miserably unhappysuch a sad affair and she could have married quite decently  what do you mean by decently ruth demanded  carl was startled he had once asked ruth the same question about the same phrase  aunt emma revolved like a gunturret getting ruths range and remarked calmly my dear child you know quite well what i mean dont i beg of you bring any socialistic problems to dinner till you have really learned something about them now i want to hear all the nice scandals i have missed  there were not many she had missed but she kept the conversation sternly to discussions of people whose names carl had never heard again he was obviously an outsider still ignoring carl aunt emma demanded of ruth and phil sitting together opposite her  tell me about the good times you children have been having ruthie i am so glad that phil and you finally went to the william truegates and your letter about the beaux arts festival was charming ruthie i quite envied you and phil  the dragon continued talking to ruth while carl listened in the interstices of his chatter to olive  i hope you havent been giving all your time and beautysleep doing too much of that settlement work ruthieand heaven only knows what germs you will get thereof course i should be the first to praise any work for the poor ungrateful and shiftless though they arewhat with my committees and the truegate temperance home for young working girlsits all very well to be sympathetic with them but when it comes to a settlementhouse and heaven knows i have given them all the counsel and suggestions i could though some of the professional settlement workers are as pert as they can be and i really do believe some of them think they are trying to end poverty entirely just as though the lord would have sent poverty into the world if he didnt have a very good reason for ityou will remember the bible says the poor you always have with you and as florence barclay says in her novels which may seem a little sentimental but they are of such a good moral effect you cant supersede the scriptures even in the most charming social circles to say nothing of the blessings of poverty im sure theyre much happier than we are with our onerous duties im sure that if any of these ragamuffin anarchists and socialists and antimilitarists want to take over my committees they are welcome if theyll take over the miserable headaches and worried hours they give me trying to do something for the poor they wont even be clean but even in model tenements they will put coal in the bathtubs and so i do hope you havent just been wearing yourself to a bone working for ungrateful dirty little children ruthie  no auntie dear ive been quite as discreet as any winslow should be you see im selfish too arent i carl  oh very  aunt emma seemed to remember then that some sort of a man whose species she didnt quite know sat next to her she glanced at carl again gave him up as an error in social judgment and went on  no ruthie not selfish so much as thoughtless about the duties of a family like oursand i was always the first to say that the winslows are as fine a stock as the truegates and i am going to see that you go out more the rest of this year ruthie i want you and phil to plan right now to attend the charity league dances next season you must learn to concentrate your attention  auntie dear please leave my wickedness till the next time we  my dear child now that i have the chance to get all of us togetherim sure mr ericson will pardon the rest of us our little family discussionsi want to take you and master phil to task together you are both of you negligent of social dutiesduties they are ruthie for man was not born to serve alonethough phil is far better than you with your queer habits and heaven only knows where you got them neither your father nor your dear sainted mother was slack or selfish  dear auntie lets admit that im a black sheep with a little black muzzle and a habit of butting all sorts of ashcans and let phil go on his social way rejoicing  ruth was jaunty but her voice was strained and she bit her lip with staccato nervousness when she was not speaking carl ventured to face the dragon  mrs winslow im sure ruth has been better than you think she has been learning all these fiendishly complicated new dances you know a poor business man like myself finds them  yes said aunt emma i am sure she will always remember that she is a winslow and must carry on the family traditions but sometimes i am afraid she gets under bad influences because of her good nature she said it loudly she looked carl in the eye  the whole table stopped talking carl felt like a tramp who has kicked a chained bulldog and discovers that the chain is broken  he wanted to be good not make a scene he noticed with intense indignation that phil was grinning he planned to get phil off in a corner not necessarily a dark corner and beat him he wanted to telegraph ruth dared not he realized in a quartersecond that he must have been discussed by the family and did not like it  every one seemed to be waiting for him to speak awkwardly he said wondering all the while if she meant what her tone said she meant by bad influences  yes butjust going to sayi believe settlement work is a good influence  please dont discuss ruth was groaning when aunt emma sternly interrupted  it is good of you to take up the cudgels mr ericson and please dont misjudge meof course i realize that i am only a silly old woman and that my passion to see the winslows keep to their fine standards is oldfashioned but you see it is a hobby of mine that ive devoted years to and you who havent known the winslows so very long her manner was almost courteous  yes thats so carl mumbled agreeably just as she dropped the courtesy and went on  you cant judgein fact this is nothing personal you know i dont suppose its possible for westerners to have any idea how precious family ideals are to easterners of course were probably silly about them and its splendid your wheatlands and not caring who your grandfather was but to make up for those things we do have to protect what we have gained through the generations  carl longed to stand up to defy them all to cry if you mean that you think ruth has to be protected against me have the decency to say so yet he kept his voice gentle  but why be narrowed to just a few families in ones interests now this settlement  one isnt narrowed there are plenty of good families for ruth to consider when it comes time for my little girl to consider alliances at all aunt emma coldly stated  i will shut up he told himself i will shut up ill see this dinner through and then never come near this house again he tried to look casual as though the conversation was safely finished but aunt emma was waiting for him to go on in the general stillness her corsets creaked with belligerent attention he played with his fork in a well if thats how you feel about it perhaps it would be better not to discuss it any further my dear madam manner growing every second more flushed embarrassed sick angry trying harder every second to look unconcerned  aunt emma hawked a delicate and ladylike hawk in her patrician throat prefatory to a new attack carl knew he would be tempted to retort brutally  then from the door of the diningroom whimpered the high voice of an excited child  oh mamma oh cousin ruthie nurse says hawk ericson is here i want to see him  every one turned toward a boy of five or six round as a baby chicken in his fuzzy miniature pajamas protectingly holding a cotton monkey under his arm sturdy and shy and defiant  why arthur why my son oh the darling baby from the table  come here arthur and lets hear your troubles before nurse nabs you old son said phil not at all condescendingly rising from the table holding out his arms  no no you just let me go i want to see hawk ericson is that hawk ericson demanded the son of aunt emma pointing at carl  yes sweetheart said ruth softly proudly  running madly about the end of the table arthur jumped at carls lap  carl swung him up and inquired what is it old man  are you hawk ericson  at your commands capn  aunt emma rose and said masterfully come little son now youve seen mr ericson its up to beddie again uptobeddie  no no please no mamma ive never seen a aviator before not in all my life and you promised me cross your heart at pasadena you did i could see one  arthurs face showed signs of imminent badness  well you may stay for a while then said aunt emma weakly unconscious that her sway had departed from her while the rest of the table grinned except carl who was absorbed in arthurs ecstasy  im going to be a aviator too i think a aviator is braver than anybody id rather be a aviator than a general or a policeman or anybody i got a picture of you in my scrapbookyou got a funny hat like cousin bobby wears when he plays football in it shall i get you the picture in my scrapbook honest will you give me another  aunt emma made one more attempt to coax arthur up to bed but his majesty refused and she compromised by scolding his nurse and sending up for his dressinggown a small blue dressinggown on which yellow ducks and white bunnyrabbits paraded proudly  like our blue bowl carl remarked to ruth  not till after coffee in the drawingroom would arthur consent to go to bed this real head of the emma winslow family was far too much absorbed in making carl tell of his long races and why does a flyingmachine fly whats a wind pressure why does the wind shove up why is the wings curved why does it want to catch the wind the others listened including even aunt emma  carl went home early ruth had the opportunity to confide  hawk dear i cant tell you how ashamed i am of my family for enduring anybody so rude and opinionated as aunt emma butits all right now isnt it no no dont kiss me butdear dreams hawk  phils voice from behind shouted oh ericson just a second  carl was not at all pleased he remembered that phil had listened with obvious amusement to his agonized attempt to turn aunt emmas attacks  said phil while ruth disappeared which way you going walk to the subway with you you win old man i admire your nerve for facing aunt emma what i wanted to sayi hope to thunder you dont think i was in any way responsible for mrs winslows linking me and ruth that way andoh you understand i admire you like the devil for knowing what you want and going after it i suppose youll have to convince ruth yet but by jove youve convinced me glad you had arthur for ally they dont make kiddies any better god if i could have a son like thati turn off here ggood luck ericson  thanks a lot phil  thanks good night carl     chapter xxxvii   long beach on the first hot sunday of may when motorists come out from new york halfready to open asphalt hearts to sea and sky carls first sight of it save from an aeroplane and he was madhappy to find real shore so near the city  ruth and he were picnicking vulgar and unashamed among the dunes at the end of the long boardwalk like the beerdrinking pickleeating parties of fishermen and the family groups with red tablecloths grapebasket lunches and colored sunday supplements ruth declared that she preferred them to the elegant loungers who were showing off new motorcoats on the boardwalk but carl and she had withdrawn a bit from the crowds and in the dunes had made a nest with a book and a magazine and a box of chocolates and carls collapsible lunchkit  not new york only but all of ruths relatives were forgot aunt emma truegate winslow was a myth of the dragonhaunted past here all was fresh color and free spaces looking to open sea behind the dunes with their traceries of pale grass reveled the sharp unshadowed green of marshes and an inland bay that was blue as bluing a startling blue bordered by the emerald marshes to one sideafar not troubling their peacewere the crimson roofs of fantastic houses like chalets and california missions and villas of the riviera with gables and turrets of red tiles  before their feet was the creamcolored beach marked by ridges of driftwood mixed with small glistening shells long ranks of paleyellow seaweed and the delicate wrinkles in the sand that were the tracks of receding waves the breakers left the beach wet and shining for a moment like plates of rawcolored copper making one cry out with its flashing beauty then at last the eyes lifted to unbroken bluewaternothing between them and europe save rolling waves and wavecrests like white plumes the sea was of a diaphanous blue that shaded through a bold steel blue and a lucent blue enamel to a rich ultramarine which absorbed and healed the officeworn mind the sails of tacking sloops were ablossom seagulls swooped a tall surffisherman in red flannel shirt and shiny black hipboots strode out into the water and cast with a long curve of his line cumulus clouds whose pure white was shaded with a delicious golden tone were baronial above and out on the skyline the steamers raced by  round them was the warm intimacy of the dune sands beyond was infinite space calling to them to be big and unafraid  talking falling into silences touched with the mystery of sun and sea they confessed youths excited wonder about the world carl sitting crosslegged rubbing his ankles a springy figure in blue flannel and a daring tie while ruth in deeprose linen her throat bright and bare lay with her chin in her hands a flush beneath the gentle brown of her cheeks her whiteclad ankles crossed under her skirt slender against the gray sand thoughtful of eye lost in happiness  some day carl was musing your children and mine will say you certainly lived in the most marvelous age in the world think of it they talk about the romance of the crusades and the romans and all that but think of the miracles weve seen already and were only kids aviation and the automobile and wireless and moving pictures and electric locomotives and electric cooking and the use of radium and the xray and the linotype and the submarine and the labor movementthe i w w and syndicalism and all thatnot that i know anything about the labor movement but i suppose its the most important of all and metchnikoff and ehrlich oh yes and a good share of the development of the electric light and telephone and the phonograph golly in just a few years  yes ruth added and montessoris system of educationthats what i think is the most important see that sailboat hawk like a lily and the lateafternoon gold on those marshes i think this salt breeze blows away all the bad ruth oh dont forget the attempts to cure cancer and consumption so many big things starting right now while were sitting here  lord what an age romancewhy theres more romance in a wireless sparkthink of it little lonely wallowing steamer at night out in the dark slamming out a radio like forty thousand tigers spittingand a man getting it here on long island more romance than in all the galleons that ever sailed the purple tropics which they mostly aint purple but dirty green anything s possible now world cools offaright well move on to some other planet it gets me going dont have to believe in fairies to give the imagination a job today glad ive been an aviator gives me some place in it all anyway  im glad too hawk terribly glad  the sun was crimsoning the wind grew chilly the beach was scattered with campfires their own fire settled into compact live coals which in the dusk of the dunehollow spread over the million bits of quartz a glow through which pirouetted the antic sandfleas carls cigarette had the fragrance that comes only from being impregnated with the smoke of an outdoor fire the waves were lyric and a group at the next fire crooned old black joe the two lovers curled in their nest hand moved toward hand  ruth whispered its sweet to be with all these people and their fires will i really learn not to be supercilious  honey yousupercilious democracy oh the dickens lets not talk about theories any more but just about us  her hand tightcoiled as a snailshell was closed in his  your hand is asleep in my hands arms he whispered the ball of his thumb pressed her thumb and he whispered once more see now our hands are kissing each otherwewe must watch them better your thumb is like a fairy again his thumb hardened with file and wrench and steeringwheel touched hers it was startlingly like a kiss of real lips  lightly she returned the fingerkiss answering diffidently our hands are madsilly hands to think that long beach is a tropical jungle  you arent angry at them  nno  he cradled her head on his shoulder his hand gripping her arm till she cried you hurt me he kissed her cheek she drew back as far as she could her hand against his chest held him away for a minute her defense suddenly collapsed and she was relaxed and throbbing in his arms he slipped his fingers under her chin and turned up her face till he could kiss her lips he had not known the kiss of man and woman could be so long so stirring yet at first he was disappointed this was after all but a touchjust such a touch as finger against finger but her lips grew more intense against his returning and taking the kiss both of them giving and receiving at once  wondering at himself for it carl thought of other things he was amazed that while their lips were hot together he worried as to what train ruth ought to take after dinner yet with such thoughts conferring he was in an ecstasy beyond sorrow praying that to her as to him there was no pain but instead a rapture in the sting of her lips as her teeth cut a little into them a kissthing that the polite novels sketch as a seconds unbodied blisshow human it was with teeth and lips to consider common as eatingand divine as martyrdom his lips were saying to her things too vast and extravagant for a plain young man to venture upon in words  lady to you i chant my reverence and faith everlasting in such unearthly music as the angels use when with lambent wings they salute the marching dawn such lyric tributes and an emotion too subtle to fit into any words whatever his lips were saying  then she was drawing back rending the kiss crying youre almost smothering me  with his arms easily about her but with her weight against his shoulder they and their love veiled from the basketparties by the darkness he said quiveringly see my arms are a little house for you just as my hand was a little house for your hand once my arms are the walls and your head and mine together are the roof  i love the little house  no say i love you  no  say it  no  please  oh hawk dear i couldnt even ifjust now i do want to say it but i want to be fair i am terribly happy to be in the house of hawks arms im not afraid in it even out here on the dark duneswhich aunt emma wouldntsomehowapprove but i do want to be fair to you and im afraid im not when i let you love me this way i dont want to hurt you ever perhaps its egotistical of me but im afraid you would be hurt if i let you kiss me and then afterward i decided i didnt love you at all  but cant you some day  oh i dont know i dont know im not sure i know what love is im not sure its love that makes me happy as i really am when you kiss me perhaps im just curious and experimenting i was quite conscious when you kissed me then quite conscious and curious and once i caught myself wondering for half a second what train wed take i was ashamed of that but i wasnt ashamed of taking mental notes and learning what these kisses that we mention so glibly really are just experimenting you see and if you were too serious about our kiss it wouldnt be at all fair to you  im glad youre frank blessed and i guess i understand pretty well how you feel but after all im fairly simple about such things blessed blessed i dont really know a thing but i love you  his arms were savage again he kissed her kissed her lips kissed the hollow of her throat then he lifted her from the ground and would not set her down till she had kissed him back  you frightened me a lot then she said did the child want to impress ruth with his mighty strength well she shall be impressed hawk i do hopei do hate myself for not knowing my mind i will try not to experiment i want you to be happy i do want to be honest with you if im honest will you try not to be too impatient till i do know just what i want oh im sick of the modern lover i talk and talk about love it seems as though wed lost the power to be simple like the old ballads or werent the ballad people really simple either you say you are so i think you will have to run away with me but not till after dinner come  the moon was rising swinging hands they tramped toward the boardwalk the crunch of their feet in the sand was the rhythmic spell of a magician which she broke when she sighed  should i have let you kiss me out here in the wilds will you respect me after it  princess youre all the respect there is in the world  it seems so strange we were absorbed in war and electricity and then  love is war and electricity or else its dull and i dont think we two ll ever get dullif you do decide you can love me well wander cabin in the rockies with forty mountains for our garden fence and an eagle for our suburban train  and south sea islands silhouetted at sunset look that moon i always imagine it so clearly when i hear hawaiian singers on the victrolaand a hawaiian beach with fireflies in the jungle behind and a phosphorescent sea in front and native girls dancing in garlands  yes and paris boulevards and a mysterious castle in the austrian mountains with a hidden treasure in dark secret dungeons and heavy iron armor and then bing a brandnew prairie town in saskatchewan or dakota with brandnew sunlight on the fresh pine shacks and beyond the town the plains with brandnew grass rolling  but seriously hawk would you want to go to all those places if you were married would you practically you know even rich globetrotters go to the same sorts of places mostly and we wouldnt even be rich would we  no just comfortable maybe five thousand a year  well would you really want to keep on going and take your wife or would you settle down like the rest and spend money so you could keep in shape to make money to spend to keep in shape  seriously i would keep goingif i had the right girl to go with me it would be mighty important which one though i guessand by that i mean you once when i quit flying i thought that maybe id stop wandering and settle down maybe even marry a joralemon kind of a girl but i was meant to hike for the hikings sake only not alone any more i need you wed go and go no limit and we wouldnt just go places either wed be different things wed be connecticut farmers one year and run a mine in mexico the next and loaf in paris the next if we had the money  sometimes you almost tempt me to like you  like me now  no not now but heres the boardwalk  wheres those steps oh yes gee i hate to leave the water without having had a swim wish wed had one dare you to go wading  oh ought i to do you think wading would be silly and nice  course you oughtnt come on dont you remember how the sand feels between your toes  the moon brooded upon the lulled waves and quested among the ridges of driftwood for pearly shells the pools left by the waves were enticing ruth retreated into the shelter of the boardwalk and came shyly out clutching her skirts her feet and ankles silver in the light  the sand does feel good but uh its getting colder and colder she wailed as she cautiously advanced into the water ill think up punishments for you youve not only caused me to be cold but youve made me abominably selfconscious  dont be selfconscious blessed we are just children exploring he splashed out coat off trousers rolled to the knee above his thin muscular legs galloping along the edge of the water like a large puppy while she danced after him  they were stilled to the persuasive beauty of the night music from the topaz jeweled hotels far down the beach wove itself into the peace on land and sea a fish lying on shore was turned by the moon into ivory with carven scales before them reaching to the ancient towers of england and france and the islands of the sea was the whispering water a tenderness that understood everything made allowance for everything in her and in himself folded its wings round him as he scanned her that stood like a slender statue of silverdark hair moonbrightened white arms holding her skirts white legs round which the spent waves sparkled with unworldly fire he waded over to her and timidly kissed the edge of her hair  she rubbed her cheek against his now we must run she said she quickly turned back to the shadow of the boardwalk to draw on her stockings and shoes kneeling on the sand like the simple maid of the ballads which she had been envying  they tramped along the boardwalk with heels clicking like castanets conscious that the world was hushed in nights old enchantment  as they had answered to companionship with the humble picnicparties among the dunes so now they found it amusing to dine among the semigreat and the semimotorists at the nassau ruth had a distinct pleasure when t wentler horsefancier aviation enthusiast president of the first state bank of sacramento came up reminded carl of their acquaintanceship at the oaklandberkeley aero meet and begged ruth and carl to join him his wife and senator leeford for coffee  as they waited for their train quiet after laughter ruth remarked it was jolly to play with the personages you havent seen much of the frivolous side of me its pretty important you dont know how much soul satisfaction i get out of dancing all night and playing tennis with flanneled oafs and eating marrons glac√©s and chatting in a box at the opera till i spoil the entire evening for all the german musiclovers and talking to all the nice doggies from the tennis and racquet club whenever i get invited to piping rock or meadow brook or any other country club that has ancestors i want you to take warning  did you really miss piping rock much today  nobut i might tomorrow and i might get horribly bored in our cabin in the rockies and hate the stony old peaks and long for tea and scandal in a corner at the ritz  then wed hike on to san francisco have tea at the st francis or the fairmont or the palace then beat it for your hawaii and fireflies in the bush  perhaps but suppose just suppose we were married and suppose the touricar didnt go so awfully well and we had to be poor and couldnt go running away but had to stick in one beastly city flat and economize its all very well to talk of working things out together but think of not being able to have decent clothes and going to the movies every nightugh when i see some of the girls who used to be so pretty and gay and they went and married poor mennow they are so worn and tired and bedraggled and perambulatorious and they worry about biddies and furnaces and cabbages and their hair is just scratched together with the dubbest hatsid rather be an idle rich  if we got stuck like that id sell out and wed hike to the mountain cabin anyway say go up in the santa lucias and keep wild bees  and probably get stungin the many subtle senses of that word and id have to cook and wash that would be fun as fun but to have to do it  ruth honey lets not worry about it now anyhow i dont believe theres much danger and dont lets spoil this bully day  it has been sweet i wont croak any more  theres the train coming     chapter xxxviii   while the new york june grew hotter and hotter and stickier and stickier while the crowds crammed together in the subway in a jam as unlovely as a pile of tomatocans on a public dumpheap grew pale in the damp heat carl labored in his office and almost every evening called on ruth who was waiting for the first of july when she was to go to cousin patton kerrs in the berkshires carl tried to bring her coolness he ate only poached eggs on toast or soup and salad for dinner that he might not be torpid he gave her mossroses with drops of water like dew on the stems they sat out on the boxstoopthe unfriendly new york street adopting for a time the frank neighborliness of a villageand exclaimed over every breeze they talked about the charm of forty degrees below zero that is sometimes their favorite topic was themselves  she still insisted that she was not in love with him hooted at the idea of being engaged she might some day go off and get married to some one but engaged never she finally agreed that they were engaged to be engaged to be engaged one night when they sought the windy housetop she twined his arms about her and almost went to sleep with her hair smooth beneath his chin he sat motionless till his arms ached with the strain till her shoulder seemed to stick into his like a bar of iron glad that she trusted him enough to doze into warm slumber in the familiarity of his arms yet he dared not kiss her throat as he had done at long beach  as lovers do carl had thought intently of her warning that she did care for clothes dancing country clubs ruth would have been caressingly surprised had she known the thought and worried conscientiousness he gave to the problem of planning parties for her ideas were always popping up in the midst of his work and never giving him rest till he had noted them down on memopapers he carried about on the backs of envelopes such notes as these  join country clb take r dances there basket of fruit for r invite mason w lunch orgnze tcar tour ny to sf newspaper men on tour probly forbes rem walters new altitude 16954 r to astor roof rem country c  he did get a card to the peace waters country club and take ruth to a dance there she seemed to know every other member and danced eloquently he took her to the josiah bagbys for dinner to the firstnight of a summer musical comedy but he was still the stranger in new york and parties are not to be had by tipping waiters and buying tickets half of the halfdozen affairs which they attended were of her inspiration he was invited to go yachting at larchmont motoring swimming on long island with friends of herself and her brothers  one evening that strikes into carls memories of those days of the pays du tendre is the evening on which phil dunleavy insisted on celebrating a yale baseball victory by taking them to dinner in the oakroom of the ritzcarlton under whose alabaster lights among the cosmopolites they dined elaborately and smoked slim imported cigarettes the thin music of violins took them into the lonely gray groves of the land of wandering tunes till phil began to talk disclosing to them a devotion to beauty a satirical sense of humor and a final acceptance of carl as his friend  a hundred other parties carl planned while dining alone at inferior restaurants a hundred times he took a tencent dessert instead of an exciting fifteencent strawberry shortcake to save money for those parties out of such sordid thoughts of nickel coins is built a love enduring and even tolerable before breakfast coffee  yet always to him their real life was in simple jaunts out of doors arranged without considering other people her father seemed glad of that he once said to carl giving him a cigar you children had better not let aunt emma know that you are enjoying yourselves as you want to how is the automobile business going                                       it would be pleasant to relate that carl was inspired by love to put so much of that celebrated american quality punch into his work that the touricar was sweeping the market or to picture with quietly falling tears the pathos of his business failure at the time when he most needed money as a matter of fact the touricar affairs were going as in real life most businesses gojust fairly well a few cars were sold there were prospects of other sales the vanzile corporation neither planned to drop the touricar nor elected our young hero vicepresident of the corporation                                       in june gertrude cowles and her mother left for joralemon carl had since christmas seen them about once a month gertie had at first represented an unhappy old friend to whom he had to be kind then as she seemed never to be able to give up the desire to see him tied down whether by her affection or by his work carl came to regard her as an irritating foe to the freedom which he prized the more because of the increasing bondage of the office the last stage was pure indifference to her gertie was either a chance for simple sweetness which he failed to take or she was a peril which he had escaped according to ones view of her but in any case he had missedor escapedher as a romantic hero escapes fire flood and plot she meant nothing to him never could again life had flowed past her as except in novels with plots most lives do flow past temporary and fortuitous points of interest gertie was farther from him now than those dancing hawaiian girls whom ruth and he hoped some day to see yet by her reaching out for his liberty gertie had first made him prize ruth                                       the 1st of july 1913 ruth left for the patton kerrs country house in the berkshires near pittsfield carl wrote to her every day he told her apropos of touricars and roofgardens and aviation records and sunday motorcycling with bobby winslow that he loved her he even made at the end of his letters the oldfashioned lines of crosses to represent kisses whenever he hinted how much he missed her how much he wanted to feel her startle in his arms he wondered what she would read out of it wondered if she would put the letter under her pillow  she answered every other day with friendly letters droll in their descriptions of the people she met his call of love she did not answerdirectly but she admitted that she missed their playtimes and once she wrote to him late on a cold berkshire night with a black rain and wind like a baying bloodhound       it is so still in my room  so wild outside that i am      frightened i have tried to make myself smart in a blue silk      dressing gown  a tosh lace breakfast cap  i will write      neatly with a quill pen from the mayfair but just the same      i am a lonely baby  i want you here to comfort me would      you be too shocked to come i would put a navajo blanket on      my bed  a papier mach√© turkish dagger  head of othello      over my bed  pretend it was a cozy corner that is of      course if they still have papier mach√© ornaments i suppose      they still live in harlem  brooklyn we would sit very      quietly in two wicker chairs on either side of my fireplace       listen to the swollen brook in the ravine just below my      window but with no hawk here the wind keeps wailing that      pan is dead  that there wont ever again be any sunshine on      the valley dear it really isnt safe to be writing like      this after reading it you will suppose that its just you      that i am lonely for but of course id be glad for phil or      puggy crewden or your nice solemn walter macmonnies or any      suitor who would make foolish noises  hide me from the      winds hunting now i will seal this up  not send it in      the morning  your playmate ruth       here is one small kiss on the forehead but remember it is      just because of the wind  rain  presumably she did mail the letter at least he received it  he carried her letters in the sidepocket of his coat till the envelopes were worn at the edges and nearly covered with smudged pencilnotes about things he wanted to keep in mind and would of course have kept in mind without making notes he kept finding new meanings in her letters he wanted them to indicate that she loved him and any ambiguous phrase signified successively that she loved laughed at loathed and loved him once he got up from bed to take another look at a letter and see whether she had said i hope you had a dear good time at the explorers club dinner or i hope you had a good time dear  carl was entirely sincere in his worried investigation of her state of mind he knew that both ruth and he had the instability as well as the initiative of the vagabond as quickly as they had claimed each other so quickly could either of them break loves alliance if bored carl himself being anything but bored was as faithfully devoted as the least enterprising of moral young men he forgot gertie did not write to istra nash the artist and when the vanzile office got a new telephonegirl a tall languorous brunette with shadowy eyes and fine cheeks he did not even smile at her  butwas ruth so bound she still refused to admit even that she could fall in love he knew that ruth and he were not romantic characters but everyday people with a tendency to quarrel and demand and be slack he knew that even if the rose dream came true there would be drab spots in it and now that she was away with lenox and polo to absorb her could the gauche ignorant carl ericson that he privately knew himself to be retain her interest  late in july he received an invitation to spend a weekend friday to tuesday with ruth at the patton kerrs     chapter xxxix   the brief trip to the berkshires was longer than any he had taken these nine months he looked forward animatedly to the journey remembering details of travelsuch trivial touches as the oval brass washbowls of a pullman sleeper and how when the water is running out the inside of the bowl is covered with a whitish film of water which swiftly peels off he recalled the cracked white paint of a steamers ventilator the abruptly stopping zhhhhh of a foghorn the vast smoky roof of a philadelphia trainshed clamorous with the trainbells of a strange town giving a sense of mystery to the traveler stepping from the car for a moment to stretch his legs an ugly junction station platform with resin oozing from the heavy planks in the spring sun the polished binnacle of the ss panama  he expected keen joy in new fields and hills yet all the way north he was trying to hold the train back in a few minutes now he would see ruth and at this hour he did not even know definitely that he liked her  he could not visualize her he could see the sleeve of her blue corduroy jacket her eyes he could not see she was a stranger had he idealized her he was apologetic for his unflattering doubt but of what sort was she  the train was stopping at her station with rattling windows and a despairing grind of the wheels carl seized his overnight bag and suitcase with fictitious enthusiasm he was in a panic emerging from the safe impersonal train upon the platform he saw her  she was waving to him from a oneseated phaeton come alone to meet himand she was the adorable the perfect comrade he thought jubilantly as he strode along the platform shes wonderful love her should say i do  while they drove under the elms past white cottages and the village green while they were talking so lightly and properly that none of the new england gossips could be wounded in the sense of propriety carl was learning her anew she was an outdoor girl now in lowcollared blouse and white linen skirt he rejoiced in her modulating laugh the contrast of blue eyes and dark brows under her panama hat her full dark hair with a lock sundrenched her bare throat boyishly brown femininely smooth the sweet clean finetextured girl flesh of the hollow of one shoulder faintly to be seen in the shadow of her broad drooping collar one hand with a curious ring of rose quartz and steel points excitedly pounding a tattoo of greeting with the whiphandle her spirited irreverences regarding the people they passed chatter which showed the world transformed as through ruby glassa ruth radiant understanding his comrade she was all that he had believed during her absence and doubted while he was coming to her but he had no time to repent of his doubt now so busily was he exulting to himself slipping a hand under her arm love her ishouldsayido  the carriage rolled out of town with the rhythmic creak of a country buggy climbed a hill range by means of the black oily state road and turned upon a sandy sideroad a brook ran beside them sunny fields alternated with woods leaffloored quiet holymiraculous after the weary city below was a vista of downwardsloping fields divided by creepercovered stone walls then a sunmeshed valley set with ponds like shining glass dishes on a green tablecloth beyond all a long reach of hillsides covered with unbroken fleecy forest like green down  so much unspoiled country and yet theres people herded in subways complained carl  they drove along a level road lined with wild raspberrybushes and full of a thin jade light from the shading maples they gossiped of the patton kerrs and the berkshires of the difference between the professional english weekender and the american who still has something of the na√Øve provincial delight of going visiting of new york and the dunleavys but their talk lulled to a nervous hush it seemed to him that a great voice cried from the clouds it is beside ruth that you are sitting ruth whose arm you feel in silence he caught her left hand  as he slowly drew back her hand and the reins with it to stop the ambling horse the two children stared straight at each other hungry tremulously afraid their kissnot only their lips but their spirits met without one reserve a straining long kiss as though they were forcing their lips into one body of living flame a kiss in which his eyes were blind to the enchantment of the jade light about them his ears deaf to brook and rustling forest all his senses were concentrated on the close warmth of her misty lips the curve of her young shoulder her woman sweetness and longing then his senses forgot even her lips and floated off into a blurred trance of bodiless happinessthe kiss of nirvana no foreign thought of trains or people or the future came now to drag him to earth it was the most devoted most sacred moment he had known  as he became again conscious of lips and cheek and brave shoulders and of her widespread fingers gripping his upper arm she was slowly breaking the spell of the kiss but again and again she kissed him hastily savage tokens of rejoicing possession  she cried i do know now i do love you  blessed  in silence they stared into the woods while her fingers smoothed his knuckles her eyes were faint with tears in the magic jade light  i didnt know a kiss could be like that she marveled presently i wouldnt have believed selfish ruth could give all of herself  yes it was the whole universe  hawk dear i wasnt experimenting that time im glad glad to know i can really love not just curiosity ive wanted you so all day i thought four oclock wouldnt ever comeand oh darling my dear dear hawk i didnt even know for sure id like you when you came sometimes i wanted terribly to have your silly foolish childish pale hair on my breastsuch hair ladys hairbut sometimes i didnt want to see you at all and i was frightened at the thought of your coming and i fussed around the house till mrs pat laughed at me and accused me of being in love and i denied itand she was right  blessed i was scared to death all the way up here i didnt think you could be as wonderful as i knew you were that sounds mixed but oh blessed blessed you really love me you really love me its hard to believe ive actually heard you say it and i love you so completely everything  i love you that is such an adorable spot to kiss just below your ear she said darling keep me safe in the little house of arms where theres only room for you and meno room for offices or aunt emmas but not now we must hurry on if a wagon had been coming along the road  as they entered the rhododendronlined drive of the patton kerr place carl remembered a detail not important but usual oh yes he said ive forgotten to propose  need you proposals sound like contracts and all those other dull forms not likethat kiss see theres pat kerr jr waving to us you can just make him out there on the upper balcony he is the darlingest child with ashblond hair cut dutch style i wonder if you didnt look like him when you were a boy with your light hair  not a chance i was a grubby kid made noises gee what a bully place and the house will you marry me  yes i will it is a dear place mrs pat is  when  always fussing over it she plants narcissuses and crocuses in the woods so you find them growing wild  i like those awnings against the white walls may i consider that we are engaged then miss winslowengaged for the next marriage  oh no no not engaged dear dont you know its one of my principles  but look  not to be engaged hawk everybody brings the cunnin old jokes out of the mothballs when youre engaged ill marry you

perhaps ill marry you in september um frightens me to think of it frightens me and awes me and amuses me to death all at once that is i shall marry you unless you take to wearing pearlgray derbies or white evening ties with black edging or kill mason in a duel or do something equally disgraceful but engaged i will not be and well put the money for a diamond ring into a big davenport are we going to be dreadfully poor  oh not pawnshop poor i made vanzile boost my salary last week and with my touricar stock im getting a little over four thousand dollars a year  is that lots or little  well it ll give us a decent apartment and a nearly decent maid i guess and if the touricar keeps going we can beat it off for a year wandering after maybe three four years  i hope so here we are thats mrs pat waiting for us  the patton kerr house set near the top of the highest hill in that range of the berkshires stood out white against a slope of crisp green an old manor house of long lines and solid beams with striped awnings of red and white and in front a brick terrace with basketchairs a swinging couch and a wicker teatable already welcomingly spread with a service of royal doulton from the terrace one saw miles of valley and hills and villages strung on a rambling river the valley was a golden bowl filled with the peace of afternoon a world of sun and listening woods  on the terrace waited a woman of thirtyfive of clever face a bit worn at the edges carefully coiffed hair and careless white blouse with a tweed walkingskirt she was gracefully holding out her hand greeting carl its terribly good of you to come clear out into our wilderness she was interrupted by the bouncing appearance of a stocky handsome redfaced fullchinned curlyblackhaired man of forty in ridingbreeches and boots and a silk shirt with him an excited small boy in romperspatton kerr sr and jr  here you are senior observantly remarked glad to see you ericson you and ruthie been a deuce of a time coming up from town holding hands along the road eh lord these aviators  pat  animal  protested mrs kerr and ruth simultaneously  all right ill be good saw you fly at nassau boulevard ericson turned my horn loose and hooted till they thought i was a militant like ruthie here lord what flying what flying id like to see you race weymann and vedrines ruthie will you show mr ericson where his room is or has poor old pat got to go and drag a servant away from reading town topics heh  i will pat said ruth  i will daddy cried pat jr  no my son i guess maybe ruthie had better do it theres a certain look in her eyes  basilisk  salamander  ruth and carl passed through the wide colonial hall with mahogany tables and portraits of the kerrs and the sword of colonel patton at the far end was an open door and a glimpse of an oldfashioned garden radiant with hollyhocks and canterbury bells it was a world of utter content as they climbed the curving stairs ruth tucked her arm in his saying  now do you see why i wont be engaged pat kerr is the best chum in the world yet he finds even a possible engagement wildly humorouslike mothersinlaw or poets or falling on your ear  but gee ruth you are going to marry me  you little child my little boy hawk of course im going to marry you do you think i would miss my chance of a cabin in the rockies my famous hawk what everybody cheered at nassau boulevard she opened the door of his room with a deferential thy chamber milord come down quickly she said we mustnt miss a moment of these days i am frank with you about how glad i am to have you here you must be good to me you will prize my love a little wont you before he could answer she had run away  after half homecomings and false homecomings the adventurer had really come home  he inspected the gracious room its chintz hangings fourposter bed low wicker chair by the fireplace fresh cherokee roses on the mantel a room of cheerfulness and open spaces he stared into woods where a cool light lay on moss and fern he did not need to remember ruths kisses for each breath of hilltop air each emerald of moss each shining mahogany surface in the room repeated to him that he had found the grail whose other name is love  saturday they loafed over breakfast the sun licking the treetops in the ravine outside the windows and they motored with the kerrs to lenox returning through the darkness till midnight they talked on the terrace they loafed again the next morning and let the fresh air dissolve the office grime which had been coating his spirit they were so startlingly original as to be simplehearted country lovers in the afternoon declining kerrs offer of a car and rambling off on bicycles  from a rise they saw water gleaming among the trees the sullen green of pines set off the silvery green of barley and an orchard climbed the next rise the smoky shadow of another hill range promised long cool forest roads crows were flying overhead going where they would the aviator and the girl who read psychology modern lovers stood hand in hand as though the age of machinery were a myth as though he were a piping minstrel and she a shepherdess before them was the open road and all around them the hum of bees  a close listless heat held monday afternoon even on the hilltop the clay tenniscourt was baking the worn bricks of the terrace reflected a furnace glow the kerrs had disappeared for a nap carl lounging with ruth on the swinging couch in the shade thought of the slaves in new york offices and tenements then because he would himself be back in an office next day he let the glare of the valley soothe him with its wholesome heat  certainly would like a swim he remarked couldnt we bike down to fishers pond or maybe take the ford  lets but theres no bathhouse  put a bathingsuit under your dress sun ll dry it in no time after the swim  as you command my liege and she ran in to change  they motored down to fishers pond which is a lake and stopped in a natural woodlandopening like a dimlighted greenroom from it stretched the enameled lake the farther side reflecting unbroken woods the nearer wateredge was exquisite in its clearness they saw perch fantastically floating over the pale sand bottom among scattered reeds whose watery green stalks were like the thin columns of a dancinghall for small fishes the surface of the lake satiny as the palm of a girls hand broke in the tiniest of ripples against white quartz pebbles on the hot shore cool flashing goldensanded the lake coaxed them out of their forest room  a lot like the minnesota lakes only smaller said carl im going right in about ready for a swim come on  im affraid she suddenly plumped on the earth and hugged her skirts about her ankles  why blessed what you scared of no sharks here and no undertow nice white sand  oh hawk i was silly i felt i was such an independent modern woman aaand i arent ive always said it was silly for girls to swim in a womans bathingsuit skirts are so cumbersome so i put on a boys bathingsuit under my dressandim terribly embarrassed  why blessedwell i guess youll have to decide his voice was somewhat shaky awful scared of carl  yes i thought i wouldnt be with you but im selfconscious as can be  well gee i dont know of coursewell ill jump in and you can decide  he peeled off his white flannels and stood in his blue bathingsuit not statuelike not very brown now but trimwaisted shapely armed wonderfully clean of neck and jaw with a wheee he dashed into the water and swam out overhand  as he turned over and glanced back his heart caught to see her standing on the creamy sand a shy elfin figure in a boys bathingsuit of black wool woman and slim boy in one silkenthroated and gracefullimbed curiously smaller than when dressed her white skirt and blouse lay tumbled about her ankles she raised rosy arms to hide her flushed face and her eyes as she cried  dont look  he obediently swam on with a tenderness more poignant than longing he heard her splashing behind him and turned again to see her racing through the water those soft yet not narrow shoulders rose and fell sturdily under the wet black wool her eyes shone and she was all comradely boy save for her dripping splendid hair singing come on lazy she headed across the pond he swam beside her reveling in the wellbeing of cool water and warm air till they reached the solemn shade beneath the trees on the other side and floated in the dark still water splashing idle hands gazing into forest hollows spying upon the brisk business of squirrels among the acorns  back at their greenwood room ruth wrapped her sailor blouse about her and they squatted like unselfconscious children on the beach while from a field a distant locust fiddled his august fandango and in flamecolored pride an oriole went by fresh sky sunfish like tropic shells in the translucent water arching reeds dipping their olivegreen points in the water wavelets rustling against a gray neglected rowboat and beside him ruth  musingly they built a castle of sand an hour of understanding so complete that it made the heart melancholy when he sighed getting late come on blessed were dry now it seemed that they could never again know such rapt tranquillity  yet they did for that evening when they stood on the terrace trying to forget that he must leave her and go back to the lonely city in the morning when the mist reached chilly tentacles up from the valley they kissed a shy goodby and carl knew that lifes real adventure is not adventuring but finding the playmate with whom to quest lifes meaning     chapter xl   after six festival months of married lifein april or may 1914the happy mrs carl ericson did not have many modern theories of marriage in general though it was her theory that she had such theories like a majority of intelligent men and women ruth was in her rebellion against the canonical marriage of slipperwarming and obedience emphatic but vague she was of precise opinion regarding certain details of marriage but in general as inconsistent as her library it is a human characteristic to be belligerently sure as to whether one prefers plush or rattan upholstery on car seatsbut not to consider whether government ownership of railroads will improve upholstering to know with certainty of perception that it is a bore to have ones husband laugh at ones pet economy of matches or string or icebut to be blandly willing to leave all theories of polygamy and polyandry monogamy and varietism to the clever russian jews  as regards details ruth definitely did want a bedroom of her own a desire which her mother would have regarded as somehow immodest she definitely did want shaving and hairbrushing kept in the background she did not want carl the lover to drift into carl the husband she did not want them to lose touch with other people and she wanted to keep the spice of madness which from the first had seasoned their comradeship  these things she delightfully had in may 1914  they were largely due to her own initiative carls drifting theories of social structure concerned for the most part the wages of workmen and the ridiculousness of class distinctions reared in the farming district the amateur college the garage and the hangar he had not despite imagination devoted two seconds to such details as the question of whether there was freedom and reposenot to speak of a variety of taste as regards opening windows and sleeping diagonally across a bedin having separate bedrooms much though he had been persuaded to read of modern fiction his race still believed that marriage bells and roses were the proper portions of marriage to think about  it was due to ruth too that they had so amiable a flat carl had been made careless of surroundings by years of hotels and furnished rooms there was less real significance for him in the beauty of his first home than in the fact that they two had a bathroom of their own that he no longer had to go clad in a drab bathrobe laden with shaving materials and a towel and talcum powder and a broken handmirror and a toothbrush like a perambulating drugstore toiletcounter down a boardinghouse hall to that modified hall bedroom with a tin tub which his doctorlandlord had called a bathroom pictures it must be admitted give a room an air pleasant it is to sit in large chairs by fireplaces and feel yourself a landed gentleman but nothing filled carl with a more delicateand truly spiritualsatisfaction than having a porcelain tub plenty of hot water and the privilege of leaving his shavingbrush in the ericson bathroom with a fair certainty of finding it there when he wanted to shave in a hurry  but careless of surroundings or not carl was stirred when on their return from honeymooning in the adirondacks he carried ruth over the threshold and they stood together in the livingroom of their home  it was a room to live in and laugh in the woodwork was whiteenameled the walls covered with gray japanese paper there were no porti√®res between livingroom and diningroom and small hall so that the three rooms with their lightreflecting walls gave an effect of spaciousness to rather a cramped and oldfashioned apartment there were not many pictures and no bric√†brac yet the rooms were not bare but clean and trim and distinguished with the large davenport and the wingchair chintzcushioned brown willow chairs and ruths upright piano excellent mahogany and a few good rugs there were only two or three vases and they genuinely intended for holding flowers and there was a bare mantelpiece that rested the eyes over the fuzzily clean gaslog the pictures were chosen because they led the imagination onetchings and color prints largely by unknown artists like windows looking on delightful country the chairs assembled naturally in groups the whole unit of three rooms suggested people talking it was home first and last though it was one cell in one layer of a sevenstory building on a street walled in with such buildings in a city which lined up more than three hundred of such streets from its southern tip to its northern limit along the hudson and threw in a couple of million people in brooklyn and the bronx  they lived in the nineties between broadway and riverside drive a few blocks from the winslow house in distance but one generation away in the matter of decoration the apartmenthouse itself was comparatively oldfashioned with an intermittent elevator run by an intermittent negro youth who gave most of his time to the telephone switchboard and mysterious duties in the basement also with a downstairs hall that was narrow and carpeted and lined with offensively dark wood but they could see the hudson from their livingroom on the sixth floor at the back of the house the agent assured them that probably not till the end of time would there be anything but low private houses between them and the river they were not haunted by aunt emma truegate winslow and ruth who had long been oppressed by latevictorian bric√†brac and american louis xvth furniture so successfully adopted elimination as the keynote that there was not one piece of furniture bought for the purpose of indicating that mr and mrs carl ericson were welltodo  she dared to tell friends who before the wedding inquired what she wanted that checks were welcome and need not be monogrammed even aunt emma had been willing to send a check provided they were properly married in st georges church consequently their six rooms showed a remarkable absence of such usual wedding presents as prints of the smugly smiling and eupeptic mona lisa three muffinstands in three degrees of marquetry three electroliers four punchbowls three sets of almonddishes a pair of birdcarvers that did not carve a bust of dante in new art marble or a de luxe set of de maupassant translated by a worthy lady with a french lexicon instead they bought what they wantedrather an impertinent thing to do but like most impertinences thoroughly worth while their livingroom was their own carls bedroom was white and simple though spotty with aviation medals and silver cups and monoplanes sketchily rendered in gold and signed photographs of aviators ruths bedroom was also plain and white and dull japanese gray a simple room with that simplicity of handembroidery real lace and fine linen appreciated by exclamatory women friends  she taught carl to say dahg instead of dawg for dog wawta instead of wotter for water whether she was more correct in her pronunciation or not does not matter new york said dahg and it amused him just then to be very eastern she taught him the theory of houselighting carl had no fanatical objection to unshaded incandescent bulbs glaring from the ceiling but he came to like the shaded electric lamps which ruth installed in the livingroom when she introduced four candles as sole lighting of the diningroom table however he grumbled loudly at his inability to see what he was eating she retired to her bedroom and he huffily went out to get a cigar at the cigarcounter he repented of all the unkind things he had ever done or could possibly do and returned to eat humble pieand eat it by candlelight inside of two weeks one of the things which carl ericson had always known was that the harmonious candlelight brought them close together at dinner  the teaching in this period of adjustments was not all on ruths part it was due to carls insistence that she tried to discover what her theological beliefs really were she admitted that only at twilight vespers with a gale of violins in an arched roof did she really worship in church she did not believe that priests and ministers who seemed to be ordinary men as regards earthly things had any extraordinary knowledge of the mysteries of heaven yet she took it for granted that she was a good christian she rarely disagreed with the dunleavys who were catholics or her aunt emma who regarded anything but high church episcopalianism as bad form or her brother mason who was an uneasy unitarian or carl who was an unaggressive agnostic  of the four it was carl who seemed to have the greatest interest in religions he blurted out such monologues as i wonder if it isnt pure egotism that makes a person believe that the religion he is born to is the best my country my religion my wife my businesswe think that whatever is ours is necessarily sacred or in other words that we are godsand then we call it faith and patriotism the hindu or the christian is equally ready to prove to youand mind you he may be a wise old man with a beardthat his national religion is obviously the only one find out what you yourself really do think and if you turn out a sunworshiper or a hardshell baptist why good luck if you dont think for yourself then youre admitting that your theory of happiness is the old dog asleep in the sun and maybe he is happier than the student but i think you like to experiment with life  his arguments were neither original nor especially logical they were largely given to him by bone stillman professor frazer and chance paragraphs in stray radical magazines but to ruth politely reared in a house with three maids where it was as tactless to discuss god as to discuss sex his defiances seemed terrifyingly new she was not the first who had complacently gone to church after reading bernard shaw but she did try to follow carls loose reasoning to find out what she thought and what the spiritual fashions of her neighborhood made her think she thought  the process gave her many anxious hours of alternating impatience with fixed religious dogmas and loneliness for the comfortable refuge of a personal god whose yearning had spoken to her in the gregorian chant she could never get herself to read more than two chapters of any book on the subject nor did she get much light from conversation one set of people supposed that christianity had so entirely disappeared from intelligent circles that it was not worth discussion another set supposed that no one but cranks ever thought of doubting the essentials of christianity and that therefore it was not worth discussion and to a few superb women whom she knew their religion was too sweet a reality to be subjected to the noisy chatter of discussion gradually ruth forgot to think often of the matter but it was always back in her mind                                       they were happy carl and ruth to their flat came such of ruths friends as she kept because she liked them for themselves with a fantastic assortment of personages and awkward rovers whom the exaviator knew the ericsons made an institution of bruncheonbreakfastluncheonat which coffee and eggs and deviled kidneys a table of auction bridge and a davenport of talk and a wingchair of sunday papers were to be had on sunday morning from ten to one at bruncheon walter macmonnies told to florence crewden his experiences in exploring southern greenland by aeroplane with the schliessbanning expedition at bruncheon bobby winslow now an interne talked baseball with carl at bruncheon phil dunleavy regarded cynically all the people he did not know and played piquet in a corner with ruths father  carl and ruth joined the peace waters country club and in the spring of 1914 went there nearly every saturday afternoon for tennis and a dance carl refused golf however he always repeated a shabby joke about the shame of taking advantage of such a tiny ball  he seemed content to stick to office home and tenniscourt it was ruth who planned their weekend trips proposed at 8 am saturday and begun at two that afternoon they explored the tangled rocks and woods of lloyds neck on long island sleeping in an abandoned shack curled together like kittens they swooped on a dutch village in new jersey spent the night with an old farmer and attended the dutch reformed church they tramped from new haven to hartford over easter carl was always ready for their gipsy journeys he responded to ruths visions of foaming south sea isles but he rarely sketched such pictures himself he had given all of himself to joy in ruth like many men called adventurers he was ready for anything but content with anything  it was ruth who was finding new voyages she kept up her settlement work and progressed to an active interest in the womens trade union league and took part in picketing during a panama hatworkers strike she may have had more curiosity than principle but she did badger policemen pluckily she was studying italian the montessori method cooking she taught new dishes to her maid she adopted a careless suggestion of carl and voluntarily increased the maids salary thereby shaking the rockribbed foundations of upper west side society  in nothing did she find greater satisfaction than in being neither the bride nor the little woman nor any like degrading thing which recently married girls are by their sentimental spinster friends expected to be she did not whisper the intimate details of her honeymoon to other young married women she did not run about quaintly and tinily telling her difficulties with household work  when a purring babytalking acquaintance gurgled how did the ruthie bride spend her morning did she cook some little dainty for her husband nothing bourgeois im sure in reply ruth pleasantly observed not a chance the ruthie bride cussed out the janitor for not shooting up a dainty cabbage on the dumbwaiter and then counted up her husbands cigarette coupons and skipped right down to the premium parlors with em and got him a pair of paleblue boston garters and a cunning graniteware stewpan and then sponged lunch off olive dunleavy but nothing bourgeois  such experiences told to carl he found diverting he seemed in the spring of 1914 to want no others     chapter xli   the apparently satisfactory development of the touricar in the late spring of 1914 was the result of an uneconomical expenditure of energy on the part of carl personally he followed by letter the trail of every amateur aviator every motoring biggame hunter he never let up for an afternoon vanzile had lost interest in the whole matter whenever carl thought of how much the development of the touricar business depended upon himself he was uneasy about the future and bent more closely over his desk on his way home swaying on a subway strap his pleasant sensation of returning to ruth was interrupted by worry in regard to things he might have done at the office nights he dreamed of lists of prospects  late in may he was disturbed for several days by headaches lassitude nausea he lied to ruth guess ive eaten something at lunch that was a little off you know what these restaurants are he admitted however that he felt like a symptom he stuck to the office though his chief emotion about life and business was that he wished to go off somewhere and lie down and die gently  directly after a sunday bruncheon at which he was silent and looked washed out he went to bed with typhoid fever  for six weeks he was ill he seemed daily to lose more of the boyishness which all his life had made him want to dance in the sun that loss was to ruth like a snickering hobgoblin attending the specter of death staying by him constantly forgetting in the intensity of her care even to want credit for virtue taking one splash at her tired eyes with boric acid and dashing back to his bed she mourned and mourned for her lost boy while she hid her fear and kept her blouses fresh and her hair wellcoiffed and mothered the stern man who lay so dreadfully still in the bed he was not shaved every day he had a pale beard under his hollow cheeks even when he was out of delirium even when he was comparatively strong he never said anything gaily foolish for the sake of being young and noisy with her  during convalescence carl was so wearily gentle that she hoped the little boy she loved was coming back to dwell in him but the hawks wings seemed broken for the first time carl was afraid of life he sat and worried going over the possibilities of the touricar and the positions he might get if the touricar failed he was willing to loaf by the window all day his eyes on a narrow bloodred stripe in the navajo blanket on his knees along which he incessantly ran a fingernail back and forth back and forth for whole quarterhours while she read aloud from kipling and london and conrad hoping to rekindle the spirit of daring  one sweet drop was in their cup of iron as woodland playmates they could never have known such intimacy as hovered about them when she rested her head lightly against his knees and they watched the hudson the storms and flurries of light on its waves the windy clouds and the processional of barges the beetlelike ferries and the great steamers for albany they talked in half sentences understanding the rest tough in winter might be good trip carls hand was always demanding her thick hair but he stroked it gently the coarse wholesome vigor was drained from him part even of his slang went with it his gee was not explosive  he took to watching her like a solemn baby when she moved about the room thus she found the little boy carl again laughed fullthroated and secretly cried over him as his sternness passed into a wistful obedience he was not quite the same impudent boy whose naughtiness she had loved but the good child who came in his place did trust her so depend upon her so  when carl was strong enough they went for three weeks to point pleasant on the jersey coast where the pines and breakers from the open sea healed his weakness and his multitudinous worries they even swam once and carl played at learning two new dances strangely called the fox trot and the lu lu fado their hotel was a vast barn all porches white flannels and handsome young jews chattering tremendously with young jewesses but its ballroom floor was smooth and ruth had lacked music and excitement for so long that she danced every night and conducted an amiable flirtation with a mysterious young man of harvard accent jewish features fine brown eyes and tortoiseshellrimmed eyeglasses while carl looked on a contented wallflower  they came back to town with ocean breeze and pine scent in their throats and seasparkle in their eyesand carl promptly tied himself to the office desk as though sickness and recovery had never given him a vision of play  ruth had not taken the point pleasant dances seriously but as day on day she stifled in a halfdarkened flat that summer she sometimes sobbed at the thought of the moonpath on the sea the reflection of lights on the ballroom floor the wavelike swish of musicmad feet  the flat was hot dead the summer heat was unrelenting as bedclothes drawn over the head and lashed down flies in sneering circles mocked the listless hand she flipped at them too hot to wear many clothes yet hating the disorder of a flimsy neglig√©e she panted by a window while the venomous sun glared on tin roofs and a few feet away snarled the ceaseless trrrrrr of a steamriveter that was erecting new flats to shut off their view of the hudson in the lavapaved back yard was the insistent filelike voice of the janitors son who kept piping haaay billay hey billys got a girl hey billys got a girl haaay billay she imagined herself going down and slaughtering him vividly saw herself waiting for the elevator venturing into the hot sepulcher of the back areaway and there becoming too languid to complete the task of ridding the world of the dear child she was horrified to discover what she had been imagining and presently imagined it all over again  two blocks across from her seen through the rising walls of the new apartmenthouses were the drab windows of a group of rundown tenements which broke the sleek respectability of the welltodo quarter in those windows ruth observed foreignlooking idle women not very clean who had nothing to do after they had completed half an hour of slovenly housework in the morning they watched their neighbors breathlessly they peered out with the petty virulent curiosity of the workless at whatever passed in the streets below them fifty times a day they could be seen to lean far out on their fireescapes and follow with slowly craning necks and unblinking eyes the passing of somethingicewagons undertakers wagons oleclo men ruth surmised the rest of the time raggedhaired and greasy of wrapper gumchewing and yawning they rested their unlovely stomachs on discolored sofacushions on the windowsills and waited for something to appear two blocks away they wereyet to ruth they seemed to be in the room with her claiming her as one of their sisterhood for now she was a useless woman as they were she raged with the thought that she might grow to be like them in every respectshe ruth winslow she wondered if any of them were norwegians named ericson with the fascination of dread she watched them as closely as they watched the world with the hypnotization of unspeakable hopelessness she had to find her work something for which the world needed her lest she be left here useless and unhappy in a flat in her kitchen she was merely an intruder on the efficient maid and there was no nursery  she sat apprehensively on the edge of a chair hating the women at the windows hating the dull persistent flies hating the wetness of her forehead and the dampness of her palm repenting of her hate and hating againand taking another cold bath to be fresh for the homecoming of carl the tired man whom she had to mother and whom of all the world she did not hate  even on the many cool days when the streets and the flat became tolerable and the vulture women of the tenements ceased to exist for her ruth was not much interested whether she went out or some one came to see her every one she knew except for the dunleavys and a few others was out of town and she was tired of olive dunleavys mirth and shallow gossip after her days with carl in the valley of the shadow olive was to her a stranger giggling about strange people phil was rather better he occasionally came in for tea poked about stared at the color prints and said cryptic things about feminism and playing squash  her settlementhouse classes were closed for the summer she brooded over the settlement work and accused herself of caring less for people than for the sensation of being charitable she wondered if she was a hypocrite then she would take another cold bath to be fresh for the homecoming of carl the tired man whom she had to mother and toward whom of all the worlds energies she knew that she was not hypocritical  this is not the story of ruth winslow but of carl ericson yet ruths stifling days are a part of it for her unhappiness meant as much to him as it did to her in the swelter of his office overlooking motorhooting gasolinereeking broadway he was aware that ruth was in the flat buried alive he made plans for her going away but she refused to desert him he tried to arrange for a week more of holiday for them both he could not he came to understand that he was now completely a prisoner of business  he was in a rut both sides of which were hedged with back work that had piled up on him he had no desire no ambition no interest except in ruth and in making the touricar pay  the touricar company had never paid expenses as yet how much longer would old vanzile be satisfied with millions to come in the futureperhaps  carl even took work home with him though for ruths sake he wanted to go out and play it really was for her sake he himself liked to play but the disease of perpetual overwork had hold of him he was glad to have her desert him for an evening now and then and go out to the peace waters country club for a dance with phil and olive dunleavy she felt guilty when she came home and found him still making calculations but she hummed waltzes while she put on a thin blue silk dressinggown and took down her hair  i cant stand this grubby shutin prison she finally snapped at him on an evening when he would not go to the first night of a roofgarden  he snarled back you dont have to why dont you go with your bloomin phil and olive of course i dont ever want to go myself  see here my friend you have been taking advantage for a long time now of the fact that you were ill im not going to be your nurse indefinitely she slammed her bedroom door  later she came stalking out very dignified and left the flat he pretended not to see her but as soon as the elevator door had clanged and the rumbling old car had begun to carry her down away from him the flat was noisy with her absence she came home eagerly sorryto find an eagerly sorry carl then while they cried together and he kissed her lips they made a compact that no matter for what reason or through whose fault they might quarrel they would always settle it before either went to bed but they were uncomfortably polite for two days and obviously were so afraid that they might quarrel that they were both prepared to quarrel  carl had been back at work for less than one month but he hoped that the touricar was giving enough promise now of positive success to permit him to play during the evening he rented a vanzile car for part time planned weekend trips hoped they could spend  then the whole world exploded  just at the time when the investigation of twilight sleep indicated that the world might become civilized the powers plunged into a war whose reason no man has yet discovered carl read the headlines on the morning of august 5th 1914 with a delusion of not reading news but history with himself in the history book  ten thousand books record the great war and how bitterly europe realized it this is to record that carl like most of america did not comprehend it even when recruits of the kaiser marched down broadway with german and american flags intertwined even when his business was threatened it was too big for his imagination  every noon he bought half a dozen newspaper extras and hurried down to the bulletinboards on the times and herald buildings he pretended that he was a character in one of the fantastic novels about a worldwar when he saw such items as russians invading prussia japs will enter war aeroplane and submarine attack english cruiser  rats he said im dreaming there couldnt be a war like that were too civilized i can prove the whole thing s impossible  in the worldpuzzle nothing confused carl more than the question of socialism he had known as a final fact that the alliance of french and german socialist workmen made war between the two nations absolutely impossibleand his knowledge was proven ignorance his faith folly he tentatively bought a socialist magazine or two to find some explanation and found only greater confusion on the part of the scholars and leaders of the party they too did not understand how it had all happened they stood amid the ruins of international socialism sorrowing if their faith was darkened how much more so was carls vague untutored optimism about worldbrotherhood  he had two coursesto discard socialism as a failure or to stand by it as a course of action which was logical but had not as yet been able to accomplish its end he decided to stand by it he could not see himself plunging into the unutterable pessimism of believing that all of mankind were such beast fools that after this one great sin they could not repent and turn from tribal murder and what other remedy was there if socialism had not prevented the war neither had monarchy nor bureaucracy bourgeois peace movements nor the church                                       with a whole world at war carl thought chiefly of his own business he was not abnormal the press was filled with bewildered queries as to what would happen to america for two weeks the automobile business seemed dead save for a grim activity in wartrucks vanzile called in carl and shook his head over the future of the touricar now that all luxuries were threatened  but the middle west promised a huge crop and prosperity the east followed then slowly the south despite the closed outlet for its cotton crop within a few weeks all sorts of motorcars were selling well especially expensive cars it was apparent that automobiles were no longer merely luxuries there was even a promise of greater trade than ever so rapidly were all the cars of the warring nations being destroyed  but once vanzile had considered the possibility of letting go his touricar interest in order to be safe he seemed always to be considering it carl read fate in vanziles abstracted manner and if vanzile withdrew carls own stock would be worthless but he stuck at his work with something of a boys frightened stubbornness and something of a mans quiet sternness fear was never far from him in an aeroplane he had never been greatly frightened he could himself by his own efforts fight the wind but how could he steer a worldwar or a worldindustry  he tried to conceal his anxiety from ruth but she guessed it she said one evening sometimes i think we two are unusual because we really want to be free and then a thing like this war comes and our bread and butter and little pink cakes are in danger and i realize were not free at all that were just like all the rest prisoners dependent on how much the job brings and how fast the subway runs oh sweetheart we mustnt forget to be just a bit mad no matter how serious things become standing very close to him she put her head on his shoulder  sure mustnt must stick by each other all the more when the world takes a run and jumps on us  indeed we will                                       unsparingly the wars cosmic idiocy continued and carl crawled along the edge of a business precipice looking down he became so accustomed to it that he began to enjoy the view the old carl with the enthusiasm which had served him for that undefined quality called courage began to come to life again laughing let the darned old business bust if shes going to  only it refused to bust  it kept on trembling while carl became nervous again then gaily defiant then nervous again till the alternation of gloom and bravado disgusted him and made ruth wonder whether he was an officeslave or a freebooter as he happened to be both at the time it was hard for him to be either convincingly she accused him of vacillating he retorted the suspense kept them both raw  to add to their difficulties of adjustment to each other and to the egomad world ruths sense of established amenities was shocked by the reappearance of carls pioneering past as revealed in the lively but vulgar person of martin dockerill carls former aviation mechanic  martin dockerill was lanky and awkward as ever he still wrote postcards to his aunt in fall river and admired burlesqueshow choruses but he no longer played the mouthorgan publicly for he had become so welltodo as to be respectable as foreign agent for the des moines autotruck company he had toured europe selling wartrucks or lorries as the english called them first to the balkan states then to italy russia and turkey he was for a time detailed to the new york office  it did not occur either to him nor to carl that he was not welcome to drop in any time often as possible to slap carl on the back loudly recollect the time when he had got drunk and fought with a policeman in san antonio or to spend a whole evening belligerently discussing the idea of war or types of motortrucks when ruth wistfully wanted carl to herself martin supposed because she smiled that she was as interested as carl in his theories about aeroplanescouting in war  ruth knew that most of carls life had been devoted to things quite outside her own sphere of action but she had known it without feeling it his talk with martin showed her how sufficient his life had been without her she began to worry lest he go back to aviation  so began their serious quarrels there were not many of them and they were forgotten out of existence in a day or two but there were at least three pitched battles during which both of them believed that this ended everything they quarreled always about the one thing which had intimidated them beforethe need of quarreling though apropos of this every detail of life came up ruths conformities her fear that he would fly again her fear that the wavering job was making him indecisive  and martin dockerill kept coming as an excellent startingpoint for dissension  ruth did not dislike martins roughness but when the exmechanic discovered that he was making more money than was carl and asked carl in her presence if hed like a loan then she hated martin and would give no reason she became unable to see him as anything but a boor an upstart servant whose friendship with carl indicated that her husband too was an outsider believing that she was superbly holding herself in she asked carl if there was not some way of tactfully suggesting to martin that he come to the flat only once in two weeks instead of two or three times a week carl was angry she said furiously what she really thought and retired to aunt emmas for the evening when she returned she expected to find carl as repentant as herself unfortunately that same carl who had declared that it was pure egotism to regard ones own religion or country as necessarily sacred regarded his own friends as sacreda noble faith which is an important cause of political graft he was ramping about the livingroom waiting for a fightand he got it  their moment of indiscretion the inevitable time when believing themselves fearlessly frank they exaggerated every memory of an injury ruth pointed out that carl had disliked florence crewden as much as she had disliked martin she renewed her accusation that he was vacillating scoffed at walter macmonnies whom she really liked gertie cowles whom she had never met and even hesitatingly carls farmer relatives  and carl was equally unpleasant at her last thrust he called her a thinblooded newyorker and slammed his bedroom door they had broken their pledge not to go to bed on a quarrel  he was gone before she came out to breakfast in the morning  in the evening they were perilously polite again martin dockerill appeared and while ruth listened carl revealed how savagely his mind had turned overnight to a longing for such raw adventuring as she could never share he feverishly confessed that he had for many weeks wavered between hating the whole war and wanting to enlist in the british aero corps to get lifes supreme sensationscouting ten thousand feet in air while dozens of batteries fired at him a nosetoearth volplane the thinking carl the playmate carl that ruth knew was masked as the foolhardy adventurerand as one who was not merely talking but might really do the thing he pictured and martin dockerill seemed so dreadfully to take it for granted that carl might go  carls high note of madness dropped to a matteroffact chatter about a kind of wandering which shut her out as completely as did the project of war i dont know said he but what the biggest fun in chasing round the country is to get up from a pile of lumber where youve pounded your ear all night and get that funny railroad smell of greasy waste and then throw your feet for a handout and sneak on a blind and go hiking off to some town youve never heard of with every brakie and constabule out after you thats living  when martin was gone carl glanced at her she stiffened and pretended to be absorbed in a magazine he took from the mess of papers and letters that lived in his inside coat pocket a warmap he had clipped from a newspaper and drew tactical lines on it from his room he brought a small book he had bought that day he studied it intently ruth managed to see that the title of the book was aeroplanes and airscouting in the european armies  she sprang up cried hawk why are you reading that  why shouldnt i read it  you dont mean to you  oh no i dont suppose id have the nerve to go and enlist now youve already pointed out to me that ive been getting cold feet  but why do you shut me out why do you  oh good lord have we got to go all over that again weve gone over it and over it and over it till im sick of telling you it isnt true  im very sorry hawk thank you for making it clear to me that im a typical silly wife  and thank you for showing me im a clumsy brute youve done it quite often now of course it doesnt mean anything that ive given up aviation  oh dont be melodramatic or if you must be dont fail to tell me that ive ruined your life  very well i wont say anything then ruth  dont look at me like that hawk so hard studying me cant you understand havent you any perception cant you understand how hard it is for me to come to you like this after last night and try  very nice of you he said grimly  with one cry of oh she ran into her bedroom  he could hear her sobbing he could feel her agony dragging him to her but no womans arms should drug his anger this time to let it ache again for once he definitely did not want to go to her so futile to make up and quarrel make up and quarrel he was impatient that her distant sobs expressed so clearly a wordless demand that he come to her and make peace hell he crawked jerked his topcoat from its nail and left the flateleven oclock of a chilly november evening     chapter xlii   dizzy with all the problems of life he did not notice where he went he walked blocks took a trolleycar got off to buy a strong cigar took the next trolley that came along was carried across the fiftyninth street bridge to long island at the eighth or tenth stop he hurried out of the car just as it was starting again he wondered why he had been such a fool as to leave it in a dark street of flatfaced wooden houses with dooryards of trampled earth and a general air of poverty goats and lunchpails he tramped on a sullen and youthless man presently he was in shaggy open country  he was frightened by his desertion of ruth but he did not want to go back nor even telephone to her he had to diagram where and what and why he was determine what he was to do  he disregarded the war as a cause of trouble had there been no extra businesspressure caused by the war there would have been some other focus for their misunderstandings they would have quarreled over clothes and aviation aunt emma and martin dockerill poverty and dancing quite the same  walking steadily with long periods when he did not think but stared at the dusty stars or the shaky illlighted old houses he alined her every fault unhappily rehearsed every quarrel in which she had been to blame his lips moving as he emphasized the righteous retorts he was almost certain he had made it was not hard to find faults in her any two people who have spent more than two days together already have the material for a lifelong feud in traits which at first were amusing or admirable ruths pretty manners of which carl had been proud he now cited as snobbish affectation he did not spare his reverence his passion his fondness he mutilated his soul like a hermit he recalled her pleasure in giving him jolly surprises in writing unexpected notes addressed to him at the office as fussy discontent with a quiet normal life he regarded her excitement over dances as evidence that she was so dependent on countryclub society that he would have to spend the rest of his life drudging for her  he wanted to flee he saw the whole world as a conspiracy of secret sinister powers that are concealed from the child but to the man are gradually revealed by a pitiless and neverending succession of misfortunes he would never be footloose again his land of hearts desire would be the office  but the ache of disappointment grew dull he was stunned he did not know what had happened did not even know precisely how he came to be walking here now and then he remembered anew that he had sharply left ruthruth his dear girlremembered that she was not at hand ready to explain with loves lips the somber puzzles of life he was frightened again and beginning to be angry with himself for having been angry with ruth  he had walked many miles brown fields came up at him through the paling darkness a signboard showed that he was a few miles from mineola letting the coming dawn uplift him he tramped into mineola with a halfplan of going on to the nearby hempstead plains aviation field to see if there was any earlymorning flying it would be bully to see a machine again  at a lunchwagon he ordered buckwheatcakes and coffee sitting on a high stool before a seveninch shelf attached to the wall facing an array of saltcastors and catsupbottles and one of those colored glass windows with a portrait of washington which give to all lunchwagons their air of sober refinement carl ate solemnly meditatively it did not seem to him an ignoble setting for his grief but he was depressed when he came out to a drab first light of day that made the street seem hopeless and unrested after the night the shops were becoming visible gray and chilly like a justawakened janitor in slippers suspenders and tousled hair the pavement was wet carl crossed the street stared at the flyspecked cover of a magazine six months old that lay in a shop window lighted by one incandescent he gloomily planned to go back and have another cup of coffee on the shelf before washingtons glassy but benign face  but he looked down the street and all the sky was becoming a delicate and luminous blue  he trotted off toward hempstead plains  the aviation field was almost abandoned most of the ambitious line of hangars were empty now with faded grass thick before the great doors that no one ever opened a recent fire had destroyed a group of five hangars  he found one door open and three sleepy youngsters in sweaters and khaki trousers bringing out a monoplane  carl watched them start bobbed his chin to the music of the motor saw the machine canter down the field and ascend from dawn to the glory of day the rising sun picked out the lines of the uninclosed framework and hovered on the silvery wingsurface the machine circled the field at two hundred feet elevation smoothly peacefully and peace beyond understanding came to carl  he studied the flight mm good and steady banks a little sharp but very thorough firs rate i believe i could get more speed out of her if i were flying like to try  wonderingly he realized that he did not want to fly that only his lips said like to try he was almost as much an outsider to aviation as though he had never flown he discovered that he was telling ruth this fact in an imaginary conversation was commenting for her on dawnsky and the plains before him and his alienation from exploits in which she could not share  the monoplane landed with a clean volplane the aviator and his mechanicians were wheeling it toward the hangar they glanced at him uninterestedly carl understood that to them he was a typical bystander here where he had once starred  the aviator stared again let go the machine walked over exclaiming say arent you hawk ericson this is an honor i heard you were somewhere in new york just missed you at the aero club one night wanted to ask you about the bagby hydro wont you come in and have some coffee and sinkers with us proud to have you my name s berry  thanks be glad to  while the youngsters were admiring him hearing of the giants of earlier days while they were drinking inspiration from this veteran of twentynine they were in turn inspiring carl by their faith in him he had been humble they made him trust himself not egotistically but with a feeling that he did matter that it was worth while to be in tune with life  yet all the while he knew that he wanted to be by himself because he could thus be with the spirit of ruth and he knew subconsciously that he was going to hurry back to mineola and telephone to her  as he dogtrotted down the road he noted the old dutch houses for her picked out the spot where he had once had a canvas hangar and fancied himself telling her of those days he did not remember that at this hangar he had known istra istra nash the artist whose name he scarce recalled istra was an incident ruth was the meaning of his life  and the solution of his problem came all at once when suddenly it was given to him to understand what that problem was  ruth and he had to be up and away immediately go any place do anything so long as they followed new trails and followed them together he knew positively after his lonely night that he could not be happy without her as comrade in the freedom he craved and he also knew that they had not done the one thing for which their marriage existed they were not just a man and a woman they were a man and a woman who had promised to find new horizons for each other  however much he believed in the sanctity of loves children carl also believed that merely to be married and breed casual children and die is a sort of suspended energy which has no conceivable place in this overcomplex and unwieldy world he had no clear nor ringing message but he did have just then an overpowering conviction that ruth and henot every one but ruth and he at leasthad a vocation in keeping clear of vocations and that they must fulfil it  over the telephone he said ruth dear ill be right there walked all night got straightened out now im out at mineola its all right with me now blessed i want so frightfully much to make it all right with you ill be there in about an hour  she answered yes so noncommittally that he was smitten by the fact that he had yet to win forgiveness for his frenzy in leaving her that he must break the shell of resentment which would incase her after a whole nights brooding between sullen walls  on the train unconscious of its uproar he was bespelled by his new love during a few moments of their lives ordinary real people people real as a toothbrush do actually transcend the coarsely physical aspects of sex and feeding and do approximate to the unwavering glow of romantic heroes carl was no more a romantic herolover than as a celebrated aviator he had been a heroadventurer he was a human being he was not even admirable except as all people are admirable from the ashman to the king there had been nothing exemplary in his struggle to find adjustment with his wife he had been bad in his impatience just as he had been good in his boyish affection in both he had been human even now when without reserve he gave himself up to love he was aware that he would ascend not on godlike pinions but by a jerky old apartmenthouse elevator to make peace with a vexed girl who was also a human being with a digestive system and prejudices yet with a joy that encompassed all the beauty of banners and saluting swords romantic towers and a fugitive queen a joy transcending trains and elevators and prejudices carl knew that human girl as the symbol of mans yearning for union with the divine he desired happiness for her with a devotion great as the passion in galahads heart when all night he knelt before the high altar  he came slowly up to their apartmenthouse if it were only possible for ruth to trust him now  mingled with his painfully clear remembrance of all the sweet things ruth was and had done was a tragic astonishment that hethis same he who was all hers nowcould possibly have turned impatiently from her sobs yet it would have been for good if only she would trust him  not till he left the elevator on their floor did he comprehend that ruth might not be awaiting him might have gone he looked irresolutely at the grill of the elevator door shut on the black shaft  she was here when i telephoned  he waited perhaps she would peep out to see if it was he who had come up in the elevator  she did not appear  he walked the endless distance of ten feet to their door unlocked it labored across the tiny hall into the livingroom she was there she stood supporting herself by the back of the davenport her eyes rededged and doubtful her face tightened expressing enmity or dread or shy longing he held out his hands like a prisoner beseeching royal mercy she in turn threw out her arms he could not say one word the clumsy signs called words could not tell his emotion he ran to her and she welcomed his arms he held her abandoned himself utterly to her kiss his harddriving mind relaxed relaxed was her body in his arms he knew not merely with his mind but with the vaster powers that drive mind and emotion and body that ruth in her disheveled dressinggown was the glorious lover to whom he had been hastening this hour past all the love which civilization had tried to turn into normal married life had escaped efficiencys pruninghook and had flowered  its all right with me now she said so wonderfully all right  i want to explain had to be by myself find out must have seemed so unspeakably r  oh dont dont explain our kiss explained                                       while they talked on the davenport together reaching out again and again for the hands that now really were there ruth agreed with carl that they must be up and away not wait till it should be too late she too saw how many lovers plan under the june honeymoon to sail away after a year or two and see the great world and when they wearily die know that it will still be a year or two before they can flee to the halcyon isles  but she did insist that they plan practically and it was she who wondered but what would happen if everybody went skipping off like us whod bear the children and keep the fields plowed to feed the ones that ran away  golly cried carl wish that were the worst problem we had maybe a thousand years from now when every one is so artistic that they want to write books it will be hard to get enough drudges but now look at any office with the clerks toiling day after day even the unmarried ones look at all the young fathers of families giving up everything they want to do to support children wholl do the same thing right over again with their children always handing on the torch of life but never getting any light from it people dont run away from slavery often enough and so they dont ever get to do real work either  but sweetheart what if we should have children some day you know of course we havent been ready for them yet but some day they might come anyhow and how could we wander round  oh probably they will come some day and then well take our dose of drudgery like the rest theres nothing that our dear civilization punishes as it does begetting children for poisoning food by adulterating it you may get fined fifty dollars but if you have children they call it a miracleas it isand then they get busy and condemn you to a lifetime of being scared by the boss  well darling please dont blame it on me  i didnt mean to get so oratorical blessed but it does make me mad the way the state punishes one for being willing to work and have children perhaps if enough of us run away from nice normal grinding well start people wondering just why they should go on toiling to produce a lot of booze and clothes and things that nobody needs  perhaps my hawk dont you think though that we might be bored in your rocky mountain cabin if we were there for months and months  yes i suppose so carl mused the rebellion against stuffy marriage has to be a whole lot wider than some little detail like changing from city to country probably for some people the happiest thing d be to live in a hobohemian flat and have parties and for some to live in the suburbs and get the missus elected president of the village improvement society for us i believe its change and keep going  yes i do think so hawk my hawk i lay awake nearly all night last night realizing that we are one not because of a wedding ceremony but because we can understand each others makeblieves and seriousnesses i knew that no matter what happened we had to try again i saw last night by myself that it was not a question of finding out whose fault a quarrel was that it wasnt anybodys fault but just conditions and well change them we wont be afraid to be free  we wont lord lifes wonderful  yes when i think of how sweet life can beso wonderfully sweeti know that all the prophets must love human beings oh so terribly no matter how sad they are about the petty things that lives are wasted over but im not a prophet im a girl thats awfully much in love and darling i want you to hold me close                                       three months later in february 1915 ruth and carl sailed for buenos ayres americas new exportmarket carl was the argentine republic manager for the vanzile motor corporation possessed of an unimportant salary a possibility of large commissions and hopes like comets their happiness seemed a thing enchanted they had not quarreled again                                       the ss sangrael for buenos ayres and rio had sailed from snow into summer ruth and carl watched isles of palms turn to fantasies carved of ebony in the rose and garnet sunset waters and the vast sky laugh out in stars carl was quoting kipling      the lord knows what we may find dear lass     and the deuce knows what we may do     but were back once more on the old trail our own trail the         out trail     were down hull down on the old trailthe trail that is always new  anyway he commented deuce only knows what well do after argentine and i dont care do you  her clasping hand answered as he went on  oh say blessed i forgot to look in the directory before we left new york to see if there wasnt a society for the spread of madness among the respectable it might have sent us out as missionaries theres a flyingfish and tomorrow i wont have to watch clerks punch a timeclock and you can hear a sailor shifting the ventilators and theres a little star perched on the foremast singing but the big thing is that youre here beside me and were going how bully it is to be living if you dont have to give up living in order to make a living  the end
