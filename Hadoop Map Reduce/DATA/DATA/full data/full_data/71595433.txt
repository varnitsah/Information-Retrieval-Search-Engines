the fashion to call every story controversial that deals with times when controversy or a war of religion was raging but it should be remembered that there are some which only attempt to portray human feelings as affected by the events that such warfare occasioned old mortality and woodstock are not controversial tales and the chaplet of pearls is so quite as little it only aims at drawing certain scenes and certain characters as the convulsions of the sixteenth century may have affected them and is in fact like all historical romance the shaping of the conceptions that the imagination must necessarily form when dwelling upon the records of history that faculty which might be called the passive fancy and might almost be described in portias song                    it is engendered in the eyes               by reading fedand there it dies  that faculty i say has learnt to feed upon character and incident and to require that the latter should be effective and exciting is it not reasonable to seek for this in the days when such things were not infrequent and did not imply exceptional wickedness or misfortune in those engaged in them this seems to me one plea for historical novel to which i would add the opportunity that it gives for study of the times and delineation of characters shakespeares henry iv and henry v scotts louis xi manzonis federigo borromeo bulwers harold jamess philip augustus are all real contributions to our comprehension of the men themselves by calling the chronicles and memoirs into action true the picture cannot be exact and is sometimes distortednay sometimes praiseworthy efforts at correctness in the detail take away whatever might have been lifelike in the outline yet acknowledging all this i must still plead for the tales that presumptuously deal with days gone by as enabling the young to realize history vividlyand what is still more desirable requiring an effort of the mind which to read of modern days does not the details of millais inquisition or of his huguenot may be in error in spite of all his study and diligence but they have brought before us for ever the horrors of the autodafe and the patient steadfast heroism of the man who can smile aside his wifes endeavour to make him tacitly betray his faith to save his life surely it is well by pen as by picture to go back to the past for figures that will stir the heart like these even though the details be as incorrect as those of the revolt of liege or of la ferrette in quentin durward and anne of geierstein  scott however willfully carved history to suit the purposes of his story and in these days we have come to feel that a story must earn a certain amount of credibility by being in keeping with established facts even if striking events have to be sacrificed and that the order of time must be preserved in shakespeares days or even in scotts it might have been possible to bring henry iii and his mignons to due punishment within the limits of a tale beginning with the massacre of st bartholomew but in 1868 the broad outlines of tragedy must be given up to keep within the bounds of historical verity  how far this has been done critics better read than myself must decide i have endeavoured to speak fairly to the best of my ability of such classes of persons as fell in with the course of the narrative according to such lights as the memoirs of the time afford the convent is scarcely a class portrait but the condition of it seems to be justified by hints in the port royal memoirs respecting maubuisson and others which mere angelique reformed the intolerance of the ladies at montauban is described in madame duplessismornays life and if berengers education and opinions are looked on as not sufficiently alien from roman catholicism a reference to froudes history of queen elizabeth will show both that the customs of the country clergy and likewise that a broad distinction was made by the better informed among the french between calvinism and protestantism or lutheranism in which they included anglicanism the minister gardon i do not consider as representing his class he is a possibility modified to serve the purposes of the story  into historical matters however i have only entered so far as my story became involved with them and here i have to apologize for a few blunders detected too late for alteration even in the volumes sir francis walsingham was a young rising statesman in 1572 instead of the elderly sage he is represented his daughter frances was a mere infant and sir philip sidney was not knighted till much later for the rest i have tried to show the scenes that shaped themselves before me as carefully as i could though of course they must not be a presentiment of the times themselves but of my notion of them  c m yonge  november 14th 1868      the chaplet of pearls  or  the white and black ribaumont     chapter i the bridal of the white and black               small was the ring and small in truth the finger          what then  the faith was large that dropped it down                         aubrey de vere infant bridal   setting aside the consideration of the risk the babyweddings of the middle ages must have been very pretty sights  so the court of france thought the bridal of henri beranger eustache de ribaumont and of marie eustacie rosalie de rebaumont du niddemerle when amid the festivals that accompanied the signature of the treaty of cateaucabresis goodnatured king henri ii presided merrily at the union of the little pair whose unite ages did not reach ten years  there they stood under the portal of notredame the little bridegroom in a white velvet coat with puffed sleeves slashed with scarlet satin as were the short also puffed breeches meeting his long white knitted silk stockings some way above the knee large scarlet rosettes were in his white shoes a scarlet knot adorned his little sword and his velvet cap of the same colour bore a long white plume and was encircled by a row of pearls of priceless value they are no other than that garland of pearls which after a night of personal combat before the walls of calais edward iii of england took from his helmet and presented to sir eustache de ribaumont a knight of picardy bidding him say everywhere that it was a gift from the king of england to the bravest of knights  the precious heirlooms were scarcely held with the respect due to an ornament so acquired the manly garb for the first time assumed by his sturdy legs and the possession of the little sword were evidently the most interesting parts of the affair to the youthful husband who seemed to find in them his only solace for the weary length of the ceremony he was a fine handsome little fellow fair and rosy with bright blue eyes and hair like shining flax unusually tall and stronglimbed for his age and as he gave his hand to his little bride and walked with her under a canopy up to kneel at the high altar for the marriage blessing and the mass they looked like a fullgrown couple seen through a diminishingglass  the little bride was perhaps a less beautiful child but she had a splendid pair of black eyes and a sweet little mouth both set into the uncomprehending solemnity of baby gravity and contentment in fine clothes in accordance with the vow indicated by her name of marie her dress was white and blue turquoise forgetmenots bound the little lace veil on her dark chestnut hair the bosom of her white satin dress was sprinkled with the same azure jewel and turquoises bordered every seam of the sweeping skirt with a train befitting a counts daughter and meandered in gorgeous constellations round the hem the little thing lisped her own vows forth without much notion of their sense and indeed was sometimes prompted by her bridesmaid cousin a pretty little girl a year older who thrust in her assistance so glibly that the king as well as others of the spectators laughed and observed that she would get herself married to the boy instead of her cousin  there was however to be no doubt nor mistake about beranger and eustacie de ribaumont being man and wife every ceremony religious or domestic that could render a marriage valid was gone through with real earnestness although with infinite gaiety on the part of the court much depended on their union and the reconcilement of the two branches of the family had long been a favourite scheme of king henri ii  both alike were descended from anselme de ribaumont renowned in the first crusade and from the brave picard who had received the pearls but in the miserable anarchy of charles vis reign the elder brother had been on the burgundian sidelike most of the other nobles of picardyand had thus been brought into the english camp where regarding henry v as lawfully appointed to the succession and much admiring him and his brother nedford he had become an ardent supporter of the english claim he had married an english lady and had received the grant if the castle of leurre in normandy by way of compensation for his ancestral one of ribaumont in picardy which had been declared to be forfeited by his treason and seized by his brother  this brother had always been an armagnac and had risen and thriven with his partybefore the final peace between france and england obliged the elder line to submit to charles vii since that time there had been a perpetual contention as to the restitution of chateau ribaumont a strife which under louis xi had become an endless lawsuit and in the days of dueling had occasioned a good many insults and private encounters the younger branch or black ribaumonts had received a grant from louis xi of the lands of niddemerle belonging to an unfortunate angevin noble who had fallen under the royal displeasure and they had enjoyed court favour up to the present generation when henri ii either from opposition to his father instinct for honesty or both had become a warm friend to the gay and brilliant young baron de ribaumont head of the white or elder branch of the family  the family contention seemed likely to wear out of its own accord for the count de ribaumont was an elderly and childless man and his brother the chevalier de ribaumont was according to the usual lot of french juniors a bachelor so that it was expected that the whole inheritance would centre upon the elder family however to the general surprise the chevalier late in life married and became the father of a son and daughter but soon after calculations were still more thrown out by the birth of a little daughter in the old age of the count  almost from the hour in which her sex was announced the king had promised the baron de ribaumont that she should be the wife of his young son and that all the possessions of the house should be settled upon the little couple engaging to provide for the chevaliers disappointed heir in some commandery of a religious order of knighthood  the barons wife was english he had when on a visit to his english kindred entirely turned the head of the lovely annora walwyn and finding that her father one of the gravest of tudor statesmen would not hear of her breaking her engagement to the honest dorset squire marmaduke thistlewood he had carried her off by a stolen marriage and coup de main which as her beauty rank and inheritance were all considerable had won him great reputation at the gay court of henri ii  infants as the boy and girl were the king had hurried on their marriage to secure its taking place in the lifetime of the count the countess had died soon after the birth of the little girl and if the arrangement were to take effect at all it must be before she should fall under the guardianship of her uncle the chevalier therefore the king had caused her to be brought up from the cottage in anjou where she had been nursed and in person superintended the brilliant wedding he himself led off the dance with the tiny bride conducting her through its mazes with fatherly kindliness and condescension but queen catherine who was strongly in the interests of the angevin branch and had always detested the baron as her husbands intimate excused herself from dancing with the bridegroom he therefore fell to the share of the dauphiness queen of scots a lovely brighteyed laughing girl who so completely fascinated the little fellow that he convulsed the court by observing that he should not have objected to be married to some one like her instead of a little baby like eustacie  amid all the mirth it was not only the chevalier and the queen who bore displeased looks in truth both were too great adepts in court life to let their dissatisfaction appear the gloomiest face was that of him whose triumph it wasthe bridegrooms father the baron de ribaumont he had suffered severely from the sickness that prevailed in st quentin when in the last august the admiral de coligny had been besieged there by the spaniards and all agreed that he had never been the same man since either in health or in demeanour when he came back from his captivity and found the king bent on crowning his return by the marriage of the children he had hung back spoken of scruples about such unconscious vows and had finally only consented under stress of the personal friendship of the king and on condition that he and his wife should at once have the sole custody of the little bride even then he moved about the gay scene with so distressed and morose an air that he was evidently either under the influence of a scruple of conscience or of a foreboding of evil  no one doubted that it had been the latter when three days later henri ii in the prime of his strength and height of his spirits encountered young des lorges in the lists received the splinter of a lance in his eye and died two days afterwards  no sooner were his obsequies over than the baron de ribaumont set off with his wife and the little bridal pair for his castle of leurre in normandy nor was he ever seen at court again     chapter ii the separation         parted without the least regret      except that they had ever met                               misses the tale that i relate      this lesson seems to carry      choose not alone a proper mate      but proper time to marry                      cowper pairing time anticipated   i will have it  thou shalt not have it  diane says it is mine  diane knows nothing about it  gentlemen always yield to ladies  wives ought to mind their husbands  then i will not be thy wife  thou canst not help it  i will i will tell my father what m le baron reads and sings and then i know he will  and welcome  eustacie put out her lip and began to cry  the husband and wife now eight and seven years old were in a large room hung with tapestry representing the history of tobit a great state bed curtained with piled velvet stood on a sort of dais at the further end there was a toilettable adorned with curiously shaped boxes and coloured venetian glasses and filagree pouncetboxes and with a small mirror whose frame was inlaid with gold and ivory a large coffer likewise inlaid stood against the wall and near it a cabinet of dutch workmanship a combination of ebony ivory wood and lookingglass the centre retreating and so arranged that by the help of most ingenious attention to perspective and reflection it appeared like the entrance to a magnificent miniature cinquecento palace with steps up to a vestibule paved in black and white lozenges and with three endless corridors diverging from it so much for show for use this palace was a bewildering complication of secret drawers and pigeonholes all depending indeed upon one tiny gold key but unless the use of that key were well understood all it led to was certain outer receptacles of fragrant spanish gloves knots of ribbon and kerchiefs strewn over with rose leaves and lavender however eustacie had secured the key and was now far beyond these mere superficial matters her youthful lord had just discovered her mounted on a chair her small person decked out with a profusion of necklaces jewels bracelets chains and rings and her fingers as well as they could under their stiffening load were opening the very penetralia of the cabinet the inner chamber of the hall where lay a case adorned with the ribaumont arms and containing the farfamed chaplet of pearls it was almost beyond her reach but she had risen on tiptoe and was stretching out her hand for it when he springing behind her on the chair availed himself of his superior height and strength to shut the door of this arcanum and turn the key his mortifying permission to his wife to absent herself arose from pure love of teasing but the next moment he added still holding his hand on the keyas to telling what my father reads that would be treason how shouldst thou know what it is  does thou think every one is an infant but thyself  but who told thee that to talk of my fathers books would get him into trouble continued the boy as they still stood together on the high heavy wooden chair  she tossed her pretty head and pretended to pout  was it diane i will know didst thou tell diane  instead of answering now that his attention to the key was relaxed eustacie made a sudden dart like a little wild cat at the back of the chair and at the key they chair overbalanced beranger caught at the front drawer of the cabinet which unlocked by eustacie came out in his hand and chair children drawer and curiosities all went rolling over together on the floor with a hubbub that brought all the household together exclaiming and scolding madame de ribaumonts displeasure at the rifling of her hoards knew no bounds eustacie by way of defence shrieked like twenty demons beranger too honourable to accuse her underwent the same tempest and at last both were soundly rapped over the knuckles with the long handle of madames fan and consigned to two separate closets to be dealt with on the return of m le baron while madame returned to her embroidery lamenting the absence of that dear little diane whose late visit at the chateau had been marked by such unusual tranquility between the children  beranger in his dark closet comforted himself with the shrewd suspicion that his father was so employed as not to be expected at home till suppertime and that his mothers wrath was by no means likely to be so enduring as to lead her to make complaints of the prisoners and when he heard a trampling of horses in the court he anticipated a speedy release and summons to show himself to the visitors he waited long however before he heard the pattering of little feet then a stool scraped along the floor the button of his door was undone the stool pushed back and as he emerged eustacie stood before him with her finger to her lip chut beranger it is my father and uncle and narcisse and oh so many gens darmes they are come to summon m le baron to go with them to disperse the preche by the bac de loie and oh beranger is he not there  i do not know he went out with his hawk and i do not think he could have gone anywhere else did they say so to my mother  yes but she never knows and oh beranger narcisse told meah was it to tease methat diane has told them all they wanted to know for that they sent her here on purpose to see if we were not all huguenots  very likely the little viper le me pass eustacie i must go and tell my father  thou canst not get out that way the court is full of menatarms hark theres narcisse calling me he will come after me  there was not a moment to lose berenger flew along a corridor and down a narrow winding stair and across the kitchen then snatching at the arm of a boy of his own age whom he met at the door he gasped out come and help me catch follet landry and still running across an orchard he pulled down a couple of apples from the trees and bounded into a paddock where a small rough breton pony was feeding among the little tawny norman cows the animal knew his little master and trotted towards him at his call of follet follet now be a wise follet and play me no tricks thou and i follet shall do good service if thou wilt be steady  follet made his advances but with a coquettish eye and look as if ready to start away at any moment  soh follet i have no bread for thee only two apples but follet listen theres my beaupere the count and the chevalier all spite and their whole troop of savage gens darmes come out to fall upon the poor huguenots who are doing no harm at all only listening to a long dull sermon and i am much afraid my father is there for he went out his hawk on his wrist and he never does take ysonde for any real sport as thou and i would do follet he says it is all vanity of vanities but thou knowst if they caught him at the preche they would call it heresy and treason and all sorts of horrors and any way they would fall like demons on the poor huguenots jacques and allthine own jacques follet come be a loyal pony follet be at least as good as eustacie  follet was evidently attentive to this peroration turning round his ear in a sensible attitude and advancing his nose to the apples as beranger held them out to him the other boy clutched his shaggy forelock so effectually that the start back did not shake him off and the next moment beranger was on his back  and i monsieur what shall i do  thou landry i know speed like a hare lock the avenue gate and hide the key that will delay them a long time off now follet  beranger and follet understood one another far too well to care about such trifles as saddle and bridle and off they went through green grassy balks dividing the fields or across the stubble till about three miles from the castle they came to a narrow valley dipping so suddenly between the hills that it could hardly have been suspected by one unaware of its locality and the sides were dotted with copsewood which entirely hid the bottom beranger guided his pony to a winding path that led down the steep side of the valley already hearing the cadence of a loud chanting voice throwing out its sounds over the assembly whence arose assenting hums over an undercurrent of sobs as though the excitable french assembly were strongly affected  the thicket was so close that beranger was almost among the congregation before he could see more than a passing glimpse of a sea of heads stout ruddy norman peasants and high whitecapped women mingled with a few soberlyclad townsfolk almost all with the grave steadfast cast of countenance imparted by unresisted persecution stood gathered round the green mound that served as a natural pulpit for a calvinist minister who more the dress of a burgher but entirely black to berangers despair he was in the act of inviting his hearers to join with him in singing one of marots psalms and the boy eager to lose not a moment grasped the skirt of the outermost of the crowd the man an absorbedlooking stranger merely said importune me not child  listen said beranger it imports  peace was the stern answer but a norman farmer looked round at that moment and beranger exclaimed stop the singing the gens darmes the psalm broke off the whisper circulated the words from leurre were next conveyed from lip to lip and as it were in a moment the dense human mass had broken up and vanished stealing through the numerous paths in the brushwood or along the brook as it descended through tall sedges and bulrushes the valley was soon as lonely as it had been populous the pulpit remained a mere mossy bank more suggestive or fairy dances than of calvinist sermons and no one remained on the scene save beranger with his pony jacques the groom a stout farmer the preacher and a tall thin figure in the plainest dark cloth dress that could be worn by a gentleman a hawk on his wrist  thou here my boy he exclaimed as beranger came to his side and as the little fellow replied in a few brief words he took him by the hand and said to the minister good master isaac let me present my young son to you who under heaven hath been the means of saving many lives this day  maitre isaac gardon a noted preacher looked kindly at the boys fair face and said bless thee young sir as thou hast been already a chosen instrument to save life so mayest thou be ever after a champion of the truth  monsieur le baron interposed jacques it were best to look to yourself i already hear sounds upon the wind  and you good sir said the baron  i will see to him said the farmer grasping him as a sort of property m le baron had best keep up the beck out on the moor there he may fly the hawk and that will best divert suspicion  farewell then said the baron wringing the ministers hand and adding almost to himself alas i am weary of these shifts and weary indeed he seemed for as the ground became so steep that the beck danced noisily down its channel he could not keep up the needful speed but paused gasping for breath with his hand on his side beranger was off his pony in an instant assuring follet that it ought to be proud to be ridden by his father and exhaling his own exultant feelings in caresses to the animal as it gallantly breasted the hill the little boy had never been so commended before he loved his father exceedingly but the baron while ever just towards him was grave and strict to a degree that the ideas even of the sixteenth century regarded as severe little eustacie with her lovely face her irrepressible saucy grace and audacious coaxing was the only creature to whom he ever showed much indulgence and tenderness and even that seemed almost against his will and conscience his son was always under rule often blamed and scarcely ever praised but it was a hardy vigorous nature and respectful love throve under the system that would have crushed or alienated a different disposition it was not till the party had emerged from the wood upon a stubble field where a covey of partridges flew up and to berangers rapturous delight furnished a victim for ysonde that m de ribaumont dismounted from the pony and walking towards home called his son to his side and asked him how he had learnt the intentions of the count and the chevalier beranger explained how eustacie had come to warn him and also told what she had said of diane de ribaumont who had lately by her fathers request spent a few weeks at the chateau with her cousins  my son said the baron it is hard to ask of babes caution and secrecy but i must know from thee what thy cousin may have heard of our doings  i cannot tell father replied beranger we played more than we talked yet monsieur you will not be angry with eustacie if i tell you what she said to me today  assuredly not my son  she said that her father would take her away if he knew what m le baron read and what he sung  thou hast done well to tell me my son thinkest thou that this comes from diane or from one of the servants  oh from diane my father none of the servants would dare to say such a thing  it is as i suspected then said the baron that child was sent amongst us as a spy tell me beranger had she any knowledge of our intended journey to england  to england but no father i did not even know it was intended to englandto that walwyn which my mother takes such pains to make us speak rightly are we then going  listen my son thou hast today proved thyself worthy of trust and thou shalt hear my son ere yet i knew the truth i was a reckless disobedient youth and i bore thy mother from her parents in england without their consent since by heavens grace i have come to a better mind we have asked and obtained their forgiveness and it has long been their desire to see again their daughter and her son moreover since the accession of the present queen it has been a land where the light is free to shine forth and though i verily believe what maitre gardon says that persecution is a blessed means of grace yet it is grievous to expose ones dearest thereto when they are in no state to count the cost therefore would i thither convey you all and there amid thy mothers family would we openly abjure the errors in which we have been nurture i have already sent to paris to obtain from the queenmother the necessary permission to take my family to visit thy grandfather and it must now be our endeavour to start immediately on the receipt of the reply before the chevaliers information can lead to any hindrance or detention of eustacie  then eustacie will go with us monsieur  certainly nothing is more important than that her faith should be the same as yours but discretion my son not a word to the little one  and landry father i had rather landry went than eustacie and follet dear father pray take him  after m de ribaumonts grave confidence to his son and heir he was a little scandalized at the comparative value that the boys voice indicated for wife fosterbrother and pony and therefore received it in perfect silence which silence continued until they reached the chateau where the lady met them at the door with a burst of exclamations  ah there you are safe my dear baron i have been in despair here were the count and his brother come to call on you to join them in dispersing a meeting of those poor huguenots and they would not permit me to send out to call you in i verily think they suspected that you were aware of it  m de ribaumont made no answer but sat wearily down and asked for his little eustacie  little vixen exclaimed the baroness she is gone her father took her away with him and as her husband looked extremely displeased she added that eustacie had been meddling with her jewel cabinet and had been put in penitence her first impulse on seeing her father had been to cling to him and poor out her complaints whereupon he had declared that he should take her away with him at once and had in effect caused her pony to be saddled and he had ridden away with her to his old tower leaving his brother the chevalier to conduct the attack on the huguenot conventicle  he had no power or right to remove her said the baron how could you let him do so in my absence he had made over her wardship to me and has no right to resume it  well perhaps i might have insisted on his waiting till your return but you see the children have never done anything but quarrel and fight and always by eustacies fault and if ever they are to endure each other it must be by being separated now  madame said the baron gravely you have done your utmost to ruin your sons chances of happiness  that same evening arrived the kings passport permitting the baron de ribaumont and his family to pay a visit to his wifes friends in england the next morning the baron was summoned to speak to one of his farmers a huguenot who had come to inform him that through the network of intelligence kept up by the members of the persecuted faith it had become known that the chevalier de ribaumont had set off for court that night and there was little doubt that his interference would lead to an immediate revocation of the sanction to the journey if to no severer measures at best the baron knew that if his own absence were permitted it would be only on condition of leaving his son in the custody of either the queenmother or the count it had become impossible to reclaim eustacie her father would at once have pleaded that she was being bred up in huguenot errors all that could be done was to hasten the departure ere the royal mandate could arrive a little norman sailing vessel was moored two evenings after in a lonely creek on the coast and into it stepped m de ribaumont with his bible marots psalter and calvins works beranger still tenderly kissing a lock of follets mane and madame mourning for the pearls which her husband deemed too sacred an heirloom to carry away to a foreign land poor little eustacie with her cousin diane was in the convent of bellaise in anjou if any one lamented her absence it was her fatherinlaw     chapter iii the family council         he counsels a divorce             shakespeare king henry viii   in the spring of the year 1572 a family council was assembled in hurst walwyn hall the scene was a wainscoted oriel chamber closed off by a screen from the great hall and fitted on two sides by presses of books surmounted the one by a terrestrial the other by a celestial globe the first with the addition of the indies in very eccentric geography the second with enormous stars studding highly grotesque figures regarded with great awe by most beholders  a solid oaken table stood in the midst laden with books and papers and in a corner near the open hearth a carved desk bearing on one slope the largest copy of the bishops bible on the other one of the prayerbook the ornaments of the oaken mantelpiece culminated in a shield bearing a cross boutonnee ie with trefoil terminations it was supported between a merman with a whelk shell and a mermaid with a comb and another like siren curled her tail on the top of the gaping baronial helmet above the shield while two more upheld the main weight of the chimneypiece on either side of the glowing woodfire  in the seat of honour was an old gentleman whitehaired and feeble of limb but with noble features and a keen acute eye this was sir william baron of hurst walwyn a valiant knight at guingate and boulogne a statesman of whom wolsey had been jealous and a ripe scholar who had shared the friendship of more and erasmus the lady who sat opposite to him was several years younger still upright brisk and active though her hair was milkwhite but her eyes were of undimmed azure and her complexion still retained a beauteous pink and white she was highly educated and had been the friend of margaret roper and her sisters often sharing their walks in the bright chelsea garden indeed the muskrose in her own favourite nook at hurst walwyn was cherished as the gift of sir thomas himself  near her sat sister cecily st john a professed nun at romsey till her twentyeight year when in the dispersion of convents her sisters home had received her there had she continued never exposed to tests of opinion but pursuing her quiet course according to her benedictine rule faithfully keeping her vows and following the guidance of the chaplain a college friend of bishop ridley and rejoicing in the use of the vernacular prayers and scriptures when queen mary had sent for her to consider of the revival of convents her views had been found to have so far diverged from those of the queen that lord walwyn was thankful to have her safe at home again and yet she fancied herself firm to old romsey doctrine she was not learned like lady walwyn but her knowledge in all needlework and confectionery was consummate so that half the ladies in dorset and wilts longed to send their daughters to be educated at hurst walwyn her small figure and soft cheeks had the gentle contour of a doves form nor had she lost the conventual serenity of expression indeed it was curious that let lady walwyn array her as she would whatever she wore bore a nunlike air her silken farthingales hung like serge robes her ruffs looked like mufflers her coifs like hoods even necklaces seemed rosaries and her scrupulous neatness enhanced the pure unearthly air of all belonging to her  eager and lively fair and handsome sat the baronne de ribaumont or rather since the higher title had been laid aside dame annora thistlewood the health of m de ribaumont had been shattered at st quentin and an inclement night of crossing the channel had brought on an attack on the lungs from which he only rallied enough to amaze his english friends at finding the gay dissipated young frenchman they remembered infinitely more strict and rigid than themselves he was never able to leave the house again after his first arrival at hurst walwyn and sank under the cold winds of the next spring rejoicing to leave his wife and son not indeed among such strict puritans as he preferred but at least where the pure faith could be openly avowed without danger  sir marmaduke thistlewood the husband to whom annora walwyn had been destined before m de ribaumont had crossed her path was about the same time left a widower with one son and daughter and as soon as a suitable interval had passed she became a far happier wife than she had been in either the barons gay or grave days her son had continued under the roof of his grandfather to whose charge his father had specially committed him and thus had been scarcely separated from his mother since combe manor was not above three miles across the downs from hurst walwyn and there was almost daily intercourse between the families lucy thistlewood had been brought to hurst walwyn to be something between a maid of honour and a pupil to the ladies there and her brother philip so soon as he was old enough daily rode thither to share with berenger the instructions of the chaplain mr adderley who on the present occasion formed one of the conclave sitting a little apart as not quite familiar though highly esteemed  with an elbow on the table and one hand toying with his long ridingwhip sat booted and spurred the jovial figure of sir marmaduke who called out in his hearty voice a good riddance of an outlandish papist say i read the letter berenger lad no no no english it i know nothing of your mincing french tis the worst fault i know in you boy to be half a frenchman and have a french namea fault that good sir marmaduke did his best to remedy by always terming his stepson berenger or berry ribmount and we will so far follow his example as henceforth to give the youth the english form of his christian name he was by this time a tall lad of eighteen with straight features honest deep blue eyes very fair hair cut short and brushed up to a crest upon the middle of his head a complexion of red and white that all the air of the downs and the sea failed to embrown and that peculiar openness and candour of expression which seems so much an english birthright that the only trace of his french origin was that he betrayed no unbecoming awkwardness in the somewhat embarrassing position in which he was placed literally standing according to the respectful discipline of the time as the subject of discussion before the circle of his elders his colour was indeed deepened but his attitude was easy and graceful and he used no stiff rigidity nor restless movements to mask his anxiety at sir marmadukes desire he could not but redden a good deal more but with a clear unhesitating voice he translated the letter that he had received from the chevalier de ribaumont who by the counts death had become eustacies guardian it was a request in the name of eustacie and her deceased father that monsieur le baron de ribaumontwho it was understood had embraced the english heresywould concur with his spouse in demanding from his holiness the pope a decree annulling the childish marriage which could easily be declared void both on account of the consanguinity of the parties and the discrepancy of their faith and which would leave each of them free to marry again  nothing can be better exclaimed his mother how i have longed to free him from that little shrew whose tricks were the plague of my life now there is nothing between him and a worthy match  we can make an englishman of him now to the backbone added sir marmaduke and it is well that it should be the lady herself who wants first to be off with it so that none can say he has played her a scurvy trick  what say you berenger said lord walwyn listen to me fair nephew you know that all my remnant of hope is fixed upon you and that i have looked to setting you in the room of the son of my own and i think that under our good queen you will find it easier to lead a quiet godfearing life than in your fathers vexed country where the reformed religion lies under persecution natheless being a born liegeman of the king of france and heir to estates in his kingdom meseemeth that before you are come to years of discretion it were well that you should visit them and become better able to judge for yourself how to deal in this matter when you shall have attained full age and may be able to dispose of them by sale thus freeing yourself from allegiance to a foreign prince and at the same time you can take measures in concert with this young lady for loosing the wedlock so unhappily contracted  o sir sir cried lady thistlewood send him not to france to be burnt by the papists  peace daughter returned her mother know you not that there is friendship between the court party and the huguenots and that the peace is to be sealed by the marriage of the kings sister with the king of navarre this is the most suitable time at which he could go  then madam proceeded the lady he will be running about to all the preachings on every bleak moor and wet morass he can find catching his death with rheums like his poor father  there was a general smile and sir marmaduke laughed outright  nay dame he said have you marked such a greed of sermons in our berry that you should fear his so untowardly running after them  tillyvally sir duke quoth dame annora with a flirt of her fan learnt at the french court men will run after a preacher in a marshy bog out of pure forwardness when they will nod at a godly homily on a wellstuffed bench between four walls  i shall commit that matter to mr adderley who is good enough to accompany him said lord walwyn and by whose counsel i trust that he will steer the middle course between the pope and calvin  mr adderley bowed in answer saying he hoped that he should be enable to keep his pupils mind clear between the allurements of popery and the errors of the reformed but meanwhile lady thistlewoods mind had taken a leap and she exclaimed  and son whatever you do bring home the chaplet of pearls i know they have set their minds upon it they wanted me to deck eustacie with it on that unlucky bridalday but i would not hear of trusting her with it and now will it rarely become our lucy on your real weddingday  you travel swiftly daughter said lord walwyn nor have we yet heard the thoughts of one who ever thinks wisely sister he added turning to cecily st john hold not you with us in this matter  i scarce comprehend it my lord was the gentle reply i knew not that it was possible to dissolve the tie of wedlock  the popes decree will suffice said lord walwyn  yet sir still said the exnun methought you had shown me that the holly father exceeded his power in the annulling of vows  using mine own lessons against me sweet sister said lord walwyn smiling yet remember the contract was rashly made between two ignorant babes and bred up as they have severally been it were surely best for them to be set free from vows made without their true will or knowledge  and yet said cecily perplexed when i saw my niece here wedded to sir marmaduke was it not with the words what god hath joined let no man put asunder  good lack aunt cried lady thistlewood you would not have that poor lad wedded to a pert saucy illtempered little moppet bred up that den of iniquity queen catherines court where my poor baron never trusted me after he fell in with the religion and had heard of king antonys calling me the swan of england  at that moment there was a loud shriek halflaugh halffright coming through the window and lady thistlewood starting up exclaimed the child will be drowned box their ears berenger and bring them in directly  berenger at her bidding hurried out of the room into the hall and thence down a flight of steps leading into a square walled garden with a couple of stone male and female marine divinities accommodating their fishy extremities as best they might on the corners of the wall the square contained a bowlinggreen of exquisitelykept turf that looked as if cut out of green velvet and was edged on its four sides by a raised broadpaved walk with a trimming of flowerbeds where the earliest blossoms were showing themselves in the centre of each side another paved path intersected the green lawn and the meeting of these two diameters was at a circular stone basin presided over by another merman blowing a conch on the top of a pile of rocks on the gravelled margin stood two distressed little damsels of seven and six years old remonstrating with all their might against the proceedings of a roguishlooking boy of fourteen of fifteen who had perched their juniora fat fair kittenlike element of mischief aged about fiveen croupe on the merman and was about according to her delighted request to make her a bower of water by extracting the plug and setting the fountain to play but as the fountain had been still all the winter the plug was hard of extraction especially to a young gentleman who stood insecurely with his feet wide apart upon pointed and slippery point of rockwork and berenger had time to hurry up exclaiming giddy pate dolly would berenger drenched to the skin  and she has on her best blue made out of mothers french farthingale cried the discreet annora  do you know dolly ive orders to box your ears and send you in added berenger as he lifted his halfsister from her perilous position speaking as he did so without a shade of foreign accent though with much more rapid utterance than was usual in england she clung to him without much alarm and retaliated by an endeavour to box his ears while philip slowly making his way back to the mainland exclaimed ah theres no chance now here comes demure mistress lucy and she is the worst marsport of all  a gentle girl of seventeen was drawing near her fair delicatelytinted complexion suiting well with her pale golden hair it was a sweet face and was well set off by the skyblue of the farthingale which with her white lace coif and white ruff gave her something the air of a speedwell flower more especially as her expression seemed to have caught much of cecilys air of selfrestrained contentment she held a basketful of the orange pistils of crocuses and at once seeing that some riot had taken place she said to the eldest little girl ah nan you had been safer gathering saffron with me  nay brother berry came and made all well said annora and he had been shut up so long in the library that he must have been very glad to get out  and what came of it cried philip are you to go and get yourself unmarried  unmarried burst out the sisters annora and elizabeth  what laughed philip you knew not that this is an ancient husband married years before your father and mother  but why said elizabeth rather inclined to cry what has poor lucy done that you should get yourself unmarried from her  there was a laugh from both brothers but berenger seeing lucys blushes restrained himself and said mine was not such good luck bess but they gave me a little french wife younger than dolly and saucier still and as she seems to wish to be quit of me why i shall be rid of her  see there dolly said philip in a warning voice that is the way youll be served if you do not mend your ways  but i thought said annora gravely that people were married once for all and it could not be undone  so said aunt cecily but my lord was proving to her out of all law that a contract between such a couple of babes went for nought said berenger  and shall you indeed see paris and all the braveries there asked philip i thought my lord would never have trusted you out of his sight  and now it is to be only with mr adderley said berenger but there will be rare doings to be seen at this royal wedding and maybe i shall break a lance there in your honour lucy  and youll bring me a french fan cried bess  and me a pouncetbox added annora  and me a french puppet dressed paris fashion said dolly  and what shall he bring lucy added bess  i know said annora the pearls that mother is always talking about i heard her say that lucy should wear them on her weddingday  hush interposed lucy dont you see my father yonder on the step beckoning to you  the children flew towards sir marmaduke leaving berenger and lucy together  not a word to wish me good speed lucy now i have my wish said berenger  oh yes said lucy i am glad you should see all those brave french gentlemen of whom you used to tell me  yes they will be all at court and the good admiral is said to be in high favour he will surely remember my father  and shall you see the lady asked lucy under her breath  eustacie probably but that will make no change i have heard too much of lescadron de la reinemere to endure the thought of a wife from thence were she the queen of beauty herself and my mother says that eustacie would lose all her beauty as she grew uplike blackeyed sue on the down nor did i ever think her brown skin and fierce black eyes to compare with you lucy i could be well content never to see her more but and here he lowered his voice to a tone of confidence my father when near his death called me and told me that he feared my marriage would be a cause of trouble and temptation to me and that i must deal with it after my conscience when i was able to judge in the matter something too he said of the treaty of marriage being a burthen on his soul but i know not what he meant if ever i saw eustacie again i was to give her his own copy of clement marots psalter and to tell her that he had ever loved and prayed for her as a daughter and moreover my father added said berenger much moved at the remembrance it brought across him that if this matter proved a burthen and perplexity to me i was to pardon him as one who repented of it as a thing done ere he had learnt to weigh the whole world against a soul  yes you must see her said lucy  well what more were you going to say lucy  i was only thinking said lucy as she raised her eyes to him how sorry she will be that she let them write that letter  berenger laughed pleased with the simplicity of lucys admiration but with modesty and common sense enough to answer no fear of that lucy for an heiress with all the court gallants of france at her feet  ah but you  i am all very well here when you have never seen anybody but lubberly dorset squires that never went to london nor oxford nor beyond their own furrows said berenger but depend upon it she has been bred up to care for all the airs and graces that are all the fashion at paris now and will be as glad to be rid of an honest man and a protestant as i shall to be quit of a court puppet and a papist shall you have finished my pointcuffs next week lucy depend upon it no gentleman of them all will wear such dainty lace of such a fancy as those will be  and lucy smiled well pleased  coming from the companionship of eustacie to that of gentle lucy had been to berenger a change from perpetual warfareto perfect supremacy and his preference to his little sister as he had been taught to call her from the first had been loudly expressed brother and sister they had ever since considered themselves and only within the last few months had possibilities been discussed among the elders of the family which oozing out in some mysterious manner had become felt rather than known among the young people yet without altering the habitual terms that existed between them both were so young that love was the merest vaguest dream to them and lucy in her quiet faith that berenger was the most beautiful excellent and accomplished cavalier the earth could afford was little troubled about her own future share in him she seemed to be promoted to belong to him just as she had grown up to curl her hair and wear ruffs and farthingales and to berenger lucy was a very pleasant feature in that english home where he had been far happier than in the uncertainties of chateau leurre between his naughty playfellow his capricious mother and morose father if in england his lot was to be cast lucy was acquiesced in willingly as a portion of that lot     chapter iv tithonus         a youth came riding towards a palace gate      and from the palace came a child of sin      and took him by the curls and led him in      where sat a company with heated eyes                      tennyson a vision of sin   it was in the month of june that berenger de ribaumont first came in sight of paris his grandfather had himself begun by taking him to london and presenting him to queen elizabeth from whom the lads good mien procured him a most favourable reception she willingly promised that on which lord walwyns heart was set namely that his title and rank should be continued to his grandson and an ample store of letter of recommendation to sir francis walsingham the ambassador and all others who could be of service in the french court were to do their utmost to provide him with a favourable reception there  then with mr adderley and four or five servants he had crossed the channel and had gone first to chateau leurre where he was rapturously welcomed by the old steward osbert the old man had trained up his son landry berengers fosterbrother to become his valet and had him taught all the arts of hairdressing and surgery that were part of the profession of a gentlemans bodyservant and the youth a smart acuter young norman became a valuable addition to the suite the guidance of which through a foreign country their young master did not find very easy mr adderley thought he knew french very well through books but the language he spoke was not available and he soon fell into a state of bewilderment rather hard on his pupil who though a very good boy and crammed very full of learning was still nothing more than a lad of eighteen in all matters of prudence and discretion  lord walwyn was as we have seen one of those whose church principles had altered very little and very gradually and in the utter diversity of practice that prevailed in the early years of queen elizabeth his chaplain as well as the rector of the parish had altered no more than was absolutely enjoined of the old ceremonial if the poor baron de ribaumont had ever been well enough to go to church on a sunday he would perhaps have thought himself still in the realms of what he considered as darkness but as he had never openly broken with the gallic church berenger had gone at once from mass at leurre to the combe walwyn service therefore when he spent a sunday at rouen and attended a calvinist service in the building that the huguenots were permitted outside the town he was much disappointed in it he thought its very fervour familiar and irreverent and felt himself much more at home in the cathedral into which he strayed in the afternoon and on the sunday he was at leurre he went as a part of his old homehabits to mass at the old roundarched church where he and eustacie had played each other so many teasing tricks at his mothers feet and had received so many admonitory nips and strokes of her fan all he saw there was not congenial to him but he liked it vastly better than the huguenot meeting and was not prepared to understand or enter into mr adderleys vexation when the tutor assured him that the reverent gestures that came naturally to him were regarded by the protestants as idolatry and that he would be viewed as a recreants from his faith all mr adderley hoped was that no one would hear of it and in this he felt himself disappointed when in the midst of his lecture there walked into the room a little withered brown darkeyed man in a gorgeous dress of green and gold who doffing a hat with an umbrageous plume precipitated himself as far as he could reach towards berengers neck calling him fair cousin and dear baron the lad stood taken by surprise for a moment thinking that tithonus must have looked just like this and skipped like this just as he became a grasshopper then he recollected that this must be the chevalier de ribaumont and tried to make up for his want of cordiality the old man had it appeared come out of picardy where he lived on soupe maigre in a corner of the ancestral castle while his son and daughter were at court the one in monsieurs suite the other in that of the queenmother he had come purely to meet his dear young cousin and render him all the assistance is his power conduct him to paris and give him introductions  berenger who had begun to find six englishmen a troublesome charge in france was rather relieved at not being the only french scholar of the party and the chevalier also hinted to him that he spoke with a dreadful norman accent that would never be tolerated at court even if it were understood by the way moreover the chevalier studied him all over and talked of paris tailors and posturemasters and though the pink of politeness made it evident that there was immensely too much of him it might be the custom in england to be so tall here no one was of anything like such a height but the duke of guise he in his position with his air could carry it off but we must adapt ourselves as best we can  and his shrug and look of concern made berenger for a moment almost ashamed of that superfluous height of which they were all so proud at home then he recollected himself and asked and why should not i be tall as well as m de guise  we shall see fair cousin he answered with an odd satirical bow we are as heaven made us all lies in the management and if you had the advantages of training perhaps you could even turn your height into a grace  am i such a great lubber wondered berenger they did not think so at home no nor did the queen she said i was a proper stripling well it matters the less as i shall not stay long to need their favour and ill show them there is some use in my inches in the tiltyard but if they think me such a lout what would they say to honest philip  the chevalier seemed willing to take on him the whole management of his fair cousin he inquired into the amount of the rents and dues which old osbert had collected and held ready to meet the young barons exigencies and which would it seemed be all needed to make his dress any way presentable at court the pearls too were inquired for and handed over by osbert to his young lords keeping with the significant intimation that they had been demanded when the young madame la baronne went to court but that he had buried them in the orchard and made answer that they were not in the chateau the contract of marriage which berenger could just remember signing and seeing signed by his father the king and the count was not forthcoming and the chevalier explained that it was in the hands of a notary at paris for this berenger was not sorry his grandfather had desired him to master the contents and he thought he had thus escaped a very dry and useless study  he did not exactly dislike the old chevalier de ribaumont the system on which he had been brought up had not been indulgent so that compliments and admiration were an agreeable surprise to him and rebuffs and rebukes from his elders had been so common that hints in the delicate dressing of the old knight came on him almost like gracious civilities there was no love lost between the chevalier and the chaplain that was plain but how could there be between an ancient french courtier and a sober english divine however to mr adderleys great relief no attempts were made on berengers faith his kinsman even was disposed to promote his attendance at such calvinist places of worship as they passed on the road and treated him in all things as a mere guest to be patronized indeed but as much an alien as if he had been born in england and yet there was a certain deference to him as head of the family and a friendliness of manner that made the boy feel him a real relation and all through the journey it came naturally that he should be the entire manager and berenger the paymaster on a liberal scale  thus had the travellers reached the neighbourhood of paris when a jingling of chains and a trampling of horses announced the advance of riders and several gentlemen with a troop of servants came in sight  all were gaily dressed with feathered hats and short spanish cloaks jauntily disposed over one shoulder and their horses were trapped with bright silvered ornaments as they advanced the chevalier exclaimed ah it is my son i knew he would come to meet me and simultaneously father and son leapt from their horses and rushed into each others arms berenger felt it only courteous to dismount and exchange embraces with his cousin but with a certain sense of repulsion at the cloud of perfume that seemed to surround the younger chevalier de ribaumont the earrings in his ears the general air of delicate research about his ridingdress and the elaborate attention paid to a small dark sallow face and figure in which the only tolerable feature was an intensely black and piercing pair of eyes  cousin i am enchanted to welcome you  cousin i thank you  allow me to present you and berenger bowed low in succession several times in reply to salutations as his cousin narcisse named m do m de la valette m de pibrac m labbe de mericour who had done him the honour to accompany him in coming out to meet his father and m le baron then the two cousins remounted something was said to the chevalier of the devoirs of the demoiselles and they rode on together bandying news and repartee so fast that berenger felt that his ears had become too much accustomed to the more deliberate english speech to enter at once into what caused so much excitement gesture and wit the royal marriage seemed doubtfulthe pope refused his sanction nay but means would be foundthe king would not be impeded by the pope spanish influencenay the king had thrown himself at the head of the reformedhe was bewitched with the grim old colignyif order were not soon taken the louvre itself would become a temple  then one of the party turned suddenly and said but i forget monsieur is a huguenot  i am a protestant of the english church said berenger rather stiffly in the formula of his day  well you have come at the right moment tis all for the sermon now if the little abbe there wished to sail with a fair wind he should throw away his breviary and study his calvin  berengers attention was thus attracted to the abbe de mericour a young man of about twenty whose dress was darker than that of the rest and his hat of a clerical cut though in other respects he was equipped with the same pointdevice elegance  calvin would never give him the rich abbey of selicy said another the breviary is the safer speculation  ah m de ribaumont can tell you that abbeys are no such securities in these days let yonder admiral get the upper hand and we shall see mericour the happy cadet of eight brothers and sisters turned adrift from their convents what a fatherly spectacle m le marquis will present  here the chevalier beckoned to berenger who riding forward learnt that narcisse had engaged lodgings for him and his suite at one of the great inns and berenger returned his thanks and a proposal to the chevalier to become his guest they were by this time entering the city where the extreme narrowness and dirt of the streets contrasted with the grandeur of the palatial courts that could be partly seen through their archways at the hostel they rode under such an arch and found themselves in a paved yard that would have been grand had it been clean privacy had scarcely been invented and the party were not at all surprised to find that the apartment prepared for them was to serve both day and night for berenger the chevalier and mr adderley besides having a trucklebed on the floor for osbert meals were taken in public and it was now one oclockjust dinnertime so after a hasty toilette the three gentlemen descended the rest of the party having ridden off to their quarters either as attendants of monsieur or to their families it was a sumptuous meal at which a great number of gentlemen were present coming in from rooms hired over shops call as it seemed assembled at paris for the marriage festivities but berenger began to gather that they were for the most part adherents of the guise party and far from friendly to the huguenot interest some of them appeared hardly to tolerate mr adderleys presence at the table and berenger though his kinsmans patronage secured civil treatment felt much out of his element confused unable to take part in the conversation and sure that he was where those at home did not wish to see him  no sooner was the dinner over than he rose and expressed his intention of delivering his letters of introduction in person to the english ambassador and to the admiral de coligny whom as his fathers old friend and the hero of his boyhood he was most anxious to see the chevalier demurred to this were it not better to take measures at once for making himself presentable and narcisse had already supplied him with directions to the fashionable haircutter c it would be taken amiss if he went to the admiral before going to present himself to the king  and i cannot see my cousins till i go to court asked berenger  most emphatically no have i not told you that the one is in the suite of the young queen the other in that of the queenmother i will myself present you if only you will give me the honour of your guidance  with all thanks monsieur said berenger my grandfathers desire was that i should lose no time in going to his friend sir francis walsingham and i had best submit myself to his judgment as to my appearance at court  on this point berenger was resolute though the chevalier recurred to the danger of any proceeding that might be unacceptable at court berenger harassed and impatient repeated that he did not care about the court and wished merely to fulfil his purpose and return at which his kinsman shook his head and shrugged his shoulders and muttered to himself ah what does he know he will regret it when too late but i have done my best  berenger paid little attention to this but calling landry osbert and a couple of his men he bade them take their swords and bucklers and escort him in his walk through paris he set off with a sense of escape but before he had made many steps he was obliged to turn and warn humfrey and jack that they were not to walk swaggering along the streets with hand on sword as if every frenchman they saw was the natural foe of their master  very tall were the houses very close and extremely filthy the streets very miserable the beggars and yet here and there was to be seen the open front of a most brilliant shop and the thoroughfares were crowded with richlydressed gallants even the wider streets gave little space for the career of the gay horsemen who rode along them still less for the great cumbrous though gailydecked coaches in which ladies appeared glittering with jewels and fan in hand with tiny white dogs on their knees  the persons of whom berenger inquired the way all uncapped most respectfully and replied with much courtesy but when the hotel of the english ambassador had been pointed out to him he hardly believed it so foul and squalid was the street where a large nailstudded door occupied a wide archway here was a heavy iron knocker to which osbert applied himself a little door was at once opened by a large powerful john bull of a porter whose looks expanded into friendly welcome when he heard the english tongue of the visitor inside the scene was very unlike that without the hotel was built round a paved court adorned with statues and stone vases with yews and cypresses in them and a grand flight of steps led up to the grand centre of the house around which were collected a number of attendants wearing the walsingham colours among these berenger left his two englishmen well content to have fallen into an english colony landry followed him to announce the visitor berenger waiting to know whether the ambassador would be at liberty to see him  almost immediately the door was reopened and a keenlooking gentleman about sixandthirty years of age rather short in stature but nevertheless very dignifiedlooking came forward with outstretched handsgreet you well my lord de ribaumont we expected your coming welcome mine honoured friends grandson  and as berenger bent low in reverent greeting sir francis took his hand and kissed his brow saying come in my young friend we are but sitting over our wine and comfits after dinner have you dined  berenger explained that he had dined at the inn where he had taken lodgings  nay but that must not be my lord walwyns grandson here and not my guest you do me wrong sir in not having ridden hither at once  truly my lord i ventured not they sent me forth with quite a companymy tutor and six grooms  our chaplain will gladly welcome his reverend brother said sir francis and as to the grooms one of my fellows shall go and bring them and their horses up what rather gravely as berenger still hesitated i have letters for you here which methinks will make your grandfathers wish clear to you  berenger saw the ambassador was displeased with his reluctance and answered quickly in sooth my lord i would esteem myself only too happy to be thus honoured but in sooth he repeated himself and faltered  in sooth you expected more freedom than in my grave house said walsingham displeased  not so my lord it would be all that i could desire but i have done hastily a kinsman of mine has come up to paris with me and i have made him my guest i know not how to break with himthe chevalier de ribaumont  what the young ruffler in monsieurs suite  no my lord his father he comes on my business he is an old man and can ill bear the cost and i could scarce throw him over  berenger spoke with such earnest bright open simplicity and look so boyish and confiding that sir franciss heart was won and he smiled as he said right lad you are a considerate youth it were not well to cast off your kinsman but when you have read your letters you may well plead your grandfathers desires to say nothing of a hint from her grace to have an eye to you and for the rest you can acquit yourself gracefully to the gentleman by asking him to occupy the lodging that you had taken  berengers face brightened up in a manner that spoke for his sincerity and sir francis added and where be these lodgings  at the croix de lorraine  ha your kinsman has taken you into a nest of guisards but come let me present you to my wife and my other guests then will i give you your letters and you shall return and make your excuses to monsieur le chevalier  berenger seemed to himself to be on familiar ground again as his host thus assumed the direction of him and ushered him into a large dininghall where the table had been forsaken in favour of a lesser table placed in the ample window round which sat assembled some six or eight persons with fruit wine and conserves before them a few little dogs at their feet or on their laps and a lute lying on the knee of one of the young gentlemen sir francis presented the young lord de ribaumont their expected guest to lady walsingham from whom he received a cordial welcome and her two little daughter frances and elizabeth and likewise to the gentleman with the lute a youth about a year older than berenger and of very striking and prepossessing countenance who was named as mr sidney the son of the lord deputy of ireland a couple of gentlemen who would in these times have been termed attaches a couple of lady attendants upon lady walsingham and the chaplain made up the party which on this day chanced only to include besides the household the young traveller sidney berenger was at once seated and accepted a welcomingcup of wine ie a long slender glass with a beautifully twisted stem responded to friendly inquiries about his relatives at home and acknowledged the healths that were drunk in honour of their names after which lady walsingham begged that mr sidney would sing the madrigal he had before promised afterwards a glee was sung by sidney one of the gentlemen and lady walsingham and it was discovered that mr de ribaumont had a trained ear and the very voice that was wanting to the italian song they were practising and so sped a happy hour till a booted and spurred messenger came in with letters for his excellency who being thus roused from his dreamy enjoyment of the music carried young ribaumont off with him to his cabinet and there made over to him a packet with good news from home and orders that made it clear that he could do no other than accept the hospitality of the embassy thus armed with authority he returned to the croix de lorraine where mr adderley could not contain his joy at the change to quarters not only so much more congenial buts so much safer and the chevalier after some polite demur consented to remain in possession of the rooms being in fact well satisfied with the arrangement  let him steep himself up to the lips among the english said tithonus to his son thus will he peaceably relinquish to you all that should have been yours from the first and at court will only be looked on as an overgrown english page  the change to the ambassadors made berenger happy at once he was not french enough in breeding or even constitution to feel the society of the croix de lorraine congenial and kind as the chevalier showed himself it was with a wonderful sense of relief that berenger shook himself free from both his fawning and his patronizing there was a constant sense of not understanding the old gentlemans aims whereas in walsinghams house all was as clear easy and open as at home  and though berenger had been educated in the country it had been in the same tone as that of his new friends he was greatly approved by sir francis as a stripling of parts and modesty mr sidney made him a companion and the young matron lady walsingham treated him as neither lout nor lubber yet he could not be at ease in his state between curiosity and repulsion towards the wife who was to be discarded by mutual consent the sight of the scenes of his early childhood had stirred up warmer recollections of the pretty little playful torment who through the vista of years assumed the air of a tricksy elf rather than the little vixen he used to think her his curiosity had been further stimulated by the sight of his rival narcisse whose effeminate ornaments small stature and seat on horseback filled sir marmadukes pupil with inquisitive disdain as to the woman who could prefer anything so unmanly  sidney was to be presented at the afterdinner reception at the louvre the next day and sir francis proposed to take young ribaumont with him berenger coloured and spoke of his equipment and sidney goodnaturedly offered to come and inspect that young gentleman was one of the daintiest in apparel of his day but he was amazed that the suit in which berenger had paid his devoir to queen elizabeth should have been set asideit was of pearlgrey velvet slashed with rosecoloured satin and in shape and fashion pointdeviceunless as the ambassador said goodhumouredly my young lord ribaumont wished to be one of monsieurs clique thus arrayed then and with the chaplet of pearls bound round the small cap with a heronplume that sat jauntily on one side of his fair curled head berenger took his seat beside the hazeleyed brownhaired sidney in his white satin and crimson and with the ambassador and his attendants were rolled off in the great statecoach drawn by eight horses which had no sinecure in dragging the ponderous machine through the unsavoury debris of the streets  royalty fed in public the sumptuous banquetingroom contained a barrier partitioning off a space where charles ix sat alone at his table as a state spectacle he was a sallow unhealthylooking youth with large prominent dark eyes and a melancholy dreaminess of expression as if the whole ceremony not to say the world itself were distasteful now and then as though endeavouring to cast off the mood he would call to some gentleman and exchange a rough jest generally fortified with a tremendous oath that startled berengers innocent ears he scarcely tasted what was put on his plate but drank largely of sherbet and seemed to be trying to linger through the space allotted for the ceremony  silence was observed but not so absolute that walsingham could not point out to his young companions the notabilities present the lofty figure of henri duke of guise towered high above all around him and his grand features proud lip and stern eye claimed such natural superiority that berenger for a moment felt a glow on his cheek as he remembered his challenge of his right to rival that splendid stature and yet guise was very little older than himself but he walked a prince of men among a crowd of gentlemen attendants on him rather than on the king the elegant but indolentlooking duke de montmorency had a much more attractive air and seemed to hold a kind of neutral ground between guise on the one hand and the reformed who mustered at the other end of the apartment almost by intuition berenger knew the fine calm features of the grayhaired admiral de coligny before he heard him so addressed by the kings loud rough voice when the king rose from table the presentations took place but as charles heard the name of the baron de ribaumont he exclaimed what monsieur are you presented here by our good sisters representative  walsingham answered for him alluding to the negotiations for queen elizabeths marriage with one of the french princessire in the present happy conjuncture it needs not be a less loyal frenchman to have an inheritance in the lands of my royal mistress  what say you monsieur sharply demanded the king are you come here to renounce your country religionand love as i have been told  i hope sire never to be unfaithful where i owe faith said berenger heated startled and driven to extremity  not ill answered for the english giant said charles aside to an attendant then turning eagerly to sidney whose transcendent accomplishments had already become renowned charles welcomed him to court and began to discuss ronsards last sonnet showing no small taste and knowledge of poetry greatly attracted by sidney the king detained the whole english party by an invitation to walsingham to hear music in the queenmothers apartments and berenger following in the wake of his friends found himself in a spacious hall with a raised gallery at one end for the musicians the walls decorated with the glorious paintings collected by francois i greek and roman statues clustered at the angles and cabinets with gems and antiques disposed at intervals not that berenger beheld much of this he was absolutely dazzled with the brilliant assembly into which he was admitted there moved the most beautiful women in france in every lovelycoloured tint that dress could assume their bosoms arms and hair sparkling with jewels their gossamer ruffs surrounding their necks like fairy wings their light laugh mingling with the music as they sat stood or walked in graceful attitudes conversing with one another or with the cavaliers whose brilliant velvet and jewels fifty mixed with their bright array these were the sirens he had heard of the squadron of the queenmother the dangerous beings against whom he was to steel himself and which of them was the child he had played with to whom his vows had been plighted it was like some of the enchanting dreams of romance merely to look at these fair creatures and he stood as if gazing into a magicglass till sir francis walsingham looking round for him said come then my young friend you must do your devoirs to the queens sidney i see is as usual in his element the king has seized upon him  catherine de medicis was seated on a large velvet chair conversing with the german ambassador never beautiful she appeared to more advantage in her mature years than in her girlhood and there was all the dignity of a lifetime of rule in demeanour and gestures the bearing of her head and motion of her exquisite hands her eyes were like her sons prominent and gave the sense of seeing all round at once and her smile was to the highest degree engaging she received the young baron de ribaumont far more graciously than charles has done held out her hand to be kissed and observed that the young gentleman was like madame sa mere whom she well remembered as much admired was it true that she was married in england  berenger bowed assent  ah you english make good spouses she said with a smile ever satisfied with home but your excellency added she turning to walsingham what stones would best please my good sister for the setting of the jewel my son would send her with his portrait he is all for emeralds for the hue of hope but i call it the colour of jealousy  walsingham made a sign that berenger had better retreat from hearing the solemn coquetting carried on by the maiden queen through her gravest ambassadors he fell back and remained watching the brilliant throng trying in vain to discover the bright merry eyes and velvet cheek he remembered of old presently a kind salutation interrupted him and a gentleman who perceived him to be a stranger began to try to set him at ease pointed out to him the handsome foppishlydressed duke of anjou and his ugly spiteful little brother of alengon then designated as queen elizabeths future husband who was saying something to a lady that made her colour and bite her lips is that the younger queen asked berenger as his eye fell on a sallow darkcomplexioned sadlooking little creature in deep mourning and with three or four such statelylooking blackrobed spanishlooking duennas round her as to prove her to be a person of high consequence  that oh no that is madame catherine of navarre who has resided here ever since her mothers death awaiting her brother our royal bridegroom see here is the bride madame marguerite conversing with m de guise  berenger paid but little heed to marguerites showy but already rather coarse beauty and still asked where was the young queen elizabeth of austria she was unwell and not in presence ah then he said her ladies will not be here  that is not certain are you wishing to see any one of them  i would like to see he could not help colouring till his cheeks rivaled the colour of his swordknot i want just to know if she is here i know not if she be called madame or mademoiselle de ribaumont  the fair ribaumont assuredly see she is looking at you shall i present you  a pair of exceedingly brilliant dark eyes were fixed on berenger with a sort of haughty curiosity and halfrecognition the face was handsome and brilliant but he felt indignant at not perceiving a particle of a blush at encountering him indeed rather a look of amusement at the deep glow which his fair complexion rendered so apparent he would fain have escaped from so public an interview but her eye was upon him and there was no avoiding the meeting as he moved nearer he saw what a beautiful person she was her rich primrosecoloured dress setting off her brunette complexion and her stately presence she looked older than he had expected but this was a hotbed where every one grew up early and the expression and manner made him feel that an old intimacy was here renewed and that they were no strangers  we need no introduction cousin she said giving a hand to be saluted i knew you instantly it is the old face of chateau leurre only gone up so high and become so handsome  cousins thought he well it makes things easier but what audacity to be so much at her ease when lucy would have sunk into the earth with shame his bow had saved him the necessity of answering in words and the lady continued  and madame votre mere is she well she was very good to me  berenger did not think that kindness to eustacie had been her chief perfection but he answered that she was well and sent her commendations which the young lady acknowledged by a magnificent curtsey and as beautiful as ever she asked  quite as beautiful he said only somewhat more embonpoint  ah she said smiling graciously and raising her splendid eyes to his face i understand better what that famous beauty was now and the fairness that caused her to be called the swan  it was so personal that the colour rushed again into his cheek no one had ever so presumed to admire him and with a degree gratified and surprised and sensible more and more of the extreme beauty of the lady there was a sort of alarm about him as if this were the very fascination he had been warned against and as if she were casting a net about him which wife as she was it would be impossible to him to break  nay monsieur she laughed is a word from one so near too much for your modesty is it possible that no one has yet told you of your good mien or do they not appreciate greek noses and blue eyes in the land of fat englishmen how have you ever lived en province our princes are ready to hang themselves at the thought of being in such banishment even at courtindeed monsieur has contrived to transfer the noose to m dalengon have you been at court cousin  i have been presented to the queen  she then proceeded to ask questions about the chief personages with a rapid intelligence that surprised him as well as alarmed him for he felt more and more in the power of a very clever as well as beautiful woman and the attraction she exercised made him long the more to escape but she smiled and signed away several cavaliers who would have gained her attention she spoke of queen mary of scotland then in the fifth years of her captivity and asked if he did not feel bound to her service by having been once her partner did not he remember that dance  i have heard my mother speak of it far too often to forget it said berenger glowing again for her who could speak of that occasion without a blush  you wish to gloss over your first inconstancy sir she said archly but he was spared from further reply by philip sidneys coming to tell him that the ambassador was ready to return home he took leave with an alacrity that redoubled his courtesy so much that he desired to be commended to his cousin diane whom he had not seen  to diane said the lady inquiringly  to mademoiselle diane de ribaumont he corrected himself ashamed of his english rusticity i beg pardon if i spoke too familiarly of her  she should be flattered by m le barons slightest recollection said the lady with an ironical tone that there was no time to analyze and with a mutual gesture of courtesy he followed sidney to where sir francis awaited them  well what think you of the french court asked sidney so soon as the young men were in private  i only know that you may bless your good fortune that you stand in no danger from a wife from thence  ha cried sidney laughing you found your lawful owner why did you not present me  i was ashamed of her bold visage  whatwas she the beauteous demoiselle i found you gallanting said philip sidney a good deal entertained who was gazing at you with such visible admiration in her languishing black eyes  the foul fiend seize their impudence  fie for shame thus to speak of your own wife said the mischievous sidney and the fairest  go to sidney were she fairer than venus with a kingdom to her dower i would none of a woman without a blush  what in converse with her wedded husband said sidney were not that overshamefastness  nay now sidney in good sooth give me your opinion should she set her fancy on me even in this hour am i bound in honour to hold by this accursed wedlocklock as it may well be called  i know no remedy said sidney gravely save the two enchanted founts of love and hate they cannot be far away since it was at the siege of paris that rinaldo and orlando drank thereof  another question that berenger would fain have asked sidney but could not for very shame and dread of mockery was whether he himself were so dangerously handsome as the lady had given him to understand with a sense of shame he caught up the little mirror in his casket and could not but allow to himself that the features he there saw were symmetricalthe eyes azure the complexion of a delicate fairness such as he had not seen equaled except in those splendid lorraine princes nor could he judge of the further effect of his openfaced frank simplicity and sweetness of expressioncontemptible perhaps to the astute but most winning to the worldweary he shook his head at the fair reflection smiled as he saw the colour rising at his own sensation of being a fool and then threw it aside vexed with himself for being unable not to feel attracted by the first woman who had shown herself struck by his personal graces and yet aware that this was the very thing he had been warned against and determined to make all the resistance in his power to a creature whose very beauty and enchantment gave him a sense of discomfort     chapter v the convent bird         young knight whatever that dost armes professe      and through long labours huntest after fame      beware of fraud beware of ficklenesse      in choice and change of thy beloved dame                           spenser faery queene   berenger mind was relieved even while his vanity was mortified when the chevalier and his son came the next day to bring him the formal letter requesting the popes annulment of his marriage after he had signed it it was to be taken to eustacie and so soon as he should attain his twentyfirst year he was to dispose of chateau leurre as well as of his claim to the ancestral castle in picardy to his cousin narcisse and thus become entirely free to transfer his allegiance to the queen of england  it was a very good thingthat he well knew and he had a strong sense of virtue and obedience as he formed with his pen the words in all their fullness henri beranger eustache baron de ribaumont et seigneur de leurre he could not help wondering whether the lady who looked at him so admiringly really preferred such a meanlooking little fop as narcisse whether she were afraid of his english home and breeding or whether all this open coquetry were really the court manners of ladies towards gentlemen and he had been an absolute simpleton to be flattered any way she would have been a most undesirable wife and he was well quit of her but he did feel a certain lurking desire that since the bonds were cut and he was no longer in danger from her he might see her again carry home a mental inventory of the splendid beauties he had renounced and decide what was the motive that actuated her in rejecting his own handsome self meantime he proceeded to enjoy the amusements and advantage of his sojourn at paris of which by no means the least was the society of philip sidney and the charm his brilliant genius imparted to every pursuit they shared books at the university fencing and dancing from the best professors italian poetry french sonnets latin epigrams nothing came amiss to sidney the flower of english youth and berenger had taste intelligence and cultivation enough to enter into all in which sidney led the way the good tutor after all his miseries on the journey was delighted to write to lord walwyn that far from being a risk and temptation this visit was a school in all that was virtuous and comely  if the good man had any cause of dissatisfaction it was with the calvinistic tendencies of the ambassadors household walsingham was always on the puritanical side of elizabeths court and such an atmosphere as that of paris where the roman catholic system was at that time showing more corruption than it has ever done before or since in any other place naturally threw him into sympathy with the reformed the reaction that half a century later filled the gallican church with saintliness had not set in her ecclesiastics were the tools of a wicked and bloodthirsty court who hated virtue as much as schism in the men whom they persecuted the huguenots were for the most part men whose instincts for truth and virtue had recoiled from the popular system and thus it was indeed as if piety and morality were arrayed on one side and superstition and debauchery on the other mr adderley thus found the tone of the ambassadors chaplain that of far more complete fellowship with the reformed pastors than he himself was disposed to admit there were a large number of these gathered at paris for the lull in persecution that had followed the battle of moncontour had given hopes of a final accommodation between the two parties and many had come up to consult with the numerous lay nobility who had congregated to witness the king of navarres wedding among them berenger met his fathers old friend isaac gardon who had come to paris for the purpose of giving his only surviving son in marriage to the daughter of a watchmaker to whom he had for many years been betrothed by him the youth with his innocent face and gracious respectful manners was watched with delight as fulfilling the fairest hopes of the poor baron but the old minister would have been sorely disappointed had he known how little berenger felt inclined towards his party  the royal one of course berenger could not love but the rigid bareness and as he thought irreverence of the calvinist and the want of all forms jarred upon one used to a ritual which retained much of the ancient form in the early years of elizabeth every possible diversity prevailed in parish churches according to the predilections of rector and squire from forms scarcely altered from those of old times down to the baldest rudest neglect of all rites and berenger in his country home had been used to the first extreme he could not believe that what he heard and saw among the sacrementaires as they were called was what his father had prized and he greatly scandalized sidney the pupil of hubert languet by openly expressing his distaste and dismay when he found their worship viewed by both walsingham and sidney as a model to which the english protestants ought to be brought  however sidney excused all this as more boyish distaste to sermons and love of externals and berenger himself reflected little on the subject the aspect of the venerable coligny his fathers friend did far more towards making him a huguenot than any discussion of doctrine the good old admiral received him affectionately and talked to him warmly of his father and the grave noble countenance and kind manner won his heart great projects were on foot and were much relished by the young king for raising an army and striking a blow at spain by aiding the reformed in the netherlands and coligny was as ardent as a youth in the cause hoping at once to aid his brethren to free the young king from evil influences and to strike one good stroke against the old national enemy he talked eagerly to sidney of alliances with england and then lamented over the loss of so promising a youth as young ribaumont to the reformed cause in france if the marriage with the heiress could have taken effect he would have obtained estates near enough to some of the main huguenot strongholds to be very important and these would now remain under the power of narcisse de ribaumont a determined ally of the guise faction it was a pity but the admiral could not blame the youth for obeying the wish of his guardian grandfather and he owned with a sigh that england was a more peaceful land than his own beloved country berenger was a little nettled at this implication and began to talk of joining the french standard in a campaign in their present home and described the conversation walsingham said  the admirals favourite project he would do wisely not to brag of it so openly the king of spain has too many in his interest in this place not to be warned and to be thus further egged on to compass the ruin of coligny  i should have thought said sidney that nothing could add to his hatred of the reformed  scarcely said walsingham save that it is they who hinder the duke of guise from being a good frenchman and a foe to spain  politics had not developed themselves in berengers mind and he listened inattentively while walsingham talked over with sidney the state of parties in france where natural national enmity to spain was balanced by the need felt by the queenmother of the support of that great roman catholic power against the huguenots whom walsingham believed her to dread and hate less for their own sake than from the fear of loss of influence over her son he believed charles ix himself to have much leaning towards the reformed but the late victories has thrown the whole court entirely into the power of the guises the truly unscrupulous partisans of rome they were further inflamed against the huguenots by the assassination of the last duke of guise and by the violences that had been committed by some of the reformed party in especial a massacre of prisoners at nerac  sidney exclaimed that the huguenots had suffered far worse cruelties  that is true replied sir francis but my young friend you will find in all matters of reprisals that a party has no memory for what it may commit only for what it may receive  the conversation was interrupted by an invitation to the ambassadors family and guests to a tiltingmatch and subsequent ball at the louvre in the first berenger did his part with credit to the second he went feeling full of that strange attraction of repulsion he knew gentlemen enough in colignys suite for it to be likely that he might remain unperceived among them and he knew this would be prudent but he found himself unexpectedly near the ranks of ladies and smile and gesture absolutely drew him towards his semispouse so that he had no alternative but to lead her out to dance  the stately measure was trod in silence as usual but he felt the dark eyes studying him all the time however he could bear it better now that the deed was done and she had voluntarily made him less to her than any gallant parading or mincing about the room  so you bear the pearls sir she said as the dance finished  the only heirloom i shall take with me he said  is a look at them too great a favour to ask from their jealous guardian she asked  he smiled half ashamed of his own annoyance at being obliged to place them in her hands he was sure she would try to cajole him out of them and by way of asserting his property in them he did not detach them from the band of his black velvet cap but gave it with them into her hand she looked at each one and counted them wistfully  seventeen she said and how beautiful i never saw them so near before they are so becoming to that fair cheek that i suppose no offer from mymy uncle on our behalf would induce you to part with them  an impulse of openhanded gallantry would have made him answer no offer from your uncle but a simple request from you but he thought in time of the absurdity of returning without them and merely answered i have no right to yield them fair lady they are the witness to my forefathers fame and prowess  yes sir and to those of mine also she replied and you would take them over to the enemy from whom that prowess extorted them  the country which honoured and rewarded that prowess replied berenger  she looked at him with an interrogative glance of surprise at the readiness of his answer then with half a sigh said there are your pearls sir i cannot establish our right though i verily believe it was the cause of our last quarrel and she smiled archly  i believe it was he said gravely but added in the moment of relief at recovering the precious heirloom though it was diane who inspired you to seize upon them  ah poor diane you sometimes recollect her then if i remember right you used to agree with her better than with your little spouse cousin  if i quarrelled with her less i liked her less answered berengerwho since the act of separation had not been so guarded in his demeanour and began to give way to his natural frankness  indeed diane would be less gratified than i ought to be and why may i ask  diane was more caressing but she had no truth  truth that was what feu m le baron ever talked of what huguenots weary one with  and the only thing worth seeking the real pearl said berenger without which all else is worthless  ah she said who would have thought that soft youthful face could be so severe you would never forgive a deceit  never he said with the crystal hardness of youth or rather i might forgive i could never esteem  what a bare rude world yours must be she said shivering and no weak ones in it only the strong can dare to be true  truth is strength said berenger for example i see yonder a face without bodily strength perhaps but with perfect candour  ah some huguenot girl of madame catherines no doubtfrom the depths of languedoc and dressed like a fright  no no the young girl behind the pale yellowhaired lady  comment monsieur do you not yet know the young queen  but who is the young demoiselleshe with the superb black eyes and the ruby rose in her black hair  take care sir do you not know i have still a right to be jealous she said blushing bridling and laughing  but this pull on the cords made him the more resolved he would not be turned from his purpose who is she he repeated have i ever seen her before i am sure i remember that innocent look of espieglerie  you may see it on any childs face fresh out of the convent it does not last a month was the still displeased rather jealous answer that little thingi believe they call her niddemerleshe has only just been brought from her nunnery to wait on the young queen ah your gaze was perilous it is bringing on you one of the jests of madame marguerite  with laughter and gaiety a troop of gentlemen descended on m de ribaumont and told him that madame marguerite desired that he should be presented to her the princess was standing by her pale sisterinlaw elizabeth of austria who looked grave and annoyed at the mischievous mirth flashing in marguerites dark eyes  m de ribaumont said the latter her very neck heaving with suppressed fun i see i cannot do you a greater favour than by giving you mademoiselle de niddemerle for your partner  berenger was covered with confusion to find that he had been guilty of such a fixed stare as to bring all this upon the poor girl he feared that his vague sense of recognition had made his gaze more open than he knew and he was really and deeply ashamed of this as his worst act of provincial illbreeding  poor little convent maid with crimson cheeks flashing eyes panting bosom and a neck evidently aching with proud dignity and passion she received his low bow with a sweeping curtsey as lofty as her little person would permit  his cheeks burnt like fire and he would have found words to apologize but she cut him short by saying hastily and low not a word monsieur let us go through it at once no one shall make game of us  he hardly durst look at her again but as he went through his own elaborate paces he knew that the little creature opposite was swimming bending turning bounding with the fluttering fierceness of an angry little bird and that the superb eyes were casting flashes on him that seemed to carry him back to days of early boyhood  once he caught a mortified pleading wistful glance that made him feel as if he had inflicted a cruel injury by his thoughtless gaze and he resolved to plead the sense of recognition in excuse but no sooner was the performance over than she prevented all conversation by saying lead me back at once to the queen sir she is about to retire they were already so near that there was no time to say anything he could only hold as lightly as possible the tiny fingers that he felt burning and quivering in his hand and then after bringing her to the side of the chair of state he was forced to release her with the mere whisper of pardon mademoiselle and the request was not replied to save by the additional stateliness of her curtsey  it was already late and the party was breaking up but his head and heart were still in a whirl when he found himself seated in the ambassadorial coach hearing lady walsinghams wellpleased rehearsal of all the compliments she had received on the distinguished appearance of both her young guests sidney as the betrothed of her daughter was property of her own but she also exulted in the praises of the young lord de ribaumont as proving the excellence of the masters whom she had recommended to remove the rustic clownishness of which he had been accused  nay said sir francis whoever called him too clownish for court spake with design  the brief sentence added to berengers confused sense of being in a mist of false play could his kinsman be bent on keeping him from court could narcisse be jealous of him mademoiselle de ribaumont was evidently inclined to seek him and her cousin might easily think her lands safer in his absence he would have been willing to hold aloof as much as his uncle and cousin could wish save for an angry dislike to being duped and cajoled and moreover a strong curiosity to hear and see more of that little passionate bird fresh from the convent cage her gesture and her eyes irresistibly carried him back to old times though whether to an angry blackbird in the yewtree alleys at leurre or to the eager face that had warned him to save his father he could not remember with any distinctness at any rate he was surprised to find himself thinking so little in comparison about the splendid beauty and winning manners of his discarded spouse though he quite believed that now her captive was beyond her grasp she was disposed to catch at him again and try to retain him or as his titillated vanity might whisper his personal graces might make her regret the family resolution which she had obeyed     chapter vi foully cozened          i was the more deceivedhamlet   the unhappy charles ix had a disposition that in good hands might have achieved great nobleness and though cruelly bound and trained to evil was no sooner allowed to follow its natural bent than it reached out eagerly towards excellence at this moment it was his mothers policy to appear to leave the ascendancy to the huguenot party and he was therefore allowed to contract friendships which deceived the intended victims the more completely because his admiration and attachment were spontaneous and sincere philip sidneys varied accomplishment and pure lofty character greatly attracted the young king who had leant on his arm conversing during great part of the ball and the next morning sent a royal messenger to invite the two young gentlemen to a part at pallmall in the tuileries gardens  pallmall was either croquet or its nearest relative and was so much the fashion that games were given in order to keep up political influence perhaps because the freedom of a garden pastime among groves and bowers afforded opportunities for those seductive arts on which queen catherine placed so much dependence the formal gardens with their squares of level turf and clipped alleys afforded excellent scope both for players and spectators and numerous games had been set on foot from all of which however berenger contrived to exclude himself in his restless determination to find out the little demoiselle de niddemerle or at least to discover whether any intercourse in early youth accounted for his undefined sense of remembrance  he interrogated the first disengaged person he could find but it was only the young abbe de mericour who had been newly brought up from dauphine by his elder brother to solicit a benefice and who knew nobody to him ladies were only bright phantoms such as his books had taught him to regard like the temptations of st anthony but whom he actually saw treated with as free admiration by the ecclesiastic as by the layman  suddenly a clamour of voices arose on the other side of the closelyclipped wall of limes by which the two youths were walking there were the clear tones of a young maiden expostulating in indignant distress and the bantering indolent determination of a male annoyer  hark exclaimed berenger this must be seen to  have a care returned mericour i have heard that a man needs look twice are meddling  scarcely hearing berenger strode on as he had done at the last village wake when he had rescued cis of the down from the impertinence of a dorchester scrivener it was a like case he saw when breaking through the arch of clipped limed he beheld the little demoiselle de niddemerle driven into a corner and standing at bay with glowing cheeks flashing eyes and hands clasped over her breast while a young man dressed in the extreme of foppery was assuring her that she was the only lady who had not granted him a tokenthat he could not allow such pensionnaire airs and that now he had caught her he would have his revenge and win her rosecoloured breakknot another gentleman stood by laughing and keeping guard in the walk that led to the more frequented part of the gardens  hold thundered berenger  the assailant had just mastered the poor girls hand but she took advantage of his surprise to wrench it away and gather herself up as for a spring but the abbe in dismay the attendant in anger cried out stayit is monsieur  monsieur be he who he may exclaimed berenger no honest man can see a lady insulted  are you mad it is monsieur the duke of anjou said mericour pouncing on his arm  shall we have him to the guardhouse added the attendant coming up on the other side but henri de valois waved them both back and burst into a derisive laugh no no do you not see who it is monsieur the english baron still holds the end of the halter his sale is not yet made come away do he will soon have enough on his hands without us farewell fair lady another time you will be free of your jealous giant  so saying the duke of anjou strolled off feigning indifference and contempt and scarcely heeding that he had been traversed in one of the malicious adventures which he delighted to recount in public before the discomfited victim herself often with shameful exaggeration  the girl clasped her hands over her brow with a gesture of dismay and cried oh if you have only not touched your sword  let me have the honour of reconducting you mademoiselle said berenger offering his hand but after the first sigh of relief a tempestuous access seized her she seemed about to dash away his hand her bosom swelled with resentment and with a voice striving for dignity though choked with strangled tears she exclaimed no indeed had not m le baron forsaken me i had never been thus treated and her eyes flashed through their moisture  eustacie you are eutacie  whom would you have me to be otherwise i have the honour to wish m le baron a good morning  eustacie stay hear me it concerns my honour i see it is youbut whom have i seen who was she he cried half wild with dismay and confusion was it diane  you have seen and danced with diane de ribaumont answered eustacie still coldly but what of that let me go monsieur you have cast me off already  i when all this has been of your own seeking  mine cried eustacie panting with the struggle between her dignity and her passionate tears i meddled not i heard that m le baron was gone to a strange land and had written to break off old ties her face was in a flame and her efforts for composure absolute pain  i again exclaimed berenger the first letter came from your uncle declaring that it was your wish and as her face changed rapidly then it was not true he has not had your consent  what would i hold to one who despised mewho came here and never even asked to see this hated spouse  i did i entreated to see you i would not sign the application tilloh there has been treachery and have they made you too sign it  when they showed me your name they were welcome to mine  berenger struck his forehead with wrath and perplexity then cried joyfully it will not stand for moment so foul a cheat can be at once exposed eutacie you knowyou understand that it was not you but diane whom i saw and detested and no wonder when she was acting such a cruel treason  oh no diane would never so treat me cried eustacie i see how it was you did not know that my father was latterly called marquis de niddemerle and when they brought me here they would call me after him they said a maid of honour must be demoiselle and my uncle said there was only one way in which i could remain madame de ribaumont and the name must have deceived you thou wast always a great dull boy she added with a sudden assumption of childish intimacy that annihilated the nine years since their parting  had i seen thee i had not mistaken for an instant this little face stirred my heart hers repelled me and she deceived me wittingly eustacie for i asked after her by name  ah she wished to spare my embarrassment and then her brother must have dealt with her  i see exclaimed berenger i am to be palmed off thus that thou mayest be reserved for narcisse tell me eustacie wast thou willing  i hate narcisse she cried but oh i am lingering too long monsieur will make some hateful tale i never fell into his way before my queen and madame la comtesse are so careful only today as i was attending her alone the king came and gave her his arm and i had to drop behind i must find her i shall be missed she added in sudden alarm oh what will they say  no blame for being with thy husband he answered clasping her hand thou art mine henceforth i will soon cut our way out of the web thy treacherous kindred have woven meantime  hush there are voices cried eustacie in terror and guided by something he could not discern she fled with the swiftness of a bird down the alley following with the utmost speed that might not bear the appearance of pursuit he found that on coming to the turn she had moderated her pace and was more tranquilly advancing to a bevy of ladies who sat perched on the stone steps like great butterflies sunning themselves watching the game and receiving the attentions of their cavaliers he saw her absorbed into the group and then began to prowl round it in the alleys in a tumult of amazement and indignation he had been shamefully deceived and cheated and justice he would have he had been deprived of a thing of his own and he would assert his right he had been made to injure and disown the creature he was bound to protect and he must console her and compensate to her were it only to redeem his honour he never even thought whether he loved her he merely felt furious at the wrong he had suffered and been made to commit and hotly bent on recovering what belonged to him he might even have plunged down among the ladies and claimed her as his wife if the young abbe de mericour who was two years older than he and far less of a boy for his years had not joined him in his agitated walk he then learnt that all the court knew that the daughter of the late marquis de niddemerle comte de ribaumont was called by his chief title but that her marriage to himself had been forgotten by some and unknown to others and thus that the first error between the cousins had not been wonderful in a stranger since the chevaliers daughter had always been mdlle de ribaumont the error once made berengers distaste to diane had been so convenient that it had been carefully encouraged and the desire to keep him at a distance from court and throw him into the background was accounted for the abbe was almost as indignant as berenger and assured him both of his sympathy and his discretion  i see no need for discretion said berenger i shall claim my wife in the face of the sun  take counsel first i entreat exclaimed mericour the ribaumonts have much influence with the guise family and now you have offended monsieur  ah where are those traitorous kinsmen cried berenger  fortunately all are gone on an expedition with the queenmother you will have time to think i have heard my brother say no one ever prospered who offended the meanest follower of the house of lorraine  i do not want prosperity i only want my wife i hope i shall never see paris and its deceivers again  ah but is it true that you have applied to have the marriage annulled at rome  we were both shamefully deceivers that can be nothing  a decree of his holiness you a huguenot she an heiress all is against you my friend be cautions exclaimed the young ecclesiastic alarmed by his passionate gestures to break forth now and be accused of brawling in the palace precincts would be fatalfatalmost fatal  i am as calm as possible returned berenger i mean to act most reasonably i shall stand before the king and tell him openly how i have been tamperes with demanding my wife before the whole court  long before you could get so far the ushers would have dragged you away for brawling or for maligning an honourable gentlemen you would have to finish your speech in the bastille and it would be well if even your english friends could get you out alive  why what a place is this began berenger but again mericour entreated him to curb himself and his english education had taught him to credit the house of guide with so much mysterious power and wickedness that he allowed himself to be silenced and promised to take no open measures till he had consulted the ambassador  he could not obtain another glimpse of eustacie and the hours passed tardily till the break up of the party charles could scarcely release sidney from his side and only let him go on condition that he should join the next day in an expedition to the hunting chateau of montpipeau to which the king seemed to look forward as a great holiday and breathing time  when at length the two youths did return sir francis walsingham was completely surprised by the usually tractable wellbehaved stripling whose praises he had been writing to his old friend bursting in on him with the outcry sir sir i entreat your counsel i have been foully cozened  of how much said sir francis in a tone of reprobation  of my wife of mine honour sir your excellency i crave pardon if i spoke too hotly said berenger collecting himself but it is enough to drive a man to frenzy  sit down my lord de ribaumont take breath and let me know what is this coil what hath thus moved him mr sidney  it is as he says sir replied sidney who had beard all as they returned he has been greatly wronged the chevalier de ribaumont not only writ to propose the separation without the ladys knowledge but imposed his own daughter on our friend as the wife he had not seen since infancy  there sir broke forth berenger surely if i claim mine own in the face of day no man can withhold her from me  hold said sir francis what mean this passion young sir methought you came hither convinced that both the religion and the habits in which the young lady had been bred up rendered your infantine contract most unsuitable what hath fallen out to make this change in your mind  that i was cheated sir the lady who palmed herself off on me as my wife was a mere impostor the chevaliers own daughter  that may be but what known you of this other lady has she been bred up in faith or manners such as your parents would have your wife  she is my wife reiterated berenger my faith is plighted to her that is enough for me  sir francis made a gesture of despair he has seen her i suppose said he to sidney  yes truly sir answered berenger and found that she had been as greatly deceived as myself  then mutual consent is wanting said the statesman gravely musing  that is even as i say began berenger but walsingham help up his hand and desired that he would make his full statement in the presence of his tutor then sounding a little whistle the ambassador despatched a page to request the attendance of mr adderley and recommended young ribaumont in the meantime to compose himself  used to being under authority as berenger was the somewhat severe tone did much to allay his excitement and remind him that right and reason were so entirely on his side that he had only to be cool and rational to make them prevail he was thus able to give a collected and coherent account of his discovery that the part of his wife had been assumed by her cousin diane and that the signature of both the young pair to the application to the pope had been obtained on false pretences that he had as sidney said been foully cozened in both senses of the word was as clear as daylight but he was much angered and disappointed to find that neither the ambassador nor his tutor could see that eustacies worthiness was proved by the iniquity of her relation or that any one of the weighty reasons for the expediency of dissolving the marriage was remove the whole affair had been in such good train a little before that mr adderley was much distressed that it should thus have been crossed and thought the new phase of affairs would be far from acceptable at combe walwyn  whatever is just and honourable must be acceptable to my grandfather said berenger  even so said walsingham but it were well to consider whether justice and honour require you to overthrow the purpose wherewith he sent you hither  surely sir justice and require me to fulfil a contract to which the other party is constant said berenger feeling very wise and prudent for calling that wistful indignant creature the other party  that is also true said the ambassador provided she be constant but you own that she signed the requisition for the dissolution  she did so but under the same deception as myself and further mortified and aggrieved at my seeming faithlessness  so it may easily be represented muttered walsingham  how sir cried berenger impetuously do you doubt her truth  heaven forefend said sir francis that i should discuss any fair ladys sincerity the question is how far you are bound have i understood you that you are veritably wedded not by a mere contract of espousal  berenger could produce no documents for they had been left at chateau leurre and on his fathers death the chevalier had claimed the custody of them but he remembered enough of the ceremonial to prove that the wedding had been a veritable one and that only the papal intervention could annul it  indeed an englishman going by english law would own no power in the pope nor any one on earth to sever the sacred tie of wedlock but french courts of law would probably ignore the mode of application and would certainly endeavour to separate between a catholic and a heretic  i am english sir in heart and faith said berenger earnestly look upon me as such and tell me am i married or single at this moment  married assuredly mores the pity said sir francis  and no law of god or man divides us without our own consent there was no denying that the mutual consent of the young pair at their present age was all that was wanting to complete the inviolability of their marriage contract  berenger was indeed only eighteen and eustacie more than a year younger but there was nothing in their present age to invalidate their marriage for persons of their rank were usually wedded quite as young or younger walsingham was only concerned at his old friends disappointment and at the danger of the young man running headlong into a connection probably no more suitable than that with diane de ribaumont would have been but it was not convenient to argue against the expediency of a mans loving his own wife and when berenger boldly declared he was not talking of love but of justice it was only possible to insist that he should pause and see where true justice lay  and thus the muchperplexed ambassador broke up the conference with his hot and angry young guest  and mistress lucy sighed mr adderley in rather an inapropos fashion it must be owned but then he had been fretted beyond endurance by his pupil striding up and down his room reviling diane and describing eustacie while he was trying to write these uncomfortable tidings to lord walwyn  lucy what makes you bring her up to me exclaimed berenger little dolly would be as much to the purpose  only sir no resident at hurst walwyn could fail to know that has been planned and desired  pshaw cries berenger have you not heard that it was a mere figment and that i could scarce have wedded lucy safely even had this matter gone as you wish this is the luckiest chance that could have befallen her  that may be said mr adderley i wish she may think sosweet young lady  i tell you mr adderley you should know better lucy has more sense my aunt whom she follows more than any other creature ever silenced the very sport or semblance of love passages between us even as children by calling them unseemly in one wedded as i am brother and sister we have ever been and have loved as suchay and shall i know of late some schemes have crossed my mothers mind  yea and that of others  but they have not ruffled lucys quiet naturetrust me and for the rest what doth she need me in comparison of this poor child shelike a bit of her own gray lavender in the shadiest nook of the walled garden tranquil theresure not to be taken there save to company with fine linen in some trim scented coffer whilst this fresh glowing rosebud has grown up pure and precious in the very midst of the foulest corruption christendom can show and if i snatch her not from it i the innocence and sweetness what is to be her fate the very pity of a christian the honour of a gentleman would urge me even if it were not my most urgent duty  mr adderley argued no more when berenger came to his duty in the matter he was invincible and moreover all the more provoking because he mentioned it with a sort of fiery sound of relish and looked so very boyish all the time poor mr adderley feeling as if his trust were betrayed loathing the very idea of a french court lady saw that his pupil had been allured into a headlong passion to his own misery and that of all whose hopes were set on him yet preached to by this stripling scholar about duties and sacred obligations well might he rue the day he ever set foot in paris  then to his further annoyance came a royal messenger to invite the baron de ribaumont to join the expedition to montpipeau of course he must go and his tutor must be left behind and who could tell into what mischief he might not be tempted  here however sidney gave the poor chaplain some comfort he believed that no ladies were to be of the party and that the gentlemen were chiefly of the kings new friends among the huguenots such as coligny his soninlaw teligny rochefoucauld and the like among whom the young gentleman could not fall into any very serious harm and might very possibly be influenced against a roman catholic wife at any rate he would be out of the way and unable to take any dangerous steps  this same consideration so annoyed berenger that he would have declined the invitation if royal invitations could have been declined and in the morning before setting out he dressed himself point device and with osbert behind him marched down to the croix de larraine to call upon the chevalier de ribaumont he had a very fine speech at his tongues end when he set out but a good deal of it had evaporated when he reached the hotel and perhaps he was not very sorry not to find the old gentleman within  on his return he indited a note to the chevalier explaining that he had now seen his wife madame la baronne de ribaumont and had come to an understanding with her by which he found that it was under a mistake that the application to the pope had been signed and that they should therefore follow it up with a protest and act as if no such letter had been sent  berenger showed this letter to walsingham who though much concerned could not forbid his sending it poor lad he said to the tutor tis an excellently writ billet for one so young i would it were in a wiser cause but he has fairly the bit between his teeth and there is no checking him while he has this show of right on his side  and poor mr adderley could only beseech mr sidney to take care of him     chapter vii the queens pastoral         either very gravely gay      or very gaily grave             w m praed   montpipeau though in the present day a suburb of paris was in the sixteenth century far enough from the city to form a sylvan retreat where charles ix could snatch a short respite from the intrigues of his court under pretext of enjoying his favourite sport surrounded with his favoured associates of the huguenot party he seemed to breathe a purer atmosphere and to yield himself up to enjoyment greater than perhaps his sad life had ever known  he rode among his gentlemen and the brilliant cavalcade passed through poplarshaded roads clattered through villages and threaded their way through bits of forest still left for the royal chase the people thronged out of their houses and shouted not only vive le roy but vive lamiral and more than once the cry was added spanish war or civil war the heart of france was if not with the reformed at least against spain and the lorrainers and sidney perceived from the conversation of the gentlemen round him that the present expedition had been devised less for the sake of the sport than to enable the king to take measures for emancipating himself from the thraldom of his mother and engaging the country in a war against philip ii sidney listened but berenger chafed feeling only that he was being further carried out of reach of his explanation with his kindred and thus they arrived at montpipeau a tower tall and narrow like all french designs but expanded on the ground floor by wooden buildings capable of containing the numerous train of a royal hunter and surrounded by an extent of waste land without fine trees though with covert for deer boars and wolves sufficient for sport to royalty and death to peasantry charles seemed to sit more erect in his saddle and to drink in joy with every breath of the thymescented breeze from the moment his horse bounded on the hollowsounding turf and when he leapt to the ground with the elastic spring of youth he held out his hands to sidney and to teligny crying welcome my friends here i am indeed a king  it was a lovely summer evening early in august and charles bade the supper to be spread under the elms that shaded a green lawn in front of the chateau etiquette was here so far relaxed as to permit the sovereign to dine with his suite and tables chairs and benches were brought out drapery festooned in the trees to keep off sun and wind the king lay down in the fern and let his happy dogs fondle him and as a hersgirl passed along a vista in the distance driving her goats before her philip sidney marvelled whether it was not even thus in arcadia  presently there was a sound of horses trampling wheels moving a party of gaily gilded archers of the guard jingled up and in their midst was a coach berengers heart seemed to leap at once to his lips as a glimpse of ruffs hats and silks dawned on him through the windows  the king rose from his lair among the fern the admiral stood forward all heads were bared and from the coachdoor alighted the young queen no longer pale subdued and indifferent but with a face shining with girlish delight as she held out her hand to the admiral ah this is well this is beautiful she exclaimed it is like our happy chases in the tyrol ah sire to the king how i thank you for letting me be with you  after her majesty descended her gentlemanusher then came the ladyinwaiting madame de sauve the wife of the state secretary in attendance on charles and a triumphant coquettish beauty than a fat goodhumoured austrian dame always called madame la comtesse because her german name was unpronounceable and without whom the queen never stirred and lastly a little figure rounded yet slight slender yet soft and plump with a kittenlike alertness and grace of motion as she sprang out collected the queens properties of fan kerchief pouncetbox mantle c and disappeared in to the chateau without berengers being sure of anything but that her little black hat had a rosecoloured feather in it  the queen was led to a chair placed under one of the largest trees and there charles presented to her such of his gentlemen as she was not yet acquainted with the baron de ribaumont among the rest  i have heard of m de ribaumont she said in a tone that made the colour mantle in his fair cheek and with a sign of her hand she detained him at her side till the king had strolled away with madame la sauve and no one remained near but her german countess then changing her tone to one of confidence which the highbred homeliness of her austrian manner rendered inexpressibly engaging she said i must apologize monsieur for the giddiness of my sisterinlaw which i fear caused you some embarrassment  ah madame said berenger kneeling on one knee as she addressed him and his heart bounding with wild undefined hope i cannot be grateful enough it was that which led to my being undeceived  it was true then that you were mistaken said the queen  treacherously deceived madame by those whose interest it is to keep us apart said berenger colouring with indignation they imposed my other cousin on me as my wife and caused her to think me cruelly neglectful  i know said the queen yet mdlle de ribaumont is far more admired than my little blackbird  that may be madame but not by me  yet is it true that you came to break off the marriage  yes madame said berenger honestly but i had not seen her  and now said the queen smiling  i would rather die than give her up said berenger oh madame help us of your grace every one is trying to part us every one is arguing against us but she is my own true wedded wife and if you will but give her to me all will be well  i like you m de ribaumont said the queen looking him full in the face you are like our own honest germans at my home and i think you mean all you say i had much rather my dear little nid de merle were with you than left here to become like all the others she is a good little lieglinghow do you call it in french she has told me all and truly i would help you with all my heart but it is not as if i were the queenmother you must have recourse to the king who loves you well and at my request included you in the huntingparty  berenger could only kiss her hand in token of earnest thanks before the repast was announced and the king came to lead her to the table spread beneath the trees the whole party supped together but berenger could have only a distant view of his little wife looking very demure and grave by the side of the admiral  but when the meal was ended there was a loitering in the woodland paths amid healthy openings or glades trimmed into discreet wildness fit for royal rusticity the sun set in parting glory on one horizon the moon rising in crimson majesty on the other a musician at intervals touched the guitar and sang spanish or italian airs whose soft or quaint melody came dreamily through the trees then it was that with beating heart berenger stole up to the maiden as she stood behind the queen and ventured to whisper her name and clasp her hand  she turned their eyes met and she let him lead her apart into the wood it was not like a lovers tryst it was more like the continuation of their old childish terms only that he treated her as a thing of his own that he was bound to secure and to guard and she received him as her own lawful but tardy protector to be treated with perfect reliance but with a certain playful resentment  you will not run away from me now he said making full prize of her hand and arm  ah is not she the dearest and best of queens and the large eyes were lifted up to him in such frank seeking of sympathy that he could see into the depths of their clear darkness  it is her doing then though eustacie when i knew the truth not flood nor fire should keep me long from you my heart my love my wife  what wife in spite of those villainous letter she said trying to pout  wife for ever inseparably only you must be able to swear that you knew nothing of the one that brought me here  poor me no indeed there was celine carried off at fourteen madame de blanchet a bride at fifteen all marrying hither and thither and i she pulled a face irresistibly drolli growing old enough to dress st catherines hair and wondering where was m le baron  they thought me too young said berenger to take on me the cares of life  so they were left to me  cares what cares have you but finding the queens fan  little you know she said half contemptuous half mortified  nay pardon me ma mie who has troubled you  ah you would call it nothing to be beset by narcisse to be told ones husband is faithless till one half believes it to be looked at by ugly eyes to be liable to be teased any day by monsieur or worse by that mocking ape m dalecon and to have nobody who can or will hinder it  she was sobbing by this time and he exclaimed ah would that i could revenge all never never shall it be again what blessed grace has guarded you through all  did i not belong to you she said exultingly and had not sister monique yes and m le baron striven hard to make me good ah how kind he was  my father yes eustacie he loved you to the last he bade me on his deathbed give you his own book of psalms and tell you he had always loved and prayed for you  ah his psalms i shall love them even at bellaise when first we came there we used to sing them but the mother abbess went out visiting and when she came back she said they were heretical and soeur monique would not let me say the texts he taught me but i would not forget them i say them often in my heart  then he cried joyfully you will willingly embrace my religion  be a huguenot she said distastefully  i am not precisely a huguenot i do not love them he answered hastily but all shall be made clear to you at my home in england  england she said must we live in england away from every one  ah they will love so much i shall make you so happy there he answered there you will see what it is to be true and trustworthy  i had rather live at chateau leurre or my own nid de merle she replied there i should see soeur monique and my aunt the abbess and we would have the peasants to dance in the castle court oh if you could but see the orchards at le bocage you would never want to go away and we could come now and then to see my dear queen  i am glad at least you would not live at court  oh no i have been more unhappy here than ever i knew could be borne  and a very few words from him drew out all that had happened to her since they parted her father had sent her to bellaise a convent founded by the first of the angevin branch which was presided over by his sister and where diane was also educated the good sister monique had been mistress of the pensionnaires and had evidently taken much pains to keep her charge innocent and devout diane had been taken to court about two years before but eustacie had remained at the convent till some three months since when she had been appointed maid of honour to the recentlymarried queen and her uncle had fetched her from anjou and had informed her at the same time that her young husband had turned englishman and heretic and that after a few formalities had been complied with she would become the wife of her cousin narcisse now there was no person whom she so much dreaded as narcisse and when berenger spoke of him as a feeble fop she shuddered as though she knew him to have something of the tiger  do you remember benoit she said poor benoit who came to normandy as my laquais when i went back to anjou he married a girl from leurre and went to aid his father at the farm the poor fellow had imbibed the barons doctrinehe spread it it was reported that there was a nest of huguenots on the estate my cousin came to break it up with his gens darmes o berenger he would hear no entreaties he had no mercy he let them assemble on sunday that they might be all together he fired the house shot down those who escaped if a prisoner were made gave him up to the bishops court benoit my poor good benoit who used to lead my palfrey was first wounded then tried and burntburnt in the place at lucon i heard narcisse laughlaugh as he talked of the cries of the poor creatures in the conventicler my own people who loved me i was but twelve years old but even then the wretch would pay me a halfmocking courtesy as one destined to him and the more i disdained him and said i belonged to you the more both he and my aunt the abbess smiled as though they had their bird in a cage but they left me in peace till my uncle brought me to court and then all began again and when they said you gave me up i had no hope not even of a convent but ah it is all over now and i am so happy you are grown so gentle and so beautiful berenger and so much taller than i ever figured you to myself and you look as if you could take me up in your arms and let no harm happen to me  never never shall it said berenger felling all manhood strength and love stir within him and growing many years in heart in that happy moment my sweet little faithful wife never fear again now you are mine  alas poor children they were a good way from the security they had begun to fancy for themselves early the next morning berenger went in his straightforward way to the king thanked him and requested his sanction for at once producing themselves to the court as monsieur le baron and madame la baronne de ribaumont  at this charles swore a great oath as one in perplexity and bade him not go so fast  see here said he with the rude expletives only too habitual with him she is a pretty little girl and she and her lands are much better with an honest man like you than with that pendard of a cousin but you see he is bent on having her and he belongs to a cutthroat crew that halt at nothing i would not answer for your life if you tempted him so strongly to rid himself of you  my own sword sire can guard my life  plague upon your sword what does the foolish youth think it would do against halfadozen poniards and pistols in a lane black as hells mouth  the foolish young was thinking how could a king so full of fiery words and strange oaths bear to make such an avowal respecting his own capital and his own courtiers all he could do was to bow and reply nevertheless sire at whatever risk i cannot relinquish my wife i would take her at one to the ambassadors  how sir interrupted charles haughtily and angrily if you forget that you are a french nobleman still i should remember it the ambassador may protect his own countrymennone else  i entreat your majestys pardon said berenger anxious to retract his false step it was your goodness and the gracious queens that made me hope for your sanction  all the sanction charles de valois can give is yours and welcome said the king hastily the sanction of the king of france is another matter to say the truth i see no way out of the affair but an elopement sire exclaimed the astonished berenger whose strictlydisciplined education had little prepared him for such counsel  look you if i made you known as a wedded pair the chevalier and his son would not only assassinate you but down on me would come my brother and my mother and m de guise and all their crew veritably for giving the prize out of the mouth of their satellite but nominally for disregarding the pope favouring a heretical marriage and i know not what but as things go here i should assuredly get the worst of it and if you made safely off with your prize no one could gainsay youi need know nothing about itand lady and lands would be your without dispute you might ride off from the skirts of the forest i would lead the hunt that way and the three days riding would bring you to normady for you had best cross to england immediately when she is one there owned by your kindred monsieur le cousin may gnash his teeth as he will he must make the best of it for the sake of the honour of his house and you can safely come back and raise her people and yours to follow the oriflamme when it takes the field against spain what you are still discontented speak out plain speaking is a treat not often reserved for me  sire i am most grateful for your kindness but i should greatly prefer going straightforward  peste well is it said that a blundering englishman goes always right before him there then as your king on the one hand as the friend who has brought you and your wife together sir it is my command that you do not compromise me and embroil greater matters than you can understand by publicly claiming this girl privately i will aid you to the best of my ability publicly i command you for my sake if you heed not your own to be silent  berenger sought out sidney who smiled at his surprise  do you not see he said that the king is your friend and would be very glad to save the ladys lands from the guisards but that he cannot say so he can only befriend a huguenot by stealth  i would not be such a king for worlds  however eustacie was enchanted it was like a prince and princess in mere perinnes fairy tales could they go like a shepherd and shepherdess she had no fearsno scruples would she not be with her husband it was the most charming frolic in the world so the king seemed to think it though he was determined to call it all the queens doingthe first intrigue of her own making her like all the rest of usthe queens little comedy he undertook to lead the chase as far as possible in the direction of normandy when the young pair might ride on to an inn meet fresh horses and proceed to chateau leurre and thence to england he would himself provide a safeconduct which as berenger suggested would represent them as a young englishman taking home his young wife eustacie wanted at least to masquerade as an englishwoman and played off all the fragments of the language she had caught as a child but berenger only laughed at her and said they just fitted the french bride it was very pretty to laugh at eustacie she made such a droll pretence at pouting with her rosebud lips and her merry velvety eyes belied them so drolly  such was to be the queens pastoral but when elisabeth found the responsibility so entirely thrown on her she began to look grave and frightened it was no doubt much more than she had intended when she brought about the meeting between the young people and the king who had planned the elopement seemed still resolved to make all appear her affair she looked all day more like the grave spiritless being she was at court than like the bright young rural queen of the evening before and she was long in her little oratory chapel in the evening berenger who was waiting in the hall with the other huguenot gentlemen thought her devotions interminable since they delayed all her ladies at length however a page came up to him and said in a low voice the queen desires the presence of m le baron de ribaumont  he followed the messenger and found himself in the little chapel before a gailyadorned altar and numerous little shrines and niches round sidney would have dreaded a surreptitious attempt to make him conform but berenger had no notion of such perilshe only saw that eustacie was standing by the queens chair and a kindlylooking austrian priest the queens confessor held a book in his hand  the queen came to meet him for my sake she said with all her sweetness to ease my mind i should like to see my little eustacie made entirely your own ere you go father meinhard tells me it is safer that when the parties were under twelve years old the troth should be again exchanged no other ceremony is needed  i desire nothing but to have her made indissolubly my own said berenger bowing  and the king permits added elisabeth  the king growled out it is your comedy madame i meddle not  the austrian priest had no common language with berenger but latin he asked a few questions and on hearing the answers declared that the sacrament of marriage had been complete but thatas was often done in such caseshe would once more hear the trothplight of the young pair the brief formula was therefore at once exchangedthe king when the queen looked entreatingly at him rousing himself to make the bride over to berenger as soon as the vows had been made in the briefest manner the king broke in boisterously there you are twice marred to please madame there but hold your tongues all of you about this scene in the play  then almost pushing eustacie over to berenger he added there she is take your wife sir but mind she was as much yours before as she is now  but for all berenger had said about his wife it was only now that he really felt her his own and became husband rather than loverman instead of boy she was entirely his own now and he only desired to be away with her but some days delay was necessary a chase on the scale of the one that was to favour their evasion could not be got up without some notice and moreover it was necessary to procure money for neither sidney nor ribaumont had more than enough with them for the needful liberalities to the kings servants and huntsmen indeed berenger had spent all that remained in his purse upon the wares of an italian pedlar whom he and eustacie met in the woods and whose gloves as sweet as fragrant posies fans scentboxes pocket mirrors genoa wire venice chains and other toys afforded him the mean of making up the gifts that he wished to carry home to his sisters and eustacies counsel was merrily given in the choice and when the vendor began with a meaning smile to recommend to the young pair themselves a little silvernetted heart as a lovetoken and it turned out that all berengers money was gone so that it could not be bought without giving up the scented casket destined for lucy eustacie turned with her sweetest proudest smile and said no no i will not have it what do we two want with lovetokens now  sidney had taken the youthful and romantic view of the case and considered himself to be taking the best possible bare of is young friend by enabling him to deal honourably with so charming a little wife as eustacie ambassador and tutor would doubtless be very angry but sidney could judge for himself of the lady and he therefore threw himself into her interests and sent his servant back to paris to procure the necessary sum for the journey of master henry berenger and mistress mary his wife sidney was on his return alone to paris to explain all to the elders and pacify them as best he could and his servant was already the bearer of a letter from berenger that was to be sent at once to england with walsinghams dispatches to prepare lord walwyn for the arrival of the runaways the poor boy laboured to be impressively calm and reasonable in his explanation of the misrepresentation and of his strong grounds for assuming his rights with his persuasion that his wife would readily join the english churcha consideration that he knew would greatly smooth the way for her indeed his own position was impregnable nobody could blame him for taking his own wife to himself and he was so sure of her charms that he troubled himself very little about the impression she might make on his kindred if they loved her it was all right if not he could take her back to his own castle and win fame and honour under the banner of france in the low countries as the lucy thistlewood she was far too discreet to feel any disappointment or displeasure or if she should it was her own fault and that of his mother for all her life she had known him to be married so he finished his letter with a message that the bells should be ready to ring and that when philip heard three guns fired on the coast he might light the big beacon pile above the combe  meantime the queens pastoral was much relished by all the spectators the state of things was only avowed to charles elisabeth and philip sidney and even the last did not know of the renewed troth which the king chose to treat as such a secret but no one had any doubt of the mutual relations of m de ribaumont and mdlle de nid de merle and their dream of bliss was like a pastoral for the special diversion of the holiday of montpipeau the transparency of their indifference in company their meeting eyes their trysts with the secrecy of an ostrich were the subjects of constant amusement to the elders more especially as the shyness blushes and caution were much more on the side of the young husband than on that of the lady fresh from her convent simple with childishness and innocence it was to her only the natural completion of her life to be altogether berengers and the brief concealment of their full union added a certain romantic enchantment which added to her exultation in her victory over her cruel kindred she had been upon her own mind poor child for her few weeks of court life she had been upon her own mind poor child for her few weeks of court life but not long enough to make her grow older though just so long as to make the sense of her having her own protector with her doubly precious he on the other hand though full of happiness did also feel constantly deepening on him the sense of the charge and responsibility he had assumed hardly knowing how the more dear eustacie became to him the more she rested on him and became entirely his the more his boyhood and insouciance drifted away behind him and while he could hardly bear to heave his darling a moment out of his sight the less he could endure any remark or jest upon his affection for her his home had been a refined one where ceciles convent purity seemed to diffuse an atmosphere of modest reserve such as did not prevail in the court of the maiden queen herself and the lad of eighteen had not seem enough of the outer world to have rubbed off any of that grace his seniority to his little wife seemed to show itself chiefly in his being put out of countenance for her when she was too innocent and too proud of her secret matronhood to understand or resent the wit  little did he know that this was the balletlike interlude in a great and terrible tragedy whose first act was being played out on the stage where they schemed and sported like their own little drama which was all the world to them and noting to the others berenger knew indeed that the admiral was greatly rejoiced that the nid de merle estates should go into protestant hands and that the old gentleman lost no opportunity of impressing on him that they were a heavy trust to be used for the benefit of the religion and for the support of the king in his better mind but it may be feared that he did not give a very attentive ear to all this he did not like to think of those estates he would gladly have left them all the narcisse so that he might have their lady and though quite willing to win his spurs under charles and coligny against the spaniard his heart and head were far too full to take in the web of politics sooth to say the elopement in prospect seemed to him infinitely more important than pope or spaniard guise or huguenot and coligny observed with a sigh to teligny that he was a good boy but nothing but the merest boy with eyes open only to himself  when charles undertook to rehearse their escape with them and the queen drove out in a little highwheeled litter with mne la comtesse while mme de sauve and eustacie were mounted on gay palfreys with the pommelled sidesaddle lately invented by the queenmother berenger as he watched the fearless horsemanship and graceful bearing of his newlywon wife had no speculations to spend on the thoughtful face of the admiral and when at the outskirts of the wood the kings bewildering huntinghornsounding as it were now here now there now low now highcalled every attendant to hasten to its summons leaving the young squire and damsel errant with a long winding highbanked lane before them they reckoned the dispersion to be all for their sakes and did not note as did sidneys clear eye that when the entire company had come straggling him it was the king who came up with mme de sauve almost the last and a short space after as if not to appear to have been with him appeared the admiral and his soninlaw  sidney also missed one of the admirals most trusted attendants and from this and other symptoms he formed his conclusions that the king had scattered his followers as much for the sake of an unobserved conference with coligny as for the convenience of the lovers and that letters had been dispatched in consequence of that meeting  those letters were indeed of a kind to change the face of affairs in france marshal strozzi then commanding in the southwest was bidden to embark at la rochelle in the last week of august to hasten to the succour of the prince of orange against spain and letters were dispatched by coligny to all the huguenot partisans bidding them assemble at melun on the third of september when they would be in the immediate neighbourhood of the court which was bound for fontainebleau was the star of the guises indeed waning was charles about to escape from their hands and commit himself to an honest highminded policy in which he might have been able to purify his national church and wind back to her those whom her corruptions had driven to seek truth and morality beyond her pale  alas there was a bright pair of eyes that saw more than philip sidneys a pair of ears that heard more a tongue and pen less faithful to guard a secret     chapter viii le brouilon         but never more the same two sister pearls      ran down the silken thread to kiss each other                         tennyson   berenger was obliged to crave permission from the king to spend some hours in riding with osbert to the first hostel on their way to make arrangements for the relay of horses that was to meet them there and for the reception of veronique eustacies maid who was to be sent off very early in the morning on a pillion behind osbert taking with her the articles of dress that would be wanted to change her mistress from the huntress maid of honour to the english dame  it was not long after he had been gone that a sound of wheels and trampling horses was heard in one of the forest drives charles who was amusing himself with shooting at a mark together with sidney and teligny handed his weapon to an attendant and came up with looks of restless anxiety to his queen who was placed in her chair under the tree with the admiral and her ladies round her as judges of the prize  here is le brouillon he muttered i thought we had been left in peace too long  elisabeth who brantome says was water while her husband was fire tried to murmur some hopeful suggestion and poor little eustacie clasping her hands could scarcely refrain from uttering the cry oh it is my uncle do not let him take me  the next minute there appeared four horses greatly heated and jaded drawing one of the court coaches and as it stopped at the castle gate two ladies became visible within itthe portly form of queen catherine and on the back seat the graceful figure of diane de ribaumont  charles swore a great oath under his breath he made a step forward but then his glance falling on eustacies face which had flushed to the rosiest hue of the carnation he put his finger upon his lip with a menacing air and then advanced to greet his mother followed by his gentlemen  fear not my dear child said the young queen taking eustacies arm as she rose for the same purpose obey the king and he will take care that all goes well  the gentle elisabeth was however the least regarded member of the royal family her motherinlaw had not even waited to greet her but had hurried the king into his cabinet with a precipitation that made the young queens tender heart conclude that some dreadful disaster had occurred and before mademoiselle de ribaumont had had time to make her reverence she exclaimed breathlessly oh is it ill news not from vienna  no no madame reassure yourself replied diane it is merely that her majesty being on the way to monceaux with mesdames turned out of her road to make a flying visit to your graces and endeavour to persuade you to make her party complete  elisabeth looked as if questioning with herself if this would possibly be the whole explanation monceaux was a castle belonging to the queen dowager at no great distance from montpipeau but there had been no intention of leaving paris before the wedding which was fixed for the seventeenth of august and the bridegroom was daily expected she asked who was the party at monceaux and was told that madame de nemours had gone thither the evening before with her son m de guise to make ready and that monsieur was escorting thither his two sisters madame de lorraine and madame marguerite the queenmother had set out before them very early in the morning  you must have made great speed said elisabeth it is scarcely two oclock  truly we did madame two of our horses even died upon the road but the queen was anxious to find the king ere he should set off on one of his long chases  diane at every spare moment kept her eyes interrogatively fixed on her cousin and evidently expected that the taciturn queen to whom a long conversation in any language but spanish was always a grievance would soon dismiss them both and eustacie did not know whether to be thankful or impatient as elisabeth with tardy hesitating mentallytranslated speech inquired into every circumstance of the death of the poor horses and then into all the court gossip which she was currently supposed neither to hear nor understand and then bethought herself that this good mademoiselle de ribaumont could teach her that embroidery stitch she had so long wished to learn taking her arm she entered the hall and produced her work so as effectually to prevent any communication between the cousins eustacie meanwhile her heart clinging to her friend felt her eyes filling with tears at the thoughts of how unkind her morrows flight would seem without one word of farewell or of confidence and was already devising tokens of tenderness to be left behind for dianes consolation when the door of the cabinet opened and catherine sailed down the stairs with her peculiar gliding step and sweep of dignity the king followed her with a face of irresolution and distress he was evidently under her displeasure but she advanced to the young queen with much graciousness and an air of matronly solicitude  my daughter she said i have just assured the king that i cannot leave you in these damp forests i could not be responsible for the results of the exposure any longer it is for him to make his own arrangements but i brought my coach empty on purpose to transport you and your ladies to monceaux  the women may follow with the mails you can be ready as soon as the horses are harnessed  elisabeth was used to passiveness she turned one inquiring look to her husband but he looked sullen and evidently cowed by his mother uttered not a word she could only submit and catherine herself add that there was room for madame de sauve and mademoiselle de nid de merle madame la comtesse should follow it was selfevident that propriety would not admit of the only demoiselle being left behind among the gentlemen poor eustacie she looked mutely round as if she hoped to escape what was the other unkindness to this and ever under the eyes of diane too who followed her to their chamber when she went to prepare so that she could not even leave a token for him where he would have been most certain to find it moments were few but at the very last while the queens were being handed in the carriage she caught the eye of philip sidney he saw the appealing look and came near she tried to laugh here is my gage monsieur sidney she said and held out a rosecoloured knot of ribbon then as he came near enough she whispered imploringly three of her few english words  give to him  i take the gage as it is meant said sidney putting a knee to the ground and kissing the trembling fingers ere he handed her into the carriage he smiled and waved his hand as he met her earnest eyes one bow contained a scrap of paper pricked with needleholes sidney would not have made out those pricks for the whole world even had he been able to do more than hastily secure the token before the unhappy king with a paroxysm of violent interjections demanded of him whether the queen of england woman though she were ever were so beset and never allowed a moment to herself then without giving time for an answer he flung away to his cabinet and might be heard pacing up and down there in a tempest of perplexity he came forth only to order his horse and desire m de sauve and a few grooms to be ready instantly to ride with him his face was full of pitiable perplexitythe smallest obstacle was met with a savage oath and he was evidently in all the misery of a weak yet passionate nature struggling with impotent violence against a yoke that evidently mastered it  he flung a word to his guests that he should return ere night and they thus perceived that he did not intend their dismissal  poor youth said coligny mildly he will be another being when we have him in our camp with the king of navarre for his companion  and then the admiral repaired to his chamber to write one of his many fond letters to the young wife of his old age while his soninlaw and philip sidney agreed to ride on so as to met poor young ribaumont and prepare him for the blow that had befallen him personally while they anxiously debated what this sudden descent of the queenmother might portend teligny was ready to believe in any evil intention on her part but he thought himself certain of the kings real sentiments and in truth charles had never treated any man with such confidence as this young huguenot noble to whom he had told his opinion of each of his counsellors and his complete distrust of all that pitying affection which clings to those who cling to it as well as a true french loyalty of heart made teligny fully believe that however catherine might struggle to regain her ascendancy and whatever apparent relapses might be caused by charless habitual subjection to her yet the high aspirations and strong sense of justice inherent in the king were asserting themselves as his youth was passing into manhood and that the muchdesired war would enable him to develop all his higher qualities sidney listened partially agreed talked of caution and mused within himself whether violence might not sometimes be mistaken for vigour  ere long the merry cadence of an old english song fell with a homelike sound upon sidneys ear and in another moment they were in sight of berenger trotting joyously along with a bouquet of crimson and white heatherblossoms in his hand and his bright young face full of exultation in his arrangements he shouted gaily as he saw them calling out i thought i should meet you but i wondered not to have heard the kings buglehorn where are the rest of the hunters  unfortunately we have had another sort of hunt today said sidney who had ridden forward to meet him and one that i fear will disquiet you greatly  how not her uncle exclaimed berenger  no cheer up my friend it was not she who was the object of the chase it was this unlucky king he added speaking english who has been run to earth by his mother  nay but what is that to me said berenger with impatient superiority to the affairs of the nation how does it touch us  sidney related the abstraction of the young queen and her ladies and then handed over the rosecoloured token which berenger took with vehement ardour then his features quivered as he read the needlepricked wordstwo that he had playfully insisted on her speaking and spelling after him in his adopted tongue then not vulgarized but the tenderest in the language sweet heart that was all but to him they conveyed constancy to him and his whatever might betide and an entreaty not to leave her to her fate  my dearest never he muttered then turning hastily as he put the precious token into his bosom he exclaimed are their women yet gone and being assured that they were not departed when the two friends had set out he pushed his horse on at speed so as to be able to send a reply by veronique he was barely in time the clumsy wagonlike conveyance of the waitingwomen stood at the door of the castle in course of being packed with the queens wardrobe amid the janglings of lackeys and expostulating cries of femmes de chambre all in the worst possible humour at being crowded up with their natural enemies the household of the queenmother  veronique a roundfaced angevin girlwho like her lady had not parted with all her rustic simplicity and honesty and who had been necessarily taken into their confidencewas standing apart from the whirl of confusion holding the leashes of two or three little dogs that had been confided to her care that their keepers might with more ease throw themselves into the melee her face lighted up as she saw the baron de ribaumont arrive  ah sir madame will be so happy that i have seen monsieur once more she exclaimed under her breath as he approached her  alas there is not a moment to write he said looking at the vehicle already fast filling but give her these flowers they were gathered for her give her ten thousand thanks for her token tell her to hold firm and that neither king nor queen bolt nor bar shall keep me from her tell her our watchword is hope  the sharp eyes of the duenna of the queens household a rigid spanish dame were already searching for stray members of her flock and veronique had to hurry to her place while berenger remained to hatch new plans each wilder than the last and torment himself with guesses whether his project had been discovered indeed there were moments when he fancied the frustration of his purpose the special object of queen catherines journey but he had the wisdom to keep any such suggestion to himself  the king came back by suppertime looking no longer in a state of indecision but pale and morose he spoke to no one as he entered and afterwards took his place at the head of the suppertable in silence which he did not break till the meal was nearly over then he said abruptly gentlemen our party has been broken up and i imagine that after our great hunt tomorrow no one will have any objection to return to paris we shall have merrier sport at fontainebleau when this most troublesome of weddings is over  there was nothing to be done but to bow acquiescence and the king again became grimly silent after supper he challenged coligny to a game of chess and not a word passed during the protracted contest either from the combatants or any other person in the hall it was as if the light had suddenly gone out to others besides the disappointed and anxious berenger and a dull shadow had fallen on the place only yesterday so lively joyous and hopeful  berenger chained by the etiquette of the royal presence sat like a statue his back against the wall his arms crossed on his breast his eyes fixed chewing the cud of the memories of his dream of bliss or striving to frame the future to his will and to decide what was the next reasonable step he could take or whether his irrepressible longing to ride straight off to monceaux claim his wife and take her on horseback behind him were a mere impracticable vision  the king having been checkmated twice out of three times by the admiral too honest a man not truly to accept his declaration of not wanting courtly play pushed away the board and was attended by them all to his coucher which was usually made in public and the queen being absent the gentlemen were required to stand around him till he was ready to fall asleep he did not seem disposed to talk but begged sidney to fetch his lute and sing to him some english airs that had taken his fancy much when sung by sidney and berenger together  berenger felt as if they would choke him in his present turbid state of resentful uncertainty but even as the unhappy young king spoke it was with a heavy restless groan as he added if you know any lullaby that will give rest to a wretch tormented beyond bearing let us have it  alas sire said the admiral seeing that no perilous ears remained in the room there are better and more soothing words than any mundane melody  peste my good father said the king petulantly has not old phlipote my nurse rocked me to the sound of your marots psalms and crooned her texts over me i tell you i do not want to think i want what will drive thought awayto dull  alas what dulls slays said the admiral  let it nothing can be worse than the present said the wretched charles then as if wishing to break away from coligny he threw himself round towards berenger and said here stoop down ribaumont a word with you your matters have gone up the mountains as the italians say with mine but never fear keep silence and you shall have the bird in your hand only you must be patient hold i will make you and monsieur sidney gentlemen of my bedchamber which will give you the entree of the louvre and if you cannot get her out of it without an eclat then you must be a much duller fellow than half my court only that it is not their own wives that they abstract  with this berenger must needs content himself and the certainty of the poor kings goodwill did enable him to do his part with sidney in the songs that endeavoured to soothe the torments of the evil spirit which had on that day effected a fresh lodgment in that weak unwilling heart  it was not till the memoirs of the secret actors in this tragedy were brought to light that the key to these doings was discovered m de sauve charless secretary had disclosed his proceedings to his wife she flattered by the attentions of the duke of anjou betrayed them to him and the queenmother terrified at the change of policy and the loss of the power she had enjoyed for so many years had hurried to the spot  her influence over her son resembled the fascination of a snake once within her reach he was unable to resist her and when in their teteatete she reproached him with illfaith towards her prophesied the overthrow of the church the desertion of his allies the ruin of his throne and finally announced her intention of hiding her head in her own hereditary estates in auvergne begging as a last favour that he would give his brother time to quit france instead of involving him in his own ruin the poor young mans whole soul was in commotion his mother knew her strength left the poison to work and withdrew in displeasure to monceaux sure that as in effect happened he would not be long in following her imploring her not to abandon him and making an unconditional surrender of himself his conscience and his friends into her hands duplicity was so entirely the element of the court that even while thus yielding himself it was as one checked but continuing the game he still continued his connection with the huguenots hoping to succeed in his aims by some future counterintrigue and his real hatred of the court policy and the genuine desire to make common cause with them served his mothers purpose completely since his cajolery thus became sincere her purpose was probably not yet formed it was power that she loved and hoped to secure by the intrigues she had played off all her life but she herself was in the hands of an infinitely more bloodthirsty and zealous faction who could easily accomplish their ends by working on the womanly terrors of an unscrupulous mind     chapter ix the wedding with crimson favours         and trust me not at all or all in all                        tennyson   so extensive was the louvre so widely separated the different suites of apartments that diane and eustacie had not met after the pallmall party till they sat opposite to their several queens in the coach driving through the woods the elder cousin curiously watching the eyes of the younger so wistfully gazing at the window and now and then rapidly winking as though to force back a rebellious tear  the cousins had been bred up together in the convent at bellaise and had only been separated by dianes having been brought to court two years sooner than eustacie they had always been on very kindly affectionate terms diane treating her little cousin with the patronage of an elder sister and greatly contributing to shield her from the temptations of the court the elder cousin was so much the more handsome brilliant and admired that no notion of rivalry had crossed her mind and eustacies inheritance was regarded by her as reserved for her brother and the means of aggradizement an prosperity for herself and her father she looked upon the child as a sort of piece of property of the family to be guarded and watched over for her brother and when she had first discovered the error that the young baron was making between the two daughters of the house it was partly in kindness to eustacie partly to carry out her fathers plans and partly from her own pleasure in conversing with anything so candid and fresh as berenger that she had maintained the delusion her father believed himself to have placed berenger so entirely in the background that he would hardly be at court long enough to discover the imposition and diane was not devoid of a strong hope of winning his affection and bending his will so as to induce him to become her husband and become a french courtier for her sakea wild dream but a better castle in the air than she had ever yet indulged in  this arrangement was however disconcerted by the kings passion for sidneys society which brought young ribaumont also to court and at the time of the mischievous introduction by madame marguerite diane had perceived that the mistake would soon be found out and that she should no longer be able to amuse herself with the freshcoloured openfaced boy who was unlike all her former acquaintance but the magnetism that shows a woman when she produces an effect had been experienced by her and she had been sure that a few efforts more would warm and mould the wax in her fingers that he should prefer a little brown thing whose beauty was so inferior to her own had never crossed her mind she did not even know that he was invited to the pallmall party and was greatly taken by surprise when her father sought an interview with her accused her of betraying their interests and told her that this foolish young fellow declared that he had been mistaken and having now discovered his veritable wife protested against resigning her  by that time the whole party were gone to montpipeau but that the baron was among them was not known at the louvre until queen catherine who had always treated diane as rather a favoured quickwitted protegee commanded her attendance and on her way let her know that madame de sauve had reported that among all the follies that were being perpetrated at the huntingseat the young queen was absolutely throwing the little niddemerle into the arms of her huguenot husband and that if measures were not promptly taken all the great estates in the bocage would be lost to the young chevalier and be carried over to the huguenot interest  still diane could not believe that it was so much a matter of love as that the young had begun to relish court favour and to value the inheritance and she could quite believe her little cousin had been flattered by a few attentions that had no meaning in them she was not prepared to find that eustacie shrank from her and tried to avoid a private interview in truth the poor child had received such injunctions from the queen and so stern a warning look from the king that she durst not utter a syllable of the evening that had sealed her lot and was so happy with her secret so used to tell everything to diane so longing to talk of her husband that she was afraid of betraying herself if once they were alone together yet diane knowing that her father trusted to her to learn how far things had gone and piqued at seeing the transparent little creature now glowing and smiling with inward bliss now pale pensive sighing and anxious and scorning her as too childish for the love that she seemed to affect was resolved on obtaining confidence from her  and when the whole female court had sat down to the silk embroidery in which catherine de medicis excelled diane seated herself in the recess of a window and beckoned her cousin to her side so that it was not possible to disobey  little one she said why have you cast off your poor cousin there sit downfor eustacie stood with her silk in her hand as if meaning instantly to return to her former place and now her cheeks in a flame she answered in an indignant whisper you know diane how could you try to keep him from me  because it was better for thee my child than to be pestered with an adventurer she said smiling though bitterly  my husband returned eustacie proudly  bah you know better than that then as eustacie was about to speak but checked herself diane added yes my poor friend he has a something engaging about him and we all would have hindered you from the pain and embarrassment of a meeting with him  eustacie smiled a little saucy smile as though infinitely superior to them all  pauvre petite said diane nettled she actually believes in his love  i will not hear a word against my husband said eustacie stepping back as if to return to her place but diane rose and laid her hand on hers my dear she said we must no part thus i only wish to know what touches my darling so nearly i thought she loved and clung to us why should she have turned from me for the sake of one who forgot her for half his life what can he have done to master this silly little heart  i cannot tell you diane said eustacie simply and though she looked down the colour on her face was more of a happy glow than a conscious blush i love him too much only we understand each other now and it is of no use to try to separate us  ah poor little thing so she thinks said diane and as eustacie again smiled as one incapable of being shaken in her conviction she added and how do you know that he loves you  diane was startled by the bright eyes that flashed on her and the bright colour that made eustacie perfectly beautiful as she answered because i am his wife that is enough then before her cousin could speak again but diane i promised not to speak of it i know he would despise me if i broke my word so i will not talk to you till i have leave to tell you all and i am going back to help gabrielle de limeuil with her shepherdess  mademoiselle de ribaumont felt her attempt most unsatisfactory but she knew of old that eustacie was very determinedall bellaise know that to oppose the tiny baronne was to make her headstrong in her resolution and if she suspected that she was coaxed she only became more obstinate to make any discoveries diane must take the line of most cautious caresses such as to throw her cousin off her guard and this she was forced to confess to her father when he sought an interview with her on the day of her return to paris he shook his head she must be on the watch he said and get quickly into the silly girls confidence what had she not found out that the young villain had been on the point of eloping with her if such a thing as that should succeed the whole family was lost and she was the only person who could prevent it he trusted to her  the chevalier had evidently come to regard his niece as his sons lawful property and the baron as the troublesome meddler and diane had much the same feeling enhanced by sore jealousy at eustacies triumph over her and curiosity as to whether it could be indeed well founded she had an opportunity of judging the same eveningmere habit always caused eustacie to keep under her wing if she could not be near the queen whenever there was a reception and to that reception of course berenger came armed with his right as gentleman of the bedchamber eustacie was colouring and fluttering as if by the instinct of his presence even before the tall fair head became visible moving forward as well as the crowd would permit and seeking about with anxious eyes the glances of the blue and the black eyes met at last and a satisfied radiance illuminated each young face then the young man steered his way through the throng but was caught midway by coligny and led up to be presented to a hooknosed darkhaired livelylooking young man in a suit of black richly laced with silver it was the king of navarre the royal bridegroom who had entered paris in state that afternoon eustacie tried to be proud of the preferment but oh she thought it mistimed and was gratified to mark certain wandering of the eye even while the gracious king was speaking then the admiral said something that brought the girlish rosy flush up to the very roots of the short curls of flaxen hair and made the young kings white teeth flash out in a mirthful goodnatured laugh and thereupon the way opened and berenger was beside the two ladies kissing eustacies hand but merely bowing to diane  she was ready to take the initiative  my cousins deem me unpardonable she said yet i am going to purchase their pardon see this cabinet of porcelain a le reine and italian vases and gems behind this curtain there is all the siege of troy which m le baron will not doubt explain to mademoiselle while i shall sit on this cushion and endure the siege of st quentin from the bon sieur de selinville  monsieur de selinville was the court bore who had been in every battle from pavia to montcontour and gave as full memoirs of each as did blaise de monluc only viva voce instead of in writing diane was rather a favourite of his she knew her way through all his adventures so soon as she had heard the description of the king of navarres entry into paris that afternoon and the old gentlemans lamentation that his own two nephews were among the three hundred huguenot gentleman who had formed the escort she had only to observe whether his reminiscences had gone to italy or to flanders in order to be able to put in the appropriate remarks at each pause while she listened all the while to the murmurs behind the curtain yet it was not easy with all her court breeding to appear indifferent and solely absorbed in hearing of the bad lodgings that had fallen to the share of the royal troops at brescia when such sounds were reaching her it was not so much the actual words she heard though these were the phrasesmon ange my heart my love those were common and diane had lived in the queenmothers squadron long enough to despise those who uttered them only less than those who believed them it was the full depth of tenderness and earnestness in the subdued tones of the voice that gave her a sense of quiet force and reality beyond all she had ever known she had heard and overheard men pour out frantic ravings of passion but never had listened to anything like the sweet protecting tenderness of voice that seemed to embrace and shelter its object diane had no doubts now he had never so spoken to her nay perhaps he had had no such cadences in his voice before it was quite certain that eustacie was everything to him she herself nothing she who might have had any gallant in the court at her feet but had never seen one whom she could believe in whose sense of esteem had been first awakened by this stranger lad who despised her surely he was loving this foolish child simply as his duty his belonging as his right he might struggle hard for her and if he gained her be greatly disappointed for how could eustacie appreciate him little emptyheaded silly thing who would be amused and satisfied by any court flatterer  however diane held out and played her part caught scraps of the conversation and pieced them together yet avoided all appearance of inattention to m de selinville and finally dismissed him and manoeuvred first eustacie and after a safe interval berenger out of the cabinet the latter bowed as he bade her good night and said with the most open and cordial of smiles cousin i thank you with all my heart  the bright look seemed to her another shaft what happiness said she to herself can i overthrow it bah it will crumble of its own accord even if i did nothing and my father and brother  communication with her father and brother was not always easy to diane for she lived among the queenmothers ladies her brother was quartered in a sort of barrack among the gentlemen of monsieurs suite and the old chevalier was living in the room berenger had taken for him at the croix de lorraine and it was only on the most public days that they attended at the palace such a day however there was on the ensuing sunday when henry of navarre and marguerite of france were to be wedded their dispensation was come but to the great relief of eustacie there was no answer with it to the application for the cassation of her marriage in fact this dispensation had never emanated from the pope at all rome would not sanction the union of a daughter of france with a huguenot prince and charles had forged the document probably with his mothers knowledge in the hope of spreading her toils more completely round her prey while he trusted that the victims might prove too strong for her and destroy her web and in breaking forth might release himself  strange was the pageant of that wedding on sunday the 17th of august 1572 the outward seeming was magnificent when all that was princely in france stood on the splendidly decked platform in front of notredame around the bridegroom in the bright promise of his kingly endowments and the bride in her peerless beauty brave noblehearted and devoted were the gallant following of the one splendid and highly gifted the attendants of the other and their union seemed to promise peace to a long distracted kingdom  yet what an abyss lay beneath those trappings the bridegroom and his comrades were as lions in the toils of the hunter and the lure that had enticed them thither was the bride herself so unwilling a victim that her lips refused to utter the espousal vows and her head as force forward by her brother into a sign of consent while the favoured lover of her whole lifetime agreed to the sacrifice in order to purchase the vengeance for which he thirsted and her mother the corrupter of her own children looked complacently on at her readydug pit of treachery and bloodshed  among the many who played unconscious on the surface of that gulf of destruction were the young creatures whose chief thought in the pageant was the glance and smile from the gallery of the queens ladies to the long procession of the english ambassadors train as they tried to remember their own marriage there berenger with clear recollection of his fathers grave anxious face and eustacie chiefly remembering her own white satin and turquoise dress which indeed she had seen on every great festivalday as the best raiment of the image of notre dame de bellaise she remained in the choir during mass but berenger accompanied the rest of the protestants with the bridegroom at their head into the nave where coligny beguiled the time with walking about looking at the banners that had been taken from himself and conde at montcontour and jarnac saying that he hoped soon to see them taken down and replaced by spanish banners berenger had followed because he felt the need of doing as walsingham and sidney thought right but he had not been in london long enough to become hardened to the desecration of churches by frequenting pauls walk he remained bareheaded and stood as near as he could to the choir listening to the notes that floated from the priests and acolytes at the high altar longing from the time when he and eustacie should be one in their prayers and lost in a reverie till a grave old nobleman passing near him reproved him for dallying with the worship of rimmon but his listening attitude had not passed unobserved by others besides huguenot observers  the wedding was followed by a ball at the louvre from which however all the stricter huguenots absented themselves out of respect to sunday and among them the family and guests of the english ambassador who were in the meantime attending the divine service that had been postponed on account of the mornings ceremony neither was the duke of guise present at the entertainment for though he had some months previously been piqued and entrapped into a marriage with catherine of cleves yet his passion for marguerite was still so strong that he could not bear to join in the festivities of her wedding with another the absence of so many distinguished persons caused the admission of many less constantly privileged and thus it was that diane there met both her father and brother who eagerly drew her into a window and demanded what she had to tell them laughing too at the simplicity of the youth who had left for the chevalier a formal announcement that he had dispatched his protest to rome and considered himself as free to obtain his wife by any means in his power  where is la petite narcisse demanded behind her queen as usual  the young queen keeps her room tonight returned diane nor do i advise you brother to thrust yourself in the way of la petite entetee just at present  what is she so besotted with the peach face he shall pay for it  brother no duel father remind him that she would never forgive him  fear not daughter said the chevalier this folly can be ended by much quieter modes only you must first give us information  she tells me nothing said diane she is in one of her own humourshigh and mighty  peste where is your vaunt of winding the little one round your finger  with time i said replied diane curiously enough she had no compunction in worming secrets from eustacie and betraying them but she could not bear to think of the trap she had set for the unsuspecting youth and how ingenuously he had thanked her little knowing how she had listened to his inmost secrets  time is everything said her father delay will be our ruin your inheritance will slip through your fingers my son the youth will soon win favour by abjuring his heresy he will play the same game with the king as his father did with king henri you will have nothing but your sword and for you my poor girl there is nothing but to throw yourself on the kindness of your aunt at bellaise if she can receive the vows of a dowerless maiden  it will never be said narcisse my rapier will soon dispose of a big rustic like that who knows just enough of fencing to make him an easy prey what i verily believe the great of entreaty and yet the fine fellow was willing enough to break the marriage when he took her for the bride  nay my son argued the chevalier will apparently to spare his daughter from the sting of mortification as i said all can be done without danger of bloodshed on either side were we but aware of any renewed project of elopement the pretty pair would be easily waylaid the girl safely lodged at bellaise the boy sent off to digest his pride in england  unhurt murmured diane  her father checked narcisses mockery at her solicitude as he added unhurt yes he is a liberalhearted gracious fine young man whom i should much grieve to harm but if you know of any plan of elopement and conceal it my daughter then upon you will lie either the ruin and disgrace of your family or the death of one or both of the youths  diane saw that her question had betrayed her knowledge she spoke faintly something i did overhear but i know not how to utter a treason  there is no treason where there is no trust daughter said the chevalier in the tone of a moral sage speak  diane never disobeyed her father and faltered wednesday it is for wednesday they mean to leave the palace in the midst of the masque there is a marketboat from leurre to meet them on the river his servants will be in it  on wednesday father and son looked at each other  that shall be remedied said narcisse  child added her father turning kindly to diane you have saved our fortunes there is put one thing more that you must do make her obtain the pearls from him  ah sighed diane half shocked half revengeful as she thought how he had withheld them from her  it is necessary said the chevalier the heirloom of our house must not be risked secure the pearls child and you will have done good service and earned the marriage that shall reward you  when he was gone diane pressed her hands together with a strange sense of misery he who had shrunk from the memory of little dianes untruthfulness what would he think of the present dianes treachery yet it was to save his life and that of her brotherand for the assertion of her victory over the little robber eustacie     chapter x monsieurs ballet        the styx had fast bound her     nine times around her          pope ode on stcecilias day   early on monday morning came a message to mademoiselle nid de merle that she was to prepare to act the part of a nymph of paradise in the kings masque on wednesday night and must dress at once to rehearse her part in the ballet specially designed by monsieur  her first impulse was to hurry to her own queen whom she entreated to find some mode of exempting her but elisabeth who was still in bed looked distressed and frightened made signs of caution and when the weeping girl was on the point of telling her of the project that would thus be ruined silenced her by saying hush my poor child i have but meddled too much already our lady grant that i have not done you more harm than good tell me no more  ah madame i will be discreet i will tell you nothing but if you would only interfere to spare me from this ballet it is monsieurs contrivance ah madame could you but speak to the king  impossible child said the queen things are not her as they were at happy montpipeau  and the poor young queen turned her face in to her pillow and wept  every one who was not in a dream of bliss like poor little eustacie knew that the king had been in so savage a mood ever since his return that no one durst ask anything from him a little while since he had laughed at his gentle wife for letting herself and emperors daughter be trampled on where his brother franciss queen from her trumpery beggarly realm had held up her head and put down la belle mere he had amused himself with elisabeths pretty little patronage of the young ribaumonts as a promising commencement in intriguing like other people but now he was absolutely violent at any endeavour to make him withstand his mother and had driven his wife back into that cold listless indifferent shell of apathy from which affection and hope had begun to rouse her she knew it would only make it the worse for her little nid de merle for her to interpose when monsieur had made the choice  and eustacie was more afraid of monsieur than even of narcisse and her berenger could not be there to protect her however there was protection in numbers with twelve nymphs and cavaliers to match even the duke of anjou could not accomplish the being very insulting eustacielight agile and fairylikegained considerable credit for ready comprehension and graceful evolutions she had never been so much complimented before and was much cheered by praise diane showed herself highly pleased with her little cousins success embraced her and told her she was finding her true level at court she would be the prettiest of all the nymphs who were all small since fairies rather than amazons were wanted in their position and eustacie she added you should wear the pearls  the pearls said eustacie ah but he always wears them i like to see them on his bonnetthey are hardly whiter than his forehead  foolish little thing said diane i shall think little of his love if he cares to see himself in them more than you  the shaft seemed carelessly shot but diane knew that it would work and so it did eustacie wanted to prove her husbands love not to herself but to her cousin  he made his way to her in the gardens of the louvre that evening greatly dismayed at the report that had reached him that she was to figure as a nymph of elysium she would thus be in sight as a prominent figure the whole evening even till an hour so late that the market boat which osbert had arranged for their escape could not wait for them without exciting suspicion and besides his delicate english feelings were revolted at the notion of her forming a part of such a spectacle she could not understand his displeasure if they could not go on wednesday they could go on saturday and as to her acting half the noblest ladies in the court would be in piece and if english husbands did not like it they must be the tyrants she had always heard of  to be a gazingstock began berenger  hush monsieur i will hear no more or i shall take care how i put myself in your power  that has been done for you sweetheart he said smiling with perhaps a shade too much superiority you are mine entirely now  that is not kind she pouted almost cryingfor between flattery excitement and disappointment she was not like herself that day and she was too proud to like to be reminded that she was in any ones power  i thought said berenger with the gentleness that always made him manly in dealing with her i thought you like to own yourself mine  yes sir when you are good and do not try to hector me for what i cannot avoid  berenger was candid enough to recollect that royal commands did not brook disobedience and being thoroughly enamoured besides of his little wife he hastened to make his peace by saying true ma mie this cannot be helped i was a wretch to find fault think of it no more  you forgive me she said softened instantly  forgive you what for pretty one for my forgetting that you are still a slave to a hateful court  ah then if you forgive me let me wear the pearls  the poor pearls said berenger taken aback for a moment the meed of our forefathers valour to form part of the pageant and mummery but never mind sweetheart for he could not bear to vex her again you shall have them tonight only take care of them my mother would look back on me if she knew i had let them out of my care but you and i are one after all  berenger could not bear to leave his wife near the duke of anjou and narcisse and he offered himself to the king as an actor in the masque much as he detested all he heard of its subject the king nodded comprehension and told him it was open to him either to be a demon in a tight suit of black cloth with clovenhoof shoes a long tail and a trident or one of the huguenots who were to be repulsed from paradise for the edification of the spectators as these last were to wear suits of knightly armour berenger much preferred making one of them in spite of their doom  the masque was given at the hall of the hotel de bourbon where a noble gallery accommodated the audience and left full space beneath for the actors down the centre of the stage flowed a stream broad enough to contain a boat which was plied by the abbe de mericourtransformed by a gray beard and hair and dismal mask into charon  but so unused to navigation was he so crazy and illtrimmed his craft that his first performance would have been his submersion in the styx had not berenger better accustomed to boats than any of the dramatis personoe caught him by the arms as he was about to step in pointed out the perils weighted the frail vessel and given him a lesson in paddling it to and fro with such a masterly hand that had there been time for a change of dress the part of charon would have been unanimously transferred to him but the delay could not be suffered and poor mericour in fear of a ducking or worse of ridicule balanced himself pole in hand in the midst of the river to the right of the river was elysiuma circular island revolving on a wheel which was an absolute orrery representing in concentric circles the skies with the sun moon the seven planets twelve signs and the fixed stars all illuminated with small lamps the island itself was covered with verdure in which among bowers woven of gay flowers reposed twelve nymphs of paradise of whom eustacie was one  on the other side of the stream was another wheel whose grisly emblems were reminders of dantes infernal circles and were lighted by lurid flames while little bells were hung round so as to make a harsh jangling sound and all of the court who had any turn for buffoonery were leaping and dancing about as demons beneath it and uttering wild shouts  king charles and his two brothers stood on the margin of the elysian lake king henry the prince of conde and a selection of the younger and gayer huguenots were the assailantsstorming paradise to gain possession of the nymphs it was a very illusive armour that they wore thin scales of gold or silver as cuirasses over their satin doublets and the swords and lances of festive combat in that court had been of the bluntest foil ever since the father of these princes had died beneath montgomerys spear and when the king and his brothers one of them a puny crooked boy were the champions the battle must needs be the merest show though there were lookerson who thought that judging by appearances the assailants ought to have the best chance of victory both literal and allegorical  however these three guardian angels had choice allies in the shape of the infernal company who as fast as the huguenots crossed swords or shivered lances with their royal opponents encircled them with their long black arms and dragged them struggling away to tartarus henry of navarre yielded himself with a goodwill to the horseplay with which this was performed resisting just enough to give his demoniacal captors a good deal of trouble while yielding all the time and taking them by surprise by agile efforts that showed that if he were excluded from paradise it was only by his own consent and that he heartily enjoyed the merriment most of his comrades in especial the young count de rochefoucauld entered into the sport with the same heartiness but the prince of conde submitted to his fate with a gloomy disgusted countenance that added much to the general mirth and berenger with eustacie before his eyes looking pale distressed and ill at ease was a great deal too much in earnest he had so veritable an impulse to leap forward and snatch her from that giddy revolving prison that he struck against the sword of monsieur with a hearty goodwill his silvered lath snapped in his hand and at that moment he was seized round the waist and when his furious struggle was felt to be in earnest he was pulled over on his back while yells and shouts of discordant laughter rang round him as demons pinioned him hand and foot  he thought he heard a faint cry from eustacie and with a sudden unexpected struggle started into a sitting posture but a derisive voice that well he knew cried ha the deadly sin of pride monsieur thinks his painted face pleases the ladies to the depths with him and therewith one imp pulled him backwards again while others danced a wardance round him pointing their forks at him and the prime tormentor whom he perfectly recognized not only leapt over him but spurned at his face with a cloven foot giving a blow not of gay french malice but of malignity it was too much for the boys forbearance he struggled free dashing his adversaries aside fiercely and as they again gathered about him with the leader shouting rage too rage to the prey imps he clenched his fist and dealt the foremost foe such a blow in the chest as to level him at once with the ground  monsieur forgets said a voice friendly yet reproachful that this is but sport  it was henry of navarre himself who spoke and bent to give a hand to the fallen imp a flush of shame rushed over berengers face already red with passion he felt that he had done wrong to use his strength at such a moment and that though there had been spite in is assailant he had not been therefore justified he was glad to see narcisse rise lightly to his feet evidently unhurt and with the frankness with which he had often made it up with philip thistlewood or his other english comrades after a sharp tussle he held out his hand saying good demon your pardon you roused my spirit and i forgot myself  demons forget not was the reply at him imps and a whole circle of hobgoblins closed upon with their tridents forks and other horrible implements to drive him back within two tall barred gates which illuminated by red flames were to form the ghastly prison of the vanquished perhaps fresh indignities would have been attempted had not the king of navarre thrown himself on his side shared with him the brunt of all the grotesque weapons and battled them off with infinite spirit and address shielding him as it were from their rude insults by his own dexterity and inviolability though retreating all the time till the infernal gates were closed on both  then henry of navarre who never forgot a face held out his hand saying tartarus is no region of good omen for friendships m de ribaumont but for lack of yonder devils claw here is mine i like to meet a comrade who can strike a hearty blow and ask a hearty pardon  i was too hot sire confessed berenger with one of his ingenuous blushes but he enraged me  he means mischief said henry remember if you are molested respecting this matter that you have here a witness that you did the part of a gentleman  berenger bowed his thanks and began something about the honour but his eye anxiously followed the circuit on which eustacie was carried and the glance was quickly remarked  how your heart is spinning in that mahometan paradise and that is what put such force into your fists which of the houris is it the little one with the wistful eyes who looked so deadly white and shrieked out when the devilry overturned you eh monsieur you are a happy man  i should be sire and berenger was on the point of confiding the situation of his affairs to this most engaging of princes when a fresh supply of prisoners chased with wild antics and fiendish yells by the devils came headlong in on them and immediately completing as henry said the galimatias of mythology a pasteboard cloud was propelled on the stage and disclosed the deities mercury and cupid who made a complimentary address to the three princely brothers inciting them to claim the nymphs whom their valour had defended and lead them through the mazes of a choric celestial dance  this dance had been the special device of monsieur and the balletmaster and during the last three days the houris had been almost danced off their legs with rehearsing it morning noon and night but one at least of them was scarcely in a condition for its performance eustacie dizzied at the first minute by the whirl of her elysian merrygoround had immediately after become conscious of that which she had been too childish to estimate merely in prospect the exposure to universal gaze strange staring eyes glaring lights frightful imps seemed to wheel round her in an intolerable delirious succession her only refuge was in closing her eyes but even this could not long be persevered in so necessary a part of the pageant was she and besides she had berenger to look for berenger whom she had foolishly laughed at for knowing how dreadful it would be but of course the endeavour to seek for one object with her eyes made the dizziness even more dreadful and when at length she beheld him dragged down by the demoniacal creatures whose horrors were magnified by her confused senses and the next moment she was twirled out of sight her cry of distracted alarm was irrepressible carried round again and again on a wheel that to her was far more like ixions than that of the spheres she never cleared her perceptions as to where he was and only was halfmaddened by the fantastic whirl of incongruous imagery while she barely sat out mercurys lengthy harangue and when her wheel stood still and she was released she could not stand and was indebted to charon and one of her fellownymphs for supporting her to a chair in the back of the scene kind charon hurried to bring her wine the lady revived her with essences and the balletmaster clamoured for his performers  ill or well royal ballets must be danced one long sob one gaze round at the refreshing sight of a room no longer in motion one wistful look at the gates of tartarus and the misery of the throbbing aching head must be disregarded the balletmaster touched the white cheeks with rouge and she stepped forward just in time for monsieur himself was coming angrily forward to learn the cause of the delay  spectators said the windings of that dance were exquisitely graceful it was well that eustacies drilling had been so complete for she moved through it blindly senselessly and when it was over was led back between the two demoiselles de limeuil to the apartment that served as a greenroom drooping and almost fainting they seated her in a chair and consulted round her and her cousin narcisse was among the first to approach but no sooner had she caught sight of his devilish trim than with a little shriek she shut her eyes and flung herself to the other side of the chair  my fair cousin he said opening his black vizard do you not see me i am no demon remember i am your cousin  that makes it no better said eustacie too much disordered and confused to be on her guard and hiding her face with her hands go go i entreat  in fact he had already done this and the ladies added their counsel for indeed the poor child could scarcely hold up her head but she said i should like to stay if i could a little a little longer will they not open those dreadful bars she added presently  they are even now opening them said mdlle de limeuil hark they are going to fight en melle mdlle de nid de merle is better now  oh yes let not detain you  eustacie would have risen but the two sisters had fluttered back impatient to lose nothing of the sports and her cousin in his grim disguise stood full before her no haste cousin he said you are not fit to move  oh then go said eustacie suffering too much not to be petulant you make me worse  and why it was not always thus began narcisse so eager to seize an opportunity as to have little consideration for her condition but she was unable to bear any more and broke out yes it was i always detested you more than ever since you deceived me so cruelly oh do but leave me  you scorn me then you prefer to mewho have loved you so longthat childish newcomer who was ready enough to cast you off  prefer he is my husband it is an insult for any one else to speak to me thus said eustacie drawing herself up and rising to her feet but she was forced to hold by the back of her chair and diane and her father appearing at that moment she tottered towards the former and becoming quite passive under the influence of violent dizziness and headache made no objection to being half led half carried through galleries that connected the hotel de bourbon with the louvre  and thus it was that when berenger had fought out his part in the melle of the prisoners released and had maintained the honours of the rosecoloured token in his helmet he found that his ladylove had been obliged by indisposition to return home and while he stood folding his arms to restrain their strong inclination to take narcisse by the throat and demand whether this were another of his deceptions a train of fireworks suddenly exploded in the middle of the styxa last surprise especially contrived by king charles and so effectual that half the ladies were shrieking and imagining that they and the whole hall had blown up together  a long supper full of revelry succeeded and at length sidney ad ribaumont walked home together in the midst of their armed servants bearing torches all the way home berenger was bitter in vituperation of the hateful pageant and all its details  yea truly replied sidney methought that it betokens disease in the mind of a nation when their festive revelry is thus ghastly rendering the most awful secrets made known by our god in order to warm man from sin into a mere antic laughingstock laughter should be moved by what is fair and laughterworthyeven like such sports as our own midsummer nights dream i have read that the bloody temper of rome fed itself in gladiator shows and verily what we beheld tonight betokens something at once grisly and lightminded in the mood of this country  sidney thought so the more when on the second ensuing morning the admiral de coligny was shot through both hands by an assassin generally known to have been posted by the duke of guise yet often called by the sinister sobriquet of le tueur de roi     chapter xi the kings tragedy         the night is come no fears disturb      the sleep of innocence      they trust in kingly faith and kingly oath      they sleep alas they sleep      go to the palace wouldst thou know      how hideous night can be      eye is not closed in those accursed walls      nor heart is quiet there                        southey bartholomews eve   young gentlemen said sir francis walsingham as he rose from dinner on the saturday are you bound for the palace this evening  i am so please your excellency returned berenger  i would have you both to understand that you must have a care of yourselves said the ambassador the admirals wound has justly caused much alarm and i hear that the protestants are going vapouring about in so noisy and incautious a manner crying out for justice that it is but too likely that the party of the queenmother and the guise will be moved to strong measures  they will never dare lay a finger upon us said sidney  in a terrorstricken fray men are no respecters of persons replied sir francis this house is of course inviolable and whatever the madness of the people we have stout hearts enough here to enforce respect thereto but i cannot answer even for an englishmans life beyond its precincts and you ribaumont whom i cannot even claim as my queens subjecti greatly fear to trust you beyond its bounds  i cannot help it sir nay with the most grateful thanks for all your goodness to me i must pray you not to take either alarm or offence if i return not this night  no more my friend said walsingham quickly let me know nothing of your purposes but take care of yourself i would you were safe at home again though the desire may seem inhospitable the sooner the better with whatever you have to do  is the danger so imminent asked sidney  i know nothing philip all i can tell is that as i have read that dogs and cattle scent an earthquake in the air so man and women seem to breathe a sense of danger in this city and to me the graciousness with which the huguenots have been of late treated wears a strangely suspicious air sudden and secret is the blow like to be and we cannot be too much on our guard therefore remember my young friends both that your danger or death would fall heavily on those ye love and honour at home  so saying he left the two youths unwilling to seek further confidence and berenger held his last consultation with sidney to whom he gave directions for making full explanation to walsingham in his absence and expediting mr adderleys return to england osbert alone was to go to the louvre with him after having seen the five english grooms on board the little decked marketvessel on the seine which was to await the fugitives berenger was to present himself in the palace as in his ordinary court attendance and contriving to elude notice among the throng who were there lodged was to take up his station at the foot of the stairs leading to the apartments of ladies whence eustacie was to descend at about eleven oclock with her maid veronique landry osbert was to join them from the lackeys hall below where he had a friend and the connivance of the porter at the postern opening towards the seine had been secured  sidney wished much to accompany him to the palace if his presence could be any aid or protection but on consideration it was decided that his being at the louvre was likely to attract notice to ribaumonts delaying there the two young men therefore shook hands and parted as youths who trusted that they had begun a lifelong friendship with mutual promises to write to one anotherthe one the adventures of his flight the other the astonishment it would excite and auguries were exchanged of merry meetings in london and of the admiration the lovely little wife would excite at queen elizabeths court  then with an embrace such as english friends then gave they separated at the gate and sidney stood watching as berenger walked free and bold down the street his sword at his side his cloak over one shoulder his feathered cap on one side showing his bright curling hair a sunshiny picture of a victorious bridegroomsuch a picture as sent philip sidneys wits back to arcadia  it was not a day of special state but the palace was greatly crowded the huguenots were in an excited mood inclined to rally round henry of navarre whose royal title made him be looked on as is a manner their monarch though his kingdom had been swallowed by spain and he was no more than a french duke distantly related to royalty in the male line and more nearly through his grandmother and bride the eight hundred gentlemen he had brought with him swarmed about his apartments making their lodging on staircases and in passages and to berenger it seemed as if the kings guards and monsieurs gentlemen must have come in in equal numbers to balance them narcisse was there and berenger kept cautiously amid his huguenot acquaintance resolved not to have a quarrel thrust on him which he could not honourably desert it was late before he could work his way to the young queens receptionroom where he found eustacie she looked almost as white as at the masque but there was a graver less childish expression in her face than he had ever seen before and her eyes glanced confidence when they met his  behind the queens chair a few words could be spoken  ma mie art thou well again canst bear this journey now  quite well now quite ready oh that we may never have masques in england  he smilednever such as this  ah thou knowest best i am glad i am thine already i am so silly thou wouldest never have chosen me but thou wilt teach me and i will strive to be very good and oh let me but give one farewell to diane  it is too hard to deny thee aught tonight sweetheart but judge for thyself think of the perils and decide  before eustacie could answer a rough voice came near the king making noisy sport with the count de rochefoucauld and others he was louder and ruder than berenger had ever yet seen him almost giving the notion of intoxication but neither he nor his brother henry ever tasted wine though both had a strange pleasure in being present at the orgies of their companions the king it was generally said from love of the selfforgetfulness of excitementthe duke of anjou because his cool brain there collected mens secrets to serve afterwards for his spiteful diversion  berenger would willingly have escaped notice but his bright face and sunny hair always made him conspicuous and the king suddenly strode up to him you here sir i thought you would have managed your affairs so as to be gone long ago then before berenger could reply however since here you are come along with me to my bedchamber we are to have a carouse there tonight that will ring through all paris yes and shake rochefoucauld out of his bed at midnight you will be one of us ribaumont i command it  and without waiting for reply he turned away with an arm round rochefoucaulds neck and boisterously addressed another of the company almost as wildly as if he were in the mood that scots call fey  royalty seems determined to frustrate our plans said berenger as soon as the king was out of hearing  but you will not go his comrades drink tilloh two three in the morning we should never get away  no i must risk his displeasure we shall soon be beyond his reach but at least i may make his invitation a reason for remaining in the louvre people are departing soon wilt thou be my own  as soon as the queens coucher is over i have but to change to a traveling dress  at the foot of the winding stair sweetest be brave  i fear nothing with thee to guard me see the queen is rising  elizabeth was in effect rising to make her respectful progress to the rooms of the queenmother to bid her good night and eustacie must follow would diane be there oh that the command to judge between her heart and her caution had not been given cruel kindness  diane was there straight as a poplar cold as marble with fixed eyes eustacie stole up to her and touched her she turned with a start cousin you have been very good to me diane started again as if stung you will love me still whatever you hear  is this meant for farewell said diane grasping her wrist  do not ask me diane i may not  where there is no trust there is no treason said diane dreamily no answer me not little one there will be time for that another day where is he  in the oeildeboeuf between the kings and queens suites of rooms i must go there is the queen going diane one loving word  silly child you shall have plenty another time said diane breaking away follow thy queen now  catherine who sat between her daughters claude and marguerite looked preoccupied and summarily dismissed her daughterinlaw elizabeth whom eustacie was obliged to follow to her own stateroom there all the forms of the coucher were tediously gone through every pin had its own ceremony and even when her majesty was safely deposited under her blue satin coverlet the ladies still stood round till she felt disposed to fall asleep elisabeth was both a sleepy and a considerate person so that this was not so protracted a vigil as was sometimes exacted by the more wakeful princesses but eustacie could not escape from it till it was already almost midnight the period for her tryst  her heart was very full it was not the usual flutter and terror of an eloping girl eustacie was a fearless little being and her conscience had no alarms her affections were wholly with berenger and her transient glimpses of him had been as of something come out of a region higher tenderer stronger purer more trustworthy than that where she had dwelt she was proud of belonging to him she had felt upheld by the consciousness through years of waiting and now he more than realized her hopes and she could have wept for exulting joy yet it was a strange stealthy break with all she had to leave behind the light to which he belonged seemed strange chill dazzling light and she shivered at the thought of it as if the new world new ideas and new requirements could only be endured with him to shield her and help her on and withal there seemed to her a shudder over the whole place on that night the kings eyes looked wild and startled the queenmothers calm was strained the duchess of lorraine was evidently in a state of strong nervous excitement there were strange sounds strange people moving about a weight on everything as if they were under the shadow of a thundercloud could it be only her own fancy she said to herself because this was to be the great event of her life for surely all these great people could not know or heed that little eustacie de ribaumont was to make her escape that night  the trains of royalty were not sumptuously lodged france never has cared so much for comfort as for display the waitinglady of the bedchamber slept in the anteroom of her mistress the others however high their rank were closely herded together up a winding stair leading to a small passage with tiny celllike recesses wherein the demoiselles slept often with their maids and then dressed themselves in the space afforded by the passage eustacies cell was nearly at the end of the gallery and exchanging goodnights with her companions she proceeded to her recess where she expected to find veronique ready to adjust her dress veronique however was missing but anxious to lose no time she had taken off her delicate white satin farthingale to change it for an unobtrusive dark woolen kirtle when to her surprise and dismay a loud creaking growling sound made itself heard outside the door at the other end halfadozen heads came out of their cells halfadozen voices asked and answered the question what is it they are bolting our door outside but only eustacie sped like lightning along the passage pulled at the door and cried open open i say no answer but the other bolt creaked  you mistake concierge we are never bolted in my maid is shut out  no answer but the step retreated eustacie clasped her hands with a cry that she could hardly have repressed but which she regretted the next moment  gabrielle de limeuil laughed what mademoiselle are you afraid they will not let us out tomorrow  my maid murmured eustacie recollecting that she must give a colour to her distress  ah perhaps she will summon old pierre to open for us  this suggestion somewhat consoled eustacie and she stood intently listening for veroniques step wishing that her companions would hold their peace but the adventure amused them and they discussed whether it were a blunder of the concierge or a piece of prudery of madame la comtesse or after all a precaution the palace so full of strange people who could say what might happen and there was a talk of a conspiracy of the huguenots at any rate every one was too much frightened to go to sleep and some sitting on the floor some on a chest some on a bed the girls huddled together in gabrielle de limeuils recess the nearest to the door and one after another related horrible tales of blood murder and vengeancethen alas only too frequent occurrences in their unhappy landeach bringing some frightful contribution from her own province each enhancing upon the lasttold story and ever and anon pausing with bated breath at some fancied sound or supposed start of one of the others then clinging close together and renewing the ghastly anecdote at first in a hushed voice that grew louder with the interest of the story eustacie alone would not join the cluster her cloak round her shoulders she stood with her back against the door ready to profit by the slightest indication outside of a step that might lead to her release or at least enable her to communicate with veronique longing ardently that her companions would go to bed yet unable to avoid listening with the like dreadful fascination to each of the terrible histories which added each moment to the nervous horror of the whole party only one a dull and composed girl felt the influence of weariness and dozed with her head in her companions lap but she was awakened by one general shudder and suppressed cry when the hoarse clang of a bell struck on the ears of the already terrified excited maidens  the tocsin the bell of st germain fire no a huguenot rising fire oh let us out let us out the window where is the fire nowhere see the lights hark that was a shot it was in the palace a heretic rising ah there was to be a slaughter of the heretics i heard it whispered oh let us out open the door  but nobody heard nobody opened there was one who stood without word or cry close to the doorher eyes dilated her cheek colourless her whole person soul and body alike concentrated in that one impulse to spring forward the first moment the bolt should be drawn but still the door remained fast shut     chapter xii the palace of slaughter         a human shambles with bloodreeking floor             miss swanwick esch agamemnon   the door was opened at last but not till full daylight it found eustacie as ready to rush forth past all resistance as she had been the night before and she was already in the doorway when her maid veronique her face swollen with weeping caught her by the hands and implored her to turn back and listen  and words about a rising of the huguenots a general destruction corpses lying in the court were already passing between the other maidens and the concierge eustacie turned upon her servant veronique what means it where is he  alas alas ah mademoiselle do but lie down woe is me i saw it all lie down and i will tell you  tell i will not move till you have told me where my husband is said eustacie gazing with eyes that seemed to veronique turned to stone  ah my ladymy dear lady i was on the turn of the stairs and saw all the traitorthe chevalier narcissecame on him cloaked like youandshot him deadwith oh such cruel words of mockery oh woe the day stay stay dear lady the place is all bloodthey are slaying them allall the huguenots will no one stop hermademoisellemamselle  for eustacie no sooner gathered the sense of veroniques words than she darted suddenly forwards and was in a few seconds more at the foot of the stairs there indeed lay a pool of dark gore and almost in it berengers black velvet cap with the heron plume eustacie with a low cry snatched it up continued her headlong course along the corridor swiftly as a bird veronique following and vainly shrieking to her to stop diane appearing at the other end of the gallery saw but for a moment the little figure with the cloak gathered round her neck and floating behind her understood veroniques cry and joined in the chase across hall and gallery where more stains were to be seen even down to the marble stairs every step slippery with blood others there were who saw and stood aghast not understanding the apparition that flitted on so swiftly never pausing till at the great door at the foot of the stairs she encountered a gigantic scottish archer armed to the teeth she touched his arm and standing with folder arms looked up and said good soldier kill me i am a huguenots  stop her bring her back cried diane from behind it is mdlle de nildemerle  no no my husband is huguenot i am a huguenot let them kill me i saystruggling with diane who had now come up with her and was trying to draw her back  puir lassie muttered the stout scotsman to himself this fearsome night has driven her demented  but like a true sentinel he moved neither hand nor foot to interfere as shaking herself loose from diane she was springing down the steps into the court when at that moment the young abbe de mericour was seen advancing pale breathless horrorstruck and to him diane shrieked to arrest the headlong course he obeyed seeing the wild distraction of the white face and widely glaring eyes took her by both hands and held her in a firm grasp saying alas lady you cannot go out it is no sight for any one  they are killing the protestants she said i am one let me find them and die  a strong effort to free herself ensued but it was so suddenly succeeded by a swoon that the abbe could scarcely save her from dropping on the steps diane begged him to carry her in since they were in full view of menatarms in the court and frightful to say of some of the ladies of the palace who in the frenzy of that dreadful time had actually come down to examine the halfstripped corpses of the men with whom they had jested not twelve hours before  ah it is no wonder said the youthful abbe as he tenderly lifted the inanimate figure this has been a night of horrors i was coming in haste to know whether the king knows of this frightful plot of m de guise and the bloody work that is passing in paris  the king exclaimed diane m labbe do you know where he is now in the balcony overlooking the river taking aim at the fugitives take care even your soutane would not save you if m do and his crew heard you but i must pray you to aid me with this poor child i dread that her wild cries should be heard  the abbe struck dumb with horror silently obeyed mdlle de ribaumont and brought the still insensible eustacie to the chamber now deserted by all the young ladies he laid her on her bed and finding he could do no more left her to her cousin and her maid  the poor child had been unwell and feverish ever since the masque and the suspense of these few days with the tension of that horrible night had prostrated her she only awoke from her swoon to turn her head from the light and refuse to be spoken to  but eustacie child listen this is all in vainhe lives said diane  weary me not with falsehoods faintly said eustacie  no no no they meant to hinder your flight but  they knew of it cried eustacie sitting up suddenly then you told them gogo let me never see you more you have been his death  listen i am sure he lives what would they injure one whom my father loved i heard my father say he would not have him hurt depend upon it he is safe on his way to england  eustacie gave a short but frightful hysterical laugh and pointed to veronique she saw it she said ask her  saw what said diane turning fiercely on veronique what vile deceit have you half killed your lady with  alas mademoiselle i did but tell her what i had seen sighed veronique trembling  tell me said diane passionately  yes everything said eustacie sitting up  ah mademoiselle it will make you ill again  i will be illi will die heavens slaying is better than mans tell her how you saw narcisse  false girl burst out diane  no no cried veronique oh pardon me mademoiselle i could not help it  in spite of her reluctance she was forced to tell that she had found herself locked out of her mistresss room and after losing much time in searching for the concierge learnt that the ladies were locked up by order of the queenmother and was strongly advised not to be running about the passages after a time however while sitting with the concierges wife she heard such frightful whispers from men with white badges who were admitted one by one by the porter and all led silently to a small lower room that she resolved on seeking out the barons servant and sending him to warn his master while she would take up her station at her ladys door she found osbert and with him was ascending a narrow spiral leading from the officesshe unfortunately the foremost as she came to the top a scuffle was going onfour men had thrown themselves upon one and a torch distinctly showed her the younger chevalier holding a pistol to the cheek of the fallen man and she heard the worlds le baiser deustacie jet e barbouillerai ce chien de visage and at the same moment the pistol was discharged she sprang back oversetting as she believed osbert and fled shrieking to the room of the concierge who shut her in till morning  and howhow stammered diane should you know it was the baron  eustacie with a deathlike look showed for a moment what even in her swoon she had held clenched to her bosom the velvet cap soaked with blood  besides added veronique resolved to defend her assertion whom else would the words suit besides are not all the heretic gentlemen dead why as i sat there in the porters room i heard m do call each one of them by name one after the other into the court and there the whitesleeves cut them down or pistolled them like sheep for the slaughter they lie all out there on the terrace like so many carcases at market ready for winter salting  all slain said eustacie dreamily  all except those that the king called into his own garde robe  then i slew him eustacie sank back  i tell you child said diane almost angrily he lives not a hair of his head was to be hurt the girl deceives you  but eustacie had again become insensible and awoke delirious entreating to have the door opened and fancying herself still on the revolving elysium oh demons have pity was her cry  dianes soothings were like speaking to the winds and at last she saw the necessity of calling in further aid but afraid of the scandal that the poor girls raving accusations might create she would not send for the huguenots surgeon ambroise pare whom the king had carefully secured in his own apartments but employed one of the barber valets of the queenmothers household poor eustacie was well pleased to see her blood flowing and sank back on her pillow murmuring that she had confessed her husbands faith and would soon be one with him and diane feared for a moment lest the swoon should indeed be death  the bleeding was so far effectual that it diminished the fever and eustacie became rational again when she had dozed and wakened but she was little able or willing to speak and would not so much as listen to dianes asseverations that veronique had made a frightful error and that the baron would prove to be alive whether it were that the admission that diane had known of the project for preventing the elopement that invalidated her words or whether the sufferers instinct made her believe veroniques testimony rather than her cousins assurances it was all cramming words into her ear against the stomach of her sense and she turned away from them with a piteous petulant hopelessness could they not even let her alone to die in peace  diane was almost angered at this little silly child being in such an agony of sorrowshe who could never have known how to love him and after all this persistent grief was willfully thrown away for diane spoke in perfect sincerity when she taxed veronique with an injurious barbarous mistake she knew her fathers strong aversion to violence and the real predilection that berengers good mien respectful manners and liberal usage had won from him and she believed he had much rather the youth lived provided he were inoffensive no doubt a little force had been necessary to kidnap one so tall active and determined and veronique had made up her horrible tale after the usual custom of waitingmaids  nothing else should be true did she think otherwise she should be even more frantic than eustacie why it would be her own doing she had betrayed the day of the escapeshe had held aloof from warning there was pleasure in securing niddemerle for her brother pleasure in balking the foolish child who had won the heart that disregarded her nay there might have been even pleasure in the destruction of the scorner of her charmsthe foe of her housethere might have been pride in receiving queen catherines dexterous hint that she had been an apt pupil if the young baron had only been something differentsomething less fair gracious bright and pure one bright angel seemed to have flitted across her path and nothing should induce her to believe she had destroyed him  the stripped corpses of the murdered huguenots of the palace had been laid in a line on the terrace and the ladies who had laughed with them the night before went to inspect them in death a few remnants of soeur moniques influence would have withheld diane but that a frenzy of suspense was growing on her she must see for herself if it were so she must secure a fragment of the shining flaxen hair if only as a token that anything so pure and bright had walked the earth  she went on the horrible quest shrinking where others stared for it was a pitiless time and the squadron of the queenmother were as lost to womanhood as the fishwomen of two centuries later but diane saw no corpse at once so tall so young and so fair though blond normans and blueblooded franks lads scarce sixteen and stalwart warriors lay in one melancholy rank she at least bore away the certainly that the english ribaumont was not there and if not he must be safe she could obtain no further certainty for she knew that she must not expect to see either her father or brother there was a panic throughout the city all paris imagined that the huguenots were on the point of rising and slaying all the catholics and with the savagery of alarmed cowardice the citizens and the mob were assisting the armed bands of the dukes of anjou and guise to complete the slaughter dragging their lodgers from their hidingplaces and denouncing all whom they suspected of reluctance to mass and confession but on the monday diane was able to send an urgent message to her father that he must come to speak with her for mdlle de niddemerle was extremely ill she would meet him in the garden after morning mass  there accordingly when she stepped forth pale rigid but stately with her large fan in her hand to serve as a parasol she met both him and her brother she was for a moment sorry for she had much power over her father while she was afraid of her brothers sarcastic tongue and eye she knew he never scrupled to sting her wherever she was most sensitive and she would have been able to extract much more from her father in his absence france has never been without a tendency to produce the tigermonkey or ferocious fop and the genus was in its full ascendancy under the sons of catherine de medicis when the dregs of francois the firsts pseudochivalry were not extinctwhen horrible retaliating civil wars of extermination had made life cheap nefarious persecutions had hardened the heart and steeled the eye and the licentiousness promoted by the shifty queen as one of her instruments of government had darkened the whole understanding the most hateful heights of perfidy effeminacy and hypocrisy were not reached till poor charles ix who only committed crimes on compulsion was in his grave and henry iii on the throne but narcisse de ribaumont was one of the choice companions of the latter and after the night and day of murder now stood before his sister with scented hair and handkerchiefthe last laced delicately held by a hand in an embroidered gloveemerald pendants in his ears a moustache twisted into sharp points and turned up like an eternal sardonic smile and he led a little white poodle by a rosecoloured ribbon  well sister he said as he went through the motions of kissing her hand and she embraced her father so you dont know how to deal with megrims and transports  father said diane not vouchsafing any attention unless you can send her some assurance of his life i will not answer for the consequences  narcisse laughed take her this dog with my compliments that is the way to deal with such a child as that  you do not know what you say brother answered diane with dignity it goes deeper than that  the deeper it goes child said the elder chevalier the better it is that she should be undeceived as soon as possible she will recover and be amenable the sooner  then he lives father exclaimed diane he lives though she is not to hear itsay  what know i said the old man evasively on a night of confusion many mischances are sure to occur lurking in the palace at the very moment when there was a search for the conspirators it would have been a miracle had the poor young man escaped  diane turned still whiter then she said that was why you made monsieur put eustacie into the ballet that they might not go on wednesday  it was well hinted by you daughter we could not have effectually stopped them on wednesday without making a scandal  once more said diane gasping though still resolute is not the story told by eustacies woman falsethat she saw himpistolledby you brother  peste cried narcisse was the prying wench there i thought the little one might be satisfied that he had neighbours fare no matter what is done for ones beaux yeux is easily pardonedand if not why i have her all the same  nevertheless daughter said the chevalier gravely the woman must be silenced either she must be sent home or taught so to swear to having been mistaken that la petite may acquit your brother but what now my daughter  she is livid exclaimed narcisse with his sneer what sir did not you know she was smitten with the peach on the top of a pole  enough brother said diane recovering herself enough to speak hoarsely but with hard dignity you have slainyou need not insult one whom you have lost the power of understanding  shallow schoolboys certainly form no part of my study save to kick them downstairs when they grow impudent said narcisse coolly it is only women who think what is long must be grand  come children no disputes said the chevalier of course we regret that so fine a youth mixed himself up with the enemies of the kingdom like the stork among the sparrows both diane and i are sorry for the necessity but remember child that when he was interfering between your brother and his just right of inheritance and destined wife he could not but draw such a fate on himself now all is smooth the estates will be united in their true head and youyou too my child will be provided for as suits your name all that is needed is to soothe the little one so as to hinder her from making an outcryand silence the maid my child will do her best for her fathers sake and that of her family  diane was less demonstrative than most of her countrywomen she had had time to recollect the uselessness of giving vent to her indignant anguish and her brothers derisive look held her back the family tactics from force of habit recurred to her she made no further objection to her fathers commands but when her father and brother parted with her she tottered into the now empty chapel threw herself down with her burning forehead on the stone step and so lay for hours it was not in prayer it was because it was the only place where she could be alone to her heaven above and earth below seemed alike full of despair darkness and cruel habitations and she lay like one sick with misery and repugnance to the life and world that lay before herthe hard world that had quenched that one fair light and mocked her pity it was a misery of solitude and yet no thought crossed her of going to weep and sympathize with the other sufferer no rivalry and jealousy came in there eustacie viewed herself as his wife and the very thought that she had been deliberately preferred and had enjoyed her triumph hardened dianes heart against her nay the open violence and abandonment of her grief seemed to the more restrained and concentrated nature of her elder a sign of shallowness and want of durability and in a certain contemptuous envy at her professing a right to mourn diane never even reconsidered her own resolution to play out her fathers game consign eustacie to her husbands murdered and leave her to console herself with bridal splendours and a choice of admirers from all the court  however for the present diane would rather stay away as much as possible from the sickbed of the poor girl and when an approaching step forced her to rouse herself and hurry away by the other door of the chapel she did indeed mount to the ladies bedchamber but only to beckon veronique out of hearing and ask for her mistress  just the same still only sleeping to have feverish dreams of the revolving wheel or the demons grappling her husband refusing all food but a little drink and lying silent except for a few moans heedless who spoke or looked at her  diane explained that in that case it was needless to come to her but added with the vraisemblance of falsehood in which she had graduated in catherines school veronique as i told you you were mistaken  ah mademoiselle if m le baron lives she will be cured at once  silly girl said diane giving relief to her pentup feeling by asperity of manner how could he live when you and your intrigues got him into the palace on such a night dead he is of course but it was your own treacherous mischievous fancy that laid it on my brother he was far away with m de guise at the attack on the admiral it was some of monsieurs grooms you saw you remember she had brought him into a scrape with monsieur and it was sure to be remembered and look you if you repeat the other tale and do not drive it out of her head you need not look to be long with herno nor at home my father will have no one there to cause a scandal by an evil tongue  that threat convinced veronique that she had been right but she too had learnt lessons at the louvre and she was too diplomatic not to ask pardon for her blunder promise to contradict it when her mistress could listen and express her satisfaction that it was not the chevalier narcissefor such things were not pleasant as she justly observed in families  about noon on the tuesday the louvre was unusually tranquil all the world had gone forth to a procession to notre dame headed by the king and all the royal family to offer thanksgiving for the deliverance of the country from the atrocious conspiracy of the huguenots eustacies chamber was freed from the bustle of all the maids of honour arraying themselves and adjusting curls feathers ruffs and jewels and such relief as she was capable of experiencing she felt in the quiet  veronique hoped she would sleep and watched like a dragon to guard against any disturbance springing out with upraised finger when a soft gliding step and rustling of brocade was heard does she sleep said a low voice and veronique in the pale thin face with tearswollen eyes and light yellow hair recognized the young queen my good girl said elisabeth with almost a beseeching gesture let me see her i do not know when again i may be able  veronique stood aside with the lowest possible of curtseys just as her mistress with a feeble weary voice murmured oh make them let me alone  my poor poor child said the queen bending over eustacie while her brimming eyes let the tears fall fast i will not disturb you long but i could not help it  her majesty exclaimed eustacie opening wide her eyes in amazement  my dear suffer me here a little moment said the meek elisabeth seating herself so as to bring her face near to eustacies i could not rest till i had seen how it was with you and wept with you  ah madame you can weep said eustacie slowly looking at the queens heavy tearful eyes almost with wonder but i do not weep because i am dying and that is better  my dear my dear do not so speak exclaimed the gentle but rather dull queen  is it wrong nay so much the betterthen i shall be with him said eustacie in the same feeble dreamy manner as if she did not understand herself but a little roused by seeing she had shocked her visitor i would not be wicked he was all bright goodness and truth but his does not seem to be goodness that brings to heaven and i do not want to be in the heaven of these cruel false meni think it would go round and round she shut her eyes as if to steady herself and that moment seemed to give her more selfrecollection for looking at the weeping troubled visitor she exclaimed with more energy oh madame it must be a dreadful fancy good men like him cannot be shut into those fiery gates with the torturing devils  heaven forbid exclaimed the queen my poor poor child grieve not yourself thus at my home my austrian home we do not speak in this dreadful way my father loves and honours his loyal protestants and he trusts that the good god accepts their holy lives in his unseen church even though outwardly they are separate from us my german confessor ever said so oh child it would be too frightful if we deemed that all those souls as well as bodies perished in these frightful days myself i believe that they have their reward for their truth and constancy  eustacie caught the queens hand and fondled it with delight as though those words had veritably opened the gates of heaven to her husband the queen went on in her slow gentle manner the very tone of which was inexpressibly soothing and sympathetic yes and all will be clear there no more violence at home our good men think so and the king will think the same when these cruel counselors will leave him to himself and i pray i pray day and night that god will not lay this sin to his account but open his eyes to repent forgive him eustacie and pray for him too  the king would have saved my husband madame returned eustacie he bade him to his room it was i unhappy i who detained him lest our flight should have been hindered  the queen in her turn kissed eustacies forehead with eager gratitude oh little one you have brought a drop of comfort to a heavy heart alas i could sometimes feel you to be a happier wife than i with your perfect trust in the brave purespirited youth unwarped by these wicked cruel advisers i loved to look at his open brow it was so like our bravest german junkers and child we thought both of us to have brought about your happiness but ah it has but caused all this misery  no no dearest queen said eustacie this month with all its woe has been joylife oh i had rather lie here and die for his loss than be as i was before he came and nownow you have given him to me for all eternityif but i am fit to be with him  eustacie had revived so much during the interview that the queen could not believe her to be in a dying state but she continued very ill the low fever still hanging about her and the faintness continual the close room the turmoil of its many inhabitants and the impossibility of quiet also harassed her greatly and elisabeth had little or no power of making any other arrangements for her in the palace ladies when ill were taken home and this poor child had no home the other maids of honour were a gentler simpler set than catherines squadron and were far from unkind but between them and her who had so lately been the brightest child of them all there now lay that great gulf ich habe gelebt und geliebet that the little blackbird as they used to call her should have been on the verge of running away with her own husband was a half understood amusing mystery discussed in exaggerating prattle this was hushed indeed in the presence of that crushed prostrate silent sorrow but there was still an utter incapacity of true sympathy that made the very presence of so many oppressive even when they were not in murmurs discussing the ghastly tidings of massacres in other cities and the fate of acquaintances  on that same day the queen sent for diane to consult her about the sufferer elisabeth longed to place her in her own cabinet and attend on her herself but she was afraid to do this as the unhappy king was in such a frenzied mood and so constantly excited by his brother and guise that it was possible that some halfdelirious complaint from poor eustacie might lead to serious consequences indeed elisabeth though in no state to bear agitation was absorbed in her endeavour to prevent him from adding blood to blood and a few days later actually saved the lives of the king of navarre and prince of conde by throwing herself before him halfdressed and tearing his weapon from his hand her only hope was that if she should give him a son her influence for mercy would revive with his joy meantime she was powerless and she could only devise the sending the poor little sufferer to a convent where the nuns might tend her till she was restored to health and composure diane acquiesced but proposed sending for her father and he was accordingly summoned diane saw him first alone and both agreed that he had better take eustacie to bellaise where her aunt would take good care of her and in a few months she would no doubt be weary enough of the country to be in raptures to return to paris on any terms  yet even as diane said this a sort of longing for the solitude of the woods of niddemerle came over her a recollection of the good sister monique at whose knee she had breathed somewhat of the free pure air that her murdered cousin had brought with him a sense that there she could pour forth her sorrow she offered herself at once to go with eustacie  no no my daughter said the chevalier that is unnecessary there is pleasanter employment for you i told you that your position was secured here is a brilliant offerm de selinville  le bonhomme de selinville exclaimed diane feeling rather as if the compensation were like the little dog offered to eustacie  know ye not that his two heretic nephews perished the other night he is now the head of his name the marquis the only one left of his house  he begins early said diane  an old soldier my daughter scarce stays to count the fallen he has no time to lose he is sixty with a damaged constitution it will be but the affair of a few years and then will my beautiful marquise be free to choose for herself i shall go from the young queen to obtain permission from the queenmother  no question was asked diane never even thought objection possible it was a close to that present life which she had begun to loathe it gave comparative liberty it would dull and confuse her heartsick pain and give her a certain superiority to her brother moreover it would satisfy the old father whom she really loved marriage with a wornout old man was a simple step to full display for young ladies without fortune  the chevalier told queen elisabeth his purpose of placing his niece in the family convent under the care of her aunt the abbess in a foundation endowed by her own family on the borders of her own estate elisabeth would have liked to keep her nearer but could not but own that the change to the scenes of her childhood might be more beneficial than a residence in a nunnery at paris and the chevalier spoke of his niece with a tender solicitude that gained the queens heart she consented only stipulating that eustacies real wishes should be ascertained and herself again made the exertion of visiting the patient for the purpose  eustacie had been partly dressed and was lying as near as she could to the narrow window the queen would not let her move but took her damp languid hand and detailed her uncles proposal it was plain that it was not utterly distasteful soeur monique she said soeur monique would sing hymns to me and then i should not see the imps at night  poor child and you would like to go you could bear the journey  it would be in the air and then i should not smell bloodblood and her cheeks became whiter again if possible  then you would not rather be at the carmelites or maubuisson near me  ah madame there would not be soeur monique if the journey would only make me die as soon as i came with soeur monique to hush me and keep off dreadful images  dear child you should put away the thought of dying maybe you are to live that your prayers may win salvation for the soul of him you love  oh then i should like to go into a convent so strictso strict cried eustacie with renewed vigour bellaise is nothing like strict enough does your majesty indeed think that my prayers will aid him  alas what hope could we have but in praying said elisabeth with tears in her eyes little one we will be joined at least in our prayers and intercessions thou wilt not forget in thine one who yet lives unhappier than all  and oh my good my holy queen will you indeed pray for himmy husband he was so good his faith can surely not long be reckoned against him he did not believe in purgatory perhaps then frowning with a difficulty far beyond a feverclouded brain she concludedat least orisons may aid him it is doing something for him oh where are my beadsi can begin at once  the queen put her arm round her and together they said the de profundisthe queen understood every word far more for the living than the dead again elisabeth had given new life to eustacie the intercession for her husband was something to live for and the severest convent was coveted until she was assured that she would not be allowed to enter on any rule till she had time to recover her health and show the constancy of her purpose by a residence at bellaise  ere parting however the queen bent over her and colouring as if much ashamed of what she said whisperedchild not a word of the ceremony at montpipeauyou understand the king was always averse it would bring him and me into dreadful trouble with those others and alas it makes no difference now you will be silent  and eustacie signed her acquiescence as indeed no difficulty was made in her being regarded as the widow of the baron de ribaumont when she further insisted on procuring a widows dress before she quitted her room and declared with much dignity that she should esteem no person her friend who called her mademoiselle de niddemerle to this the chevalier de ribaumont was willing to give way he did not care whether narcisse married her as berengers widow or as the separated maiden wife and he thought her vehement opposition and dislike would die away the faster the fewer impediments were placed in her way both he and diane strongly discouraged any attempt on narcisses widow part at a farewell interview and thus unmolested and under the constant soothing influence of reciting her prayers in the trust that they were availing her husband eustacie rallied so much that about ten day after the dreadful st batholomew in the early morning she was halfled halfcarried down the stairs between her uncle and veronique her face was close muffled in her thick black veil but when she came to the foot of the first stairs where she had found berengers cap a terrible shuddering came on her she again murmured something about the smell of blood and fell into a swoon  carry her on at once said diane who was followingthere will be not end to it if you do not remove her immediately  and thus shielded from the sight of marcisses intended passionate gesture of farewell at the palacedoor eustecie was laid at full length on the seat of the great ponderous family coach where veronique hardly wished to revive her till the eight horses should have dragged her beyond the streets of paris with their terrible associations and the gibbets still hung with the limbs of the murdered     chapter xiii the bridegrooms arrival      the starling flew to his mothers window stane     it whistled and it sang   and aye the ower word of the tune     was johnnie tarries lang                      johnnie of bredislee   there had been distrust and dissatisfaction at home for many a day past berenger could hardly be censured for loving his own wife and yet his family were by not means gratified by the prospect of his bringing home a little french papist of whom lady thistlewood remembered nothing good  lucy was indignantly fetched home by her stepmother who insisted on treating her with extreme pity as a deserted maiden and thus counteracting aunt cecilys wise representations that there never should and therefore never could have been anything save fraternal affection between the young people and that pity was almost an insult to lucy the good girl herself was made very uncomfortable by there demonstrations and avoided them as much as possible chiefly striving in her own gentle way to prepare her little sisters to expect numerous charms in brother berengers wife and heartily agreeing with philip that berenger knew his own mind best  and at any rate quoth philip well have the best bonfire that ever was seen in the country lucy youll coax my father to give us a tarbarrel  the tarbarrel presided over a monstrous pile of fagots and the fisherboys were promised a tester to whoever should first bring word to master philip that the young lord and lady were in the creek  philip gave his pony no rest between the lockout on the downs and the borders of the creek but day after day passed and still the smacks from jersey held no person worth mentioning and still the sense of expectation kept lucy starting at every sound and hating herself for her own folly  at last philip burst into combe manor fiery red with riding and consternation oh father father paul duvals boat is come in and he says that the villain papists have butchered every protestant in france  sir marmadukes asseveration was of the strongest that he did not believe a word of it nevertheless he took his horse and rode down to interrogate paul duval and charge him not to spread the report was in the air he went to the hall and the butler met him with a grave face and took him to the study where lord walwyn was sitting over letter newly received from london giving hints from the low countries of bloody work in france and when he returned to his home his wife burst out upon him in despair here had they been certainly killing her poor buy not a doubt that he was dead all from this miserable going to france that had been quite against her will  stoutly did sir marmaduke persevere in his disbelief but every day some fresh wave of tidings floated in murder wholesale had surely been perpetrated now came stories of deathbells at rouen from the fishermen on the coast now markets and petty sessions discussed the foul slaughter of the ambassador and his household truly related how the queen had put on mourning and falsely that she had hung the french ambassador la mothe feneon and burleigh wrote to his old friend from london that some horrible carnage had assuredly taken place and that no news had yet been received of sir francis walsingham or of his suite  all these days seems so many years taken from the vital power of lord walwyn not only had his hopes and affections would themselves closely around his grandson but he reproached himself severely with having trusted him in his youth and inexperience among the seductive perils of paris the old man grieved over the promising young life cut off and charged on himself the loss and grief to the women whose stay he had trusted berenger would have been he said little but his hand and head grew more trembling he scarcely ate or slept and seemed to waste from a vigorous elder to a feeble being in the extremity of old age till lady walwyn had almost ceased to think of her grandson in her anxiety for her husband  letters came at last the messenger despatched by sir francis walsingham had not been able to proceed till the ways had become safe and he had then been delayed but on his arrival his tidings were sent down there were letters both from sir francis walsingham and from heartbroken mr adderley both to the same effect with all possible praises of the young baron de ribaumont all possible reproach to themselves for having let him be betrayed without even a possibility of recovering his remains for honourable burial poor mr adderley further said that mr sidney who was inconsolable for the loss of his friend had offered to escort him to the low countries whence he would make his way to england and would present himself at hurst walwyn if his lordship could endure the sight of his creature who had so miserably failed in his trust  lord walwyn read both letters twice through before he spoke then he took off his spectacles laid them down and said calmly gods will be done i thank god that my boy was blameless better they slew him than sent him home tainted with their vices  the certainty such as it was seemed like repose after the suspense they knew to what to resign themselves and even lady thistlewoods tempestuous grief had so spent itself that late in the evening the family sat round the fire in the hall the old lord dozing as one worn out with sorrow the others talking in hushed tones of that bright boyhood that joyous light quenched in the night of carnage  the butler slowly entered the hall and approached sir marmaduke cautiously can i speak with you sir  what is it davy demanded the lady who first caught the words what did you say  madam it is humfrey holt  humfrey holt was the head of the grooms who had gone with berenger and there was a general start and suppressed exclamation humfrey hold said lord walwyn feebly drawing himself to sit upright hath he then escaped  yea my lord said davy and he brings news of my young lord  alack davy said lady walwyn such news had been precious a while ago  nay so please your ladyship it is better than you deem humfley says my young lord is yet living  living shrieked lady thistlewood starting up living my son and where  they are bearing him home my lady said the butler but i fear me by what humfley says that it is but in woeful case  bringing him home which way philip darted off like an arrow from the bow sir marmaduke hastily demanded if aid were wanted and lady walwyn interpreting the almost inaudible voice of her husband bade that humfley should be called in to tell his own story  hands were held out in greeting and blessings murmured as the groom entered looking battered and worn and bowing low in confusion at being thus unusually conspicuous and having to tell his story to the head and body and slashed about the face so as it is a shame to see nor hath he done aught these three weary weeks but moan from time to time so as it is enough to break ones heart to hear him and i fear me tis but bringing him home to die  even so god be thanked and you too honest humfley said lady walwyn let us hear when and how this deed was done  why that my lord i cant so well say being that i was not with him mores the pity or id have known the reason why or even they laid a finger on him but when master landry his french fosterbrother comes he will resolve you in his own tongue i cant parleyvoo with him but hes an honest rogue for a frenchman and twas he brought off my young lord you see we were all told to be abroad the little french craft  master landry took me down and settled it all with the master a french farmer fellow that came a horsedealing to paris i knew what my young lord was after but none of the other varlets did and i went down and made as decent a place as i could between decks my lord and master landry were gone down to the court meantime and we were to lie off till we heard a whistle like a mavis on the bank then come and take them aboard well we waited and waited and all the lights were out and not a sound did we hear till just an hour after midnight then a big bell rang out not like a decent christianable bell but a great clash then another and a lot of strokes enough to take away ones breath then half the windows were lighted up and we heard shots and screeches and splashes till as i said to jack smithers twas as if one half the place was murthering the other the farmer got frightened and would have been off but when i saw what he was at no says i not an inch do we budge without news of my lord so jack stood by the rope and let them see that twas as much as their life was worth to try to unmoor mercy what a night it was shrieks and shouts and shots and howls here there and everywhere and splashes into the rive and by and by we saw the poor murthered creatures come floating by the farmer he had some words with one of the boats near and i heard somewhat of huguenot and hereteek and i knew that was what they called good protestants then up comes the farmer with his sons looking mighty ugly at us and signing that unless we let them be off twould be set ashore for us and we began to think as how we had best be set ashore and go down the five of us to see if we could stand by my young lord in some strait or give notice to my lord ambassador  god reward you exclaimed lady walwyn  twas only our duty my lady gruffly answered humfrey but just as hal had got on the quay what should i see but master landry coming down the street with my young lord in his back i can tell you he was wellnigh spent and just then half a dozen butcherly villains came out on him bawling tuy tuy which it seems means kill kill he turned about and showed them that he had got a white sleeve and white cross in his bonnet like them the rascals giving them to understand that he was only going to throw the corpse into the river i doubted him then myself but he caught sight of us and in his fashion of talk with us called out to us to help for there was life still so two of us took my lord and the other three gave the beggarly french cutthroats as good as they meant for us while landry shouted to the farmer to wait and we got aboard and made right away down the river but never a word has the poor young gentleman spoken though master landry has done all a barber or a sicknurse could do and he got us past the cities by showing the papers in my lords pocket so that we got safe to the farmers place there we lay till we could get a boat to jersey and thence again home and maybe my young lord will mend now mistress cecily will have the handing of him  that is it the wisest hands good humfrey said lord walwyn as the tears of feeble age flowed down his cheeks may he who hath brought the lad safely so far spare him yet and raise him up but whether he live or die you son and daughter thistlewood will look that the faithfulness of humfrey holt and his comrades be never forgotten or unrewarded  humfrey again muttered something about no more than his duty but by this time sounds were heard betokening the approach of the melancholy procession who having been relieved by a relay of servants sent at once from the house were bearing home the wounded youth philip first of all dashed in hurrying and stumbling he had been unprepared by hearing humfreys account and impetuous and affectionate as he was was entirely unrestrained and flinging himself on his knees with the halfaudible words oh lucy lucy he is as good as dead hid his face between his arms on his sisters lap and sobbed with the abandonment of a child and with all his youthful strength so much adding to the consternation and confusion that finding all lucys gentle entreaties vain his father at last roughly pulled up his face by main force and said philip hold your tongue are we to have you on our hands as well as my lady i shall send you home this moment let your sister go  this threat reduced the boy to silence lucy who was wanted to assist in preparing berengers room disengaged herself but he remained in the same posture his head buried on the seat of the chair and the loud weeping only forcibly stifled by forcing his handkerchief into his mouth as if he had been in violent bodily pain nor did he venture again to look up as the cause of all his distress was slowly carried into the hall corpselike indeed the bearers had changed several times all but a tall fair norman youth who through the whole transit had supported the head endeavouring to guard it from shocks when the mother and the rest came forward he made a gesture to conceal the face saying in french ah mesdames this is no sight for you  indeed the head and face were almost entirely hidden by bandages and it was not till berenger had been safely deposited on a large carved bed that the anxious relatives were permitted to perceive the number and extent of his hurts and truly it was only by the breath the vital warmth and the heavy moans when he was disturbed or the dressings of the wounds were touched that showed him still to be a living man there proved to be no less than four woundsa shot through the right shoulder the right arm also broken with a terrible blow with a sword a broad gash from the left temple to the right ear and worse than all le baiser deustacie a bullet wound where the muzzle of the pistol had absolutely been so close as to have burnt and blackened the cheek so that his life was as osbert averred chiefly owing to the assassins jealousy of his personal beauty which had directed his shot to the cheek rather than the head and thus though the bullet had terribly shattered the upper jaw and roof of the mouth and had passed out through the back of the head there was a hope that it had not penetrated the seat of life or reason the other gash on the face was but a swordwound and though frightful to look at was unimportant compared with the first wound with the pistolshot in the shoulder with the arm broken and further injured by having served to suspend him round osberts neck but it was altogether so appalling a sight that it was no wonder that sis marmaduke muttered low but deep curses on the cowardly ruffians while his wife wept in grief as violent though more silent than her stepsons and only cecily gathered the faintest ray of hope the wounds had been well cared for the arm had been set the hair cut away and lint and bandages applied with a skill that surprised her till she remembered that landry osbert had been bred up in preparation to be berengers valet and thus to practise those minor arts of surgery then required in a superior bodyservant for his part though his eyes looked red and his whole person exhausted by unceasing watching he seemed unable to relinquish the care of his master for a moment and her nunnery french would not have perceived her tender touch and ready skill these were what made him consent to leave his post even for a short meal and so soon as he had eaten it he was called to lord walwyn to supply the further account which humfley had been unable to give he had waited he explained with a lackey a friend of his in the palace till he became alarmed by the influx of armed men wearing white crosses and shirtsleeves on their left arms but his friend had assured him that his master had been summoned to the royal bedchamber where he would be as safe as in church and obtaining from landry osbert himself a perfectly true assurance of being a good catholic had supplied him with the badges that were needful for security it was just then that madames maid crept down to his waitingplace with the intelligence that her mistress had been bolted in and after a short consultation they agreed to go and see whether m le baron were indeed waiting and if he were to warn him of the suspicious state of the lower regions of the palace  they were just in time to see but not to prevent the attack upon their young master and while veronique fled screaming landry osbert who had been thrown back on the stairs in her sudden flight recovered himself and hastened to his master the murderers after their blows had been struck had hurried along the corridor to join the body of assassins whose work they had in effect somewhat anticipated landry full of rage and despair was resolved at least to save his fosterbrothers corpse from further insult and bore it downstairs in his arms on the way he perceived that life was not yet extinct and resolving to become doubly cautious he sought in the pocket for the purse that had been well filled for the flight and by the persuasive argument of gold crowns obtained egress from the doorkeeper of the postern where berenger hoped to have emerged in a far different manner it was a favourable moment for the main body of the murderers were at that time being poster in the court by the captain of the guard ready to massacre the gentlemen of the king of navarres suite and he was therefore unmolested by any claimant of the plunders of the apparent corpse he bore on his shoulders the citizens of paris who had been engaged in their share of the murders for more than an hour before the tragedy began in the louvre frequently beset him on his way to the quay and but for the timely aid of his english comrades he would hardly have brought off his fosterbrother safely  the pass with which king charles had provided berenger for himself and his followers when his elopement was first planned enabled osbert to carry his whole crew safely past all the stations where passports were demanded he had much wished to procure surgical aid at rouen but learning from the boatmen on the river that the like bloody scenes were there being enacted he had decide on going on to his masters english home as soon as possible merely trusting to his own skill by the way and though it was the slightest possible hope yet the healthy state of the wounds and the mere fact of life continuing had given him some faint trust that there might be a partial recovery  lord walwyn repeated his agitated thanks and praises for such devotion to his grandson  osbert bower laid his hand on his heart and repliedmonseigneur is good but what say i monsieur le baron is my fosterbrother say that and all is said in one word  he was then dismissed with orders to take some rest but he obstinately refused all commands in french or english to go to bed and was found some time after fast asleep     chapter xiv sweet heart         ye hae marred a bonnier face than your ain             dying words of the bonnie earl of moray   one room at hurst walwyn though large wainscoted and well furnished bore as pertinaciously the air of a cell as the appearance of sister cecily st john continued like that of a nun there was a large sunny oriel in which a thrush sang merrily in a wicker cage and yet the very central point and leading feature of the room was the altarlike table covered with rich needlework with a carved ebony crucifix placed on it and on the wall above quaint and stiff but lovelyfeatured delicately tinted pictures of our lady in the centre and of st anne and st cecilia on either side with skies behind of most ethereal blue and robes tenderly trimmed with gold a little shrine of purple spar with a crystal front contained a fragment of sacred bone a silver shell help holy water perpetuated from some blessed by bishop ridley               with velvet bound and broidered oer                       her breviary book  lay open at sext and there too lay with its three marks at the daily lessons the bishops bible and the common prayer beside it  the elder baron de ribaumont had never pardoned cecily his single glance at that table and had seriously remonstrated with his fatherinlaw for permitting its existence quoting rachel achan and maachah yet he never knew of the haircloth smock the discipline the cord and sackcloth that lay stored in the large carved awmry and were secretly in use on every fast or vigil not with any notion of merit but of simple obedience and with even deeper comprehension and enjoyment of their spiritual significance of which in her cloister life she had comprehended little  it was not she however who knelt with bowed head and clasped hands before the altartable the winter sunbeams making the shadows of the ivy sprays dance upon the deep mourning dress and pale cheek the eyelashes were heavy with teardrops and veiled eyes that had not yet attained to the region of calm like the light quivering of the lips showed that here was the beginning of the course of trial through which serenity might be won and for ever  by and by the latch was raise and cecily came forward lucy rose quickly to her feet and while giving and returning a fond embrace asked with her eyes the question that cecily answered still in the same lethargy the only shade of sense that i have seen is an unclosing of the eyes a wistful look whenever the door opened and a shiver through all his frame whenever the great bell rings till my lord forbade it to be sounded  that frightful bell that the men told us of said lucy shuddering oh what a heart that murderess must have had  hold lucy how should we judge her who may at this moment be weeping in desolation  lucy looked up astonished aunt she said you have been so long shut up with him that you hardly can have heard allhow she played fast and loose and for the sake of a mere pageant put off the flight from the time when it would have been secure even until that dreadful eve  i know it said cecily i fear me much that her sin has been great yet lucy it were better to pray for her than to talk wildly against her  alas murmured lucy i could bear it and glory in it when it seemed death for the faiths sake but and the tears burst out to find he was only trapped and slain for the sake of a faithless girland that he should love her still  she is his wife said cecily child from my soul i grieve for you but none the less must i if no other will keep before your eyes that our berengers faith belongs solely to her  youyou never would have let me forget it said lucy indeed i am more maidenly when not alone with you i know verily that he is loyal and that my hatred to her is more than is meet i willi will pray for her but i would that you were in your convent still and that i could hide me there  that were scarce enough said cecily one sister we had who had fled to our house to hide her sorrows for her betrothed had wedded another she took her sorrows for her vocation strove to hurry on her vows and when they were taken she chafed and fretted under them it was she who wrote to the commissioner the letter that led to the visitation of our house and moreover she was the only one of us who married  to her own lover  no to a brewer at winchester i say not that you could ever be like poor sister bridget but only that the cloister has no charm to still the heartprayer and duty can do as much without as within  when we deemed her worthy i was glad of his happiness said lucy thoughtfully  you did my dear and i rejoiced think now how grievous it must be with her if she as i fear she may yielded her heart to those who told her that to ensnare him was her duty or if indeed she were as much deceived as he  then she will soon be comforted said lucy still with some bitterness in her voice bitterness of which she herself was perhaps conscious for suddenly dropping in her knees she hid her face and cried oh help me to pray for her aunt cecily and that i may do her wrong no more  and cecily in her low conventual chant sang almost under her breath the noonday latin hymn the words of which long familiar to lucy had never as yet so come home to her             quench thou the fires of heat and strife                the wasting fever of the heart             from perils guard our feeble life                and to our souls thy help impart  cecilys judgment would have been thought weakly charitable by all the rest of the family mr adderley had been forwarded by sir francis walsingham like a bale of goods and arriving in a mood of such selfreproach as would be deemed abject by persons used to the modern relations between noblemen and their chaplains was exhilarated by the unlookedfor comfort of finding his young charge at least living and in his grandfathers house from his narrative walsinghams letter and osberts account lord walwyn saw no reason to doubt that the black ribaumonts had thought that massacre a favourable moment for sweeping the only survivor of the white or elder branch away and that not only had royalty lent itself to the cruel project but that as diane de ribaumont had failed as a bait the young espoused wife had herself been employed to draw him into the snare and secure his presence at the slaughterhouse away from his safe asylum at the ambassadors or even in the kings garderobe it was an unspeakably frightful view to take of the case yet scarcely worse than the reality of many of the dealings of those with whom the poor young girl had been associated certainly not worse than the crimes the suspicion of which was resting on the last dowager queen of france and all that could be felt by the sorrowing family was comfort that at least corruption of mind had either not been part of the game or had been unsuccessful and by all testimony the victim was still the same innocent boy this was all their relief while for days for weeks berenger de ribaumont lay in a trance or torpor between life and death sometimes as cecily had said his eyes turned with a startled wistfulness towards the door and the sound of a bell seemed to thrill him with a start of agony but for the most part he neither appeared to see or hear and a few moans were the only sounds that escaped him the queen in her affection for her old friend and her strong feeling for the victims of the massacre sent down the court physician who turned him about and elicited sundry heavy groans but could do no more than enjoin patient waiting on the beneficent powers of nature in early youth his visit produced one benefit namely the strengthening of cecily st johns hands against the charms elixirs and nostrums with which lady thistlewoods friends supplied herplasters from the cunning women of lyme regis made of powder of giants bones and snakes prayed into stone by st aldhelm pills of live woodlice and fomentations of living earthworms and spiders great was the censure incurred by lady walwyn for refusing to let such remedies be tried on her grandson and he was so much more her child than his mothers that dame annora durst do no more than maunder  in this perfect rest it seemed as if after a time the powers of nature did begin to rally there were appearances of healing about the wounds the difference between sleeping and waking became more evident the eyes lost the painful halfclosed vacant look but were either shut or opened with languid recognition the injuries were such as to exclude him from almost every means of expression the wound in his mouth made speech impossible and his right arm was not available for signs it was only the clearness of his eyes and their response to what was said that showed that his mind was recovering tone and then he seemed only alive to the present and to perceive nothing but what related to his suffering and its alleviations the wistfulness that had shown itself at first was gone and even when he improved enough to establish a language of signs with eye lip or left hand cecily became convinced that he has little or no memory of recent occurrences and that finding himself at home among familiar faces his still dormant perceptions demanded no further explanation  this blank was the most favourable state for his peace and for his recovery and it was of long duration lasting even till he had made so much progress that he could leave his bed and even speak a few words though his weakness was much prolonged by the great difficulty with which he could take nourishment about two winters before cecily had successfully nursed him through a severe attack of smallpox and she thought that he confounded his present state with the former illness when he had had nearly the same attendants and surroundings as at present and that his faculties were not yet roused enough to perceive the incongruity  once or twice he showed surprise at visits from his mother or philip who had then been entirely kept away from him and about christmas he brightened so much and awoke to things about him so much more fully that cecily thought the time of recollection could not be much longer deferred any noise however seemed so painful to him that the christmas festivities were held at combe manor instead of hurst walwyn only after church sir marmaduke and lady thistlewood came in to make him a visit as he sat in a large easychair by his bedroomfire resting after having gone through as much of the rites of the day as he was able for with mr adderlay the room looked very cheerful with the bright woodfire on the open hearth shining on the gay tapestry hangings and the dark wood of the carved bed the evergreendecked window shimmered with sun shine and even the patient leaning back among crimson cushions though his face and head were ghastly enough wherever they were not covered with patches and bandages still had a pleasant smile with lip and eye to thank his stepfather for his cheery wishes of a merry christmas at least one better in health  i did not bring the little wenches berenger lest they should weary you said his mother  berenger looked alarmed and said with the indistinctness with which he always spoke have they caught it are they marked  no no not like you may boy said sir marmaduke sufficiently aware of berengers belief to be glad to keep it up and yet obliged to walk to the window to hide his diversion at the notion of his little girls catching the contagion of swordgashes and bulletwounds dame annora prattled on but they have sent you their christmas gifts by me poor children they have long been busied with them and i fancy lucy did half herself see this kerchief is hemmed by little dolly and here are a pair of bands and cuffs to match that nanny and bessy have been broidering with their choicest stitchery  berenger smile took expressed admiration by gesture and then said in a dreamy uncertain manner methought i had some gifts for them then looking round the room his eye fell on a small brassbound casket which had travelled with him to hold his valuables he pointed to it with a pleased look as sir marmaduke lifted it and placed it on a chair by his side the key a small ornamental brass one was in his purse not far off and lady thistlewood was full of exceeding satisfaction at the unpacking not only of foreign gifts but as she hoped of the pearls cecily meantime stole quietly in to watch that her patient was not overwearied  he was resuming the use of his right arm though it was still weak and stiff and he evidently had an instinct against letting any one deal with that box but himself he tried himself to unlock it and though forced to leave this to sir marmaduke still leant over it when opened as if to prevent his mothers curious glances from penetrating its recesses and allowed no hands near it but his own he first brought out a pretty feather fan saying as he held it to his mother for nan i promised it it was bought at the halles he added more dreamily  then again he dived and brought out a wax medallion of our lady guarded by angels and made the sign that always brought cecily to him he held it up to her with a puzzled smile saying they thought me a mere papist for buying itm de teligny i think it was  they had heard how the good and beloved teligny had been shot down on the roof of his fatherinlaws house by rabid assassins strangers to his person when all who knew him had spared him from love to his gentle nature and the name gave a strange thrill  he muttered something about pedlarmontpipeauand still continued then came a small silver casket diffusing an odour of attar of roseshe leant back in his chairand his mother would have taken it from him supposing him overcome by the scent but he held it fast and shook his head saying for lucybut she must give it herself she gave up any gift for herself for itshe said we needed no lovetokens and he closed his eyes dame annora plunged into the unpacking and brought out a pocketmirror with enamelled cupids in the corner addressed to herself and then came upon berengers own  again came a fringed pair of gloves among the personal jewellery such as gentlemen were wont to wear the rings clasps and brooches he had carried from home dame annoras impatience at last found vent in the exclamation the pearls son i do not see the chaplet of pearls  she had them answered berenger in a matteroffact tone to wear at the masque  she  sir marmadukes great hand choked as it were the query on his wifes lips unseen by her son who as if the words had touched some chord was more eagerly seeking in the box and presently drew out a bow of carnation ribbon with a small piece of paper full of pinholes attached to it at once he carried it to his lips kissed it fervently and then sinking back in his chair seemed to be trying to gather up the memory that had prompted the impulse knitted his brows together and then suddenly exclaimed where is she  his mother tried the last antecedent lucy she shall come and thank you tomorrow  he shook his head with a vehement negative beckoned cecily impatiently and said earnestly is it the contagion is she sick i will go to her  cecily and sir marmaduke both replied with a no no and were thankful though in much suspense at the momentary pause while again he leant back on the cushions looked steadily at the pinholes that formed themselves into the word sweet heart then suddenly began to draw up the loose sleeve of his wrappinggown and unbutton the wristband of his right sleeve his mother tried to help him asking if he had hurt or tired his arm they would have been almost glad to hear that it was so but he shook her off impatiently and the next moment had a view of the freshly skinned over but still wide and gaping gash on his arm he looked for a brief space and said it is a swordcut  truly it is lad said sir marmaduke and a very bad one happily whole is this the first time you have seen it  he did not answer but covered his eyes with his hand and presently burst out again then it is no dream sirhave i been to france  yes my son you have said sir marmaduke gently and with more tenderness than could have been looked for but what passed there is much better viewed as a dream and cast behind your back  berenger had while he spoke taken up the same little mirror where he had once admired himself and as he beheld the scar and plaster that disfigured his face with a fresh start of recollection muttered over barbouiller ce chien de visageay so he said i felt the pistols muzzle touch narcisse has god had mercy on me i prayed him ah le baiser deustacieso he said i was waiting in the dark why did he come instead of her oh father where is she  it was a sore task but sir marmaduke went bravely and bluntly though far from unkindly to the point she remains with her friends in france  there the youths look of utter horror and misery shocked and startled them all and he groaned rather than said left there left to them what have i done to leave her there  come berenger this will not serve said his mother trying to rouse and cheer him you should rather be thankful that when you had been so foully ensnared by their wiles good osbert brought you off with your life away from those bloody doings yes you may thank heaven and osbert for you are the only one of them living now  of whom mother  of all the poor protestants that like you were deluded by the pack of murderers over there whatfancying it would exhilarate him to hear of his own escapeyou knew not that the bloody guise and the paris cutthroats rose and slew every huguenot they could lay hands on why did not the false wench put off your foolish runaway project for the very purpose of getting you into the trap on the night of the massacre  he looked with a piteous appealing glance from her to cecily and sir marmaduke as if in hopes that they would contradict  too true my lad said sir marmaduke it is heavens good mercy that osbert carried you out alive no other protestant left the palace alive but the king of navarre and his cousin who turned renegades  and she is left there he repeated  heed her not my dear boy began his mother you are safe and must forget her illfaith and  berenger seemed scarcely to hear this speechhe held out his hands as if stunned and dizzied and only said or rather indicated let me lie down  his stepfather almost carried him across the room and laid him on his bed where he turned away from the light and shut his eyes but the knot of ribbon and the pinpricked word was still in his hand and his mother longed to take away the token of this false love as she believed it the great clock struck the hour for her to go leave him quiet said cecily gently he can bear no more now i will send over in the evening to let you know how he fares  but that he should be so set on the little bloodthirsty baggage sighed lady thistlewood and then going up to her son she poured out her explanation of being unable to stay as her parents were already at the manor with no better entertainers than lucy philip and the children she thanked him for the gifts which she would take to them with his love all this passed by him as though he heard it not but when leaning down she kissed his forehead and at the same time tried to withdraw the knot of ribbon his fingers closed on it with a grasp like steel so cold were they yet so fast  sir masmaduke lingered a few moments behind her and berenger opening his eyes as if to see whether solitude had been achieved found the kindhearted knight gazing at him with eyes full of tears berry my lad he said bear it like a man i know how hard it is theres not a woman of them all that an honest plain englishman has a chance with when a smoothtongued frenchman comes round her but a man may live a true and honest life however sore his heart may be and god almighty makes it up to him if he faces it out manfully  good sir marmaduke in his sympathy had utterly forgotten both berengers french blood and that he was the son of the very smoothtongued interloper who had robbed his life of its first bloom berenger was altogether unequal to do more than murmur as he held out his hand in response to the kindness you do not know her  ah poor lad sir marmaduke shook his head and left him to cecily  after the first shock berenger never rested till he had made osbert mr adderley and cecily tell him all they knew and asked by name after those whom he had known best at paris alas of all those save such as had been in the ambassadors house there was but one account to give venerable warrior noblehearted youth devoted pastor all alike had perished  this frightful part of the story was altogether new to him he had been probably the earliest victim in the louvre as being the special object of private malice which had contrived to involve him in the general catastrophe and his own recollections carried him only to the flitting of lights and ringing of bells that has made him imagine that an alarm of fire would afford a good opportunity of escape if she would but come a cloaked figure had approachedhe had held out his armsmet that deadly strokeheard the words hissed in his ear  he owned that for some time past strange recollections had been flitting though his minda perpetual unsatisfied longing for and expectation of his wife and confused impressions of scenes and people had harassed him perpetually even when he could not discern between dreams and reality but knowing that he had been very ill he had endeavoured to account for everything as delirious fancies but had become increasingly distressed by their vividness confusion and want of outward confirmation at last these solid tokens and pledges from that time had brought certainty back and with it the harmony and clearness of his memory and the strong affection that even his oblivion had not extinguished now recurred in all its warmth to its object  four months had passed as he now discovered since that night when he had hoped to have met euctacie and she must be believing him dead his first measure on the following day when he had been dressed and seated in his chair was to send for his casket and with his slow stiff arm write thus  mon coeur my own sweethearthast thou thought me dead and thyself deserted osbert will tell thee all and why i can scarce write trust thyself to him to bring to me i shall be whole seeing thee or if thou canst not come with him write or send me the least token by him and i will come and bear thee home so soon as i can put foot in stirrup would that i could write all that is in my heart                                              thy husband   it was all that either head or hand would enable him to say but he had the fullest confidence in landry osbert who was one of the few who understood him at half a word he desired osbert to seek the lady out wherever she might be whether still at court or in a convent convey the letter to her if possible and if she could by any means escape obtain from chateau leurre such an escort as she could come to england with if as was too much to be feared she was under too close restraint osbert should send intelligence home as he could readily do through the ambassadors household and berenger trusted by that time to be able to take measures for claiming her in person  osbert readily undertook everything but supplies for his journey were needed and there was an absolute commotion in the house when it was known that berenger had been writing to his faithless spouse and wishing to send for her lord walwyn came up to visit his grandson and explain to him with much pity and consideration that he considered such a step as vain and only likely to lead to further insult berengers respect forced him to listen without interruption and though he panted to answer it was a matter of much difficulty for the old lord was becoming deaf and could not catch the indistinct agitated words  my lord she is innocent as day  ah anan boy  i pledge my life on her love and innocence  love yes my poor boy but if she be unworthyeh cecily what says he  he is sure of her innocence sir  that is of course but my dear lad you will soon learn that even a gentle good woman who has a consciencekeeper is too apt to think her very sense of right ought to be sacrificed to what she calls her religionwhat is it what is he telling you cecily  she was ready to be one of us berenger said with a great effort to make it clear  ah a further snare poor child the very softest of them become the worst deceivers and the kindred who have had the charge of her all their life could no doubt bend her will  sir said berenger finding argument impossible if you will but let me dispatch osbert her answer will prove to you what she is  there is something in that said lord walwyn when he had heard it repeated by cecily it is of course needful that both she and her relations should be aware of berengers life and i trow nothing but the reply will convince him  convince him muttered berenger oh that i could make him understand what a wretch i am to have no voice to defend her  what said the old lord again  only that i could speak sir you should know why it is sacrilege to doubt her  ah well we will not wound you my son while talk is vain you shall have the means of sending your groom if thus you will set your mind at rest though i had rather have trusted to walsinghams dealing i will myself give him a letter to sir francis to forward him on his way and should the young lady prove willing to hold to her contract and come to you here i will pray him to do everything to aid her that may be consistent with his duty in his post  this was a great and wonderful concession for lord walwyn and berenger was forced to be contented with it though it galled him terribly to have eustacie distrusted and be unable to make his vindication even heard or understood as well as to be forced to leave her rescue and even his own explanation to her to a mere servant  this revival of his memory had not at all conduced to his progress in recovery his brain was in no state for excitement or agitation and pain and confusion were the consequence and were counteracted after the practice of the time by profuse bleedings which prolonged his weakness the splintered state of the jaw and roof of the moth likewise produced effects that made him suffer severely and deprived him at times even of the small power of speech that he usually possessed and though he had set his heart upon being able to start for paris so soon as osberts answer should arrive each little imprudence he committed in order to convince himself of his progress threw him back so seriously that he was barely able to walk downstairs to the hall and sit watchingwatching so that it was piteous to see himthe gates of the courtyard but the time that on a cold march day a booted and spurred courier not osbert entered by them  he sprang up and faster than he had yet attempted to move met the man in the hall and demanded the packet it was a large one done up in canvas and addressed to the right honourable and worshipful sir william baron walwyn of hurst walwyn and he had further to endure the delay of carrying it to his grandfathers library which he entered with far less delay and ceremony than was his wont sit down berenger said the old man while addressing himself to the fastenings and the permission was needed for he could hardly have stood another minute the covering contained a letter to lord walwyn himself and a packet addressed to the baron de ribaumont which his trembling fingers could scarcely succeed in cutting and tearing open  how shall it be told what the contents of the packet were lord walwyn reading on with much concern but little surprise was nevertheless startled by the fierce shout with which berenger broke out  a lie a lie forged in hell and then seizing the parchment was about to rend it with all the force of passion when his grandfather seizing his hand said in his calm authoritative voice patience my poor son  how how should i have patience when they send me such poisoned lies as these of my wife and she is in the power of the villains grandfather i must go instantly  let me know what you have heard said lord walwyn holding him feebly indeed but with all the impressive power and gravity of his years  falsehoods said berenger pushing the whole mass of papers over to him and then hiding his head between his arms on the table  lord walwyn finished his own letter first walsingham wrote with much kind compassion but quite decisively he had no doubt that the ribaumont family had acted as one wheel in the great plot that had destroyed all the heads of protestant families and swept away among others as they had hoped the only scion of the rival house the old chevalier de ribaumont had he said begun by expressing sorrow for the mischance that had exposed his brave young cousin to be lost in the general catastrophe and he had professed proportionate satisfaction on hearing of the young mans safety but the ambassador believed him to have been privy to his sons designs and whether mdlle de nid de merle herself had been a willing agent or not she certainly had remained in the hands of the family the decree annulling the marriage had been published the lady was in a convent in anjou and narcisse de ribaumont had just been permitted to assume the title of marquis de nid de merle and was gone into anjou to espouse her sir francis added a message of commiseration for the young baron but could not help congratulating his old friend on having his grandson safe and free from these inconvenient ties  berengers own packet contained in the first place a copy of the cassation of the marriage on the ground of its having been contracted when the parties were of too tender age to give their legal consent and its having been unsatisfied since they had reached ecclesiastical years for lawful contraction of wedlock  the second was one of the old chevaliers polite productions he was perfectly able to ignore berengers revocation of his application for the separation since the first letter had remained unanswered and the kings peremptory commands had prevented berenger from taking any open measures after his return from montpipeau thus the old gentleman after expressing due rejoicing at his dear young cousins recovery and regret at the unfortunate mischance that had led to his confounded with the many suspected huguenots proceeded as if matters stood exactly as they had been before the pallmall party and as if the decree that he enclosed were obtained in accordance with the young barons intentions he had caused it to be duly registered and both parties were at liberty to enter upon other contracts of matrimony the further arrangements which berenger had undertaken to sell his lands in normandy and his claim on the ancestral castle in picardy should be carried out and deeds sent for his signature so soon as he should be of age in the meantime the chevalier courteously imparted to his fair cousin the marriage of his daughter mademoiselle diane de ribaumont with m le comte de selinville which had taken place on the last st martins day and of his niece mademoiselle eustacie de ribaumont de nid de merle with his son who had received permission to take her fathers title of marquis de nid de merle the wedding was to take place at bellaise before the end of the cardinal and would be concluded before this letter came to hand  lastly there was an ill written and spelt letter running somewhat thus  monseigneuryour faithful servant hopes that monsieur le baron will forgive him for not returning since i have been assured by good priests that it is not possible to save my soul in a country of heretics i have done everything as monsieur commanded i have gone down into anjou and have had the honour to see the young lady to whom monsieur le baron charged me with a commission and i delivered to her his letter whereupon the lady replied that she thanked m le baron for the honour he had done her but that being on the point of marriage to m le marquis de nid de merle she did not deem it fitting to write to him nor had she any tokens to send him save what he had received on the st barthelemy midnight they might further his suit elsewhere these monsieur were her words and she laughed as she said them so gaily that i thought her fairer than ever i have prevailed with her to take me into her service as intendant of the chateau de nid de merle knowing as she does my fidelity to the name of ribaumont and so trusting monseigneur will pardon me for what i do solely for the good of my soul i will ever pray for his welfare and remain                                 his faithful menial and valet                                          landry osbert  the result was only what lord walwyn had anticipated but he was nevertheless shocked at the crushing weight of the blow his heart was full of compassion for the youth so cruelly treated in these his first years of life and as much torn in his affections as mangled in person after a pause while he gathered up the sense of the letters he laid his hand kindly on his grandsons arm and said this is a woeful budget my poor son we will do our best to help you to bear it  the only way to bear it said berenger lifting up his face is for me to take horse and make for anjou instantly she will hold out bravely and i may yet save her  madness said his grandfather you have then not read your fellows letter  i read no letter from fellow of mine yonder is a vile forgery narcisses own most likely no one else would have so profaned her as to put such words into her mouth my dear faithful fosterbrotherhave they murdered him  can you point to any proof that it is forged said lord walwyn aware that handwriting was too difficult an art and far too crabbed among persons of osberts class for there to be any individuality of penmanship  it is all forged said berenger it is as false that she could frame such a message as that poor osbert would leave me  these priests have much power over the conscience began lord walwyn but berenger interrupting his grandfather for the first time in his life cried no priest could change her whole nature oh my wife my darling what may they not be inflicting on her now sir i must go she may be saved the deadly sin may be prevented  this is mere raving berenger said lord walwyn not catching half what he said and understanding little more than his resolution to hasten in quest of the lady you who have not mounted a horse nor walked across the pleasance yet  my limbs should serve me to rescue her or they are worth nothing to me  lord walwyn would have argued that he need not regret his incapacity to move since it was no doubt already too late but berenger burst forthshe will resist she will resist to the utmost even if she deems me dead tortures will not shake her when she knows i live i must prepare and he started to his feet  grandson said lord walwyn laying a hand on his arm listen to me you are in not state to judge for yourself i therefore command you to desist from this mad purpose  he spoke gravely but berenger was disobedient for the first time my lord he said you are but my grandfather she is my wife my duty is to her  he had plucked his sleeve away and was gone before lord walwyn had been able to reason with him that there was no wife in the case a conclusion at which the old statesman would not have arrived had he known of the ceremony at montpipeau and all that had there passed but not only did berenger deem himself bound to respect the kings secret but conversation was so difficult to him that he had told very little of his adventures and less to lord walwyn than any one else in effect his grandfather considered this resolution of going to france as mere frenzy and so it almost was not only on the score of health and danger but because as a ward he was still so entirely under subjection that his journey could have been hindered by absolutely forcible detention and to this lord walwyn intended to resort unless the poor youth either came to a more rational mind or became absolutely unable to travel  the lastas he had apprehendedcame to pass only too surely the very attempt to argue and to defend eustacie was too much for the injured head and long before night berenger full believed himself on the journey acted over its incidents and struggled wildly with difficulties all the time lying on his bed with the old servants holding him down and cecily listening tearfully to his ravings  for weeks longer he was to lie there in greater danger than ever he only seemed soothed into quiet when cecily chanted those old latin hymns of her benedictine rule and thenwhen he could speak at allhe showed himself to be in imagination praying in eustacies convent chapel sure to speak to her when the service should be over     chapter xv notredame de bellaise    there came a man by middle day he spied his sport and went away and brought the king that very night and brake my bower and slew my knight                        the border widows lament   footnote bellaise is not meant for a type of all nunneries but of the condition to which many of the lesser ones had come before the general reaction and purification of the seventeenth century   that same latin hymn which cecily st john daily chanted in her own chamber was due from the choir of cistercian sisters in the chapel of the convent of our lady at bellaise in the bocage of anjou but there was a convenient practice of lumping together the entire night and forenoon hours at nine oclock in the morning and all the evening ones at compline so that the sisters might have undisturbed sleep at night and entertainment by day bellaise was a very comfortable little nunnery which only received richly dowered inmates and was therefore able to maintain them in much ease though without giving occasion to a breath of scandal founded by a daughter of the first angevin ribaumont it had become a sort of appanage for the superfluous daughters of the house and nothing would more have amazed its present head eustacie barbe de ribaumontconventually known as la mere marie seraphine de stlouis and to the world as madame de bellaisethan to be accused of not fulfilling the intentions of the bienheureuse barbe the foundress or of her patron st bernard  madame de bellaise was a finelooking woman of forty in a high state of preservation owing to the healthy life she had led her eyes were of brilliant beautiful black her complexion had a glow her hairfor she wore it visiblyformed crisp rolls of jetty ringlets on her temples almost hiding her close white cap the heavy thick veil was tucked back beneath the furred purple silk hood that fastened under her chin the white robes of her order were not of serge but of the finest cloth and were almost hidden by a short purple cloak with sleeves likewise lined and edged with fur and fastened on the bosom with a gold brooch her fingers bearing more rings than the signet of her house were concealed in embroidered gauntlets of spanish leather one of them held an ivoryhandled ridingrod the other the reins of the wellfed jennet on which the lady on a fine afternoon late in the carnival was cantering home through the lanes of the bocage after a successful mornings hawking among the wheatears she was attended by a pair of sisters arrayed somewhat in the same style and by a pair of mounted grooms the falconer with his charge having gone home by a footway  the sound of horses feet approaching made her look towards a long lane that came down at right angles to that along which she was riding and slacken her pace before coming to its opening and as she arrived at the intersection she beheld advancing mounted on a little rough pony the spare figure of her brother the chevalier in his home suit so greasy and frayed that only his plumed hat and a rusty plume it was and the old sword at his side showed his high degree  he waved his hand to her as a sign to halt and rode quickly up scarcely giving time for a greeting ere he said sister the little one is not out with you  no truly the little mad thing she is stricter and more headstrong than ever was her preceptress poor monique i had hoped that we should be at rest when that casstete had carried off her scruples to steclaire at lucon but here is this little droll far beyond her without being even a nun  assuredly not the business must be concluded at once she must be married before lent  that will scarce bein her present frame  it must be listen sister here is this miserable alive  her spouse  folly about her spouse the decree from rome has annulled the foolish mummery of her infancy it came a week after the protestant conspiracy and was registered when the norman peasants at chateau leurre showed contumacy it was well for behold our gallant is among his english friends recovering and even writing a billet anon he will be upon our hands in person by the best fortune gillot fell in with his messenger this morning prowling about on his way to the convent and brought him to me to be examined i laid him fat in ward and sent gillot off to ride day and night to bring my son down to secure the girl at once  you will never obtain her consent she is distractedly in love with his memory let her guess at his life and  precisely therefore must we be speedy all paris knows it by this time for the fellow went straight to the english ambassador and i trust my son has been wise enough to set off already for should we wait till after lent monsieur le baron himself might be upon us  poor child you men little heed how you make a woman suffer  how reverend mother you pleading for a heretic marriage that would give our rights to a huguenotwhat say ian english renegade  i plead not brother the injustice towards you must be repaired but i have a certain love for my niece and i fear she will be heartbroken when she learns the truth the poor child  bah the abbess should rejoice in thus saving her soul how if her heretic treated bellaise like the convents of england  no threats brother as a daughter of ribaumont and a mother of the church will i stand by you said the abbess with dignity  and now tell me how it has been with the child i have not seen her since we agreed that the request did but aggravate her you said her health was better since her nurse had been so often with her and that she had ceased from her austerities  not entirely for when first she came in her transports of despair and grief on finding soeur monique removed she extorted from father bonami a sort of hope that she might yet save her husbands i mean the barons soul then truly it was a frenzy of fasts and prayers father bonami has made his profit and so have the fathers of cholletall her money has gone in masses and in alms to purchase the prayers of the poor and she herself fasting on bread and water kneeling barefooted in the chapel till she was transfixed with cold no chaufferette not she obstinate to the last degree tell her she would dieit was the best news one could bring all her desire to be in a more rigid house with soeur monique at lucon at length mere perrine and veronique found her actually fainting and powerless with cold on the chapelfloor and since that time she has been more reasonable there are prayers as much as ever but the fancy to kill herself with fasting has passed she begins to recover her looks nay sometimes i have thought she had an air of hope in her eyes and lips but what know i i have much to occupy me and she persists in shutting herself up with her woman  you have not allowed her any communication from without  mere perrine has come and gone freely but she is nothing no the child could have no correspondence she did indeed write a letter to the queen as you know brother six weeks ago but that has never been answered nor could any letters have harmed you since it is only now that this young man is known to be living  you are right sister no harm can have been done all will go well the child must be wearied with her frenzy of grief and devotion she will catch gladly at an excuse for change a scene or two and she will readily yield  it is true said the abbess thoughtfully that she has walked and ridden out lately she has asked questions about her chateaux and their garrisons i have heard nothing of the stricter convent for many weeks but still brother you must go warily to work  and you sister must show no relenting let her not fancy she can work upon you  by this time the brother and sister were at the gateway of the convent a lay sister presided there but there was no cloture as the strict seclusion of a nunnery was called and the chevalier rode into the cloistered quadrangle as naturally as if he had been entering a secular chateau dismounted at the porch of the hall and followed madame de bellaise to the parlour while she dispatched a request that her niece would attend her there  the parlour had no grating to divide it but was merely a large room furnished with tapestry carved chests chairs and cushions much like other receptionrooms a large cheerful woodfire blazed upon the hearth and there was a certain air of preparation as indeed an ecclesiastical dignity from saumur was expected to sup with the ladies that evening  after some interval spent by the chevalier in warming himself a low voice at the door was heard saying deus vobiscum the abbess answered et cum spiritu tuo and on this monastic substitute for a knock and come in there appeared a figure draped and veiled from head to foot in heavy black so as to look almost like a sable moving cone she made an obeisance as she entered saying you commanded my presence madame  your uncle would speak to you daughter on affairs of moment  at his service i too would speak to him  first then my dear friend said the chevalier let me see you that face must not be muffled any longer from those who love you  she made no movement of obedience until her aunt peremptorily bade her turn back her veil she did so and disclosed the little face so well known to her uncle but less childish in its form and the dark eyes sparkling though at once softer and more resolute  ah my fair niece said the chevalier this is no visage to be hidden i am glad to see it reembellished and it will be lovelier than ever when you have cast off this disguised  that will never be said eustacie  ah we know better my daughter is sending down a counterpart of her own weddingdress for your bride of the mardigras  and who may that bride be said eustacie endeavouring to speak as though it were nothing to her  nay ma petite it is too long to play the ignorant when the bridegroom is on his way from paris  madame said eustacie turning to her aunt you cannot suffer this scandal the meanest peasant may weep her first year of widowhood in peace  listen child there are weighty reasons the duke of anjou is a candidate for the throne of poland and my son is to accompany him thither he must go as marquis de nid de merle in full possession of your estates  let him take them began eustacie who first commits a cowardly murder and then forces himself on the widow he has made  folly child folly said the chevalier who supposed her ignorant of the circumstances of her husbands assassination and the abbess who was really ignorant exclaimedfid donc niece you know not what you say  i know madamei know from an eyewitness said eustacie firmly i know the brutal words that embittered my husbands death and were there no other cause they would render wedlock with him who spoke them sacrilege resolutely and steadily did the young wife speak looking at them with the dry fixed eye to which tears had been denied ever since that eventful night  poor child said the chevalier to his sister she is under the delusion still husband there is none in the case then waving his hand as eustacies face grew crimson and her eyes flashed indignation while her lips parted it was her own folly that rendered it needful to put an end to the boys presumption had she been less willful and more obedient instead of turning the poor lads head by playing at madame we could have let him return to his island fogs but when she encouraged him in contemplating the carrying her away and alienating her and her lands from the true faith there was but one remedyto let him perish with the rest my son is willing to forgive her childish pleasure in a boys passing homage and has obtained the kings sanction to an immediate marriage  which to spare you my dear added the aunt shall take place in our chapel  it shall never take place anywhere said eustacie quietly though with a quiver in her voice no priest will wed me when he has heard me  the dispensation will overcome all scruples said the abbess hear me niece i am sorry for you but it is best that you should know at once that there is nothing in heaven or earth to aid you in resisting your duty  eustacie made no answer but there was a strange halfsmile on her lip and a light in her eye which gave her an air not so much of entreaty as of defiance she glanced from one to the other as if considering but then slightly shook her head what does she mean asked the chevalier and the abbess one of another as with a dignified gesture she moved to leave the room  follow her convince her that she has no hope said the uncle and the abbess moving faster than her wont came up with her at the archway whence one corridor led to the chapel another to her own apartments her veil was down again but her aunt roughly withdrew it saying look at me eustacie i come to warn you that you need not look to tamper with the sisters not one will aid you in your headstrong folly if you cast not off ere suppertime this mockery of mourning you shall taste of that discipline you used to sigh for we have borne with your fancy long enoughyou who are no more a widow than inor wife  wife and widow am i in the sight of him who will protect me said eustacie standing her ground  insolent why did i not excuse this as a childish delusion should i not spurn one who durst lovewhat say inot a heretic merely but the foe of her fathers house  he cried eustacie what had he ever done  he inherited the blood of the traitor baron returned her aunt ever have that recreant line injured us my nephews sword avenged the wrongs of many generations  then said eustacie looking at her with a steady fixed look of inquire you madame labbesse would have neither mercy nor pity for the most innocent offspring of the elder line  girl what folly is this to talk to me of innocence that is not the question the question isobey willingly as my dear daughter or compulsion must be used  my question is answered said eustacie on her side i see that there is neither pity nor hope from you  and with another obeisance she turned to ascend the stairs madame paced back to her brother  what he said you have not yet dealt with her  no brother i never saw a like mood she seems neither to fear nor to struggle i knew she was too true a ribaumont for weak tears and entreaties but fiery little being as once she was i looked to see her force spend itself in passion and that then the victory would have been easy but no she ever looks as if she had some inward resourcesome securityand therefore could be calm i should deem it some huguenot fanaticism but she is a very saint as to the prayers of the church the very torment of our lives  could she escape exclaimed the chevalier who had been considering while his sister was speaking  impossible besides where could she go but the gates shall be closed i will warn the portress to let none pass out without my permission  the chevalier took a turn up and down the room then exclaimed it was very illadvised to let her women have access to her let us have veronique summoned instantly  at that moment however the ponderous carriage of monseigneur with outriders both lay and clerical came trampling up to the archway and the abbess hurried off to her own apartment to divest herself of her huntinggear ere she received her guest and the orders to one of the nuns to keep a watch on her niece were oddly mixed with those to the cook confectioner and butterer  la mere marie saraphine was not a cruel or an unkind woman she had been very fond of her pretty little niece in her childhood but had deeply resented the arrangement which had removed her from her own superintendence to that of the englishwoman besides the uniting to the young baron one whom she deemed the absolute right of narcisse she had received eustacie on her first return with great joy and had always treated her with much indulgence and when the drooping brokenhearted girl came back once more to the shelter of her convent the goodhumoured abbess only wished to make her happy again  but eustacies misery was far beyond the ken of her aunt and the jovial turn of these consolations did but deepen her agony to be congratulated on her release from the heretic assured of future happiness with her cousin and above all to hear berenger abused with all the bitterness of rival family and rival religion tore up the lacerated spirit ill dejected and broken down too subdued to fire up in defence and only longing for the power of indulging in silent grief eustacie had shrunk from her and wrapped herself up in the ceaseless round of masses and prayers in which she was allowed to perceive a glimmering of hope for her husbands soul the abbess ever busy with affairs of her convent or matters of pleasure soon relinquished the vain attempt to console where she could not sympathize trusted that the fever of devotion would wear itself out and left her niece to herself of the seven nuns two were decorously gay like their mother abbess one was a prodigious worker of tapestry two were unrivalled save by one another as confectioners eustacie had been their pet in her younger days now she was out of their reach they tried in turn to comfort her and when she would not be comforted they too felt aggrieved by the presence of one whose austerity reproached their own laxity they resented her disappointment at soeur moniques having been transferred to lucon and they too left her to the only persons whose presence she had ever seemed to relishnamely her maid veronique and veroniques mother her old nurse perrine wife of a farmer about two miles off the woman had been eustacies fostermother and continued to exert over her much of the caressing care of a nurse  after parting with her aunt eustacie for a moment looked towards the chapel then clasping her hands murmured to herself no no speed is my best hope and at once mounted the stairs and entered a room where the large stone crucifix a waxen madonna and the holy water font gave a celllike aspect to the room and a straw pallet covered with sackcloth was on the floor a richly curtained couch driven into the rear as unused  she knelt for a moment before the madonna ave maria be with me and mine oh blessed lady thou hadst to fly with thy holy one from cruel men have thou pity on the fatherless  then going to the door she clapped her hands and as veronique entered she bade her shut and bolt the door and at the same moment began in nervous haste to throw off her veil and unfasten her dress  make haste veronique a dress of thine  all is known then cried veronique throwing up her arms  no but he is comingnarcisseto marry me at oncemardegras  et quoi madame has but to speak the word and it is impossible  and after what my aunt has said i would die a thousand deaths ere speaking that word i asked her veronique she would have vengeance on the most guiltlessthe most guiltlessdo you hearof the norman house never never shall she have the chance come thy striped petticoat  but oh what will madame do where would she go oh it is impossible  first to thy fathers yes i know he has once called it a madness to think of rallying my vassals to protect their lady that was when he heard of it from theethou faint of heartand thy mother i shall speak to him in person now make haste i tell thee girl i must be out of this place before i am watched or guarded she added breathlessly i feel as if each moment i lost might have death upon it and she looked about her like a startled deer  to my fathers ah there it is not so ill but the twilights the length of way sobbed veronique in grievous distress and perplexity oh madame i cannot see you go the mother abbess is good she must have pity oh trust to her  trust did i not trust to my cousin diane never nothing will kill me but remaining in their hands  veronique argued and implored in vain ever since in the height of those vehement austerities by which the bereaved and shattered sufferer strove to appease her wretchedness by the utmost endeavour to save her husbands soul the old fostermother had made known to her that she might thus sacrifice another than herself eustacies elastic heart had begun to revive with all its dauntless strength of will what to her women seemed only a fear was to her only a hope  frank and confiding as was her nature however the cruel deceptions already practiced on her by her own kindred together with the harsh words with which the abbess spoke of berenger had made her aware that no comfort must be looked for in that quarter it was after all perhaps her won instinct and the aunts want of sympathy that withheld her from seeking counsel of any save perrine and her daughter at any rate till she could communicate with the kind young queen to her then eustacie had written entreating that a royal mandate would recall her in time to bestow herself in some trustworthy hands or even in her husbands won norman castle where his heir would be both safe and welcome but time has passedthe whole space that she had reckoned as needful for the going and coming of her messengerallowing for all the obstructions of winter roadsnay he had come back she knew letter was delivered but answer there was none it might yet comeperhaps a royal carriage and escortand day after day had she waited and hoped only tardily admitting the conviction that elisabeth of austria was as powerless as eustacie de ribaumont and meantime revolving and proposing many a scheme that could only have entered the brain of a bravespirited child as she was to appeal to her vassals garrison with them a ruinous old tower in the woods and thence send for aid to the montmorencys to ride to saumur and claim the protection of the governor of the province to make her way to the coast and sail for england to start for paris and throw herself in person on the queens protectionall had occurred to her and been discussed with her two confidantes but the hope of the queens interference together with the exceeding difficulty of acting had hitherto prevented her from taking any steps since no suspicion had arisen in the minds of those about her veronique caring infinitely more for her mistresss health and wellbeing than for the object of eustacies anxieties had always secretly trusted that delay would last till action was impossible and that the discovery would be made only without her being accused of treason in the present stress of danger she could but lament and entreat for eustacies resolution bore her down and besides as she said to herself her lady was after all going to her fosterfather and mother who would make her hear reason and bring her back at once and then there would be no anger nor disgrace incurred the dark muddy length of walk would be the worst of itand bah most likely madame would be convinced by it and return of her own accord  so veronique though not intermitting her protests adjusted her own dress upon her mistressshort striped petticoat black bodice winged turbanlike white cap and a great muffling gray cloth cloak and hook over the head and shouldersthe costume in which veronique was wont to run to her home in the twilight on various errands chiefly to carry her mistresss linen for starching eustacies plain bands and cuffs was mere perrines special pride the wonted bundle therefore now contained a few garments and the money and jewels especially the chaplet of pearls which eustacie regarded as a trust  sobbing and still protesting veronique however engaged that if her lady succeeded in safely crossing the kitchen in the twilight and in leaving the convent she would keep the secret of her escape as long as possible reporting her refusal to appear at supper and making such excuses as might very probably prevent the discovery of her flight till next day  and then said eustacie i will send for thee either to saumur or to the old tower adieu dear veronique do not be frightened thou dost not know how glad i am that the time for doing something is come tomorrow  tomorrow thought veronique as she shut the door before that you will be back here again my poor little lady trembling weeping in dire need of being comforted but i will make up a good fire and shake out the bed ill let her have no more of that villainous palliasse no no let her try her own way and repent of it then when this matter is over she will turn her mind to chevalier narcisse and there will be no more languishing in this miserable hole      chapter xvi the hearths and thickets of the bocage    i winna spare for his tender age    nor yet for his hie kin   but soon as ever he born is he shall mount the gallows pinfause foodrage   dusk was closing in but lamps had not yet been lighted when with a trembling yet almost a bounding heart eustacie stole down the stone staircase leading to a backdooran utterly uncanonical appendage to a nunnery but one much used among the domestic establishment of bellaise  a gleam of red light spread across the passage from the halfopen kitchen door whence issued the savoury steam of the supper preparing for monseigneur eustacie had just cautiously traversed it when the voice of the presiding laysister called out veronique is that you  sister returned eustacie with as much of the angevin twang as she could assume  where are you going  to the orchard farm with this linen  ah it must be but there are strict orders come from madame about nobody going out unreported and you may chance to find the door locked if you do not come back in good time oh and i had wellnight forgot tell your mother to be here early tomorrow madame would speak with her  eustacie assented half stifled by the great throb of her fluttering heart at the sense that she had indeed seized the last moment forth then she stepped how dark waste and lonely the open field looked but her heart did not fail her she could only feel that a captivity was over and the most vague and terrible of her anxieties soothed as she made her way into one of the long shady lanes of the bocage it was nearly dark and very muddy but she had all the familiarity of a native with the way and the farm where she had trotted about in her infancy like a peasants child always seemed like home to her it had been a prime treat to visit it during her time of education at the convent and there was an association of pleasure in treading the path that seemed to bear her up and give her enjoyment in the mere adventure and feeling of escape and liberty she had no fear of the dark nor of the distant barking of dogs but the mire was deep and it was plodding work in those heavy sabots up the lane that led from the convent and the poor child was sorely weary long before she came to the top of the low hill that she used scarcely to know to be rising round at all the stars had come out and as she sat for a few moments to rest on a large stone she saw the lights of the cottage fires in the village below and looking round could also see the many gleams in the convent windows the read firelight in her own room among them she shivered a little as she thought of its glowing comfort but turned her back resolutely tightened her cloak over her head looked up to a glimmer in the watchtower of her own castle far above her on the hill and closed against her and then smiled to herself with hope at the sparkle of a window in a lonely farmhouse among the fields  with fresh vigour she rose and found her way through lane and fieldpath to the paddock where she had so often played here a couple of huge dogs dashed forward with an explosion of barks dying away into low growls as she spoke to them by their names and called aloud on blaise and mere perrine the cottage door was opened the light streamed forth and a mans head in a broad had appeared veronique girl is this an hour to be gadding abroad  blaise do you not know me  it is our lady ah  the next moment the wanderer was seated in the ample wooden chair of the head of the family the farmer and his two stout sons standing before her as their liege lady and mere perrine hanging over her in great anxiety not wholly dispelled by her low girlish laugh partly of exultation at her successful evasion partly of amusement at their wonder and partly too because it was so natural to her to enjoy herself at that hearth that she could not help it a savoury mess from the great caldron that was for ever stewing over the fire was at once fished out for her before she was allowed to explain herself and as she ate with the carved spoon and from the earthenware crock that had been called mademoiselles ever since her babydays perrine chafed and warmed her feet fondled her and assured her as if she were still their spoiled child that they would do all she wished  pierre and tiennot the two sons were sent out to fodder the cattle and keep careful watch for any sounds of pursuers from the convent and blaise in the plenitude of his respects and deference would have followed them but eustacie desired him to remain to give her counsel  her first inquire was after the watchtower she did not care for any discomfort if her vassals would be faithful and hold it out for her till she could send for help to the allies of her husbands house and her eyes glanced as she spoke  but blaise shook his head he had looked at the tower as madame bade but it was all in ruins crumbling away and moreover m le chevalier had put a forester therea grim bad subject who had been in the italian wars and cared neither for saint nor devil except chevalier narcisse indeed even if he had not been there the place was untenable it would only be getting into a trap  count hebert held it out for twelve days against the english said eustacie proudly  ah ah but there were none of your falconets or what call you those cannons then no if madame would present herself as a choice morsel for monsieur le chevalier to snap up that is the place  then came the other plan of getting an escort of the peasants together and riding with them towards the huguenot territories around la rochelle where for her husbands sake eustacie could hardly fail to obtain friends it was the more practicable expedient but blaise groaned over it wondered how many of the farmers could be trusted or brought together and finally expressed his intention of going to consult martin his staunch friend at the next farm meantime madame had better lie down and sleep and madame did sleep in perrines huge boxbedstead with a sweet calm childlike slumber whilst her nurse sat watching her with eyes full of tears of pity and distress the poor young things buoyant hopefulness and absence of all fear seemed to the old woman especially sad and like a sort of want of comprehension of the full peril in which she stood  not till near dawn was eustacie startled from her rest by approaching steps nurse is all ready she cried can we set off are the horses there  no my child it is but my good man and martin who would speak with you do not hasten there is nothing amiss as yet  oh nurse cried eustacie as she quickly arranged the dress in which she had lain down the dear old farm always makes me sleep well this is the first time i have had no dream of the whirling wheel and fiery gates oh is it a token that he is indeed at rest i am so well so strong i can ride anywhere now let them come in and tell me  martin was a younger brisker cleverer man than blaise and besides being a vassal of the young lady was a sort of agent to whom the abbess instructed many of the matters of husbandry regarding the convent lands he stood like blaise bareheaded as he talked to little lady and heard her somewhat peremptorily demand why they had not brought the horses and men for her escort  it was impossible that night explained martin time was needed to bring in the farmhorses and summon the other peasants without whom the roads were unsafe in these times of disorder he and blaise must go round and warn them to be ready a man could not be ready in a wink of the eye as madame seemed to think and the two peasants looked impenetrable in stolidity  laggards that you are cried eustacie petulantly clasping her hands and meantime all will be lost they will be upon me  not so madame it is therefore that i came here said martin deferentially to the little fuming impatient creature madame will be far safer close at hand while the pursuit and search are going on but she must not stay here this farm is the first place they will come to while they will never suspect mine and my good woman lucette will be proud to keep watch for her madame knows that the place is full of shrubs and thickets where one half of an army might spend a fine day in looking for the other  and at night you will get together the men and convoy me asked eustacie eagerly  all in good time madame now she must be off ere the holy mothers be astir i have brought an ass for her to ride  eustacie had no choice but compliance none of the orchard family could go with her as it was needful that they should stay at home and appear as unconcerned as possible but they promised to meet her at the hour and place to be appointed ad if possible to bring veronique  eating a piece of ryebread as she went eustacie in her gray cloak rode under martins guardianship along the deep lanes just budding with spring in the chill dewiness before sunrise she was silent and just a little sullen for she had found stout shrewd martin less easy to talk over than the admiring blaise and her spirit was excessively chafed by the tardiness of her retainers but the sun rose and cleared away all clouds of temper the cocks crew the sheep bleated and fresh morning sounds met her ear and seemed to cheer and fill her with hope and in some compunction for her want of graciousness she thanked martin and praised his ass with a pretty cordiality that would have fully compensated for her displeasure even if the honest man had been sensible of it  he halted under the lee of a barn and gave a low whistle at the sound lucette a brown sturdy young woman with a red handkerchief over her head and another over her shoulders came running round the corner of the barn and whispered eagerly under her breath ah madame madame what an honour kissing eustacies hand with all her might as she spoke but alas i fear madame cannot come into the house the questing brother francoisplague upon himhas taken it into his head to drop in to breakfast i longed to give him the cold shoulder but it might have brought suspicion down  right good woman said martin but what shall madame do it is broad way and no longer safe to run the lanes  give me a distaff said eustacie rising to the occasion i will go to that bushy field and herd the cows  madame was right the husband and wife unwillingly agreed there in her peasant dress in the remote field sloping up into a thick wood she was unlikely to attract attention and though the field was bordered on one side by the lane leading to the road to paris it was separated from it by a steep bank crowned by one of the thick hedgerows characteristic of the bocage  here then they were forced to leave her seated on a stone beneath a thornbush distaff in hand with bread cheese and a pitcher of milk for her provisions and three or four cows grazing before her from the higher ground below the wood of ash and hazel she could see the undulating fields and orchards a few houses and that inhospitable castle of her own  she had spent many a drearier day in the convent than this in the free sun and air with the feeling of liberty and unbounded hopes founded on this first success she told her beads diligently trusting that the tale of devotions for her husbands spirit would be equally made up in the field as in the church and intently all day were her ears and eyes on the alert once lucette visited her to bring her a basin of porridge and to tell her that all the world at the convent was in confusion that messengers had been sent out in all directions and that m le chevalier had ridden out himself in pursuit but they should soon hear all about it for martin was pretending to be amongst the busiest and he would know how to turn them away again much later in the day martin came striding across the field and had just reached her as she sat in the hedgerow when the great dog who followed him pricked his ears and a tramping and jingling was audible in the distance in the lane eustacie held up her finger her eyes dilating  it must be m le chevalier returning madame must wait a little longer i must be at home or they may send out to seek me here and that would be ruin i will return as soon as it is safe if madame will hide herself in the hedgerow  into the hedgerow accordingly crept eustacie cowering close to a hollytree at the very summit of the bank and led by a strange fascination to choose a spot where unseen herself she could gaze down on the party who came clanking along the hollow road beneath nearer nearer they came and she shuddered with more of passion than of fear as she beheld not only her uncle in his best wellpreserved green suit but narcisse muddy with riding though in his court braveries suddenly they came to a halt close beneath her was she detected ah just below was the spot where the road to the convent parted from the road to the farm and as martin had apprehended they were stopping for him the chevalier ordered one of the armed men behind him to ride up to the farm and summon martin to speak with him and then he and his son while waiting under the hollybush continued their conversation  so that is the state of things a fine overthrow quoth narcisse  bah not at all she will soon be in our hands again i have spoken with or written to every governor of the cities she must pass through and not one will abet the little runaway at the first barrier she is ours  et puis  oh we shall have her mild as a sheep eustacie set her teeth every one will be in the same story that her marriage was a nullity she cannot choose but believe and can only be thankful that we overlook the escapade and rehabilitate her  thank you my good uncle almost uttered his unseen auditor  well there is too much land down here to throw away but the affair has become horribly complicated and distasteful  no such thing all the easier she can no longer play the spotless saintget weakminded priests on her sidebe all for strict convents no no her time for that is past shut her up with trustworthy persons from whom she will hear nothing from without and she will understand her case the child it will scarce be born alive or at any rate she need not know whether it is then with no resource no hope what can she do but be too thankful for pardon and as glad to conceal the past as we could wish  eustacie clenched her fist had a pistol been within her reach the speakers tenure of life had been short she was no chastened selfrestrained forgiving saint the poor little thing only a hottempered generous keenlysensitive being wellnigh a child in years and in impulses though with the instincts of a mother awakening within her and of a mother who heard the life of her unborn babe plotted against she was absolutely forced to hold her lips together to repress the sobbing scream of fury that came to her throat and the struggles with her gasping breath the surging of the blood in her ears hindered her from hearing or seeing anything for some seconds though she kept her station by the time her perceptions had cleared themselves martin cap in hand was in the lane below listening deferentially to the two gentlemen who were assuring him that inquiry had been made and a guard carefully set at the fugitive could have passed those or be able to do so she must certainly be hidden somewhere near home and martin had better warn all his friends against hiding her unless they wished to be hung up on the thresholds of their burning farmsteads martin bowed and thought the fellows would know their own interest and mademoiselles better  well said the chevalier we must begin without loss of time my son has brought down a set of fellows here who are trained to ferret out heretics not a runaway weasel cold escape them we will set them on as soon as ever they have taken a bit of supper up there at the chateau and do you come up with us just to show them the way across to leonards thats no unlikely place for her to lurk in as you said this morning good fellow  it was the most remote farm from that of martin and eustacie felt how great were his services even while she flushed with anger to hear him speaking of her as mademoiselle he was promising to follow immediately to the castle to meet ces messieurs there almost as soon as they could arrive but excusing himself from accompanying them by the need of driving home the big bull whom no one else could manage  they consented and rode on martin watched them out of sight then sprang up by some steppingstones in the bank a little below where eustacie sat and came crackling through the boughs to where she was crouching down with fierce glittering eyes and panting breath like a wild animal ready to spring  madame has heard said martin under his breath  if i have heard oh that i were a man to slay them where they stood martin martin you will not betray me some day we will reward you  madame need not have said that to me said martin rather hurt i am only thinking what she can do alas i fear that she must remain in this covert till it is dark for these mens eyes are all on the alert at dark i or lucette will come and find a shelter for her for the night  long long then did eustacie sit muffled in her gray cloak shrinking together to shelter herself from the sunset chill of early spring but shuddering more with horror than with cold as the cruel coldblooded words she had heard recurred to her and feeling as if she were fast within a net every outlet guarded against her and search everywhere yet still with the indomitable determination to dare and suffer to the utmost ere that which was dearer than her own life should come into peril from her enemies  the twilight closed in the stars came out sounds of life died away and still she sat on becoming almost torpid in the cold darkness until at length she heard the low call of lucette madame ahla pauvre madame she started up so stiff that she could hardly more and only guided by the voice to feel her way through the hedgerow in the right direction another moment and lucettes warn arms had received her and she was guided scarce knowing how or where in cautious silence to the farmyard and into the house where a most welcome sight a huge fire blazed cheerfully on the hearth and martin himself held open the door for her the other occupants of the kitchen were the sleeping child in its wooden cradle some cocks and hens upon the rafters and a big sheepdog before the fire  the warmth and the chicken that lucette had killed and dressed brought the colour back to the exhausted wanderers cheek and enabled her again to hold council for her safety it was plain as martin had found in conversation with the menatarms that precautions had been taken against her escaping in any of the directions where she might hope to have reached friends alone she could not go and any escort sufficient to protect her would assuredly be stopped at the first town besides which collecting it in secret was impossible under present circumstances and it would be sure to be at once overtaken and demolished by the chevalier narcisses wellarmed followers martin therefore saw no alternative but for her to lurk about in such hidingplaces as her faithful vassals could afford her until the search should blow over and the vigilance of her uncle and cousin relax hope the highspirited hope of early youth looked beyond to indefinite but infinite possibility anything was better than the shame and horror of yielding and eustacie trusted herself with all her heart for the present fancying she knew not what the future  indeed the vendean fidelity has often been tested and she made full proof of it among the lanes copses and homesteads of her own broad lands the whole country was a network of deep lanes sunk between impenetrable hedgerows inclosing small fields orchards and thickets and gently undulating in low hills and shallow valleys interspersed with tall waspwaisted windmills airily waving their arms on the top of lofty masts it was partitioned into small farms inhabited by a simplehearted peasantry religious and diligent with a fair amount of rural wealth and comfort their love for their lords was loyally warm and eustacie monopolized it from their detestation of her uncles exactions they would risk any of the savage punishments with which they were threatened for concealing her and as one by one it was needful to take them into the secret so as to disarm suspicion and she was passed from one farm to another each proved his faithful attachment and though himself repaid by her thankful smile and confiding manner  the chevalier and his son searched vigorously on the slightest suspicion they came down to the farm closed up the outlets threatened the owners turned out the house and the very place they had last searched would become her quarters on the next night messages always had warned her in time intelligence was obtained by martin who contrived to remain a confidential agent and warnings were dispatched to her by many a strange messengerby little children by old women or even by the village innocent  the most alarming days were those when she was not the avowed object of the chase but when the pursuit of game rendered the coverts in the woods and fields unsafe and the hounds might lead to her discovery on one of these occasions martin locked her up in the great hayloft of the convent where she could actually hear the chants in the chapel and distinguish the chatter of the laysisters in the yard another time in conjunction with the sacristan he bestowed her in the great seigneurial tribune or squires pew in the village church a tall carved box where she was completely hidden and the only time when she had failed to obtain warning beforehand she stood kneading bread at a tub in martins cottage while the hunt passed by and a manatarms looked in and questioned the master on the last traces of the runaway  it was seldom possible to see mere perrine who was carefully watched under the conviction that she must know where her nursling was but one evening veronique ventured up to martins farm trusting to tidings that the gentlemen had been eustacies only secure harbour and when in a bright evening gleam of the setting sun from beneath the clouds veronique came in sight of her lady the queens favourite it was to see her leading by a string a little shaggy cow with a bell round its neck her gray cloak huddled round her though dank with wet a long lock of black hair streaming over her brow her garments clinging with damp her bare ankles scratched with thorns her heavy sabots covered with mire her cheeks pale with cold and wet  the contrast overwhelmed poor veronique she dropped on her knees sobbing as if her heart would break and declaring that this was what the abbess had feared her lady was fast killing herself  hush veronique said eustacie that is all folly i am wet and weary now but oh if you knew how much sweeter to me life is now than it was shut up down there with my fears see and she held up a bunch of purple pasqueflowers and woodsorrel this is what i found in the wood growing out of a rugged old dead root and just by sheltered by the threefold leaves of the alleluiaflower was a birds nest the motherbird on her eggs watching me with the wise black eye that saw i would not hurt her and it brought back the words i had heard long ago of the good god caring for the sparrows and i knew he would care the more for me and mine because i have not where to lay my head  alas sobbed veronique now she is getting to be a saint outright she will be sure to die ah madamedear madame do but listen to me if you did but know how madame de bellaise is afflicting herself on your account she sent for meah do not be angry dear lady  i wish to hear nothing about her said eustacie  nay listen de graceone moment madame she has wept she has feared for you all the laysisters say so she takes no pleasure in hawking nor in visiting and she did not eat more than six of soeur bernardines best conserves she does nothing but watch for tidings of madame and she sent for me as i told you and conjured me if i knew where you were or had any means of finding out to implore you to trust to her she will swear on all the relics in the chapel never to give a hint to messieurs les chevaliers if only you would trust her and not slay yourself with all this dreadful wandering  never said eustacie she said too much  ah but she declares that had she known the truth she never would have said that ah yes madame the abbess is good and veronique holding her mistresss cloak to secure a hearing detailed the abbess plan for lodging her niece in secret apartments within the thickness of the convent walls where mere perrine could be with her and every sacred pledge should be given that could remove her fears  and could they make me believe them so that the doubt and dread would not kill me in themselves said eustacie  but it is deathcertain death as it is oh if madame would hear reasonbut she is headstrong she will grieve when it is too late  listen veronique i have a far better plan the sacristan has a sister who weaves red handkerchiefs at chollet she will receive me and keep me as long as there is need martin is to take me in his cart when he carries the hay to the garrison i shall be well hidden and within reach of your mother and then when my son is once comethen all will be well the peasants will rise in behalf of their young lord though not for a poor helpless woman no one will dare to dispute his claim when i have appealed to the king and then veronique you shall come back to me and all will be well  veronique only began to wail aloud at her mistress obstinacy martin came up and rudely silenced her and said afterwards to his wife have a care that girl hasi verily believebetrayed her lady once and if she do not do so again from pure pity and faintness of heart i shall be much surprised     chapter xvii the ghosts of the templars     tis said as through the aisles they passed  they heard strange voices on the blast  and through the cloister galleries small  which at midheight thread the chancel wall  loud sobs and laughter louder ran  and voices unlike the voice of man  as if the fiends kept holiday                     scott lay of the last minstrel   ill news martin i see by your look cried eustacie starting to her feet from the heap of straw on which she was sitting in his cowhouse one early april day about seven weeks since her evasion from the convent  not so i hope madame but i do not feel at ease monsieur has not sent for me nor told me his plans for the morrow and i much doubt me whether that bode not a search here now i see a plan provided madame would trust herself to a huguenot  they would guard me for my husbands sake  and could madame walk half a league as far as the grange du temple there live matthieu rotrou and his wife who have they say baffled a hundred times the gendarmes who sought their ministers no one ever found a pastor they say when rotrou had been of the congregation and if they can do so much for an old preacher with a long tongue surely they can for a sweet young lady and if they could shelter her just for tomorrow till the suspicion is over then would i come for madame with my cart and carry her into chollet among the trusses of hay as we had fixed  eustacie was already tying her cloak and asking for lucette but she was grieved to hear that martin had sent her to vespers to disarm suspicion and moreover that he meant not to tell her of his new device the creature is honest enough he said but the way to be safe with women is not to let them know  he cut short all messages and expressions of gratitude and leading eustacie to a small stream he made her creep along its course with her feet in the water so as to be sheltered by the boughs that hung over the banks while he used his ling strides to enable him to double back and enter into conversation with passersby quite of the track of the grange du temple but always telling her where he should join her again and leaving with her the great dog whom she had come to regard as a friend and protector leaving the brook he conducted her beneath hedges and by lonely woodland paths beyond the confines of her own property to a secluded valley so shut in by wooded hills that she had not been aware of its existence through an extensive orchard she at length when nearly spent with the walk beheld the cluster of stone buildings substantial as the erections of religious orders were wont to be  martin found a seat for her where she might wait while he went on alone to the house and presently returned with both the good people of the farm they were more offhand and less deferential than were her own people but were full of kindliness they were middleaged folk most neatly clad and with a grave thoughtful look about them as if life were a much heavier charge to them than to their lighthearted neighbours  a fair day to you madame said the farmer doffing his wideflapped hat i am glad to serve a sufferer for the truths sake  my husband was faltered eustacie  ah la pauvre cried the good woman pressing forward as she saw how faint heated and exhausted was the wanderer come in ma pauvrette only a bride at the bartholomew alas there lean on me my dear  to be tutoyee by the fermiere rotrou was a shock yet the kind manner was comfortable and eustacie suffered herself to be led into the farmhouse where as the dame observed she need not fear chancecomers for they lived much to themselves and no one would be about till their boy robinet came in with the cows she might rest and eat there in security and after that they would find a hidingplace for hersafe as the horns of the altarfor a night or two only for two nights at most  nor do i ask more said eustacie then martin will come for me  ah i or blaise or whichever of us can do it with least suspicion  she shall meet you here added rotrou  all right good man i understand it is best i should not know where you hide her those rogues have tricks that make it as well to know nothing farewell madame i commend you to all the saints till i come for you on monday morning  eustacie gave him her hand to kiss and tried to thank him but somehow her heart sank and she felt more lonely than ever when entirely cast loose among these absolute strangers than amongst her own vassals even the farmkitchen large stonebuilt and scrupulously clean seemed strange and dreary after the little smoky earthbuilt livingrooms in which her peasantry were content to live and she never had seemed to herself so completely desolate but all the time she was so wearied out with her long and painful walk that she had no sooner taken some food than she began to doze in her chair  father said the good wife we had better take la pauvrette to her rest at once  ah must i go any farther sighed eustacie  it is but a few fields beyond the yard ma petite said the good woman consolingly and it will be safer to take you there ere we need a light  the sun had just set on a beautiful evening of a spring that happily for eustacie had been unusually warm and mild when they set forth the dame having loaded her husband with a roll of bedding and herself taking a pitcher of mild and a loaf of bread whilst eustacie as usual carried her own small parcel of clothes and jewels the way was certainly not long to any one less exhausted than she it was along a couple of fields and then through a piece of thicket where rotrou held back the boughs and his wife almost dragged her on with kind encouraging words till they came up to a stone ivycovered wall and coasting along it to a tower evidently a staircase turret here rotrou holding aside an enormous bush of ivy showed the foot of a winding staircase and his wife assured her that she would not have far to climb  she knew where she was now she had heard of the old refectory of the knights templars partly demolished by the hatred of the people upon the abolition of the order it had ever since lain waste and had become the centre of all the ghostly traditions of the country the locality of all the most horrid tales of revenants told under the breath at dame perrines hearth or at recreation hour at bellaise her courage was not proof against spiritual terrors she panted and leant against the wall as she faintly exclaimed the templethereand alone  nay lady methought as monsieur votre mari knew the true light you would fear no vain terror nor power of darkness  should these peasantsthese villeinsbe bold and see the descendant of the bravest of knights the daughter of the house of ribaumont afraid she rallied herself and replied manfully i fear not no but then womanfully but it is the temple it is haunted tell me what i must expect  i tell you truly madame said rotrou none whom i have sheltered here have seen aught on the faith of a christian no evil spiritno ghosthas ever alarmed them but they were fortified by prayer and psalm  i do pray i have a psalmbook said eustacie and she added to herself no they shall never see that i fear after all revenants can do nothing worse than scare one they cannot touch one the saints and angels will not let themand my uncle would do much worse  but to climb those winding stairs and resign herself to be left alone with the templars for the night was by far the severest trial that had yet befallen the poor young fugitive as her tire feet dragged up the crumbling steps her memory reverted to the many tales of the sounds heard by night within those wallschurch chants turning into diabolical songs and bewildered travelers into thickets and morasses where they had been found in the morning shuddering as they told of a huge white monk with clanking weapons and a burning cross of fire printed on his shoulder and breast who stood on the walls and hurled a shrieking babe into the abyss were such spectacles awaiting her must she bear them and could her endurance hold out our lady be her aid and spare her in her need  at the top of the stairs she found rotrous hand ready to help her out on a stone floor quite dark but thickly covered as she felt and smelt with trusses of hay between which a glimmering light showed a narrow passage a few steps guided by rotrous hand brought her out into light again and she found herself in a large chamber with the stone floor broken away in some places and with a circular window thickly veiled with ivy but still admitting a good deal of evening light  it was in fact a chamber over the vaulted refectory of the knights the walls and vaults still standing in their massive solidity must have tempted some peasant or mayhap some adventurer rudely to cover in the roof which had of course been stripped of its leading and thus in the unsuspected space to secure a hidingplace often for less innocent commodities than the salt which the iniquitous and oppressive gabelle had always led the french peasant to smuggle ever since the days of the first valois the room had a certain appearance of comfort there was a partition across it a hearth with some remains of woodashes a shelf holding a plate cup lamp and a few other necessaries and altogether the aspect of the place was so unlike what eustacie had expected that she almost forgot the templar as she saw the dame begin to arrange a comfortablelooking couch for her wearied limbs yet she felt very unwilling to let them depart and even ventured on faltering out the inquiry whether the good woman could not stay with hershe would reward her largely  it is for the love of heaven madame not for gain said nanon rotrou rather stiffly if you were ill or needed me all must then give way but for me to be absent this evening would soon be reported around the village down there for there are many who would find occasion against us but by way of consolation they gave her a whistle and showed her that the window of their cottage was much nearer to a loopholeslit looking towards the east than she had fancied the whistle perpetrated a mist unearthly screech a good deal like that of an owl but more discordant and nanon assured her that the sound would assuredly break her slumbers and bring her in a few minutes at any moment of need in fact the noise was so like the best authenticated accounts of the shrieks indulged in by the spirits of the temple that eustacie had wit enough to suspect that it might be the foundation of some of the stories and with that solace to her alarms she endured the departure of her hosts nanon promising a visit in the early morning  the poor child was too weary to indulge in many terrors the beneficent torpor of excessive fatigue was upon her happily bringing slumberous oblivion instead of feverish restlessness she strove to repeat her accustomed orisons but sleep was too strong for her and she was soon lying dreamlessly upon the clean homely couch prepared for her  when she awoke it was with a start the moon was shining in through the circular window making strange white shapes on the floor all quivering with the shadows of the ivy sprays it looked strange and eerie enough at the moment but she understood it the next and would have been reassured if she had not become aware that there was a low sound a tramp tramp below her gracious saints the templar have mercy on me oh i was too sleepy to pray guard me from being driven wild by fright she sat upright with widespread eyes and finding that she herself was in the moonlight through some opening in the roof she took refuge in the darkest corner though aware as she crouched there that if this were indeed the templar concealment would be vain and remembering suddenly that she was out of reach of the loopholewindow  and therewith there was a tired sound in the tread as if the templar found his weird a very length one then a long heavy breath with something so essentially human in its sound that the fluttering heart beat more steadily if reason told her that the living were more perilous to her than the dead yet feeling infinitely preferred them it might be nanon rotrou after all then how foolish to be crouching there in a fright it was rustling through the hay nono nanon it is a male figure it has a long cloak on ah it is in the moonlightsilver hairsilver beard the templar fascinated with dismay yet calling to mind that no ghost has power unless addressed she sat still crossing herself in silence but unable to call to mind any prayer or invocation save a continuous ave mary and trying to restrain her gasping breath lest if he were not the templar after all he might discover her presence  he moved about took off his cloak laid it down near the hay then his cap not a helmet after all and there was no fiery cross  he was in the gloom again and she heard him moving much as though he were pulling down the hay to form a bed did ghosts ever do anything so sensible if he were an embodied spirit would it be possible to creep past him and escape while he lay asleep she was almost becoming familiarized with the presence and the supernatural terror was passing off into a consideration of resources when behold he was beginning to sing to sing was the very way the ghosts began ere they came to their devilish outcries our lady keep it from bringing frenzy but hark hark it was not one of the chants it was a tune and words heard in older times of her life it was the evening hymn that the little husband and wife had been wont to sing to the baron in the chateau de leurremarots version of the 4th psalm                       plus de joie mest donnee                       par ce moyen o dieu treshaut                       que nont ceux qui ont grand annee                       de froment et bonne vinee                       dhuile et tout ce quil leur faut  if it had indeed been the ghostly chant perhaps eustacie would not have been able to help joining it as it was the familiar home words irresistibly impelled her to mingle her voice scarce knowing what she did in the verse                      si quen paix et surete bonne                      coucherai et reposerai                      car seigneur ta bonte tout ordonne                      et elle seule espoir me donne                      que sur et seul regnant serai  the hymn died away in its low cadence and then ere eustacie had had time to think of the consequences of thus raising her voice the newcomer demanded  is there then another wanderer here  ah sir pardon me she exclaimed i will not long importune you but only till morning lightonly till the fermiere rotrou comes  if matthieu and anne rotrou placed you here then all is well replied the stranger fear not daughter but tell me are you one of my scattered flock or one whose parents are known to me then as she hesitated i am isaac gardonescaped alas alone from the slaughter of the barthelemy  master gardon cried eustacie oh i know o sir my husband loved and honoured you  your husband  yes sir le baron de ribaumont  that fair and godly youth my dear old patrons son youyou but with a shade of doubt almost of dismay the boy was weddedwedded to the heiress  yes yes i am that unhappy one we were to have fled together on that dreadful night he came to meet me to the louvreto his doom she gasped out nearer to tears than she had ever been since that time such a novelty was it to her to hear berenger spoken of in kind or tender terms and in her warmth of feeling she came out of her corner and held our her hand to him  alas poor thing said the minister compassionately heaven has tried you sorely had i known of your presence here i would not have entered but i have been absent long and stole into my lair here without disturbing the good people below forgive the intrusion madame  the minister replied warmly that surely persecution was a brotherhood even had she not been the window of one he had loved and lamented  ah sir it does me good to hear you say so  and therewith eustacie remembered the hospitalities of her loft she perceived by the tones of the old mans voice that he was tired and probably fasting and she felt about for the milk and bread with which she had been supplied it was a most welcome refreshment though he only partook sparingly and while he ate the two so strangely met came to a fuller knowledge of one anothers circumstances  master isaac gardon had it appeared been residing at paris in the house of the watchmaker whose daughter had been newly married to his son but on the fatal eve of st bartholomew he had been sent for to pray with a sick person in another quarter of the city the catholic friends of the invalid were humane and when the horrors began not only concealed their kinsman but almost forcibly shut up the minister in the same cellar with him and thus most reluctantly had he been spared from the fate that overtook his son and daughterinlaw a lone and wellnight brokenhearted man he had been smuggled out of the city and had since that time been wandering from one to another of the many scattered settlements of huguenots in the northern part of france who being left pastorless welcomed visits from the minister of their religion and passed him on from one place to another as his stay in each began to be suspected by the authorities he was now on his way along the west side of france with no fixed purpose except so far as since heaven had spared his life when all that made it dear had been taken from him he resigned himself to believe that there was yet some duty left for him to fulfil  meantime the old man was wearied out and after due courtesies had passed between him and the lady in the dark he prayed long and fervently as eustacie could judge from the intensity of the low murmurs she heard and then she heard him with a heavy irrepressible sigh lie down on the couch of hay he had already prepared for himself and soon his regular breathings announced his sound slumbers she was already on the bed she had so precipitately quitted and not a thought more did she give to the templars living or dead even though she heard an extraordinary snapping and hissing and in the dawn of the morning saw a white weird thing like a huge moth flit in through the circular window take up its station on a beam above the hay and look down with the brightest roundest eyes she had ever beheld let owls and bats come where they would she was happier than she had been for months compassion for herself was plentiful enough but to have heard berenger spoken of with love and admiration seemed to quiet the worst ache of her lonely heart     chapter xviii the moonbeam         she wandered east she wandered west        she wandered out and in      and at last into the very swines stythe        the queen brought forth a sonfause foodrage   the morrow was sunday and in the old refectory in the late afternoon a few huguenots warned by messages from the farm met to profit by one of their scanty secret opportunities for public worship the hum of the prayer and discourse of the pastor rose up through the broken vaulting to eustacie still lying on her bed for she had been much shaken by the fatigues of the day and alarm of the night and bitterly grieved too by a message which nanon conveyed to her that poor martin was in no state to come for her in the next day but he and his wife having been seized upon by narcisse and his men and so savagely beaten in order to force from them a confession of her hidingplace that both were lying helpless on their bed and could only send an entreaty by the trustworthy fool that rotrou would find means of conveying madame into chollet in some cart of hay or corn in which she could be taken past the barriers  but this was not to be good nanon had sacrificed the sermon to creep up to eustacie and when the congregation were dispersing in the dusk she stole down the stairs to her husband and a few seconds after he was hurrying as fast as detours would allow him to blaises farm an hour and a half later dame perrine closely blindfolded for the last mile was dragged up the spiral staircase and ere the bandage was removed heard eustacies voice with a certain cheeriness say oh nurse my son will soon come  the full moon gave her light and the woman durst not have any other save from the woodfire that nanon had cautiously lighted and screened the moonshine was still supreme when some time later a certain ominous silence and halfwhisper between the two women at the hearth made eustacie with a low cry of terror exclaim nurse nurse what means this oh he lives i know he lives perrine i command you tell me  living oh yes my love my lady answered perrine returning towards her fair and perfect as the day be not disquieted for a moment  i willi will disquiet myself panted eustacie unless you tell me what is amiss  nothing amiss said nanon gruffly madame will give thanks for this fair gift of a daughter  it must be owned the words felt chill she had never thought of this it was as if the being for whom she had dared and suffered so much in the trust that he would be berengers representative and avenger had failed her and disappointed her no defender no paladin no so to be proud of her heart and courage sank down in her weakness as they had never done before and without speaking she turned her head away towards the darkness feeling as if had been for nothing and she might as well sink away in her exhaustion mere perrine was more angry with nanon than conscious of her ladys weakness woman you speak as if you knew not the blow to this family and to all who hoped for better days what that my lady the heiress who ought to be in a bed of state with velvet curtains lace pillows gold caudlecups should be here in a vile ruin among owls and bats like any beggar and all for the sake not of a young lord to raise up the family but of a miserable little girl had i known how it would turn out i had never meddled in this mad scheme  before nanon could express her indignation eustacie had turned her head opened her eyes and called out miserable oh what do you mean oh it is true nanon is it well with her  as well as heart could wish answered nanon cheerily small but a perfect little piece of sugar there lady she shall speak for herself  and as nanon laid the babe on the young mothers bosom the thrilling touch at once put an end to all the repinings of the heiress and awoke far other instincts  my child my little one my poor little orphanall cruel to her oh no welcome even from thy mother babe babe pardon me i will make it up to thee indeed i will oh let me see her do not take her away dear good woman only hold her in the moonlight  the full rays of the moon shining through the gable window streamed down very near where eustacie lay and by a slight movement dame rotrou was able to render the little face as distinctly visible to her as if it had been daylight save that the blanching light was somewhat embellishing to the newborn complexion and increased that curious resemblance so often borne for the first few hours of life to the future self eustacies cry at once was himself himselfhis very face let me have her my own moonbeamhis childmy joy  the tears so long denied rushed down like summer rain as she clasped the child in her arms dame perrine wandered to and fro like one beside herself not only at her ladys wretched accommodations but at the ill omens of the moonlight illumination of the owls who snapped and hissed incessantly over the hay and above all the tears over the babes face she tried to remonstrate with eustacie but was answered only let me weep oh let me weep it eases my heart it cannot hurt my little one she cannot weep for her father herself so i must weep for her  the weeping was gentle not violent and dame rotrou thought it did good rather than harm she was chiefly anxious to be quit of perrine who however faithful to the lady of ribaumont must not be trusted to learn the way to this huguenot asylum and must be escorted back by rotrou ere peep of dawn the old woman knew that her own absence from home would be suspicious and with many grumblings submitted but first she took the child from eustacies reluctant arms promising to restore her in a few moments after finishing dressing her in the laceedged swaddling bands so carefully preserved ever since eustacies own baby hood in these moments she had taken them all by surprise by without asking any questions sprinkling the babe with water and baptizing her by the hereditary name of berangere the feminine of the only name eustacie had always declared her son should bear such baptisms were not unfrequently performed by french nurses but eustacie exclaimed with a sound half dismay half indignation  eh quoi said perrine it is only ondoyee you can have all the ceremonies if ever time shall fit but do you think i could leave my ladys childmere girl though it bealone with owls and follets and revenants and heretics and she unbaptized she would be a changeling long ere morning i trow  come good woman said rotrou from between the trusses of hay at the entrance you and i must begin our colinmaillard again or it may be the worse for us both  and with the promise of being conducted to eustacie again in three nights time if she would meet her guide at the crossroads after dark perrine was forced to take her leave she had never suspected that all this time maitre gardon had been hidden in the refectory below and still less did she guess that soon after her departure the old man was installed as her ladys chief attendant it was impossible that nanon should stay with eustacie she had her days work to attend to and her absence would have excited suspicion he therefore came partly up the stairs and calling to nanon proffered himself to sit with cette pauvre and make a signal in case nanon should be wanted the good woman was thus relieved of a great care she would not have dared to ask it of him but with a low reverence she owned that it was an act of great charity towards the poor lady who she hoped was falling into a tranquil sleep but who she would hardly have dared to leave the pastor though hardships battles and persecutions had left him childless had been the father of a large family and perhaps he was drawn the more strongly towards the mother and child because he almost felt as if in fulfilling the part of a father towards the widow of berenger de ribaumont he was taking her in the stead of the widow of his own theodore  had the little baronne de ribaumont been lodged in a tapestried chamber between curtains of velvet and gold with a beauffet by her side glistening with gold and silver plate as would have befitted her station instead of lying on a bed of straw with no hangings to the walls save cobwebs and hay and wallflowers no beauffet but the old rickety table no attendants but nanon and m gardon no visitors but the two white owls no provisions save the homely fare that rustic mothers lived uponneither she nor her babe could have thriven better and probably not half so well she had been used to a hardy outofdoor life like the peasant women and she was young and strong so that she recovered as they did if the april shower beat in at the window or the hole in the roof they made a screen of canvas covered her with cloaks and heaped them with hay and she took no harm and the pure open air that blew in was soft with all the southern sweetness of early springtide and the little one throve in it like the puffball owlets in the hayloft or the little ringdoves in the ivy whose parents cooing voice was eustacies favourite music almost as good as these her fellownestlings was the little moonbeam la petite rayonette as eustacie fondly called this light that had come back to her from the sunshine she had lost had she cried or been heard the sounds would probably have passed for the wailings of the ghostly victims of the templars but she exercised an exemplary forbearance in that respect for which eustacie thought she could not be sufficiently admired  like the child she was eustacie seemed to have put care from her and to be solely taken up with the baby and the amusement of watching the owl family  there was a lull in the search at this moment for the chevalier had been recalled to paris by the fatal illness of his soninlaw m de selinvine the old soldier after living half his life on bread and salad that he might keep up a grand appearance at paris had on coming into the wealth of the family and marrying a beautiful wife returned to the luxuries he had been wont only to enjoy for a few weeks at a time with in military occupation of some italian town three months of festivities had been enough to cause his death and the chevalier was summoned to assist his daughter in providing for his obsequies and in taking possession of the huge endowments which as the last of his race he had been able to bequeath to her such was the news brought by the old nurse perrine who took advantage of the slackening vigilance of the enemy to come to see eustacie the old woman was highly satisfied for one of the peasants wives hadas if on purpose to oblige her ladygiven birth to twins one of whom had died almost immediately and the parents had consented to conceal their loss and at once take the little demoiselle de ribaumont as their ownguarding the secret till her mother should be able to claim her it was so entirely the practice under the most favourable circumstances for french mothers to send their infants to be nursed in cottages that perrine was amazed by the cry of angry refusal that burst from eustacie part with my child leave her to her enemiesnever never hold your tongue perrine i will not hear of such a thing  but madame hear reason she will pass for one of simonettes  she shall pass for none but minei part with thee indeed all that is left me of thy fatherthe poor little orphaned innocent that no one loves but her mother  madamemademoiselle this is not common sense why how can you hide yourself how travel with a baby on your neck whose crying may betray you  she never criesnever never and better i were betrayed than she  if it were a boy began perrine  if it were a boy there would be plenty to care for it i should not care for it half so much as for my poor little lonely girl whom every one wishes away but her motherah yes baby thy mother will go through fire and water for thee yet never fear thou shalt not leave her  no nurse can go with madame simonette could not leave her home  what needs a nurse when she has me  but madame proceeded the old woman out of patience you are beside yourself what noble lady ever nursed her babe  i dont care noble ladiesi care for my child said the vehement petulant little thing  and howwhat good will madames caring for it do what knows she of infants how can she take care of it  our lady will teach me said eustacie still pressing the child passionately to her heart and seethe owlthe ringdovecan take care of their little ones the good god shows them howhe will tell me how  perrine regarded her lady much as if she were in a naughty fit refusing unreasonably to part with a new toy and nanon rotrou was much of the same mind but it was evident that if at the moment they attempted to carry off the babe the other would put herself into an agony of passion that they durst not call forth and they found it needful to do their best to soothe her out of the deluge of agitated tears that fell from her eyes as she grasped the child so convulsively that she might almost have stifled it at once they assured her that they would not take it away nownot now at any rate and when the latent meaning made her fiercely insist that it was to leave her neither now nor ever perrine made pacifying declarations that it should be just as she pleasedpromises that she knew well when in that coaxing voice meant nothing at all nothing calmed her till perrine had been conducted away and even then nanon could not hush her into anything like repose and at last called in the minister in despair  ah sir you are a wise man can you find how to quiet the poor little thing her nurse has nearly driven her distracted with talking of the fosterparents she has found for the child  not found cried eustacie no for she shall never go  there lamented nanonso she agitates herself when it is but spoken of and surely she had better make up her mind for there is no other choice  nay nanon said m gardon wherefore should she part with the charge that god has laid on her  eustacie gave a little cry of grateful joy oh sir come nearer do you indeed say that they have no right to tear her from me  surely not lady it is you whose duty it is to shield and guard her  oh sir tell me again yours is the right religion oh you are the minister for me if you will tell me i ought to keep my child then i will believe everything else i will do just as you tell me and she stretched out both hands to him with vehement eagerness  poor thing this is no matter of one religion or another said the minister it is rather the duty that the almighty hath imposed and that he hath made an eternal joy  truly said nanon ashamed at having taken the other side the good pasteur says what is according to nature it would have gone hard with me if any one had wished to part me from robin or sara but these fine ladies and for that matter bourgeoises too always do put out their babes and it seemed to me that madame would find it hard to contrive for herselflet alone the little one  ah but what would be the use of contriving for myself without her said eustacie  if all had gone well and prosperously with madame de ribaumont probably she would have surrendered an infant born in purple and in pall to the ordinary lot of its contemporaries but the exertions and suffering she had undergone on behalf of her child its orphanhood her own loneliness and even the general disappointment in its sex had given it a hold on her vehement determined heart that intensified to the utmost the instincts of motherhood and she listened as if to an angles voice as maitre gardon replied to nanon  i say not that it is not the custom nay that my blessed wife and myself have not followed it but we have so oft had cause to repent the necessity that far be it from me ever to bid a woman forsake her sucking child  is that scripture asked eustacie ah sir sir tell me more you are giving me allallmy child i will bei ama huguenot like her father and when my vassals come i will make them ride with you to la rochelle and fight in your cause  nay said maitre gardon taken by surprise but lady your vassals are catholic  what matters it in my cause they shall fight said the feudal lady for me and my daughter  and as the pastor uttered a sound of interrogative astonishment she continued  as soon as i am well enough blaise will send out messages and they will meet me at midnight at the crossroads martin and all for dear good martin is quite well now and we shall ride across country avoiding towns wherever i choose to lead them i had thought of chantilly for i know m de montmorency would stand my friend against a guisard but now now i know you sir let me escort you to la rochelle and do your cause service worthy of nid de merle and ribaumont and as she sat up on her bed she held up her little proud head and waved her right hand with the grace and dignity of a queen offering an alliance of her realm  maitre gardon who had hitherto seen her as a childish though cheerful and patient sufferer was greatly amazed but he could not regard her project as practicable or in his conscience approve it and after a moments consideration he answered i am a man of peace lady and seldom side with armed men nor would i lightly make one of those who enroll themselves against the king  not after all the queenmother had done cried eustacie  martyrdom is better than rebellion quietly answered the old man folding his hands then he added far be it from me to blame those who have drawn the sword for the faith yet lady it would not be even thus with your peasants they might not follow you  then said eustacie with flashing eyes they would be traitors  not to the king said the pastor gently also lady how will it be with their homes and familiesthe hearths that have given you such faithful shelter  the women would take to the woods readily answered she it is summertime and they should be willing to bear something for my sake i should grieve indeed she added if my uncle misused them they have been very good to me but then they belong to me  ah lady put from you that hardening belief of seigneurs think what their fidelity deserves from their lady  i will be good to them i do love them i will be their very good mistress said eustacie her eyes filling  the question is rather of forbearing than of doing said the minister  but what would you have me do asked eustacie petulantly  this lady i gather that you would not return to your relations  never never they would rend my babe from me they would kill her or at least hide her for ever in a conventthey would force me into this abhorrent marriage nononomy child and i would die a hundred deaths together rather than fall into the hands of narcisse  calm yourself lady there is no present fear but i deem that the safest course for the little one would be to place her in england she must be heiress to lands and estates there is she not  yes and in normandy  and your husbands mother lives wherefore then should you not take me for your guide and make your waymore secretly than would be possible with a peasant escortto one of your huguenot towns on the coast whence you could escape with the child to england  my bellemere has remarried she has children i would not bring the daughter of ribaumont as a suppliant to be scorned said eustacie pouting she has lands enough of her own  there is no need to discuss the question now said m gardon gravely for a most kind offer involving much peril and inconvenience to himself was thus petulantly flouted madame will think at her leisure of what would have been the wishes of monsieur le baron for his child  he then held himself aloof knowing that it was not well for her health mental or bodily to talk any more and a good deal perplexed himself by the moods of his strange little impetuous convert if convert she could be termed he himself was a deeply learned scholar who had studied all the bearings of the controversy and though bound to the french reformers who would gladly have come to terms with the catholics at the conference of plassy and regretted the more decided calvinism that his party had since professed and in which the day of st bartholomew confirmed them he had a strong sense of the grievous losses they suffered by their disunion from the church the reformed were less and less what his ardent youthful hopes had trusted to see them and in his old age he was a sorrowstricken man as much for the cause of religion as for personal bereavements he had little desire to win proselytes but rather laid his hand to build up true religion where he found it suffering shocks in these unsettled neglected times and his present wish was rather to form and guide this little willful warmhearted motherwhom he could not help regarding with as much affection as pityto find a home in the church that had been her husbands than to gain her to his own party and most assuredly he would never let her involve herself as she was ready to do in the civil war without even knowing the doctrine which grave and earnest men had preferred to their loyalty  he could hear her murmuring to her baby no no little one we are not fallen so low as to beg our bread among strangers to live upon her own vassals had seemed to her only claiming her just rights but it galled her to think of being beholden to stranger huguenots and england and her motherinlaw without berenger were utterly foreign and distasteful to her  her mood was variable messages from blaise and martin came and went and it became known that her intended shelter at chollet together with all the adjacent houses had been closely searched by the younger ribaumont in conjunction with the governor so that it was plain that some treachery must exist and that she only owed her present freedom to her detention in the ruined temple and it would be necessary to leave that as soon as it was possible for her to attempt the journey  the plan that seemed most feasible to the vassals was that rotrou should convey her in a cart of fagots as far as possible on the road to paris that there his men should meet her by different roads riding their farmhorsesand martin even hoped to be able to convey her own palfrey to her from the monastery stable and thence taking a long stretch across country they trusted to be able to reach the lands of a dependant of the house of montmorency who would not readily yield her up to a guises man but whether instigated by perrine or by their own judgment the vassals declared that though madame should be conducted wherever she desired it was impossible to encumber themselves with the infant concealment would be impossible rough hasty rides would be retarded her difficulties would be tenfold increased and the little one would become a means of tracing her there was no choice but to leave it with simonette  angrily and haughtily did eustacie always reject this alternative and send fresh commands back by her messenger to meet the same reply in another form the strong will and practical resolution of the stout farmers who were about to make a terrible venture for her and might reasonably think they had a right to prescribe the terms that they thought best all this time maitre gardon felt it impossible to leave her still weak and convalescent alone in the desolate ruin with her young child though still her pride would not bend again to seek the counsel that she had so much detested nor to ask for the instruction that was to make her believe like her husband if she might not fight for the reformed it seemed as if she would none of their doctrine  but true lady that she was she sunk the differences in her intercourse with him she was always prettily and affectionately grateful for every service that he rendered her and as graciously polite as though she had been keeping house in the halls of ribaumont then her intense love for her child was so beautiful and there was so much sweetness in the cheerful patience with which she endured the many hardships of her situation that he could not help being strongly interested in the willful spirited little being  and thus time passed until one night when martin ventured over the farm with a report so serious that rotrou at all risks brought him up to communicate his own tidings some one had given information veronique he suspected and the two chevaliers were certainly coming the next day to search with fire the old buildings of the temple it was already dawning towards morning and it would be impossible to do more at present than to let rotrou build up the lady in a vault some little way off whence after the search was over she could be released and join her vassals the next night according to the original design as to the child her presence in the vault was impossible and martin had actually brought her intended nurse simonette to rotrous cottage to receive her  never was all eustacie answered save both of us or neither  lady said m gardon as she looked towards him i go my way with my staff  and youyou more faithful than her vassalswill let me take her  assuredly  then sir even to the worlds end will i go with you  martin would have argued have asked but she would not listen to him it was maitre gardon who made him understand the project there was what in later times has been termed an underground railway amid the persecuted calvinists and m gardon knew his ground well enough to have little doubt of being able to conduct the lady safely to some town on the coast whence she might reach her friends in england the plan highly satisfied martin it relieved him and his neighbours from the necessity of provoking perilous wrath and it was far safer for her herself than endeavouing to force her way with an escort too large not to attract notice yet not warlike enough for efficient defence he offered no further opposition but augured that after all she would come back a fine lady and right them all  eustacie recovering from her anger and recollecting his services gave him her hand to kiss and bade him farewell with a sudden effusion of gratitude and affection that warmed the honest fellows heart rewards could not be given lest they should become a clue for her uncle and perhaps they would have wounded both him and their kind hosts who did their best to assist her in their departure a hasty meal was provided by nanon and a basket so stored as to obviate the need of entering a village on that day at least to purchase provisions eustacies money and jewels again formed the nucleus of the bundle of clothes and spare swaddlingbanks of her babe her peasant dress was carefully arrangeda stout striped cloth skit and black bodice the latter covered by a scarlet chollet kerchief the winged white cap entirely hid her hair a gray cloak with a hood could either fold round her and her child or be strapped on her shoulders her sabots were hung on her shoulder for she had learnt to go barefoot and walked much more lightly thus and her little bundle was slung on a staff on the back of maitre gardon who in his great peasants hat and coat looked so like a picture of st joseph that eustacie as the light of the rising sun fell on his white beard and hair was reminded of the flight into egypt and came close to him saying shyly our blessed lady will bless and feel for my baby she knows what this journey is  the son of the blessed mary assuredly knows and blesses he answered     chapter xix la rue des trois fees    and round the baby fast and close  her trembling grasp she folds and with a strong convulsive grasp  the little infant holdssouthey   a wild storm had raged all the afternoon hail and rain had careered on the wings of the wind along the narrow street of the three fairies at the little huguenot bourg of la sablerie torrents of rain had poached the unpaved soil into a depth of mud and thunder had reverberated over the chimneytops and growled far away over the atlantic whose angry waves were tossing on the low sandy coast about two miles from the town  the evening had closed in with a chill misty drizzle and almost may though it were the widow noemi laurent gladly closed the shutters of her unglazed window where small cakes and other delicate confections were displayed and felt the genial warmth of the little fire with which she heated her tiny oven she was the widow of a pastor who had suffered for his faith in the last open persecution and being the daughter of a baker the authorities of the town had permitted her to support herself and her son by carrying on a trade in the more delicate subtilties of the art which were greatly relished at the civic feasts noemi was a grave sad woman very lonely ever since she had saved enough to send her son to study for the ministry in switzerland and with an aching heart that longed to be at rest from the toil that she looked on as a steep ladder on her way to a better home she occupied two tiny rooms on the groundfloor of a tall house and she had just arranged her few articles of furniture with the utmost neatness when there was a low knock at her door a knock that the persecuted well understood and as she lifted the latch a voice she had known of old spoke the scriptural salutation peace be with this house  eh quoi master issac is it thou come inin a good hourah  as dripping all round his broad hat and from every thread of his gray mantle the aged traveller drew into the house a female figure whom he had been supporting on his other arm muffled head and shoulders in a soaked cloak with a petticoat streaming with wet and feet and ankles covered with mire here we are my child he said tenderly as he almost carried her to noemis chair noemi with kind exclamations of la pauvre la pauvre helped the trembling cold hand to open the wet cloak and then cried out with fresh surprise and pity at the sight of the fresh little infant face nestled warm and snug under all the wrappings in those weary arms  see said the poor wanderer looking up to the old man with a faint smile she is wellshe is warmit hurts her not  can you take us in added m gardon hastily have you room  oh yes if you can sleep on the floor here i will take this poor dear to my own bed directly said noemi tenez opening a chest you will find dry clothes there of my husbands and thou helping eustacie up with her strong arm and trying to take the little one let me warm and dry thee within  too much worn out to make resistance almost past speaking knowing merely that she had reached the goal that had been promised her throughout these weary days feeling warmth and hearing kind tones eustacie submitted to be led into the inner room and when the good widow returned again it was in haste to fetch some of the warm potage she had already been cooking over the fire and hastily bade m gardon help himself to the rest she came back again with the babe to wash and dress it in the warmth of her oven fire maitre gardon in the black suit of a calvinist pastor had eaten his potage and was anxiously awaiting her report ah la pauvre with his blessing she will sleep she will do well but how far did you come today  from sainte lucie from the grange du temple since monday  ah is it possible the poor child and this little onesure it is scarce four weeks old  four weeks this coming sunday  ah the poor thing the blessing of heaven must have been with you to bear her through and what a lovely infanthow whitewhat beauteous little limbs truly she has sped well little did i think good friend that you had this comfort left or that our poor theodores young wife had escaped  alas no noemi this is no child of theodores his wife shared his martyrdom it is i who am escaped alone to tell thee but nevertheless this babe is an orphan of that same day her father was the son of the pious baron de ribaumont the patron of your husband and of myself in earlier days  ah exclaimed noemi startled then the poor young motheris shecan she be the lost demoiselle de nid de merle  is the thing known here the will of heaven be done but she can send to her husbands kindred in england  she might rest safely enough if others beside myself believed in her being your sons widow said noemi wherefore should she not be thought so  poor esperance she would willingly have lent her name to guard another said master gardon thoughtfully and for the sake of the child my little lady may endure it ah there is the making of a faithful and noble woman in that poor young thing bravely patiently cheerfully hath she plodded this weary way and verily she hath grown like my own daughter to meas i never thought to love earthly thing again and had this been indeed my theodores child i could hardly care for it more  and as he related how he had fallen in with the forlorn lady of ribaumont and all that she had dared done and left undone for the sake of her little daughter good noemi laurent wept and agreed with him that a special providence must have directed them to his care and that some good work must await one who had been carried through so much his project was to remain here for a short time to visit the flock who had lost their pastor on the day of the massacre and to recruit his own strength for he too had suffered severely from the long travelling and the exposure during many nights especially since all that was warm and sheltered had been devoted to eustacie and after this he proposed to go to la rochelle and make inquiries for a trusty messenger who could be sent to england to seek out the family of the baron de ribaumont or mayhap a sufficient escort with whom the lady could travel though he had nearly made up his mind that he would not relinquish the care of her until he had safely delivered her to her husbands mother  health and life were very vigorous in eustacie and though at first she had been completely worn out a few days of comfort entire rest and good nursing restored her noemi dressed her much like herself in a black gown prim little white starched ruff and white capa thorough calvinist dress and befitting a ministers widow eustacie winced a little at hearing of the character that had been fastened upon her she disliked for her child still more than for herself to take this bourgeois name of gardon but there was no help for it since though he chief personages of the town were huguenot there could be no safety for her if the report were once allowed to arise that the baronne de ribaumont had taken refuge there  it was best that she should be as little noticed as possible nor indeed had good noemi many visitors the sad and sorrowful woman had always shut herself up with her bible and her meditations and sought no sympathy from her neighbours nor encourage gossip in her shop in the first days when purchasers lingered to ask if it were true that maitre gardon had brought his daughterinlaw and grandchild her sternfaced almost grim answer that la pauvre was ill at ease silenced them and forced them to carry off their curiosity unsatisfied but it became less easy to arrange when eustacie herself was on foot againrefreshed active and with an irrepressible spring of energy and eagerness that could hardly be caged down in the widow laurents tiny rooms poor child had she not been ill and prostrate at first and fastened herself on the tender side of the good womans heart by the sweetness of an unselfish and buoyant nature in illness noemi could hardly have endured such an inmate not even half a huguenot full of little catholic observances like second nature to her listening indeed to the bible for the short time but always when it was expounded either asleep or finding some amusement indispensable for her baby eager for the least variety and above all spoilt by maitre gardon to a degree absolutely perplexing to the grave woman  he would not bid her lay aside the observances that to noemi seemed almost worship of the beast he rather reverted to the piety which originated them and argued with his old friend that it was better to build than to destroy and that before the fabric of truth superstition would crumble away of itself the little he taught her sounded to noemis puzzled ears mere christianity instead of controversial calvinism and moreover he never blamed her for wicked worldliness when she yawned but even devised opportunities for taking her out for a walk to see as much life as might be on a marketday he could certainly not forgetas much as would have been prudentthat she was a highborn lady and even seemed taken aback when he found her with her sleeves turned up over her shapelydelicate arms and a thick apron before her with her hands in veuve laurents flour showing her some of those special mysterious arts of confectionery in which she had been initiated by soeur bernardine when not three years ago she had been the pet of the convent at bellaise at first it was half sport and the desire of occupation but the produce of her manipulations was so excellent as to excite quite a sensation in la sablerie and the echevins and baillis sent in quite considerable orders for the cakes and patties of maitre gardons parisbred daughterinlaw  maitre gardon hesitated noemi laurent told him she cared little for the gainheaven knew it was nothing to herbut that she thought it wrong and inconsistent in him to wish to spare the poor childs pride which was unchristian enough already nay he said sadly mortifications from without do little to tame pride nor did i mean to bring her here that she should turn cook and confectioner to pamper the appetite of baillis la grasse  but eustacies first view was a bright pleasure in the triumph of her skill and when her considerate guardian endeavoured to impress on her that there was no necessity for vexing herself with the task she turned round on him with the exclamation nay dear father do you not see it is my great satisfaction to be able to do something for our good hostess so that my daughter and i be not a burden to her  well spoken my lady said the pastor there is real nobility in that way of thinking yet remember noemi is not without means she feels not the burden and the flock contribute enough for the shepherds support and yours likewise  then let her give it to the poor creatures who so often come in begging and saying they have been burned out of house and home by one party or the other said eustacie let me have my way dear sir soeur bernadine always said i should be a prime menagere i like it so much  and madame de ribaumont mixed sugar and dough and twisted quaint shapes and felt important and almost lighthearted and sang over her work and over her child songs that were not always marots psalms and that gave the more umbrage to noemi because she feared that maitre gardon actually like to hear them though should their echo reach the street why it would be a peril and still worse a horrible scandal that out of that sober afflicted household should proceed profane tunes such as court ladies sang     chapter xx the abbe         by the day and night her sorrows fall        where miscreant hands and rude      have stained her pure ethereal pall        with many a martyrs blood      and yearns not her maternal heart        to hear their secret sighs      upon whose doubting way apart        bewildering shadows risekeble   it was in the summer twilight that eustacie sitting on the doorstep between the two rooms with her baby on her knees was dreamily humming to her a tune without even words but one that she loved because she had first learnt to sing it with berenger and his friend sidney to the lute of the latter and its notes always brought before her eyes the woods of montpipeau then it was that low and soft as was the voice that befell which noemi had feared a worn raggedlooking young man who had been bargaining at the door for a morsel of bread in exchange for a handkerchief started at the sound and moved so as to like into the house  noemi was at the moment not attending being absorbed in the study of the handkerchief which was of such fine delicate texture that an idea of its having been stolen possessed her and she sought the corner where as she expected a coatofarms was embroidered just as she was looking up to demand explanation the stranger with a sudden cry of good heavens it is she pushed past her into the house and falling on his knee before eustacie exclaimed o lady lady is it thus that i see you  eustacie had started up in dismay crying out ah m labbe as you are a gentleman betray me not oh have they sent you to find me have pity on us you loved my husband  you have nothing to fear from me lady said the young man still kneeling if you are indeed a distressed fugitiveso am i if you have shelter and friendsi have none  is it indeed so said eustacie wistfully yet scarce reassured you are truly not come from my uncle indeed monsieur i would not doubt you but you see i have so much at stake i have my little one here and they mean so cruelly by her  madame i swear by the honour of a noblemannay by all that is sacredthat i know nothing of your uncle i have been a wanderer for many weeks past proscribed and hunted down because i wished to seek into the truth  ah said eustacie with a sound of relief and of apology pardon me sir indeed i know you were good you loved my husband and she reached out her hand to raise him when he kissed it reverently little bourgeoise and worn mendicant as they were in dress the air of the louvre breathed round them and there was all its grace and dignity as the lady turned round to her astonished hosts saying good sir kind mother this gentleman is indeed what you took me for a fugitive for the truth permit me to present to you monsieur labbe de mericourat least so he was when last i had the honour to see him  the last time he had seen her poor eustacie had been incapable of seeing anything save that bloody pool at the foot of the stairs  mericour now turned and explained good friends he said courteously but with the fierete of the noble not quite out of his tone i beg your grace i would not have used so little ceremony if i had not been out of myself at recognizing a voice and a tune that could belong to none but madame  sit down sir said noemi a little coldly and stifflyfor mericour was a terrible name to huguenots ears a true friend to this lady must needs be welcome above all if he comes in heavens name  sit down and eat sir added gardon much more heartily and forgive us for not having been more hospitablebut the times have taught us to be cautious and in that lady we have a precious charge rest for you look both weary and hungry  eustacie added an invitation understanding that he would not sit without her permission and then as he dropped into a chair she exclaimed ah sir you are faint but you are famished  it will pass he said i have not eaten today  instantly a meal was set before him and ere long he revived and as the shutters were closed and shelter for the night promised to him by a huguenot family lodging in the same house he began to answer eustacies anxious questions as well as to learn from her in return what had brought her into her present situation  then it was that she recollected that it had been he who at her cousin dianes call had seized her when she was rushing out of the palace in her first frenzy of grief and had carried her back to the womens apartments  it was that day which brought me here he said  and he told how bred up in his own distant province by a pious and excellent tutor he had devoutly believed in the extreme wickedness of the reformers but in his seclusion he had been trained to such purity of faith and morals that when his brother summoned him to court to solicit a benefice he had been appalled at the aspect of vice and had at the same time been struck by the pure lives of the huguenots for truly as things then were at the french court crime seemed to have arrayed itself on the side of the orthodox party all virtue on that of the schismatics  de mericour consulted spiritual advisers who told him that none but catholics could be truly holy and that what he admired were merely heathen virtues that the devil permitted the huguenots to display in order to delude the unwary with this explanation he had striven to be satisfied though eyes unblended by guilt and a pure heart continued to be revolted at the practices which his church scared at the evil times and forgetful of her own true strength left undenounced in her partisans and the more that the huguenot gentlemen thronged the court and the young abbe was thrown into intercourse with them and the more he perplexed himself how the truth the faith the uprightness the forbearance the purity that they evinced could indeed be wanting in the zeal that made them acceptable then came the frightful morning when carnage reigned in every street and the men who had been treated as favourite boon companions were hunted down like wild beasts in every street he had endeavoured to save life but would have speedily been slaughtered himself except for his soutane and in all good faith he had hurried to the louvre to inform royalty of the horrors that as he thought a fanatic passion was causing the populace to commit  he found the palace become shamblesthe king himself wrought up to frenzy firing on the fugitives and the next day while his brain still seemed frozen with horror he was called on to join in the procession of thanksgiving for the kings deliverance from a dangerous plot surely if the plot were genuine he thought the procession should have savoured of penance and humiliation rather than of barbarous exultation yet these might be only the individual crimes of the queenmother and of the guises seeking to mask themselves under the semblance of zeal and the infallible head of the visible church would disown the slaughter and cast it from the church with loathing as a bloodstained garment behold rome was full of rejoicing and sent sanction and commendation of the pious zeal of the king had the voice of holy church become indeed as the voice of the bloodhound was this indeed her call  the young man whose life from infancy had been marked out for the service of the churchso destined by his parents as securing a wealthy provision for a younger son but educated by his good tutor with more real sense of his obligationsfelt the question in its full import he was under no vows he had indeed received the tonsure but was otherwise unpledged and he was bent on proving all things the gaieties in which he had at first mingled had become abhorrent to him and he studied with the earnestness of a newlyawakened mind in search of true light the very face of study and inquiry in one of such a family as that of his brother the duke de mericour was enough to excite suspicion of huguenot inclinations the elder brother tried to quash the folly of the younger by insisting on his sharing the debaucheries which whether as priest or monk or simply as christian man it would be his duty to abjure and at length by way of bringing things to a test insisted on his making one of a party who were about to break up and destroy a huguenot assembly unable in his present mood to endure the thought of further cruelty the young abbe fled gave secret warning to the endangered congregation and hastened to the old castle in brittany where he had been brought up to pour out his perplexities and seek the counsel of the good old chaplain who had educated him whether the kind learned simplehearted tutor could have settled his mind he had no time to discover for he had scarcely unfolded his troubles before warnings came down that he had better secure himselfhis brother as head of the family had obtained the royal assent to the imprisonment of the rebellious junior so as to bring him to a better mind and cure him of the huguenot inclinations which in the poor lad were simply undeveloped but in all the catholic eyes he was a tainted man and his almost inevitable course was to take refuge with some huguenot relations there he was eagerly welcome instruction was poured in on him but as he showed a disposition to inquire and examine and needed time to look into what they taught him as one who feared to break his link with the church and still longed to find her blameless and glorious the righteous nation that keepeth the truth they turned on him and regarded him as a traitor and a spy who had come among them on false pretences  all the poor lad wanted was time to think time to examine time to consult authorities living and dead the catholics called this treason to the church the huguenots called it halting between two opinions and between them he was a proscribed distrusted vagabond branded on one side as a recreant and on the other as a traitor he had asked for a few months of quiet and where could they be had his grandmother had been the daughter of a scottish nobleman in the french service and he had once seen a nephew of hers who had come to paris during the time of queen marys residence there he imagined that if he were once out of this distracted land of france he might find respite for study for which he longed and utterly ignorant of the real state of scotland he had determined to make his way to his kindred there and he had struggled on the way to la rochelle cheated out of the small remains of his money selling his last jewels and all the clothing that was not indispensable and becoming so utterly unable to pay his passage to england that he could only trust to providence to find him some means of reaching his present goal  he had been listened to with kindness and a sympathy such as m gardons large mind enable him to bestow where his brethren had been incapable of comprehending that a man could sincerely doubt between them and rome when the history was finished eustacie exclaimed turning to maitre gardon ah sir is not this just what we sought if this gentleman would but convey a letter to my motherinlaw  m gardon smiled scotland and england are by no means the same place lady he said  whatever this lady would command wherever she would send me i am at her service cried the abbe fervently  and after a little further debate it was decided that it might really be the best course for him as for madame de ribaumont to become the bearer of a letter and token from her entreating her motherinlaw to notify her pleasure whether she should bring her child to england she had means enough to advance a sufficient sum to pay mericours passage and he accepted it most punctiliously as a loan intending so soon as her despatches were ready to go on to la rochelle and make inquiry for a ship  chance however seemed unusually propitious for the next day there was an apparition in the streets of la sablerie of four or five weatherbeaten rollickinglooking men their dress profusely adorned with ribbons and their language full of strange oaths they were well known at la sablerie as sailors belonging to a ship of the fleet of the count de montgomery the unfortunate knight whose lance had caused the death of king henry ii and who proscribed by the mortal hatred of catherine de medicis had become the admiral of a piratical fleet in the calvinist interest so far winked at the queen elizabeth that it had its headquarters in the channel islands and thence was a most formidable foe to merchant vessels on the northern and eastern coasts of france and often indulged in descents on the coast when the sailorsbeing in general the scum of the nationwere apt to comport themselves more like american buccaneers than like champions of any form of religion  la sablerie was a huguenot town so they used no violence but only swaggered about demanding from bailli la grasse in the name of their gallant captain latouche contributions and provisions and giving him to understand that if he did not comply to the uttermost it should be the worse for him their ship it appeared had been forced to put into the harbour about two miles off and maitre gardon and the young abbe decided on walking thither to see it and to have an interview with the captain so as to secure a passage for mericour at least indeed maitre gardon had in consultation with eustacie resolved if he found things suitable to arrange for their all going together she would be far safer out of france and although the abbe alone could not have escorted her yet maitre gardon would gladly have secured for her the additional protection of a young strong and spirited man and eustacie who was no scribe was absolutely relieved to have the voyage set before her as an alternative to the dreadful operation of composing a letter to the bellemere whom she had not seen since she had been seven years old and of whose present english name she had the most indistinct ideas  however the first sight of the ship overthrew all such ideas it was a wretched singledecked vessel carrying far more sail than experienced nautical eyes would have deemed safe and with no accommodation fit for a woman and child even had the aspect of captain or crew been more satisfactoryfor the ruffianly appearance and language of the former fully rivaled that of his sailors it would have been mere madness to think of trusting the lady in such hands and without a word to each other gardon and mericour resolved to give no hint even that she and her jewels were in la sablerie mericour however made his bargain with the captain who understood to transport him as far as guernsey whence he might easily make his way to dorsetshire where m gardon knew that berengers english home had been  so eustacie with no small trouble and consideration indited her lettertelling of her escape the birth of her daughter the dangers that threatened her childand begging that its grandmother would give it a safe home in england and love it for the sake of its father an answer would find her at the widow noemi laurents rue des trois fees la sablerie she could not bring herself to speak of the name of eserance gardon which had been saddled upon her and even m de mericour remained in ignorance of her bearing this disguise she recommended him to the kindness of her motherinlaw and m gardon added another letter to the lady on behalf of the charge to whom he promised to devote himself until he should see them safe in friendly hands both letters were addressed as best they might be between eustacies dim comprehension of the word thistlewood and m gardons notion of spelling jadis baronne de ribaumont was the securest part of the direction  and for a token eustacie looked over her jewels to find one that would serve for a token but the only ones she knew would be recognized were the brooch that had fastened the plume in berengers bloody cap and the chaplet of pearls to part with the first or to risk the second in the pirateship was impossible but eustacie at last decided upon detaching the pearshaped pearl which was nearest the clasp and which was so remarkable in form and tint that there was no doubt of its being well known     chapter xxi under the walnuttree      mistress jean was making the elderflower wine   and what brings the   laird at sic a like time                               lady nairn the laird of cockpen   summer was nearly ended and lucy thistlewood was presiding in the great kitchen of the manorhouse standing under the latticed window near the large oaktable a white apron over her dress presiding over the collecting of elderberries for the brew of householdwine for the winter the maids stood round her with an array of beechen bowls or red and yellow crocks while barefooted bareheaded children came thronging in with rush or wicker baskets of the crimson fruit which the maids poured in sanguine cascades into their earthenware and lucy requited with substantial slices of bread and cheese and stout homely garment mostly of her own sewing  lucy was altogether an inmate of her fathers house she had not even been at hurst walwyn for many months for her stepmothers reiterated hopes that berenger would make her his consolation for all he had suffered from his french spouse rendered it impossible to her to meet him with sisterly unconsciousness and she therefore kept out of the way and made herself so useful at home that dame annora only wondered how it had been possible to spare her so long and always wound up her praises by saying that berenger would learn in time how lucky he had been to lose the french puppet and win the good english housewife  if only tidings would have come that the puppet was safe married that was the crisis which all the family desired yet feared for berenger since nothing else they saw would so detach his thoughts from the past as the leave him free to begin life again the relapse brought on by the cruel reply to osberts message had been very formidable he was long insensible or delirious and then came a state of annihilated thought then of frightfully sensitive organs when light sound movement or scent were alike agony and when he slowly revived it was with such sunken spirits that his silence was as much from depression as from difficulty of speech his brain was weak his limbs feeble the wound in his mouth never painless and all this necessarily added to his listless indifference and weariness as though all youthful hope and pleasure were extinct in him he had ceased to refer to the past perhaps he had thought it over and seen that the deferred escape the request for the pearls the tryst at the palace and detention from the kings chamber made an uglier case against eustacie than he could endure to own even to himself if his heart trusted his mind could not argue out her defence and his tongue would not serve him for discussion with his grandfather the only person who could act for him perhaps the stunned condition of his mind made the suspense just within the bounds of endurance while trust in his wifes innocence rendered his inability to come to her aid wellnigh intolerable and doubt of her seemed both profanity and misery unspeakable he could do nothing he had shot his only shaft by sending landry osbert and had found that to endeavour to induce his grandfather to use further measures was worse than useless and was treated as mere infatuation he knew that all he had to do was to endeavour for what patience he could win from cecilys sweet influence and guidance and to wait till either certainty should comethat dreadful miserable certainty that all looked for and his very helplessness might be bringing aboutor till he should regain strength to be again effective  and miserably slow work was this recovery no one had surgical skill to deal with so severe a wound as that which narcisse had inflicted and the daily pain and inconvenience it caused led to innumerable drawbacks that ofteneven after he had come as far as the gardenbrought him back to his bed in a dark room to bloodletting and to speechlessness no one knew much of his mindcecily perhaps the most and next to her philipwho from the time he had been admitted to his stepbrothers presence had been most assiduous in tending himseemed to understand his least sign and to lay aside all his boisterous roughness in his eager desire to do him service the lads had loved each other from the moment they had met as children but never so apparently as now when all the rude horseplay of healthy youths was overand one was dependent the other considerate and if berenger had made on one else believe in eustacie he had taught philip to view her as the queens men viewed mary of scotland philip had told lucy the rough but wholesome truth that mother talks mere folly eustacie is no more to be spoken of with you than a pheasant with old brown partlet and berry waits but to be well to bring her off from all her foes and ill go with him  it was on philips arm that berenger first crept round the bowlinggreen and with philip at his rein that he first endured to ride along the avenue on lord walwyns smoothpaced palfrey and it was philip who interrupted lucys household cares by rushing in and shouting sister here i have wiled him to ride over the down and he is sitting under the walnuttree quite spent and the three little wenches are standing in a row weeping like so many little mermaids come i say  lucy at once followed him through the house through the deep porch to the court which was shaded by a noble walnuttree where sir marmaduke loved to sit among his dogs there not sat berenger resting against the trunk overcome by the heat and exertion of his ride his cloak and hat lay on the ground the dogs fawned round him eager for the wonted caress and his three little sisters stood a little aloof clinging to one another and crying piteously  it was their first sight of him and it seemed to them as if he were behind a frightful mask even lucy was not without a sensation of the kind of this effect in the change from the girlish rosy complexion to extreme paleness on which was visible in ghastly red and purple the great scar left by narcisse from the temple on the one side to the ear on the other  the far more serious would on the cheek was covered with a black patch and the hair had almost entirely disappeared from the head only a few light brown locks still hanging round the neck and temples so that the bald brow gave a strange look of age and the disfigurement was terrible enhanced as it was by the wasting effect of nearly a year of sickness lucy was so much shocked that she could hardly steady her voice to chide the children for not giving a better welcome to their brother they would have clung round her but she shook them off and sent annora in haste for her mothers fan while philip arriving with a slice of dietbread and a cup of sack the one fanned him and the other fed him with morsels of the cake soaked in the wine till he revived looked up with eyes that were unchanged and thanked them with a few faltering words scarcely intelligible to lucy the little girls came nearer and curiously regarded him but when he held out his hand to his favourite dolly she shrank back in reluctance  do not chide her he said wearily may she never become used to such marks  what would you have her live among cowards exclaimed philip but berenger instead of answering looked up at the front of the house one of those fine tudor facades that seem all carved timber and glass lattice and asked so abruptly that lucy doubted whether she heard him alrighthow many windows are there in this front  i never counted said philip  i have said annora there are seven and thirty besides the two little ones in the porch  none shall make them afraid he muttered who would dare build such a defenceless house over yonderpointing south  our hearts are guarded now said philip proudly berenger half smiled as he was wont to do when he meant more than he could conveniently utter and presently he asked in the same languid musing tone lucy were you ever really affrighted  lucy questioned whether he could be really in his right mind as if the bewilderment of his brain was again returning and while she paused annora exclaimed yes when we were gathering cowslips and the brindled cow ran at us and lucy could not run because she had dolly in her arm oh we were frightened then till you came brother  yes added bessie and last winter too when the owl shrieked at the window  and added berenger sister what was your greatest time of revelry  annora again put in her word i know brother you remember the fairday when my lady grandame was angered because you and lucy went on dancing when we and all then gentry had ceased and when lucy said she had not seen that you were left alone aunt cecily said it was because the eyes of discretion were lacking  oh the christmas feast was far grander said bessie then lucy had her first satin farthingale and three gallants besides my brother wanted to dance with her  blushing deeply lucy tried to hush the little ones much perplexed by the questions and confused by the answers could he be contrasting the life where a vicious cow had been the most alarming object a greensward dance with a stepbrother the greatest gaiety dye of the elder juice the deepest stain with the temptations and perils that had beset one equally young resting his head on his hand his elbow on his knee he seemed to be musing in a reverie that he could hardly brook as his young brow was knitted by care and despondency  suddenly the sounds in the village rose from the quiet sleepy summer hum into a fierce yell of derisive vituperation causing philip at once to leap up and run across the court to the entrancegate while lucy called after him some vain sisterly warning against mingling in a fray  it seemed as if his interposition had a good effect for the uproar lulled almost as soon as he had hurried to the scene of action and presently he reappeared eager and breathless i told them to bring him up here he said they would have flogged him at the cartstail the rogues just because my father is out of the way i could not make out his jargon but you can brother and make that rascal spinks let him go  what should i have to do with it said berenger shrinking from the sudden exposure of his scarred face and maimed speech i am no magistrate  but you can understand him he is french the poor rogue something abut a letter and wanting to ask his way ah i thought that would touch you and it will cost you little pains and slouching it over his face rose and leaning upon annoras shoulder stepped forward just as the big burly blacksmithconstable and small shriveled cobbler advanced dragging along by a cord round the wrists a slight figure with a red woolen sailors shirt ragged black hosen bare head and almost bare feet  doffing their caps the men began an awkward salutation to the young lord on his recovery but he only touched his beaver in return and demanded how now what have you bound him for  you see my lord began the constable there have been a sort of vagrants of late and ill be bound twas no fourlegged fox as took gaffer shepherds lamb  the peroration was broken off for with a start as if he had been shot berenger cried aloud mericour the abbe  ah monsieur if you know me cried the young man raising his head free me from this shameaid me in my mission  loose him fellows shouted berenger philip a knifelucy those scissors  tis my duty my lord said spinks gruffly all vagabonds to be apprehended and flogged at the cartstail by her graces special commands how is it to be answered to his honour sir marmaduke  oaf cried philip you durst not have used such violence had my father been at home dont you see my brother knows him  with hands trembling with haste berenger had seized the scissors that housewife like hung at lucys waist and was cutting the rope exclaiming in french pardon pardon friend for so shameful a reception  sir was the reply without a sign of recognition if indeed you know my name i entreat you to direct me to the chateau of le sieur tistefote whose lady was once baronne de ribaumont  my mother ah my friend my friend what would you he cried in a tone of tremulous hope and fear laying one hand on mericours shoulder and about to embrace him  mericour retreated from him but the highspirited young man crossed his arms on his breast and gazing at the group with indignant scorn made answer my message is from her who deems herself a widow to the mother of the husband whom she little imagines to be not only alive but consoled  faithful faithful burst out berenger with a wild exultant strangelyringing shout woe woe to those who would have had me doubt her philiplucyhear her truth is clear to all the world then changing back again to french ten thousand blessings on you mericour you have seen her wherehow  mericour still spoke with frigid politeness i had the honour to part with madame la baronne de ribaumont in the town of la sablerie among humble huguenot guardians to whom she had fled to save her infants lifewhen no aid came  he was obliged to break off for berenger stunned by the sudden rush of emotion reeled as he stood and would have fallen but for the prompt support of lucy who was near enough to guide him back to rest upon the bench saying resentfully in french as she did so my brother is still very ill i pray you sir have a care  she had not half understood the rapid words of the two young men philip comprehended them far less and the constable and his crew of course not at all and spinks pushed forward among the group as he saw berenger sink back on the bench and once more collaring his prisoner exclaimed almost angrily to philip there now sir youve had enough of the vagabond well keep him tight ere he bewitches any more of you  this rude interference proved an instant restorative berenger sprang up at once and seizing spinks arm exclaimed hands off fellow this is my frienda gentleman he brings me tidings of infinite gladness who insults him insults me  spinks scarcely withdrew his hand from mericours neck and scowling said very odd gentlemanvery queer tidings master berenger to fell you like an ox i must be answerable for the fellow till his honour comes  ah eh quoi wherefore not show the canaille your sword said mericour impatiently  it may not be here in england said berenger who fortunately was not wearing his weapon and in good time here comes my stepfather as the gate swung back and sir marmaduke and lady thistlewood rode through it the former sending his voice far before him to demand the meaning of the hurlyburly that filled his court  philip was the first to spring to his rein exclaiming father it is a frenchman whom spinks would have flogged at the cartstail but it seems he is a friend of berengers and has brought him tidings i know not whatabout his wife i believeany way he is beside himself with joy  sir your honour shouted spinks again seizing mericour and striving to drag him forward i would know whether the law is to be hindered from taking its course because my young lord there is a frenchman and bewitched  ah shrieked lady thistlewood i knew it they will have sent secret poison to finish him keep the fellow safe he will cast it in the air  ay ay my lady said spinks there are plenty of us to testify that he made my young lord fall back as in a swoon and reel like one distraught pray heaven it have not gone further  sir exclaimed berenger who on the other side held his friends hand tight this is a noble gentlemanthe brother of the duke de mericour he has come at great risk to bring me tidings of my dear and true wife and not one word will these demented rascals let me hear with their senseless clamour  berenger you here my boy exclaimed sir marmaduke more amazed by this than all the rest  he touches himhe holds him ah will no one tear him away screamed lady thistlewood nor would spinks have been slow in obeying her if sir marmaduke had not swung his substantial form to the ground and stepping up to the prisoner rudely clawed on one side by spinks and affectionately grasped on the other side by berenger shouted  let go both does he speak english peace dame if the lad be bewitched it is the right way he looks like the other man eh lad what does your friend say for himself  sir said berenger interpreting mericours words as they were spoken he has been robbed and misused at sea by montgomerys pirate crews he fled from court for the religions sake he met hermy wife the voice was scarcely intelligible so tremulously was it spoken in hiding among the huguenotshe brings a letter and a token from her to my mother  ha and you know him you avouch him to be what he represents himself  i knew him at court i know him well father make these fellows cease their insults i have heard nothing yet see here holding out what mericour had put into his hand this you cannot doubt mother  parted the pearls ah the little minx cried the lady as she recognized the jewels  i thought he had been robbed added sir marmaduke  the gentleman doubts said mericour catching some of the words he should know that what is confided in a french gentleman is only taken from him with his life much did i lose but the pearl i kept hidden in my mouth  therewith he produced the letter lady thistlewood pronounced that no power on earth should induce her to open it and drew off herself and her little girls to a safe distance from the secret poison she fancied it contained while sir marmaduke was rating the constables for taking advantage of his absence to interpret the queens vagrant act in their own violent fashion ending however by sending them round to the butteryhatch to drink the young lords health for the messeger the good knight heartily grasped his hand welcoming him and thanking him for having brought comfort to you poor lads heart  but there sir marmaduke paused doubting whether the letter had indeed brought comfort for berenger who had seized on it when it was refused by his mother was sitting under the treeturning away indeed but not able to conceal that his tears were gushing down like rain the anxious exclamation of his stepfather roused him at length but he scarce found power or voice to utter as he thrust the letter into the knights hand ah see what has she not suffered for me me whom you would have had believed her faithless  he then grasped his friends arm and with him disappeared into the house leaving sir marmaduke holding the letter in a state of the utmost bewilderment and calling by turns on his wife and daughter to read and explain it to him  and as lucy read the letter with her mother could not yet prevail on herself to touch she felt at each word more grateful to the good aunt cecily whose influence had taught her always to view berenger as a brother and not to condemn unheard the poor young wife if she had not been thus guarded what distress might not this day of joy to berenger have brought to lucy indeed lady thistlewood was vexed enough as it was and ready to carry her incredulity to the most inconsistent lengths it was all a trick for getting the poor boy back that they might make an end of him altogether tell her they thought him deadtilleyvalley it was a mere attempt on her own goodnature to get a little french impostor on her hands let sir duke look well to it and take care that her poor boy was not decoyed among them the frenchman might be cutting his throat at that moment where was he had sir duke been so lost as to let them out of sight together no one had either pity or prudence now that her poor father was gone and she began to weep  no great fear on that score dame laughed the knight did you not hear the lad shouting for phil phil almost in a voice like old times it does one good to hear it  just at twilight berenger came down the steps conducting a graceful gentleman in black to whom lady thistlewoods instinct impelled her to make a low courtesy before berenger had said madam allow me to present to you my friend the abbe de mericour  is it the same whispered bessie to annora surely he is translated  only into philips old mourning suit i know it by the stain on the knee  then it is translated too never did it look so well on philip see our mother is quite gracious to him she speaks to him as though he were some noble visitor to my lord  therewith sir marmaduke came forward shook mericour with all his might by the hand shouted to him his hearty thanks for the good he had done his poor lad and assured him of a welcome from the very bottom of his heart the good knight would fain have kept both berenger and his friend at the manor but berenger was far too impatient to carry home his joy and only begged the loan of a horse for mericour for himself he felt as if fatigue or dejection would never touch him again and he kissed his mother and his sisters including lucy all round with an effusion of delight  is that indeed your stepfather said mericour as they rode away together and the young man is he your halfbrother  brother wholly in dear love said berenger no blood relation the little girls are my mothers children  ah so large a family all one all at home none in convents  we have no convents  ah no but all at home all at peace this is a strange place your england     chapter xxii departure                 it is my mistress      since she is living let the time run on          to good or badcymbeline   mericour found the welcome at hurst walwyn kindly and more polished than that at combe manor he was more readily understood and found himself at his natural element lord walwyn in especial took much notice of him and conversed with him long and earnestly while berenger too happy and too weary to exert himself to say many words sat as near cecily as he could treating her as though she who had never contradicted in his trust in eustacie were the only person who could worthily share his infinite relief peace and thankfulness  lord walwyn said scarcely anything to his grandson that night only when berenger as usual bent his knee to ask his blessing on parting for the night he said gravely son i am glad of your joy i fear me you have somewhat to pardon your grandsire come to my library so soon as morning prayers be over we will speak then not now my dear lad he added as berenger with tears in his eyes kissed his hand and would have begun you are too much worn and spent to make my dear ears hear sleep and take my blessing with you  it was a delight to see the young face freed from the haggard dejected expression that had been sadder than the outward wound and yet it was so questionable how far the french connection was acceptable to the family that when berenger requested mr adderley to make mention of the mercy vouchsafed to him in the morning devotions the chaplain bowed indeed but took care to ascertain that his so doing would be agreeable to my lord and my lady  he found that if lady walwyn was still inclined to regret that the frenchwoman was so entirely a wife and thought berenger had been very hasty and imprudent yet that the old lord was chiefly distressed at the cruel injustice he had so long been doing this poor youth thing a strong sense of justice and long habit of dignified selfrestraint alone prevented lord walwyn from severely censuring mr adderley for misrepresentations but the old nobleman recollected that walsingham had been in the same story and was too upright to visit his own vexation on the honestlymistaken tutor  however when berenger made his appearance in the study looking as if not one right but weeks had been spent in recovering health and spirit the old mans first word was a gentle rebuke for his having been left unaware of how far matters had gone but he cut short the attempted reply but saying he knew it was chiefly owing to his own overhasty conclusion and fear of letting his grandson injure himself by vainly discussing the subject now however he examined berenger closely on all the proceedings paris and at montpipeau and soon understood that the ceremony had been renewed ratifying the vows taken in infancy the old statesmans face cleared up at once for as he explained he had now no anxieties as to the validity of the marriage by english law at least in spite of the decree from rome which as he pointed out to his grandson was wholly contingent on the absence of subsequent consent since the parties had come to an age for freewill had he known of this the remarriage he said he should certainly have been less supine why had berenger been silent  i was commanded sir i fear i have transgressed the command by mentioning it now i must pray you to be secret  secret foolish lad know you not that the rights of your wife and your children rest upon it and as the change in berengers looks showed that he had not comprehended the full importance of the second ceremony as nullifying the papal sentence which could only quash the first on the ground of want of mutual consent he proceeded command quotha who there had any right to command you boy  only one sir  come this no moment for lovers folly it was not the girl then then it could no other than the miserable kingwas it so  yes sir said berenger he bade me as king and requested me as the friend who gave her to me i could do no otherwise and i thought it would be but a matter of a few days and that our original marriage was the only important one  have you any parchment to prove it  no sir it passed but as a ceremony to satisfy the queens scruples ere she gave my wife to me to take home i even think the king was displeased at her requiring it  was mr sidney a witness  no sir none was present save the king and queen her german countess and the german priest  the day  lammasday  the 1st of august of the year of grace 1572 i will write to walsingham to obtain the testimony if possible of king or of priest but belike they will deny it all it was part of the trick shame upon it that a king should dig pits for so small a game as you my poor lad  verily my lord said berenger i think the king meant us kindly and would gladly have sped us well away methought he felt his bondage bitterly and would fain have dared to be a true king even at the last he bade me to his garderobe and all there were unhurt  and wherefore obeyed you not  the carouse would have kept me too late for our flight  kings behests may not lightly be disregarded said the old courtier with a smile however since he showed such seeming favour to you surely you might send a petition to him privately through sir francis walsingham to let the priest testify to your renewal of contract engaging not to use it to his detriment in france  i will do so sir meanwhile he added as one who felt he had earned a right to be heard in his turn i have your permission to hasten to bring home my wife  lord walwyn was startled at this demand from one still so far from recovered as berenger even this talk eager as the youth was had not been carried on without much difficulty repetitions and altered phrases when he could not pronounce distinctly enough to be understood and the effort brought lines of pain into his brow he could take little solid food had hardly any strength for walking or riding and though all his wounds were whole except that one unmanageable shot in the mouth he looked entirely unfit to venture on a long journey in the very country that had sent him home a year before scarcely alive lord walwyn had already devised what he thought a far more practicable arrangement namely to send mr adderley and some of my ladys women by sea under the charge of master hobbs a shipmaster at weymouth who traded with bordeaux for wine and could easily put in near la sablerie and bring off the lady and child and if she wished it the pastor to whom such a debt of gratitude was owing  berenger was delighted with the notion of the sea rather than the land journey but he pointed out at once that this would remove all objection to his going in person he had often been out whole nights with the fishermen and knew that a seavoyage would be better for his health than anythingcertainly better than pining and languishing at home as he had done for months he could not bear to think of separation from eustacie an hour longer than needful nay she had been cruelly entreated enough already and as long as he could keep his feet it was absolutely due to her that he should not let others instead of himself go in search of her it would be almost death to him to stay at home  lord walwyn looked at the pallid wasted face with all its marks of suffering and intense eagerness of expression increased by the difficulty of utterance and need of subduing agitation he felt that the longmisunderstood patience and endurance had earned something and he knew too that for all his grandsons submission and respect the boy as a husband and father had rights and duties that would assert themselves manfully if opposed it was true that the seavoyage obviated many difficulties and it was better to consent with a good grace than drive one hitherto so dutiful to rebellion he did then consent and was rewarded by the lightning flash of joy and gratitude in the bright blue eyes and the fervent pressure and kiss of his hand as berenger exclaimed ah sir eustacie will be such a daughter to you you should have seen how the admiral liked her  the news of lord walwyns consent raised much commotion in the family dame annora was sure her poor son would be murdered outright this time and that nobody cared because he was only her son and she strove hard to stir up sir marmaduke to remonstrate with her father but the good knight had never disputed a judgment of my lords in his whole life and had even received his first wife from his hands when forsaken by the gay annora so she could only ride over the combe be silenced by her father as effectually as if jupiter had nodded and bewail and murmur to her mother till she lashed lady walwyn up into finding every possible reason why berenger should and must sail then she went home was very sharp with lucy and was reckoned by saucy little nan to have nineteen times exclaimed tilleyvalley in the course of one day  the effect upon philip was a vehement insistence on going with his brother he was sure no one else would see to berry half as well and as to letting berry go to be murdered again without him he would not hear of it he must go he would not stay at home he should not study no no he should be ready to hang himself for vexation and thinking what they were doing to his brother and thus he extorted from his kindhearted father an avowal that he should be easier a bout the lad if phil were there and that he might go provided berry would have him and my lord saw no objection the first point was soon settled and as to the second there was no reason at all that philip should not go where his brother did in fact excepting for berengers state of health there was hardly any risk about the matter master hobbs to whom philip rode down ecstatically to request him to come and speak to my lord was a stout honest experienced seaman who was perfectly at home in the bay of biscay and had so strong a feudal feeling for the house of walwyn that he placed himself and his best ship the throstle entirely at his disposal the throstle was a capital sailer and carried arms quite sufficient in english hands to protect her against algerine corsairs or spanish pirates he only asked for a week to make her cabin ready for the reception of a lady and this time was spent in sending a post to london to obtain for berenger the permit from the queen and the passport from the french ambassador without which he could not safely have gone and as a further precaution letters were requested from some of the secret agents of the huguenots to facilitate his admission into la sablerie  in the meantime poor mr adderley had submitted meekly to the decree that sentenced him to weeks of misery on board the throstle but to his infinite relief an inspection of the cabins proved the space so small that berenger represented to him grandfather that the excellent tutor would be only an incumbrance to himself and every one else and that with philip he should need no one indeed he had made such a start into vigour and alertness during the last few days that there was far less anxiety about him though with several sighs for poor osbert cecily initiated philip into her simple rules for her patients treatment in case of the return of his more painful symptoms the notion of sending female attendants for eustacie was also abandoned her husbands presence rendered them unnecessary or they might be procured at la sablerie and thus it happened that the only servants whom berenger was to take with him were humfrey holt and john smithers the same honest fellows whose steadiness had so much conduced to his rescue at paris  claude de mericour had in the meantime been treated as an honoured guest at combe walwyn and was in good esteem with its master he would have set forth at once on his journey to scotland but that lord walwyn advised him to wait and ascertain the condition of his relatives there before throwing himself on them berenger had accordingly when writing to sidney by the messenger above mentioned begged him to find out from sir robert melville the scottish envoy all he could about the family whose designation he wrote down at a venture from mericours lips  sidney returned a most affectionate answer saying that he had never been able to believe the little shepherdess a traitor and was charmed that she had proved herself a heroine he should endeavour to greet her with all his best powers as a poet when she should brighten the english court but his friend master spenser alone was fit to celebrate such constancy as to m labbe de mericours friends sir robert melville had recognized their name at once and had pronounced them to be fierce catholics and queensmen so sorely pressed by the douglases that it was believed they would soon fly the country altogether and sidney added what lord walwyn had already said that to seek scotland rather than france as a restingplace in which to weigh between calvinism and catholicism was only trebly hot and fanatical his counsel was that m de mericour should so far conform himself to the english church as to obtain admission to one of the universities and through his uncle of leicester he could obtain for him an opening at oxford where he might fully study the subject  there was much to incline mericour to accept this counsel he had had much conversation with mr adderley and had attended his ministrations in the chapel and both satisfied him far better than what he had seen among the french calninists and the peace and family affection of the two houses were like a new world to him but he had not yet made up his mind to that absolute disavowal of his own branch of the church which alone could have rendered him eligible for any foundation at oxford his attainments in classics would mr adderley thought reach such a standard as to gain one of the very few scholarships open to foreigners and his noble blood revolted at becoming a pensioner of leicesters or of any other nobleman  lord walwyn upon this made an earnest offer of his hospitality and entreated the young man to remain at hurst walwyn till the return of berenger and philip during which time he might study under the directions of mr adderley and come to a decision whether to seek reconciliation with his native church and his brother or to remain in england in this latter case he might perhaps accompany both the youths to oxford for in spite of berengers marriage his education was still not supposed to be complete and when mericour still demurred with reluctance to become a burden on the bounty of the noble house he was reminded gracefully of the debt of gratitude that the family owed to him for the relief he had brought to berenger and moreover dame annora giggled out that if he would teach nan and bess to speak and read french and italian it would be worth something to them the others of the family would have hushed up this uncalledfor proposal but mericour caught at it as the most congenial mode of returning the obligation every morning he undertook to walk or ride over to the manor and there gave his lessons to the young ladies with whom he was extremely popular he was a far more brilliant teacher than lucy and ten thousand times preferable to mr adderley who had once begun to teach annora her accidence with lamentable want of success     chapter xxiii the empty cradle               eager to know      the worst and with that fatal certainty       to terminate intolerable dread       he spurred his courser forwardall his fears       too surely are fulfilledsouthey   contrary winds made the voyage of the throstle much more tardy than had been reckoned on by berengers impatience but hope was before him and he often remembered his days in the little vessel as much happier than he had known them to be at the time  it was in the calm days of right october that captain hobbs at length was putting into the little harbour nearest to la sablerie berenger on that morning had for the first time been seized by a fit of anxiety as to the impression his face would make with its terrible purple scar great patch and bald forehead and had brought out a little black velvet mask called a tour de nez often used in riding to protect the complexion intending to prepare eustacie for his disfigurement he had fastened on a carnationcoloured swordknot would a scarf of the same colour across his shoulder clasped a long ostrich plume into his broad spanish hat and looked out his deeplyfringed spanish gloves and philip was laughing merrily not to say rudely at him for trying to deck himself out so bravely  see master hobbs cried the boy in his high spirits as he followed his brother on deck you did not know you had so fine a gallant on board here be braveries for my lady  hush phil broke in berenger who had hitherto taken all the raillery in perfect good part what is amiss master hobbs  i cannot justly say sir returned master hobbs without taking his gaze off the coast but by yonder banks and creeks this should be the sables dolonne and i do not see the steeple of la sablerie which has always been the landmark for the harbour of st julien  what do you understand by that asked berenger more struck by his manner than his words  well sir if i am right a steeple that has stood three or four hundred years does not vanish out of sight like a cloud of smoke for nothing i may be lightning to be sure or the protestants may have had it down for popery but methinks they would have too much christian regard for poor mariners than to knock down the only landmark on this coast till you come to nissard spire then he hailed the man at the masthead demanding if he saw the steeple of la sablerie no no sir but as other portions of the land became clearer there was no doubt that the throstle was right in her bearings so the skipper gave orders to cast anchor and lower a boat the passengers would have pressed him with inquiries as to what he thought the absence of his landmark could portend but he hurried about and shouted orders with the deaf despotism of a nautical commander and only when all was made ready turned round and said now sir maybe you had best let me go ashore first and find out how the land lies  never said berenger in an agony of impatience  i thought so said the captain well then sir are your fellows ready armed all right  so berenger descended to the boat followed by philip next came the captain and then the two servingmen six of the crew were ready to row them to the shore and were bidden by their captain to return at once to the vessel and only return on a signal from him the surging rush of intense anxiety sure to precede the destined moment of the consummation of hope long deferred kept berenger silent choked by something between fear and prayer but philip less engrossed asked master hobbs if it were not strange that none of the inhabitants of the squalid little huts on the shore had not put out to greet them in some of the boats that were drawn up on the beach  poor wretches said hobbs they scarce know friend from foe and are slow to run their heads into the lions mouth strange fellows have the impudence to sail under our flag at times  however as they neared the low flat sandy shore a few red caps peeped out at the cottagedoors and then apparently gaining confidence from the survey some wiry active figures appeared and were hailed by hobbs his bordeaux trade had rendered him master of the coast language and a few incomprehensible shouts between him and the natives resulted in a line being thrown to them and the boat dragged as near as possible to the landingplace when half a dozen ran up splashing with their bare legs to offer their shoulders for the transport of the passengers both of whom were seized upon before they were aware philip struggling with all his might till a call from captain hobbs warned him to resign himself and then he became almost helpless with laughter at the figure cut by the longlegged berenger upon a small fishermans back  they were landed could it be that berenger was only two milesonly half an hours walk form eustacie the bound his heart gave as he touched the shore seemed to stifle him he could not believe it yet he knew how fully he had believed it the next moment when he listened to what the fishermen were saying to captain hobbs  did monsieur wish to go to la sablerie ah then he did not know what had happened the soldiers had been there there had been a great burning they had been out in their boats at sea but they had seen the sky redred as a furnace all night and the steeple was down surely monsieur had missed the steeple that was a guide to all poor seafarers and now they had to go all the way to brancour to sell their fish  and the townspeople hobbs asked  ah poor things twas pity of them for they were honest folk to deal with even if they were heretics they loved fish at other seasons if not in lent and it seemed but a fair return to go up and bury as many of them as were not burnt to nothing in their church and dom colombeau the good priest of nissard has said it was a pious work and he was a saint if any one was  alack sir said hobbs laying his hand on the arm of berenger who seemed neither to have breathed nor moved while the man was speaking i feared that there had been some such bloody work when i missed the steeple but take heart yet your lady is very like to have been out of the way we might make for la rochelle and there learn then again to the fisherman none escaped fellow  not one replied the man they say that one of the great folks was in a special rage with them for sheltering the lady he should have wedded but who had broken convent and turned heretic and they had victualled montgomerys pirates too  and the lady continued hobbs ever trying to get a more supporting hold of his young charge in case the rigid tension of his limbs should suddenly relax  i cannot tell sir i am a poor fisher but i could guide you to the place where old gillot is always poking about he listened to their preachings and knows more than we do  let us go said berenger at once beginning to stride along in his heavy boots through the deep sand philip who had hardly understood a word of the patois caught hold of him and begged to be told what had happened but master hobbs drew the boy off and explained to him and to the two men what were the dreadful tidings that had wrought such a change in berengers demeanour the way over the shifting sands was toilsome enough to all the rest of the party but berenger scarcely seemed to feel the deep plunge at every step as they almost ploughed their way along for the weary two miles before a few green bushes and halfchoked trees showed that they were reaching the confines of the sandy waste berenger had not uttered a word the whole time and his silence hushed the others the ground began to rise grass was seen still struggling to grow and presently a large straggling mass of black and gray ruins revealed themselves with the remains of a once welltrodden road leading to them but the road led to a gateway choked by a fallen jamb and barred door and the guide led them round the ruins of the wall to the opening where the breach had been the sand was already blowing in and no doubt veiled much for the streets were scarcely traceable through remnants of houses more or less dilapidated with shreds of broken or burnt household furniture within them  ask him for la rue des trois fees hoarsely whispered berenger  the fisherman nodded but soon seemed at fault and an old man followed by a few children soon appearing laden with piece of fuel he appealed to him as father gillot and asked whether he could find the street the old man seemed at home in the ruins and led the way readily did he know the widow laurents house  mademoiselle footnote this was the title of bourgeoise wives for many years in france laurent full well he knew her a good pious soul was she always ready to die for the truth he added as he read sympathy in the faces round and no doubt she had witnessed a good confession  knew he aught of the lady she had lodged  he knew nothing of ladies something he had heard of the good widow having sheltered that shining light isaac gardon quenched no doubt in the same destruction but for his part he had a daughter in one of the isles out there who always sent for him if she suspected danger here on the mainland and he had only returned to his poor farm a day or two after michaelmas so saying he led them to the threshold of a ruinous building in the very centre as it were of the desolation and said that gentlemen is where the poor honest widow kept her little shop  black burnt dreary lay the hospitable abode the building had fallen but the beams of the upper floor had fallen aslant so as to shelter a portion of the lower room where the redtile pavement the hearth with the gray ashes of the harmless homefire some unbroken crocks a chain and a sabot were still visible making the contrast of dreariness doubly mournful  berenger had stepped over the threshold with his hat in his hand as if the ruin were a sacred place to him and stood gazing in a transfixed deadened way the captain asked where the remains were  our people said the old man and the fisher laid them by night in the earth near the church  just then berengers gaze fell on something half hidden under the fallen timbers he instantly sprang forward and used all his strength to drag it out in so headlong a manner that all the rest hurried to prevent his reckless proceedings from bringing the heavy beams down on his head when brought to light the object proved to be one of the dark heavy wooden cradles used by the french peasantry shining with age but untouched by fire  look in berenger signed to philip his own eyes averted his mouth set  the cradle was empty totally empty save for a woolen covering a little mattress and a string of small yellow shells threaded  berenger held out his hand grasped the babyplay thing convulsively then dropped upon his knees clasping his hands over his ashy face the string of shells still wound among his fingers perhaps he had hitherto hardly realized the existence of his child and was solely wrapped up in the thought of his wife but the wooden cradle the homely toy stirred up fresh depths of feelings he saw eustacie wither tender sweetness as a mother he beheld the little likeness of her in the cradle and oh that this should have been the end unable to repress a moan of anguish from a bursting heart he laid his face against the senseless wood and kissed it again and again then lay motionless against it save for the longdrawn gasps and sobs that shook his frame philip torn to the heart would have almost forcibly drawn him away but master hobbs with tears running down his honest cheeks withheld the boy dont ye master thistlewood twill do him good poor young gentleman i know how it was when i came home and found our first little lad that we had thought so much on had been take but then he was safe laid in his own churchyard and his mother was there to meet me while your poor brotherah god comfort him  le pauvre monsieur exclaimed the old peasant struck at the sight of his grief was it then his child and he no doubt lying wounded elsewhere while gods hand was heavy on this place yet he might hear more they said the priest came down and carried off the little ones to be bred up in convents  whowhere asked berenger raising his head as if catching at a straw in this drowning of all his hopes  tis true added the fisherman it was the holy priest of nissard for he send down to st julien for a woman to nurse the babes  to nissard then said berenger rising  it is but a chance said the old huguenot many of the innocents were with their mothers in yonder church better for them to perish like the babes of bethlehem than to be bred up in the house of baal but perhaps monsieur is english and if so he might yet obtain the child yet he must not hope too much  no for there was many a little corpse among those we buried said the fisher will the gentleman see the place  oh no exclaimed philip understanding the actions and indeed many of the words this place will kill him  to the grave said berenger as if he heard nothing  see added philip there are better things than graves and he pointed to a young green sucker of a vine which stimulated by the burnt soil had shot up between the tiles of the floor look there is hope to meet you even here  berenger merely answered by gathering a leaf from the vine and putting it into his bosom and philip whom only extreme need could have thus inspired perceived that he accepted it as the augury of hope  berenger turned to bid the two men bear the cradle with them and then followed the old man out into the place once a pleasant open paved square now grassgrown and forlorn on one side lay the remains of the church the huguenots had been so predominant at la sablerie as to have engrossed the building and it had therefore shared the general destruction and lay in utter desolate ruin a mere shell and the once noble spire the mariners guiding star blown up with guncruel that ever desolated the country beyond lay the burialground in unspeakable dreariness the crossed of the catholic dead had been levelled by the fanaticism of the huguenots and though a great dominant stone cross raised on steps had been reerected it stood uneven tottering and desolate among nettles weeds and briers there seemed to have been a few deep trenches dug to receive the bodies of the many victims of the siege and only rudely and slightly filled in with loose earth on which philippe treading had nearly sunk in so much to his horror that he could hardly endure the long contemplation in which his brother stood gazing on the dismal scene as if to bear it away with him did the fair being he had left in a kings palace sleep her last sleep her last sleep amid the tangled grass the thistles and briers that grew so close that it was hardly possible to keep from stumbling over them where all memorials of friend or foe were alike obliterated was a restingplace among these nameless graves the best he could hope for the wife whose eyes he had hoped by this time would be answering his ownwas this her shelter from foe from sword famine and fire  a great seabird swooping along with broad wings and wild wailing cry completed the weird dismay that had seized on philip and clutching at his brothers cloak he exclaimed berry berry let us be gone or we shall both be distraught  berenger yielded passively but when the ruins of the town had been again crossed and the sad little party after amply rewarding the old man were about to return to st julien he stood still saying which is the way to nissard and as the men pointed to the south he added show me the way thither  captain hobbs now interfered he knew the position of nissard among dangerous sandbanks between which a boat could only venture at the higher tides and by daylight to go the six miles thither at present would make it almost impossible to return to the throstle that night and it was absolutely necessary that he at least should do this he therefore wished the young gentleman to return with him on board sleep there and be put ashore at nissard as soon as it should be possible in the morning but berenger shook his head he could not rest for a moment till he had ascertained the fate of eustacies child action alone could quench the horror of what he had recognized as her own lot and the very pursuit of this one thread of hope seemed needful to him to make it substantial he would hear of nothing but walking at once to nissard and captain hobbs finding it impossible to debate the point with one so dazed and crushed with grief and learning from the fishermen that not only was the priest one of the kindest and most hospitable men living but that there was a tolerable caberet not far from the house selected from the loiterers who had accompanied them from st julien a trustworthylooking active lad as a guide and agreed with the high tide on the morrow either to concert measures for obtaining possession of the lost infant or if all were in vain to fetch them off then he with the mass of stragglers from st julien went off direct for the coast while the two young brothers their two attendants and the fishermen turned southwards along the summit of the dreary sandbanks     chapter xxiv the good priest of nissard    till at the set of sun all tracks and ways in darkness lay enshrouded and een thus the utmost limit of the great profound at length we reachd where in dark gloom and mist cimmerias people and their city lie enveloped everodyssey musgrove   the october afternoon had set in before the brothers were the way to nissard and in spite of berengers excited mood the walk through the soft sinking sand could not be speedily performed it was that peculiar sanddrift which is the curse of so many coasts slowly silently irresistibly flowing blowing creeping in and gradually choking all vegetation and habitation soft and almost impalpable it lay heaped in banks yielding as air and yet far more than deep enough to swallow up man and horse nay tops of trees summits of chimneys told what it had already swallowed the whole scene far and wide presented nothing but the lone tame undulations liable to be changed by every wind and solitary beyond expressiona few rabbits scudding hither and thither or a seagull floating with white ghostly wings in the air being the only living things visible on the one hand a dim purple horizon showed that the inhabited country lay miles inland on the other lay the pale gray misty expanse of sea on which philips eyes could lovingly discern the throstles masts  that view was philips chief comfort the boy was feeling more eerie and uncomfortable than ever he had been before as he plodded along sinking deep with every step almost up to his ankles in the sand on which the barefooted guide ran lightly and berenger though sinking no less deeply seemed insensible to all inconveniences this desolateness was wellnigh unbearable no one dared to speak while berenger thus moved on in the unapproachableness of his great grief and philip presently began to feel a dreamy sense that they had all thus been moving for years that this was the worlds end the land of shadows and that his brother was a ghost already besides vague alarms like these there was the dismal english and protestant prejudice in full force in philips mind which regarded the resent ground as necessarily hostile and all frenchmen above all french priests as in league to cut off every englishman and protestant he believed himself in a country full of murderers and was walking on with the one determination that his brother should not rush on danger without him and that the popish rogues should be kept in mind that there was an english ship in sight alas that consolation was soon lost for a dense gray mist was slowly creeping in from the sea and blotted out the vessel then gathered in closer and obliterated all landmarks gradually it turned to a heavy rain and about the same time the ground on which they walked became no longer loose sandhills but smooth and level it was harder likewise from the wet and this afforded better walking but there lay upon it fragments of weed and shell as though it were liable to be covered by the sea and there was a low languid plash of the tide which could not be seen twilight began to deepen the mist the guide was evidently uneasy he sidled up to philip and began to ask what hehitherto obstinately deaf and contemptuous to frenchwas very slow to comprehend at last he found it was a question how near it was to all souls day and then came an equally amazing query whether the gentlemens babe had been baptized for it appeared that on all souls day the spirits of unchristened infants had the power of rising from the sands in a bewildering mist and leading wayfarers into the sea and the poor guide white and drenched vowed he never would have undertaken this walk if he had only thought of this these slaughters of heretics must so much have augmented the number of the poor little spirits and no doubt monsieur would be specially bewildered by one so nearly concerned with him philip half frightened could not help stepping forward and pulling berenger by the cloak to make him aware of this strange peril but he did not get much comfort baptized yes you know she was by the old nurse let me alone i say i would follow her wherever she called me the innocent and gladthe sooner the better  and he shook his brother off with a sadness and impatience so utterly unapproachable that philip poor boy could only watch his tall figure in the wide cloak and slouched hat stalking on ever more indistinct in the gloom while his much confused mind tried to settle the theological point whether the old nurses baptism were valid enough to prevent poor little berangere from becoming one of these mischievous deluders and all this was varied by the notion of captain hobbs picking up their corpses on the beach and of sir marmaduke bewailing his only son  at last a strange muffled sound made him start in the dead silence but the guide hailed the sound with a joyful cry  hola blessings on notredame and holy father colombeau now are we saved and on philips hasty interrogation he explained that it was from the bells of nissard which the good priest always caused to be rung during these seafogs to disperse all evil beings and guide the wanderers  the guide strode on manfully as the sound became clearer and nearer and philip was infinitely relived to be free from all supernatural anxieties and to have merely to guard against the wiles of a polish priest a being almost as fabulously endowed in his imagination as poor little berangeres soul could be in that of the fisherman  the drenching atlantic mist had wetted them all to the skin and closed round them so like a solid wall that they had almost lost sight of each other and had nothing but the bells voices to comfort them till quite suddenly there was a light upon the mist a hazy reddish gleama window seemed close to them the guide heartily thanking our lady and st julian knocked at a door which opened at once into a warm bright superior sort of kitchen where a neatlydressed elderly peasant woman exclaimed welcome poor souls enter then here good father are some bewildered creatures eh wrecked are you good folks or lost in the fog  at the same moment there came from behind the screen that shut off the fire from the door a benignantlooking hale old man in a cassock with long white hair on his shoulders and a cheerful face ruddy from seawind  welcome my friends he said thanks to the saints who have guided you safely you are drenched come to the fire at once  and as they moved on into the full light of the fire and the rude iron lamp by which he had been reading and he saw the draggled plumes and other appurtenances that marked the two youths as gentlemen he added are you wrecked messieurs we will do our poor best for your accommodation and while both mechanically murmured a word of thanks and removed their soaked hats the good man exclaimed as he beheld berengers ashy face with the sunken eyes and deep scars monsieur should come to bed at once he is apparently recovering from a severe wound this way sir jolitte shall make you some hot tisane  wait sir said berenger very slowly and his voice sounding hollow from exhaustion they say that you can tell me of my child let me hear  monsieurs child exclaimed the bewildered curate looking from him to philip and then to the guide who poured out a whole stream of explanation before philip had arranged three words of french  you hear sir said berenger as the man finished i came hither to seek my wife the lady of ribaumont  eh exclaimed the cure do i then see m le marquis de nid de merle  no cried berenger no i am not that scelerat i am her true husband the baron de ribaumont  the baron de ribaumont perished at the st bartholomew said the cure fixing his eyes on him as though to confute an impostor  ah would that i had said berenger i was barely saved with the life that is but misery now i came to seek heri found what you know they told me that you saved the children ah tell me where mine isall that is left me  a few poor babes i was permitted to rescue but very few but let me understand to whom i speak he added much perplexed you sir  i am her husband married at five years oldcontract renewed last year it was he whom you call nid de merle who fell on me and left me for dead a faithful servant saved my life but i have lain sick in england till now when her letter to my mother brought me to la sablerie to findto find this oh sir have pity on me tell me if you know anything of her or if you can give me her child  the orphans i was able to save arethe boys at nurse here the girls with the good nuns at lucon said the priest with infinite pity in his look should you know it sir  i wouldi should said berenger but it is a girl ah would that it were here but youyou siryou know more than these fellows is there nono hope of herself  alas i fear i can give you none said the priest but i will tell all i know only i would fain see you eat rest and be dried  how can i gasped he allowing himself however to sink into a chair and the priest spoke  perhaps you know sir that the poor lady fled from her friends and threw herself upon the huguenots all trace had been lost when at a banquet given by the mayor of lucon there appeared some patisseries which some ecclesiastic who had enjoyed the hospitality of bellaise recognized as peculiar to the convent there where she had been brought up they were presented to the mayor by his friend bailli la grasse who had boasted of the excellent confitures of the heretic pastors daughter that lodged in the town of la sablerie the place was in disgrace for having afforded shelter and supplies to montgomerys pirate crews and there were narrations of outrages committed on catholics the army were enraged by their failure before la rochelle in effect it was resolved to make an example when on m de nid de merles summons all knowledge of the lady was denied is it possible that she was indeed not there  berenger shook his head she was indeed there he said with an irrepressible groan was there no mercynone  ask not sir said the compassionate priest the flesh shrinks though there may be righteous justice a pillaged town when men are enraged is like a place of devils unchained i reached it only after it had been taken by assault when all was flame and blood ask me no more it would be worse for you to hear than me to tell he concluded shuddering but laying his hand kindly on berengers arm at least it is ended now and god is more merciful than men many died by the bombs cast into to city and she for whom you ask certainly fell not alive into the hands of those who sought her take comfort sir there is one who watches and takes count of our griefs sir turning to philip this gentleman is too much spent with sorrow to bear this cold and damp aid me i entreat to persuade him to lie down  philip understood the priests french far better than that of the peasants and added persuasions that berenger was far too much exhausted and stunned to resist to spend a night in a popish priests house would once have seemed to philip a shocking alternative yet here he was heartily assisting in removing the wet garments in which his brother had sat only too long and was heartily relieved to lay him down in the priests own bed even though there was an image over the head which indeed the boy never saw he only saw his brother turn away from the light with a low heavy moan as if he would fain be left alone with his sorrow and his crushed hopes  nothing could be kinder than dome colombeau the priest of nissard he saw to the whole of his guests being put into some sort of dry habiliments before they sat round his table to eat of the savoury mess in the great potaufeu which had since their arrival received additional ingredients and moreover sundry villagers had crept into the house whenever the good father supped at home any of his flock were welcome to drop in to enjoy his hospitability after a cup of hot cider round they carried off the fisherman to ledge in one of their cottages shakedowns were found for the others and philip wondering what was to become of the good host himself gathered that he meant to spend such part of the night on the kitchen floor as he did not pass in prayer in the church for the poor young gentleman who was in such affliction philip was not certain whether to resent this as an impertinence or an attack on their protestant principles but he was not sure either that the priest was aware what was their religion and was still less certain of his own comprehension of these pious intentions he decided that any way it was better not to make a fool of himself still the notion of the mischievousness of priests was so rooted in his head that he consulted humfrey on the expedience of keeping watch all night but was sagaciously answered that these french rogues dont do any hurt unless they be brought up to it and the place was as safe as old hurst  in fact philips vigilance would have been strongly against nature he never awoke till full daylight and morning sun were streaming through the vineleaves round the window and then to his dismay he saw that berenger had left his bed and was gone suspicions of foul play coming over him in full force as he gazed round on much that he considered as popish furniture he threw on his clothes and hastened to open the door when to his great relief he saw berenger hastily writing at a table under the window and smithers standing by waiting for the billet  i am sending smithers on board to ask hobbs to bring our cloak bags said berenger as his brother entered we must go on to lucon  he spoke briefly and decidedly and philip was satisfied to see him quite calm and collectedwhite indeed and with the old haggard look and the great scar very purple instead of red which was always a bad sign with him he was not disposed to answer questions he shortly said he had slept not less than usual which philip knew meant very little and he had evidently made up his mind and was resolved not to let himself give way if his beacon of hope had been so suddenly frightfully quenched he still was kept from utter darkness by straining his eyes and forcing his steps to follow the tiny flickering spark that remained  the priest was at his morning mass and so soon as berenger had given his note to smithers and sent him off with a fisherman to the throstle he took up his hat and went out upon the beach that lay glistening in the morning sun then turned straight towards the tall spire of the church with had been their last nights guide philip caught his cloak  you are never going there berenger  vex me not now was all the reply he got there the dead and living meet together  but brother they will take you for one of their own sort  let them  philip was right that it was neither a prudent nor consistent proceeding but berenger had little power of reflection and his impulse at present bore him into the church belonging to his native faith and land without any defined felling save that it was peace to kneel there among the scattered worshippers who came and went with their fishbaskets in their hands and to hear the low chant of the priest and his assistant from within the screen  philip meantime marched up and down outside in much annoyance until the priest and his brother came out when the first thing he heard the good colombeau say was i would have called upon you before my son but that i feared you were a huguenot  i am an english protestant said berenger but ah sir i needed comfort too much to stay away from prayer  pere colombeau looked at him in perplexity thinking perhaps that here might be a promising convert if there were only time to work on him but berenger quitted the subject at once asking the distance to lucon  a full days journey answered pere colombeau and added i am sorry you are indeed a huguenot it was what i feared last night but i feared to add to your grief the nuns are not permitted to deliver up children to huguenot relations  i am her father exclaimed berenger indignantly  that goes for nothing according to the rules of the church said the priest the church cannot yield her children to heresy  but we in england and not calvinists cried berenger we are not like your huguenots  the church would make no difference said the priest stay sir as berenger stuck his own forehead and was about to utter a fierce invective remember that if your child lives it is owing to the pity of the good nuns you seem not far from the bosom of the church did you but return  it is vain to speak of that said berenger quickly say sir would an order from the king avail to open these doors  of course it would if you have the influence to obtain one  i have i have cried berenger eagerly the king has been my good friend already moreover my english grandfather will deal with the queen the heiress of our house cannot be left in a foreign nunnery say sir he added turning to the priest if i went to lucon at once know your name and refuse all dealings with you  she could not do so if i brought an order from the king  certainly not  then to paris and laying his hand on philips shoulder he asked the boy whether he had understood ad explained that he must go at once to parisriding postand obtain the order from the king  to paristo be murdered again said philip in dismay  they do not spend their time there in murder said berenger and now is the time while the savage villain narcisse is with his master in poland i cannot but go philip we both waste words you shall take home a letter to my lord  ii go not home without you said philip doggedly  i cannot take you phil i have no warrant  i have warrant for going though my father said he was easier about you with me at your side where you go i go  the brothers understood each others ways so well that berenger knew the intonation in philips voice that meant that nothing should make him give way he persuaded no more only took measures for the journey in which the kind priest gave him friendly advice there was no doubt that the good man pitied him sincerely and wished him success more than perhaps he strictly ought to have done unless as a possible convert of money for the journey there was no lack for berenger had brought a considerable sum intending to reward all who had befriended eustacie as well as to fit her out for the voyage and this perhaps with his papers he had brought ashore to facilitate his entrance into la sableriethat entrance which alas he had found only too easy he had therefore only to obtain horses and a guide and this could be done at la motteachard where the party could easily be guided on foot or conveyed in a boat if the fog should not set in again but all the coastline of nissard was dangerous in autumn and winter nay even this very august an old man with his daughter her infant and a donkey had been found bewildered between the creeks on a sandbank where they stood still and patient like a picture of the flight into egypt when an old fisherman found them and brought them to the beneficent shelter of the presbytere  stories of this kind were told at the meal that was something partaking of the nature of both breakfast and early dinner but where berenger ate little and spoke less philip watched him anxiously the boy thought the journey a perilous experiment every way but boyishly was resolved neither to own his fears of it nor to leave his brother external perils he was quite ready to face and he fancied that his english birth would give him some power of protecting berenger but he was more reasonably in dread of the present shock bringing on such an illness as the last relapse and if berenger lost his senses again what should they do he even ventured to hint at this danger but berenger answered that will scarce happen again my head is stronger now besides it was doing nothing and hearing her truth profaned that crazed me no one at least will do that again but if you wish to drive me frantic again the way would be to let hobbs carry me home without seeking her child  philip bore this in mind when with floodtide master hobbs landed and showed himself utterly dismayed at the turn affairs had taken he saw the needlessness of going to lucon without royal authority indeed he thought it possible that the very application there might give the alarm and cause all tokens of the childs identity to be destroyed in order to save her from her heretic relations but he did not at all approve of the young gentlemen going off to paris at once it was against his orders he felt bound to take them home as he has brought them and they might then make a fresh start if it so pleased them but how could he return to my lord and sir duke without them mr ribaumont might be rightit was not for him to say a father ought not to look after his childyet he was but a stripling himself and my lord had said master hobbs i trust him to you he would clearly have liked to have called in a boats crew mastered the young gentlemen and carried them on board as captives but as this was out of his power he was obliged to yield the point he disconsolately accepted the letters in which berenger had explained all and in which he promised to go at once to sir francis walsinghams at paris to run into no needless danger and to watch carefully over philip and craved pardon in a respectful but yet manly and determined tone for placing his duty to his lost deserted child above his submission to his grandfather then engaging to look out for a signal on the coast if he should said to bordeaux in january to touch and take the passengers off captain hobbs took leave and the brothers were left to their own resources     chapter xxv the velvet coach        no my good lord diana            alls well that ends well   a late autumn journey from the west coast to paris was a more serious undertaking in the sixteenth century than the good seaman master hobbs was aware of or he would have used stronger dissuasive measures against such an undertaking by the two youths when the elder was in so frail a state of health but there had been a certain deceptive strength and vigour about young ribaumont while under strong excitement and determination and the whole party fancied him far fitter to meet the hardships than was really the case philip thistlewood always recollected that journey as the most distressing period of his life  they were out of the ordinary highways and therefore found the hiring of horses often extremely difficult they had intended to purchase but found no animals that as philip said they would have accepted as a gift though at every wretched inn where they had to wait while the country was scoured for the miserable jades their proposed requirements fell lower and lower dens of smoke dirt and boorishness were the great proportion of those inns where they were compelled to take refuge by the breaking down of one or other of the beasts or by stress of weather snow rain thaw and frost alternated each variety rendering the roads impassable and at the best the beasts could seldom be urged beyond a walk fetlockdeep in mire or water worse than all berenger far from recovered and under the heavy oppression of a heartrending grief could hardly fail to lose the ground that he had gained under the influence of hope the cold seemed to fix itself on the wound on his cheek terrible pain and swelling set in depriving him entirely of sleep permitting him to take no nourishment but fragments of soft crumbs soaked in wine or brothwhen the inns afforded any such fareand rendering speech excessively painful and at last unintelligible  happily this was not until philip and humfrey both had picked up all the most indispensable words to serve their needs and storming could be done in any language besides they had fallen in at la motteachard with a sharp fellow named guibert who had been at sea and knew a little english was a norman by birth knew who the baron de ribaumont was and was able to make himself generally useful though ill supplying the place of poor osbert who would have been invaluable in the present predicament nothing was so much dreaded by any of the party as that their chief should become utterly unable to proceed once let him be laid up at one of these little auberges and philip felt as if all would be over with him and he himself was always the most restlessly eager to push on and seemed to suffer less even in the biting wind and sleet than on the dirty pallets or in the smoky noisy kitchens of the inns that there was no wavering of consciousness was the only comfort and philip trusted to prevent this by bleeding him whenever his head seemed aching or heated and under this wellmeant surgery it was no wonder that he grew weaker every day in spite of the most affectionate and assiduous watching on his brothers part  nearly six weeks had been spent in struggling along the crossroads or rather in endless delays and when at last they came on more frequented ways with better inns wellpaved chaussees and horses more fit for use berenger was almost beyond feeling the improvement at their last halt even philip was for waiting and sending on to paris to inform sir francis walsingham of their situation but berenger only shook his head dressed himself and imperatively signed to go on it was a bright morning with a clear frost and the towers and steeples of paris presently began to appear above the poplars that bordered the way but by this time berenger was reeling in his saddle and he presently became so faint and dizzy that philip and humfrey were obliged to lift him from his horse and lay him under an elmtree that stood a little back from the road  look up sir it is but a league further quoth humfrey i can see the roof of the big church they call notredame  he does not open his eyes he is swooning said philip he must have some cordial ere he can sit his horse can you think of no lace where we could get a drop of wine or strong waters  not i master philip we passed a convent wall but now but twas a nunnery as good as a grave against poor travelers i would ride on and get some of sir franciss folk to bring a litter or coach but i doubt me if i could get past the barrier without my young lords safeconduct  berenger hearing all here made an effort to raise himself but sank back against philips shoulder just then a trampling and lumbering became audible and on the road behind appeared first three horsemen riding abreast streaming with black and white ribbons then eight pair of black horses a man walking at the crested heads of each couple and behind these a coach shaped like an urn reversed and with a coronet on the top silvered while the vehicle itself was melonlike fluted alternately black with silver figures and white with black landscapes and with white draperies embroidered with black and silver floating from the windows four lacqueys in the same magpiecolouring stood behind and outriders followed but as the cavalcade approached the group by the roadside one of the horsemen paused saying lightly over near the walls from an affair of honour has he caught it badly who was the other  ere guibert could answer the curtains were thrust aside the coach stopped a ladys head and hand appeared and a female voice exclaimed in much alarm halt ho you there in our colours come here what is it my brother here is he wounded  it is no wound madame said guibert shoved forward by his english comrades it is m le baron de ribaumont who is taken ill andah here is monsieur philippe  for philip seeing a thick black veil put back from the face of the most beautiful lady who had ever appeared to him stepped forward hat in hand as she exclaimed le baron de ribaumont can it be true what means this what ails him  it is his wound madame said philip in his best french it has broken out again and he has almost dropped from his horse from defaillance  ah bring him herelay him on the cushions we will have the honour of transporting him cried the lady and regardless of the wet road she sprang out of the coach with her essences in her hand followed by at least three women two pages and two little white dogs which ran barking towards the prostrate figure but were caught up by their pages ah cousin how dreadful she cried as she knelt down beside him and held her essences towards him voice and scent revived him and with a bewildered look and gesture half of thanks half of refusal he gazed round him then rose to his feet without assistance bent his head and making a sign that he was unable to speak turned towards his horse  cousin cousin exclaimed the lady in whose fine black eyes tears were standing you will let me take you into the cityyou cannot refuse  berry indeed you cannot ride entreated philip you must take her offer are you getting crazed at last  berenger hesitated for a moment but he felt himself again dizzy the exertion of springing into his saddle was quite beyond him and bending his head he submitted passively to be helped into the black and white coach humfrey however clutched philips arm and said impressively have a care sir this is no other than the fine lady sister to the murderous villain that set upon him if you would save his life dont quit him nor let her take him elsewhere than to our ambassadors ill not leave the coachdoor and as soon as we are past the barriers ill send jack smithers to make known we are coming  philip without further ceremony followed the lady into the coach where he found her insisting that berenger who had sunk back in a corner should lay his length of limb muddy boots and all upon the white velvet cushions richly worked in black and silver with devices and mottoes in which the crescent moon and eclipsed or setting suns made a great figure the original inmates seemed to have disposed of themselves in various nooks of the ample conveyance and philip rather at a loss to explain his intrusion perched himself awkwardly on the edge of the cushions in front of his brother thinking that humfrey was an officious suspicious fellow to distrust this lovely lady who seemed so exceedingly shocked and grieved at berengers condition ah i never guessed it had been so frightful as this i should not have known him ah had i imagined she leant back covered her face and wept as one overpowered then after a few seconds she bent forward and would have taken the hand that hung listlessly down but it was at once withdrawn and folded with the other on his breast  can you be more at ease do you suffer much she asked with sympathy and tenderness that went to philips heart and he explained he cannot speak madame the shot in his cheek the lady shuddered and put her handkerchief to her eyes from time to time cases this horrible swelling and torture after that he will be better  frightful frightful she sighed but we will do our best to make up you sir must be his trucheman  philip not catching the last word and wondering what kind of man that might be made answer i am his brother madame  eh monsieur son frere had madame sa mere a son so old  i am philip thistlewood her husbands son at your service madame said philip colouring up to the ears i came with him for he is too weak to be alone  great confidence must be reposed in you sir she said with a not unflattering surprise but whence are you come i little looked to see monsieur here  we came from anjou madame we went to la sablerie and he broke off  i understand ah let us say no more it rends the heart and again she wiped away tear and now  we are coming to the ambassadors to obtainhe stopped for berenger gave him a touch of peremptory warning but the lady saved his embarrassment by exclaiming that she could not let her dear cousin go to the ambassadors when he was among his own kindred perhaps monsieur did not know her she must present herself as madame de selinville nee de ribaumont a poor cousin of ce cher baron and even a little to you m le frere if you will own me and she held out a hand which he ought to have kissed but not knowing how he only shook it she further explained that her brother was at cracow with monsieur now king of poland but that her father lived with her at her hotel and would be enchanted to see his dear cousin only that he like herself would be desolated at the effects of that most miserable of errors she had been returning from her advent retreat at a convent where she had been praying for the soul of the late m de selinville when a true providence had made her remark the colours of her family and now nothing would serve her but that this dear baron should be carried at once to their hotel which was much nearer than that of the ambassador and where every comfort should await him she clasped her hands in earnest entreaty and philip greatly touched by her kindness and perceiving that every jolt of the splendid by springless vehicle caused berengers head a shoot of anguish was almost acceding to her offer when he was checked by one of the most imperative of those silent negatives hitherto master thistlewood had been rather proud of his bad french and as long as he could be understood considered trampling on genders tenses and moods as a manful assertion of englishry but he would just now have given a great deal for the command of any language but a horseboys to use to this beautiful gracious personage merci madame nous ne fallons pas nous avons passe notre parole daller droit a lambassadeurs et pas ou else did not sound very right to his ears he coloured up to the roots of his hair and knew that if berry had had a smile left in him poor fellow he would have smiled now but this most charming and polite of ladies never betrayed it if it were ever such bad french she only bowed her head and said something very prettyif only he could make it outof being the slave of ones word and went on persuading nor did it make the conversation easier that she inquired after berenger and mourned over his injuries as if he were unconscious while philip knew nay was reminded every instant that he was aware of all that was passing most anxious that as little as possible should be said and determined against being taken to her hotel so unreasonable a prejudice did this seem to philip that had it not been for humfreys words he would have doubted whether in spite of all his bleeding his brothers brain were not wandering  however what with humfrey without and berenger within the turn to the ambassadors hotel was duly taken and in process of time a hearty greeting passed between humfrey and the porter and by the time the carriage drew up half the household were assembled on the steps including sir francis himself who had already heard more than a fortnight back from lord walwyn and had become uneasy at the nonarrival of his two young guests on smitherss appearance all had been made ready and as berenger with feeble tardy movements made courteous gestures of thanks to the lady and alighted form the coach he was absolutely received into the dignified arms of the ambassador welcome my poor lad i am glad to see you here again though in such different guise your chamber is ready for you and i have sent my secretary to see if maitre par be at home so we will with gods help have you better at ease anon  even philips fascination by madame de selinville could not hold out against the comfort of hearing english voices all round him and of seeing his brothers anxious brow expand and his hand and eyes return no constrained thanks civilities were exchanged on both sides the ambassador thanked the lady for the assistance she had rendered to his young friend and guest she answered with a shade of stiffness that she left her kinsman in good hands and said she should send to inquire that evening and her father would call on the morrow then as lady walsingham did not ask her in the black and white coach drove away  the lady threw herself back in one corner covered her face and spoke no word her coach pursued its way through the streets and turned at length into another great courtyard surrounded with buildings where she alighted and stepped across a wide but dirty hall where ranks of servants stoop up and bowed as she passed then she ascended a wide carved staircase opened a small private door and entered a tiny wainscoted room hardly large enough for her farthingale to turn round in you veronique come inonly you she said at the door and a waitingwoman who had been in the carriage obeyed no longer clad in the angevin costume but in the richer and less characteristic dress of the ordinary parisian femme de chambre  undo my mantle in haste gasped madame de selinville o veroniqueyou sawwhat destruction  ah if my sweet young lady only known how frightful he had become she had never sacrificed herself sighed veronique  frightful what with the grave blue eyes that seem like the steady avenging judgment of st michael in his triumph in the picture at the louvre murmured madame de selinville then she added quickly yes yes it is well she and you veronique may see him frightful and welcome there are other eyesmake haste girl thereanother handerchief follow me not  and madame de selinville moved out of the room past the great state bedroom and the salle beyond to another chamber where more servants waited and rose at her entrance  is any one with my father  no madame and a page knocking opened the door and announced madame la comtesse  the chevalier in easy deshabille with a flask of good wine iced water and delicate cakes and confitures before him a witty and licentious epigrammatic poem close under his hand sat lazily enjoying the luxuries that it had been his daughters satisfaction to procure for him ever since her marriage he sprang up to meet her with a grace and deference that showed how different a person was the comtesse de selinville from diane de ribaumont  ah ma belle my sweet as there was a mutual kissing of hands thou art returned had i known thine hour i had gone down for thy first embrace but thou lookest fair my child the convent has made thee lovelier than ever  father who think you is here it is hethe baron  the baron eh father she cried impetuously who could it be but one  my child you are mistaken that young hothead can never be thrusting himself here again  but he is father i brought him into paris in my coach i left him at the ambassadors  thou shouldest have brought him here there will be ten thousand fresh imbroglios  i could not he is as immovable as ever though unable to speak oh father he is very ill he suffers terribly oh narcisse ah may i never see him again  but what brings him blundering her again exclaimed the chevalier speak intelligibly child i thought we had guarded against that he knows nothing of the survivance  i cannot tell much he could not open his mouth and his halfbrother a big dull english boy stammered out a few words of shocking french against his will but i believe they had heard of la pauvre petite at la sablerie came over for her and finding the ruin my brother makes wherever he goes are returning seeking intelligence and succour for him  that may be said the chevalier thoughtfully it is well thy brother is in poland i would not see him suffer any more and we may get him back to england ere my son learns that he is here  father there is a better way give him my hand  eh quoi child if thou art tired of devotion there are a thousand better marriages  no father none so good for this family see i bring him allall that i was sold for as the price of that he resigns for ever all his claims to the ancestral castleto la leurre and above all that claim to nid de merle as eustacies widower which should he ever discover the original contract will lead to endless warfare  his marriage with eustacie was annulled yetyet there might be doubts there was the protest and who knows whether they formally renewed their vows when so much went wrong at montpipeau child it is a horrible perplexity i often could wish we had had no warning and the poor things had made off together we could have cried shame till we forced out a provision for thy brother and my poor little eustacie he had tears in his eyes as he broke off  diane made an impatient gesture she would have died of tedium in england or broken forth so as to have a true scandal that is all over father now weigh my proposal nothing else will save my brother from all that his cruel hand merits you will win infinite credit at court the king loved him more than you thought safe  the king has not a year to live child and he has personally offended the king of poland besides this youth is heretic  only by education have i not heard you say that he had by an abjuration and as to monsieurs enmity if it be not forgotten the glory of bringing about a conversion would end that at once  then daughter thou shouldst not have let him bury himself among the english  it was unavoidable father and perhaps if he were here he would live in an untamable state of distrust whereas we may now win him gradually you will go and see him tomorrow my dear father  i must have time to think of this thy sudden device  nay he is in no condition to hear of it at present i did but speak now that you might not regard it as sudden when the fit moment comes it is the fixed purpose of my mind i am no girl now and i could act for myself if i would but as it is for your interest and that of my brother thus to dispose of me it is better that you should act for me  child headstrong child thou wilt make no scandal said the chevalier looking up at his daughters handsome head drawn up proudly with determination  certainly not sir if you will act for me and diane sailed away in her sweeping folds of black brocade  in a few moments more she was kneeling with hands locked together before a muchgilded little waxem figure of st eustacie with his crossbearing stag by his side which stood in a curtained recess in the alcove where her stately bed was placed  monseigneur st eustache ten wax candles everyday to your shrine at bellaise so he recovers ten more if he listen favourably and loves me nay allall the selinville jewels to make you a shrine allall so he will only let me love him and then while taking up the beads and pronouncing the repeated devotions attached to each her mind darted back to the day when as young children she had played unfairly defrauded landry osbert and denied it how berenger though himself uninjured had refused to speak to her all that dayhow she had hated him thenhow she had thought she had hated him throughout their brief intercourse in the previous year how she had played into her brothers hands and when she thought to triumph over the man who had scorned her found her soul all blank desolation and light gone out from the earth reckless and weary she had let herself be united to m de selinville and in her bridal honours and amusements had tried to crowd out the sense of dreariness and lose herself in excitement then came the illness and death of her husband and almost at the same time the knowledge of berengers existence she sought excitement again that feverish form of devotion then in vogue at paris and which resulted in the league she had hitherto stunned herself as it were with penances processions and sermons for which the host of religious orders then at paris had given ample scope and she was constantly devising new extravagances even at this moment she wore sackcloth beneath her brocade and her rosary was of deaths heads she was living on the outward husk of the roman church not penetrating into its living power and the phase of religion which fostered henry iii and the league offered her no more  all all had melted away beneath the sad but steadfast glance of those two eyes the only feature still unchanged in the marred wrecked countenance that honest quiet refusal that look which came from a higher atmosphere had filled her heart with passionate beatings and aspirations once more and more consciously than ever womanly feeling for suffering and a deep longing to compensate to him and earn his love nay wrest it from him by the benefits she would heap upon him were all at work but the primary sense was the longing to rest on the only perfect truth she had ever known in man and thus with passionate ardour she poured forth her entreaties to st eustache a married saint who had known love and could feel for her and could surely not object to the affection to which she completely gave way for one whose hand was now as free as her own  but st eustache was not dianes only hope that evening she sent veronique to rene of milan the courtperfumer but also called by the malicious lempoisonneur de le reine to obtain from him the most infallible charm and love potion in his whole repertory     chapter xxvi the chevaliers expiation                      next sirs did he marry and whom sirs did he marry one like himself though doubtless graced with many virtues young and erring and in nothing more astray than in this marriagetaylor edwin the fair   nothing could be kinder than the ambassadors family and philip found himself at once at home there at least in his brothers room which was all the world to him fortunately ambroise pare the most skillful surgeon of his day had stolen a day from his attendance of king charles at st germain to visit his paris patients and though unwilling to add to the list of cases when he heard from walsinghams secretary who the suffer was and when injured he came at once to afford his aid  he found however that there was little scope for present treatment he could only set his chief assistant to watch the patient and to inform him when the crisis should be nearer but remarking the uneasy anxious expression in berengers eyes he desired to know whether any care on his mind might be interfering with his recovery a huguenot and perfectly trustworthy he was one who walsingham knew might safely hear the whole and after hearing all he at once returned to his patient and leaning over him said vex not yourself sir your illness is probably serving you better than health could do  sir francis thought this quite probable since charles was so unwell and so beset with his mothers creatures that no open audience could be obtained from him and pare who always had access to him might act when no one else could reach him meantime the ambassador rejoiced to hear of the instinctive caution that had made berenger silence philip on the object of the journey to paris since if the hostile family guessed at the residence of the poor infant they would have full opportunity for obliterating all the scanty traces of her poor persecuted little thing the uncertain hope of her existence seemed really the only thread that still bound berenger to life he had spent eighteen months in hope deferred and constant bodily pain and when the frightful disappointment met him at la sablerie it was not wonder that his heart and hope seemed buried in the black scorched ruins where all he cared for had perished he was scarcely nineteen but the life before him seemed full of nothing but one ghastly recollection and as he said in the short sad little letter which he wrote to his grandfather from his bed he only desired to live long enough to save eustacies child from being a nameless orphan maintained for charity in a convent and to see her safe in aunt cecilys care and then he should be content to have done with this world for ever  the thought that no one except himself could save the child seemed to give him the resolution to battle for life that often bears the patient through illness though now he as suffering more severely and consciously than ever he had done before and lady walsingham often gave up hopes of him he was tenderly cared for by her and her women but philip was the most constant nurse and his unfailing assiduity and readiness amazed the household who had begun by thinking him ungainly loutish and fit for nothing but country sports  the chevalier de ribaumont came daily to inquire and the first time he was admitted actually burst into tears at the sight of the swollen disfigured face and the long mark on the arm which lay halfuncovered presents of delicacies ointments and cooling drinks were frequently sent from him and from the countess de selinville but lady walsingham distrusted these and kept her guest strictly to the regimen appointed by pare now and then billets would likewise come the first brought a vivid crimson into berengers face and both it and all its successors he instantly tore into the smallest fragments without letting any one see them  on the day of the carnival the young men of the household had asked master thistlewood to come out with them and see the procession of the boeuf gras but before it could take place reports were flying about that put the city in commotion caused the ambassador to forbid all going out and made philip expect another huguenot massacre the duke of alencon and the king of navarre had been detected it was said in a conspiracy for overthrowing the power of the queenmother bringing in the huguenots and securing the crown to alencon on the kings death downstairs the ambassador and his secretaries sat anxiously striving to sift the various contradictory reports upstairs philip and lady walsingham were anxiously watching berenger in what seemed the longexpected crisis and philip was feeling as if all the french court were welcome to murder one another so that they would only let ambroise pare come to his brothers relief and it was impossible even to send  at last however when ashwednesday was half over there was a quiet movement and a small pale man in black was at the bedside without philips having ever seen his entrance he looked at his exhausted patient and said it is well i could not have done you any good before  and when he had set berenger more at ease he told how great had been the confusion at st germain when the plot had become known to the queenmother the poor king had been wakened at two oclock in the morning and carried to his litter when pare and his old nurse had tended him he only said can they not let me die in peace and his weakness had been so great on arriving that the surgeon could hardly have left him for m de ribaumont save by his own desire yes sir added pare seeing berenger attending to him we must have you well quickly his majesty knows all about you and is anxious to see you  in spite of these good wishes the recovery was very slow for as the surgeon had suspected the want of skill in those who had had the charge of berenger at the first had been the cause of much of his protracted suffering pare the inventor of trephining was perhaps the only man in europe who could have dealt with the fracture in the back of the head and he likewise extracted the remaining splinters of the jaw though at the cost of much severe handling and almost intolerable pain but by easter berenger found the good surgeons encouragement verified and himself on the way to a far more effectual cure than he had hitherto thought possible sleep had come back to him he experienced the luxury of being free from all pain he could eat without difficulty and pare always an enemy to wine assured him that half the severe headaches for which he had been almost bled to death were the consequence of his living on bread soaked in sack instead of solid food and he was forbidden henceforth to inflame his brain with anything stronger than sherbet his speech too was much improved he still could not utter all the consonants perfectly and could not speak distinctly without articulating very slowly but all the discomfort and pain were gone and though still very weak he told philip that now all his course seemed clear towards his child instead of being like a dull distraught dream his plan was to write to have a vessel sent from weymouth to lie off the coast till his signal should be seen from la motteachard and then to take in the whole party and the little yearling daughter whom he declared he should trust to no one but himself lady walsingham remonstrated a little at the wonderful plans hatched by the two lads together and yet she was too glad to see a beginning of brightening on his face to make many objections it was only too sand to think how likely he was again to be disappointed  he was dressed but had not left his room and was lying on cushions in the ample window overlooking the garden while frances and elizabeth walsingham in charge of their mother tried to amuse him by their childish airs and sports when a message was brought that m le chevalier de ribaumont prayed to be admitted to see him privily  what bodes that he languidly said  mischief no doubt said philip walsingham send him word that you are seriously employed  nay that could scarce be when he must have heard the childrens voices said lady walsingham come away little ones  the ladies took the hint and vanished but philip remained till the chevalier had entered more resplendent than ever in a brown velvet suit slashed with green satin and sparkling with gold lacea contrast to the deep mourning habit in which berenger was dressed after inquiries for his health the chevalier looked at philip and expressed his desire of speaking with his cousin alone  if it be of business said berenger much on his guard my head is still weak and i would wish to have the presence of the ambassador or one of his secretaries  this is not so much a matte of business as of family said the chevalier still looking so uneasily at philip that berenger felt constrained to advise him to join the young ladies in the garden but instead of doing this the boy paced the corridors like a restless dog waiting for his master and no sooner heard the old gentleman bow himself out than he hurried back again to find berenger heated panting agitated as by a sharp encounter  brother what is itwhat has the old rogue done to you  nothing said berenger tardily and wearily and for some minutes he did not attempt to speak while philip devoured his curiosity as best he might at last he said he was always beyond me what think you now he wants me to turn french courtier and marry his daughter  his daughter exclaimed philip that beautiful lady i saw in the coach  a nod of assent  i only wish it were i  philip half angrily how can you be such a fool  of course i know it cant be said philip sheepishly but a little offended but shes the fairest woman my eyes ever beheld  and the falsest  my father says all women are false only they cant help it and dont mean it  only some do mean it said berenger dryly  brother cried philip fiercely as if ready to break a lance what right have you to accuse that kindly lovely dame of falsehood  it skills not going through all said berenger wearily i know her of old she began by passing herself off on me as my wife  and you were not transported  i am not such a gull as you  how very beautiful your wife must have been said philip with gruff amazement overpowering his consideration  much you know about it returned berenger turning his face away  there was a long silence first broken by philip asking more cautiously and what did you say to him  i said whatever could show it was most impossible even i said the brothers handwriting was too plain on my face for me to offer myself to the sister but it seems all that is to be passed over as an unlucky mistake i wish i could guess what the old fellow is aiming at  i am sure the lady looked at you as if she loved you  simpleton she looked to see how she could beguile me love they do nothing for love here you foolish boy save par amour if she loved me her father was the last person she would have sent me no no tis a new stratagem if i could only seen my way into it perhaps sir francis will when he can spend an hour on me  though full of occupation sir francis never failed daily to look in upon his convalescent guest and when he heard of the chevaliers interview he took care that berenger should have full time to consult him and of course he inquired a good deal more into the particulars of the proposal than philip had done when he learnt that the chevalier had offered all the very considerable riches and lands that diane enjoyed in right of her late husband as an equivalent for berengers resignation of all claims upon the niddemerle property he noted it on his tables and desired to know what these claims might be i cannot tell said berenger you may remember sir the parchments with our contract of marriage had been taken away from chateau leurre and i have never seen them  then said the ambassador you may hold it as certain that those parchments give you some advantage which he hears since he is willing to purchase it at so heavy a price otherwise he himself would be the natural heir of those lands  after my child said berenger hastily  were you on your guard against mentioning your trust in your childs life said sir francis  the long scar turned deeper purple than ever only so far as that i said there still be rights i had no power to resign said berenger and then he began to prove to mewhat i had no mind to hear and his voice trembled all that i know but too well  hum you must not be left alone again to cope with him said walsingham did he make any question of the validity of your marriage  no sir it was never touched on i would not let him take her name into his lips  walsingham considered for some minutes and then said it is clear then that he believes that the marriage can be sufficiently established to enable you to disturb him in his possession of some part at least of the angevin inheritance or he would not endeavour to purchase your renunciation of it by the hand of a daughter so richly endowed  i would willingly renounce it if that were all i never sought it only i cannot give up her childs rights  and that you almost declared proceeded walsingham so that the chevalier has by his negotiation gathered from you that you have not given up hope that the infant lives do your men know where you believe she is  my englishmen know it of course said berenger but there is no fear of them the chevalier speaks no english and they scarcely any french and besides i believe they deem him equally my butcher with his son the other fellow i only picked up after i was on my way to paris and i doubt his knowing my purpose  the chevalier must have had speech with him though said philip for it was he who brought word that the old rogue wished to speak with you  it would be well to be quit yourself of the fellow ere leaving paris said walsingham  then sir said berenger with an anxious voice do you indeed think i have betrayed aught that can peril the poor little one  sir francis smiled we do not set lads of your age to cope with old foxes he answered and it seems to me that you used far discretion in the encounter the mere belief that the child lives does not show him where she may be in effect it would seem likely to most that the babe would be nursed in some cottage and thus not be in the city of la sablerie at all he might mayhap thus be put on a false scent  oh no exclaimed berenger startled that might bring the death of some other persons child on my soul  that shall be guarded against said sir francis in the meantime my fair youth keep your matters as silent as may bedo not admit the chevalier again in my absence and as to this man guibert i will confer with my steward whether he knows too much and whether it be safer to keep of dismiss him  if only i could see the king and leave paris sighed berenger  and walsingham though unwilling to grieve the poor youth further bethought himself that this was the most difficult and hopeless matter of all as young ribaumont grew better the king grew worse he himself only saw charles on rare occasions surrounded by a host of watchful eyes and ears and every time he marked the progress of disease and though such a hint could be given by an ambassador he thought that by far the best chance of recovery of the child lay in the confusion that might probably follow the death of charles ix in the absence of his next heir  berenger reckoned on the influence of elisabeth of austria who had been the real worker in his union with eutacie but he was told that it was vain to expect assistance from her in the first year of her marriage she had fondly hoped to enjoy her husbands confidence and take her natural place in his court but she was of no mould to struggle with catherine de medicis and after a time had totally desisted even at the time of the st bartholomew she had endeavoured to uplift her voice on the side of mercy and had actually saved the lives of the king of navarre and prince of conde and her father the good maximilian ii had written in the strongest terms to charles ix expressing his horror of the massacre six weeks later the first hour after the birth of her first and only child she had interceded with her husband for the lives of two huguenots who had been taken alive and failing then either through his want of will or want of power she had collapsed and yielded up the endeavour she ceased to listen to petitions from those who had hoped for her assistance as if to save both them and herself useless pain and seemed to lapse into a sort of apathy to all public interests she hardly spoke mechanically fulfilled her few offices in the court and seemed to have turned her entire hope and trust into prayer for her husband her german confessor had been sent home and a jesuit given her in his stead but she had made no resistance she seemed to the outer world a dull weary stranger obstinate in leading a conventual life but those who knew her bestand of these few was the huguenot surgeon pareknew that her heart had been broken two guilty lives or to make her husband free himself from his bondage to bloody counsels to pray for him was all that remained to herand unwearied had been those prayers since his health had declined she had been equally indefatigable in attending on him and did not seem to have a single interest beyond his sick chamber  as to the king of navarre for whose help berenger had hoped he had been all these months in the dishonouable thraldom of catherine de medicis and was more powerless than ever at this juncture having been implicated in alencons plot and imprisoned at vincennes  and thus the more berenger heard of the state of things the less hopeful did his cause appear till he could almost have believed his best chance lay in philips plan of persuading the huguenots to storm the convent     chapter xxvii the dying king          die in terror of thy guiltiness   dream on dream on of bloody deeds and death fainting despair   despairing yield thy breath                                      king richard iii   a few days later when berenger had sent out philip under the keeping of the secretaries to see the queenmother represent royalty in one of the grand processions of rogationtide the gentle knock came to his door that always announced the arrival of his good surgeon  you look stronger m le baron have you yet left your room  i have walked round the gallery above the hall said berenger i have not gone downstairs that is for tomorrow  what would m le baron say if his chirurgeon took him not merely downstairs but up on flight at the louvre  ha cried berenger to the king  it is wellnigh the last chance monsieur the queenmother and all her suite are occupied with services and sermons this week and next week private access to the king will be far more difficult i have waited as long as i could that you might gain strength to support the fatigue  hope cancels fatigue said berenger already at the other end of the room searching for his longdisused cloak sword gloves hat and mask  not the sword said pare so please you m le baron must condescend to obtain entrance as my assistantthe plain black doubletyes that is admirable but i did not know that monsieur was so tall he added in some consternation as for the first time he saw his patient standing up at his full heightunusual even in england and more so in france indeed berenger had grown during his year of illness and being of course extremely thin looked all the taller so as to be a very inconvenient subject to smuggle into to palace unobserved  however ambroise had made up his mind to the risk and merely assisted berenger in assuming his few equipments then gave him his arm to go down the stairs meeting guibert on the way berenger left word with him that he was going out to take the air with maitre pare and on the mans offering to attend him refused the proposal  pare carriage waited in the court and berenger seated in its depths rolled unseen through the streets till he found himself at the little postern of the louvre the very door whence he was to have led off his poor eustacie here ambroise made him take off his small black mask in spite of all danger of his scars being remarked since masks were not etiquette in the palace and putting into his arms a small brassbound case of instruments asked his pardon for preceding him and alighted from the carriage  this was ambroises usual entrance and it was merely guarded by a scottish archer who probably observed nothing they then mounted the stone stair the same where osbert had dragged down his insensible master and as at the summit the window appeared where berenger had waited those weary hours and heard the first notes of the bell of stgermainlauxerrois his breath came in such hurried sobs that pare would fain have given him time to recover himself but he gasped not herenot here and pare seeing that he could still move on turned not to the corridor leading to the kings old apartments now too full of dreadful associations for poor charles but towards those of the young queen avoiding the anteroom where no doubt waited pages users and attendants pare presently knocked at a small door so hidden in the wainscoting of the passage that only a habitue could have found it without strict search it was at once opened and the withered motherly face of an old woman with keen black eyes under a formal tight white cap looked out  eh maitre pare she said you have brought the poor young gentleman on my faith he looks scarcely able to walk come in sir and rest a while in my chamber while maitre ambroise goes on to announce you to the king he is more at ease today the poor child and will relish some fresh talk  berenger knew this to be philippe the old huguenot nurse whom charles ix loved most fondly and in whom he found his greatest comfort he was very glad to sink into the seat she placed for him the only one is her small bare room and recover breath there while pare passed on to the king and she talked as one delighted to have a hearer  ah yes rest yourselfstay i will give you a few spoonfuls of the cordial potage i have here for the king it will comfort your heart ah you have been cruelly mauledbut he would have saved you if he could  yes good mother i know that the king has been my very good lord  ah blessings on you if you say so from your heart monsieur you know me for one of your poor reformed and i tell youi who saw him born who nursed him from his birththat suffer as you may you can never suffer as he does maitre ambroise may talk of his illness coming from blowing too much on his horn i know better but ah to be here at night would make a stone shed tears of blood the queen and i know it but we say nothing we only pray  the sight of a huguenot was so great a treat to the old woman in her isolated life that her tongue ran thus freely while berenger sat scarce daring to speak or breathe in the strange boding atmosphere of the palace where the nurse and surgeon moved as tolerated privileged persons in virtue of the necessity of the one to the kingof the other to all the world after all brief interval pare returned and beckoned to berenger who followed him across a large statebedroom to a much smaller one which he entered from under a heavy blue velvet curtain and found himself in an atmosphere heavy with warmth and perfume and strangely oppressed besides on one side of the large fire sat the young queen faded wan and with all animation or energy departed only gazing with a silent wistful intentness at her husband he was opposite to her in a pillowed chair his feet on a stool with a deadly white padded puffy cheek and his great black eyes always prominent now with a glassy look and strained wide as though always gazing after some horrible sight madame la comtesse stood in her old wooden automaton fashion behind the queen otherwise no one was present save pare who as he held up the curtain stood back to let m de ribaumont advance he stood still however merely bowing low awaiting an invitation to come forward and trying to repress the startled tear called up by the very shock of pity at the mournful aspect of the young king and queen  elisabeth absorbed in her husband and indifferent to all besides did not even turn her head as he entered but charles signed to him to approach holding out a yellow dropsicallooking hand and as he dropped on one knew and kissed it fervently the king said here he is madame the baron de ribaumont the same whose little pleasureboat was sucked down in our whirlpool  all elisabeths memories seemed to have been blotted out in that whirlpool for she only bowed her head formally and gave no look of recognition though she too allowed berenger to salute her listless dejected hand one would hardly have known him again continued the king in a low husky voice but i hope sir i see you recovering  thanks sire to heavens goodness and to your goodness in sparing to me the services of maitre pare  ah there is none like pare for curing a wound outside said charles then leant back silent and berenger still kneeling was considering whether he ought to proffer his petition when the king continued how fares your friend sidney m le baron  right well sire the queen has made him one of her gentlemen  not after this fashion said charles as with his finger he traced the long scar on berengers face our sister of england has different badges of merit from ours for her good subjects ha what say they of us in england baron  i have lain sick at home sire and have neither seen nor heard said berenger  ah one day more at montpipeau had served your turn said the king but you are one who has floated up again oneone at least whose blood is not on my head  the queen looked up uneasy and imploring as charles continued would that more of you would come in this way they have scored you deep but know you what is gashed deeper still your kings heart ah you will not come as coligny does from his gibbet with his two bleeding hands my father was haunted to his dying day by the face of one huguenot tailor why i see a score night by night you are solid let me feel you man  m pare exclaimed the poor queen take him away  no madame said the king holding tight in his hot grasp berengers hand which was as pale as his own long thin and wasted but cold from strong emotion take not away the only welcome sight i have seen for wellnigh two years he coughed and the handkerchief he put to his lips had blood on it but he did not quit his hold of his visitor and presently said in a feeble whisper tell me how did you escape  pare over the kings head signed to him to make his narrative take time and indeed his speech was of necessity so slow that by the time he had related how osbert had brought him safely to england the king had recovered himself so as to say see what it is to have a faithful servant which of those they have left me would do as much for me and now being once away with your life what brings you back to this realm of ours after your last welcome  i left my wife here sire  ha and the cousin would have married herobtained permission to call himself nid de merlebut she slipped through his clumsy fingers did she not did you know anything of her madame  no said the queen looking up she wrote to me once from her convent but i knew i could do nothing for her but bring her enemies notice on her so i made no answer  berenger could hardly conceal his start of indignationless at the absolute omission than at the weary indifference of the queens confession perhaps the king saw it for he added so it is ribaumont the kindest service we can do our friends is to let them alone and after all it was not the worse for her she did evade her enemies  yes sire said berenger commanding and steadying his voice with great difficulty she escaped in time to give birth to our child in the ruined loft of an old grange of the templars under the care of a huguenot farmer and a pastor who had known my father then she took refuge in la sablerie and wrote to my mother deeming me dead i was just well enough to go in quest of her i cameah sire i found only charred ruins your majesty knows how huguenot bourgs are dealt with  and she  berenger answered but by a look  why did you come to tell me this said the king passionately do you not know that they have killed me already i thought you came because there was still some one i could aid  there is there is sire said berenger for once interrupting royalty none save you can give me my child it is almost certain that a good priest saved it but it is in a convent and only with a royal order can one of my religion either obtain it or even have my questions answered  nor with one in paris said the king dryly but in the country the good mothers may still honour their kings hand here ambroise take pen and ink and write the order to whom  to the mother prioress of the ursulines at lucon so please our majesty said berenger to let me have possession of my daughter  eh is it only a little girl  yes sire but my heart yearns for her all the more said berenger with glistening eyes  you are right said the poor king mine too is a little girl and i bless god daily that she is no sonto be the most wretched thing the france let her come in madame she is little older than my friends daughter i would show her to him  the queen signed to madame la comtesse to fetch the child and berenger added sire you could do a further benefit to my poor little one one more signature of yours would attest that ratification of my marriage which took place in your majestys presence  ah i remember said charles you may have any name of mine that can help you to oust that villain narcisse only wait to use itspare me any more storms it will serve your turn as well when i am beyond they and you will make your claim good what seeing berengers interrogative look do you not know that by the marriagecontract the lands of each were settled on the survivor  no sire i have never seen the marriagecontract  your kinsman knew it well said charles  just then madame la comtesse returned leading the little princess by the long ribbons at her waist charles bent forward calling here ma petite come here here is one who loves thy father look well at him that thou mayest know him  the little madame elisabeth so far understood that with a certain lofty condescension she extended her hand for the stranger to kiss and thus drew from the king the first smile that berenger had seen she was more than half a year older than the berangere on whom his hopes were set and whom he trusted to find not such a pale feeble tottering little creature as this poor young daughter of france whose round black eyes gazed wonderingly at his scar but she was very precocious and even already too much of a royal lady to indulge in any awkward personal observation  by the time she had been rewarded for her good behaviour by one of the dried plums in her fathers comfitbox the order had been written by pare and berenger had prepared the certificate for the kings signature according to the form given him by his grandfather  your writing shakes nearly as much as mine said the poor king as he wrote his name to this latter now madame you had better sign it also and tell this gentleman where to find father meinhard in austria he was a little too true for us do you seewould not give thanks for shedding innocent blood ahand with a gasp of mournful longing the king sank back while elisabeth at his bidding added her name to the certificate and murmured the name of a convent in vienna where her late confessor could be found  i cannot thank you majesty enough said berenger my childs rights are now secure in england at least and thisas he held the other paper for the kingwill give her to me  ah take it for what it is worth said the king as he scrawled his charles upon it this order must be used promptly or it will avail you nothing write to ambroise how you speed that is if it will bring me one breath of good news and as berenger kissed his hand with tearful inarticulate thanks he proceeded save for that cause i would ask you to come to me again it does me good it is like a breath from montpipeauthe last days of hopebefore the frenzythe misery  whenever your majesty does me the honour began berenger forgetting all except the dying man  i am not so senseless interrupted the king sharply it would be losing the only chance of undoing one wrong only ribaumont he added fervently for once let me hear that one man has pardoned me  sire sire sobbed berenger totally overcome how can i speak the word how feel aught but love loyalty gratitude  charles half smiled again as he said in sad meditationah it was in me to have been a good king if they had let me think of me bid your friend sidney think of me as i would have beennot as i have beenand pray pray for me then hiding his face in his handkerchief in a paroxysm of grief and horror he murmured in a stifled tone blood blood deliver me good lord  in effect there was so sudden a gush of blood from mouth and nose that berenger sprang to his feet in dismay and was bona fide performing the part of assistant to the surgeon when at the queens cry not only the nurse philippe hurried in but with her a very dark keenlooking man who at once began applying strong essences to the kings face as berenger supported his head in a few moments pare looked up at berenger and setting him free intimated to him between sign and whisper to go into philippes room and wait there and it was high time for though the youth had felt nothing in the stress of the moment he was almost swooning when he reached the little chamber and lay back in the nurses chair with closed eyes scarcely conscious how time went or even where he was till he was partly aroused by hearing steps returning  the poor young man said philippes kind voice he is fainting ah no wonder it overcame any kind heart  how is the king berenger tried to say but his own voice still sounded unnatural and far away  he is better for the time and will sleep said pare administering to his other patient some cordial drops as he spoke there sir you will soon be able to return to the carriage this has been a sore trial to your strength  but i have gained allall i could hope said berenger looking at his precious papers but alas the poor king  you will never never let a word of blame pass against him cried philippe earnestly it is well that one of our people should have seen how it really is with him all i regret is that maitre rene thrust himself in and saw you  who said berenger who had been too much engrossed to perceive any one  maitre rene of milan the queenmothers perfume he came with some plea of bringing a pouncetbox from her but i wager it was as a spy i was doing my best to walk him gently off when the queens cry called me and he must needs come in after me  i saw him not said berenger perhaps he marked not me in the confusion  i fear said pare gravely he was more likely to have his senses about him than you m le baron these bleedings of the kings are not so new to us familiars to the palace the best thing now to be done is to have you to the carriage if you can move  berenger now quite recovered stood up and gave his warm thanks to the old nurse for her kindness to him  ah sir she said you are one of us pray pray that god will have mercy on my poor child he has the truth in his heart pray that it may save him at the last  ambroise knowing that she would never cease speaking while there was any one to hear her almost dragged berenger out at the little secret door conveyed him safely down the stairs and placed him again in the carriage neither spoke till the surgeon said you have seen a sad sight monsieur le baron i need not bid you be discreet  there are some things that go too deep for speech sighed the almost english berenger then after a pause is there no hope for him is he indeed dying  without a miracle he cannot live a month he is as truly slain by the st bartholomew as ever its martyrs were said pare moved out of his usual cautious reserve towards one who had seen so much and felt so truly i tell you sir that his mother hath as truly slain her sons as if she had sent rene there to them with his drugs according as they have consciences and hearts so they pine and perish under her rule  berenger shuddered and almost sobbed and hath he no better hope no comforter he asked  none save good old flipote as you heard the queenmother will not suffer his own church to speak to him in her true voice no confessor but one chosen by the cardinal of lorraine may come near him and with him all is mere ceremony but if at the last he opens his ear and heart to take in the true hope of salvation it will be from the voice of poor old philippe  and so it was it was philippe who heard him in the night sobbing over the piteous words my god what horrors what blood and as she took from his teardrenched handkerchief spoke to him of the blood that speakth better things than the blood of abel and it was she who in the final agony heard and treasured these last words if the lord jesus will indeed receive me into the company of the blest surely never was repentance deeper than that of charles ixand these his parting words were such as to inspire the trust that it was not remorse  allimportant as berengers expedition had been he still could think of little but the poor king and wearied out as he was he made very little reply to the astonished friends who gathered round him on his return he merely told philip that he had succeeded and then lay almost without speaking on his bed till the ambassador made his evening visit when he showed him the two papers sir francis could hardly believe his good fortune in having obtained this full attestation of the marriage and promised to send to the english ambassador in germany to obtain the like from father meinhard the document itself he advised berenger not to expose to the dangers of the french journey but to leave it with him to be forwarded direct to lord walwyn it was most important both as obviating any dispute on the legitimacy of the child if she lived or if not it would establish those rights of berenger to the nid de merle estates of which he had heard from the king this information explained what were the claims that the chevalier was so anxious to hush up by a marriage with madame de selinville berenger as his wifes heir was by this contract the true owner of the estates seized by the chevalier and his son and could only be ousted either by his enemies proving his contract to eustacie invalid and to be unfulfilled or by his own voluntary resignation the whole scheme was clear to walsingham and he wasted advice upon unheeding ears as to how berenger should act to obtain restitution so soon as he should be of age and how he should try to find out the notary who had drawn up the contract if berenger cared at all it was rather for the sake of punishing and balking narcisse than with any desire of the inheritance and even for righteous indignation he was just now too weary and too sad he could not discuss his rights to nid de merle if they passed over the rights of eustacies child round whom his affection were winding themselves as his sole hope  the next evening pare came in quest of berenger and after a calm refreshing hopeful ascensionday which had been a real balm to the weary spirit found him enjoying the sweet may sunshine under a tree in the garden i am glad to find you out of doors he said i fear i must hasten your departure  i burn to lose no time cried berenger prithee tell them i may safely go they all call it madness to think of setting out  ordinarily it would be said pare but rene of milan has sent his underlings to see who is my new tall assistant he will report all to the queenmother and though in this house you could scarcely suffer personal harm yet the purpose of your journey might be frustrated and the king might have to undergo another of those bourrasques which he may well dread  i will go this very night said berenger starting up where is philipwhere is sir francis  even that very night pare thought not too soon and the ascensiontide illuminations brought so many persons abroad that it would be easy to go unnoticed and in the general festivity when every one was coming and going from the country to gaze or worship at the shrines and the images decked in every church it would be easy for the barriers to be passed without observation then the brothers would sleep at a large hostel the first on the road to england where walsinghams couriers and guest always baited and the next morning he would send out to them their attendants with houses for their further journey back into anjou if any enemies were on the watch this would probably put them off the scent and it only remained further to be debated whether the norman guibert had better be dismissed at once or taken with them there was always soft place in berengers heart for a norman and the man was really useful moreover he would certainly be safer employed and in their company than turned loose to tell the chevalier all he might have picked up in the hotel dangleterre it was therefore decided that he should be the attendant of the two young men and he received immediate orders that night to pack up their garments and hold himself ready  nevertheless before the hour of departure guibert had stolen out had an interview with the chevalier de ribaumont at the hotel de selinville and came back with more than one good french crown in his pocket and hopes of more     chapter xxviii the orphans of la sablerie    the cream tarts with pepper in themarabian nights   hope spring and recovery carried the young baronde ribaumont on his journey infinitely better than his companions had dared to expect he dreaded nothing so much as being overtaken by those tidings which would make king charless order mere waste paper and therefore pressed on with little regard to his own fatigue although happily with increasing strength which carried him a further stage every day  lucon was a closelyguarded thoroughly catholic city and his safeconduct was jealously demanded but the name of ribaumont silenced all doubt a relation apparently of m de nid de merle said the officer on guard and politely invited him to dinner and bed at the castle but these he thought it prudent to decline explaining that he brought a letter from the king to the mother prioress  the convent walls were pointed out to him and he only delayed at the inn long enough to arrange his dress as might appear to the abbess most respectful and poor boy be least likely to startle the babe on whom his heart was set at almost every inn the little children had shrieked and run from his white and gashed face and his tall lank figure in deep black and it was very sadly that he said to philip you must come with me if she turns from me as an ogre your bright ruddy face will win her  the men were left at the inn with charge to let guibert speak for them and to avoid showing their nationality the three months of paris and the tailors there had rendered philip much less conspicuous than formerly but still people looked at him narrowly as he followed his brother along the street the two lads had made up their minds to encumber themselves with no nurses or womanfolk the child should be carried fondled and fed by her boyfather alone he believed that when he once held her in his arms he should scarcely even wish to give her up to any one else and in his concentration of mind had hardly thought of all the inconveniences and absurdities that would arise but really was chiefly occupied by the fear that she would not at first let him take her in his arms and hold her to his heart  philip a little more alive to the probabilities nevertheless was disposed to regard them as fun and pastime he had had many a frolic with his babysisters and this would be only a prolonged one besides it was berrys one hope and to rescue any creature from a convent was a good work in his protestant eyes which had not become a whit less prejudiced at paris so he was quite prepared to take his full share of his niece or more if she should object to her fathers looks and he only suggested halting at an old womans stall to buy some sweetmeats by way of propitiationa proceeding which much amazed the gazing population of lucon two reports were going about one that the king had vowed a silver image of himself to st ursula if her prioress would obtain his recovery by their prayers the other that he was going to translate her to the royal abbey of fontevrault to take charge of his daughter madame elisabeth any way high honour by a royal messenger must be intended to the prioress mere monique and the luconnais were proud of her sanctity  the portress had already heard the report and opened her wicket even before the bell could be rung then eagerly ushered him into the parlour the barest and most asceticlooking of rooms with a boarded partition across unenlivened except by a grated hollow and the outer portion empty save of a table three chairs and a rugged woodcut of a very tall st ursula with a crowd of pigmy virgins not reaching higher than the ample hem of her petticoat  did aunt cecily live in such a place as this exclaimed philip gazing round or do they live on the fat among down cushions inside there  hushsh said berenger frowning with anxiety for a rustling was heard behind the screen and presently a black veil and white scapulary appeared and a sweet calm voice said peace be with you sir what are your commands  berenger bowed low and replied thanks reverend lady i bring a letter from the king to request your aid in a matter that touches me nearly  his majesty shall be obeyed come you from him  he was forced to reply to her inquiries after the poor kings health before she opened the letter taking it under her veil to read it so that as he stood trembling almost sickening with anxiety and scarcely able to breathe he could see nothing but the black folds and at her low murmured exclamation he started as if at a cannonshot  de ribaumont she said can it bethe childofofout poor dear little pensionnaire at bellaise  it isit is cried berenger o madame you knew her at bellaise  even so replied the prioress who was in fact the soeur monique so loved and regretted by eustacie i loved and prayed for her with all my heart when she was claimed by the world heavens will be done but the poor little thing loved me and i have often thought that had i been still at bellaise when she returned she would not have fled but of this child i have no knowledge  you took charge of the babes of la sablerie madame said berenger almost under his breath  her infant among those poor orphans exclaimed the prioress more and more startled and amazed  if it be anywhere in this life it is in your good keeping madame said berenger with tears in his eyes oh i entreat withhold her no longer  but exclaimed the bewildered nun who would you then be sir  iher husbandwidower of eustaciefather of her orphan cried berenger she cannot be detained from me either by right or law  her husband still hesitated monique but he is dead the poor little oneheaven have mercy on her soulwrote me a piteous entreaty and gave large alms for prayers and masses for his soul  the sob in his throat almost strangled his speech she mourned me to the last as dead i was borne away senseless and desperately wounded and when i recovered power to seek her it was too late o madame have pitylet me see all she has left to me  is it possible said the nun we would not learn the parentage of our nurslings since all alike become children of mother church then suddenly bethinking herself but surely monsieur cannot be a huguenot  it was no doubt the first time she had been brought in contact with a schismatic and she could not believe that such respectful courtesy could come from one he saw he must curb himself and explain i am neither calvinist nor sacrementaire madame i was bred in england where we love our own church my aunt is a benedictine sister who keeps her rule strictly though her convent is destroyed and it is to her that i shall carry my daughter ah lady did you but know my hearts hunger for her  the prioress better read in the lives of the saints than in the sects of heretics did not know whether this meant that he was of her own faith or not and her womans heart being much moved by his pleadings she said i will heartily give your daughter to you sir as indeed i must if she be here but you have never seen her  no only her empty cradle in the burnt house but i must know her she is a year old  we have two babes of that age but i fear me you will scarce see much likeness in either of them to any one you knew said the prioress thoughtfully however there are two girls old enough to remember the parentage of their companions though we forbade them to mention it would you see them sir  and the infants so please you reverend mother exclaimed berenger  she desired him to wait and after an interval of suspense there was a pattering of little sabots behind the partition and through the grating he beheld six little girls in blue serge frocks and tight white caps of the two infants one with a puny wizen pinched face was in the arms of the prioress the other a big stout coarse child with hard brown cheeks and staring blackeyes was on its own feet but with a great basketwork frame round its head to save it from falls there were two much more prepossessing children of three or four and two intelligentlooking girls of perhaps eight and ten to the elder of whom the prioress turned saying agathe i release you from my command not to speak of your former life and desire you to tell this gentleman if you know who were the parents of these two little ones  yes reverend mother said agathe readily the old name of claire touching the larger baby was salome potier her mother was the washerwoman and nannonciade i dont know what her name was but her father worked for maitre brassier who made the kettles  philip felt relieved to be free from all doubt about these very uninviting little ones but berenger though sighing heavily asked quickly permit me madame a few questionslittle maid did you ever hear of isaac gardon  maitre isaac oh yes sir we used to hear him preach at the church and sometimes he catechized us she said and her lip quivered  he was a heretic and i abjure him added the other girl perking up her head  was he in the town what became of him exclaimed berenger  he would not be in the town said the elder girl my poor father had sent him word to go away  eh quoi  our father was bailli la grasse interposed the younger girl consequentially our names were marthe and lucie la grasse but agathe and eulalie are much prettier  but maitre gardon still asked berenger  he ought to be take and burnt said the new eulalie he brought it all on us  how was it was my wife with himmadame de ribaumont speak my child  that was the name said one girl  but maitre gardon had no great lady with him said the other only his sons widow and her baby and they lodged with noemi laurent who made the patisserie  ah cried berenger lighting up with the new ray of hope tell me my dear that they fled with him and where  i do not know of their going said agathe confused and overborne by his eagerness  curb yourself sir said the prioress they will recollect themselves and tell you what they can  it was the little cakes with lemoned sugar suggested the younger girl maitre tressan always said there would be a judgment on us for our daintiness ah he was very cross about them and after all it was the maitre of lucon who ate fifteen of them all at once but then he is not a heretic  happily for berenger agathe unraveled this speech  mademoiselle gardon made the sugarlemoned cakes and the mayor of lucon one day when he supped with us was so delighted with them that he carried one away to show his wife and afterwards he sent over to order some more then after a time he sent secretly to my father to ask him if maitre gardon was there for there was a great outcry about the lemon cakes and the duke of alencons army were coming to demand his daughterinlaw because it seems she was a great lady and the only person who could make the cakes  agathe exclaimed the prioress  i understand said berenger the cure of nissard told me that she was traced through cakes the secret of which was only known at bellaise  that might be said mere monique i remember there was something of pride in the cakes of bellaise though i always tried to know nothing of them  well little one continue entreated berenger you are giving me life and hope  i heard my father and mother talk about it said agathe gaining courage he said he knew nothing of great people and would give nobody up to the catholics but as to maitre isaac he should let him know that the catholic army were coming and that it would be the better for us if we had no pastor within our walls and that there was a cry that his daughters lemon cakes were made by the lady that was lost  and they escaped ah would that i could thank the good man  surely yes sir i never saw them again maitre tressan the elder prayed with us and when the cruel soldiers came and demanded the lady and maitre isaac and all obstinate calvinists our mayor and my father and the rest made answer that they had no knowledge of the lady and did not know where maitre gardon was and as to huguenots we were all one as obstinate as the other but that we would pay any fine within our means so they would spare our lives then the man in the fine coat said it was the lady they wanted not the fine and a great deal he said besides i know not what but my father said it is our lifes blood that they want and he put on his breastplate and kissed us all and went away then came horrible noises and firing of cannon and the neighbours ran in and said that the enemy were battering down the old crumbly bit of wall where the monastery was burnt and just then our man joseph ran back all pale and staring to tell us my father was lying badly hurt in the street my mother hurried out and locked the door to keep us from following  the poor child broke down in tears and her sister went on oh we were so frightenedsuch frightful sounds came close and people ran by all blood and shriekingand there was a glare in the skyand nobody came hometill at last it grew so dreadful that we hid in the cellar to hear and see nothing only it grew hotter and hotter and the light through the little grating was red and at last there was a noise louder than thunder and oh such a shakingfor it was the house falling down but we did not know that we tried to open the door and could not then we cried and called for father and motherand no one heardand we sat still for fear till we sleptand then it was all dark and we were very hungry i dont know how time went but at last when i was daylight again there was a talking above a little baby crying and a kind voice too and then we called out oh take us out and give us bread then a face looked down the grating oh it was like the face of an angel to us with all the white hair flying round it was the holy priest of nissard and when one of the cruel men said we were only little heretics who ought to die like rats in a hole he said we were but innocents who did not know the difference  ah we did said the elder girl you are younger sister you forget more and then holding out her hands to berenger she exclaimed ah sir take us away with you  my child exclaimed the prioress you told me you were happy to be in the good course  oh yes cried the poor child but i dont want to be happy i am forgetting all my poor father and mother used to say i cant help it and they would be so grieved oh take me away sir  take care agathe you will be a relapsed heretic said her sister solemnly for me i am a true catholic i love the beautiful images and the processions  ah but what would our mother have said cried poor agathe weeping more bitterly  poor child her old recollections have been renewed said the prioress with unchanged sweetness but it will pass my dear the gentleman will tell you that it is as impossible for him to take you as it is for me to let you go  it is so truly little one said berenger the only little girl i cold have taken with me would have been my own and as her eyes looked at him wistfully he added no doubt if your poor mother could she would thank this good motherprioress for teaching you to serve god and be a good child  monsieur speaks well and kindly said the prioress and now agathe make your curtsey and take away the little ones  let me ask one question more reverend mother said berenger ah children did you ever see her whom you call isaac gardons daughterinlaw  no sir said the children but mother did and she promised one day to take us to see the baby for it was so prettyso white that she had never seen the like  so white repeated berenger to himself and the prioress struck perhaps by the almost flaxen locks that sparsely waved on his temples and the hue of the ungloved hand that rested on the edge of the grille said smiling you come of a fair family monsieur  the white ribaumonts said berenger and moreover my mother was called the swan of england my little sisters have skins like snow ah madame though i have failed i go away far happier than if i had succeeded  and reveal the true faith began the nun but philip in the meantime was nudging his brother and whispering in english no popish prayers i say stay give these poor little prisoners one feast of the sweetmeats we brought  of this last hint berenger was glad and the prioress readily consented to a distribution of the dainties among the orphans he wished to leave a more lasting token of his gratitude to the little maiden whose father had perhaps saved eustacies life and recollecting that he had about him a great gold coin bearing the heads of philip and mary he begged leave to offer it to agathe and found that it was received by good mere monique almost in the light of a relic as bearing the head of so pious a queen  then to complete philips disgust he said i took with me my aunts blessing when i set out let me take yours with me also reverend mother  when they were in the street again philip railed at him as though he had subjected himself to a spell  she is almost a saint answered berenger  and have we not saints enough of our own without running after popish ones behind grates brother if ever the good old days come back of invading france ill march straight hither and deliver the poor little wretches so scandalously mewed up here and true protestants all the time  hush people are noticing the sound of your english  let them i never thanked heaven properly before that i have not a drop of french here berenger almost shook him by the shoulder as men turned at his broad tones and foreign words and he walked on in silence while berenger at his side felt as one treading on air so infinite was the burden taken off his mind though for the present absolutely at sea as to where to seek eustacie the relief from acquiescence in the horrible fate that had seemed to be hers was such that a flood of unspeakable happiness seemed to rush in on him and bear him up with a new infusion of life buoyancy and thankfulness     chapter xxix in the kings name      under which king bezonian speak or die    under king harry                       king henry iv   one bird in the hand is not always worth two in the bush assuredly said philip when berenger was calm enough to hold council on what he called this most blessed discovery but where to seek them  i have no fears now returned berenger we have not been bore through so much not to be brought together at last soon soon shall we have her a minister so distinguished as isaac gardon is sure to be heard of either at la rochelle montauban or nimes their great gathering places  for rochelle then said philip  even so we will be off early tomorrow and from thence if we do not find her there as i expected we shall be able to write the thrice happy news to those at home  accordingly the little cavalcade started in good time in the cool of the morning of the bright long day of early june while apple petal floated down on them in the lanes like snow and nightingales in every hedge seemed to give voice and tune to berengers eager yearning hopes  suddenly there was a sound of horses feet in the road before them and as they drew aside to make way a little troop of gendarmes filled the narrow lane the officer a rough harshlooking man laid his hand on berengers bridle with the words in the name of the king  philip began to draw his sword with one hand and with the other to urge his horse between the officer and his brother but berenger called out back this gentleman mistakes my person i am the baron de ribaumont and have a safeconduct from the king  what king demanded the officer  from king charles  i arrest you said the officer in the name of king henry iii and of the queen regent catherine  the king dead exclaimed berenger  on the 30th of may now sir  your warrantyour cause still demanded berenger  there will be time enough for that when you are safely lodged said the captain roughly pulling at the rein which he had held all the time  what no warrant shouted philip he is a mere robber and with drawn sword he was precipitating himself on the captain when another gendarme who had been on the watch grappled with him and dragged him off his horse before he could strike a blow the other two english humfrey holt and john smithers strong fullgrown men rode in fiercely to the rescue and berenger himself struggled furiously to loose himself from the captain and deliver his brother suddenly there was the report of a pistol poor smithers fell there was a moment of standing aghast and in that moment the one man and the two youths were each pounced on by three or four gendarmes thrown down and pinioned  is this usage for gentlemen exclaimed berenger as he was roughly raised to his feet  the kings power has been resisted was all the answer and when he would have been to see how it was with poor smithers one of the menatarms kicked over the body with sickening brutality saying dead enough heretic and english carrion  philip uttered a cry of loathing horror and turned white berenger above all else felt a sort of frenzied despair as he thought of the peril of the boy who had been trusted to him  have you had enough sir said the captain mount and come  they could only let themselves be lifted to their horses and their hands were then set free to use their bridles each being guarded by a soldier on each side of him philip attempted but once to speak and that in english next time i shall take my pistol  he was rudely silenced and rode on with wideopen stolid eyes and dogged face steadfastly resolved that no frenchman should see him flinch and vexed that berenger had his riding mask on so that his face could not be studied while he on his side was revolving all causes possible for his arrest and all means of enforcing he liberation if not of himself at least of philip and humfrey he looked round for guibert but could not see him  they rode on through the intricate lanes till the sun was high and scorching and berenger felt how far he was from perfect recovery at last however some little time past noon the gendarmes halted at a stone fountain outside a village and disposing a sufficient guard around his captives the officer permitted them to dismount and rest while he with the rest of the troop and the horses went to the village cabaret philip would have asked his brother what it meant and what was to be done but berenger shook his head and intimated that silence was safest as present since they might be listened to and philip who so much imagined treachery and iniquity to be the order of the day in france that he was scarcely surprised at the present disaster resigned himself to the same sullen endurance provisions and liquor were presently sent up from the inn but berenger could taste nothing but the cold water of the fountain which trickled out cool and fresh beneath an arch surmounted by a figure of our lady he bathed his face and head in the refreshing spring and lay down on a cloak in the shade philip keeping a constant change of drenched kerchiefs on his brow and hoping that he slept till at the end to two or three hours the captain returned gave the word to horse and the party rode on through intricate lanes blossoming with hawthorn and ringing with songs of birds that spoke a very different language now to berengers heart from what they had said in the hopeful morning  a convent bell was ringing to evensong when passing its gateway the escort turned up a low hill on the summit of which stood a chateau covering a considerable extent of ground with a circuit of wall whitewashed so as perfectly to glare in the evening sun at every angle a round slim turret crowned by a brilliant redtiled extinguisherlike cap and the whole surmounted by a tall old keep in the centre there was a square projection containing an arched gateway with heavy doorways which were thrown open as the party approached philip looked up as he rode in and over the doorway beheld the familiar fretted shield with the leopard in the corner and a moi ribaumont round it could it then be berengers own castle and was it thus that he was approaching it he himself had not looked up he was utterly spent with fatigue dejection and the severe headache brought on by the heat of the sun and was only intent on rallying his powers for the crisis of fate that was probably approaching and thus scarcely took note of the court into which he rode lying between the gateway and the corps de logis a building erected when comfort demanded more space than was afforded by the old keep against which one end leant but still though inclosed in a court the lower windows were small and ironbarred and all air of luxury was reserved for the mullioned casements of the upper storey the court was flagged but grass shot up between the stones and the trim air of ease and inhabited comfort to which the brothers were used at home was utterly wanting berenger was hustled off his horse and roughly pushed through a deep porch where the first thing he heard was the chevalier de ribaumonts voice in displeasure  how now sir hands off is this the way you conduct my nephew  he resisted sir  sir said berenger advancing into the hall i know not the meaning of this i am peacefully traveling with a passport from the king when i am set upon no warrant shown me my faithful servant slain myself and my brother an english subject shamefully handled  the violence shall be visited on whatever rascal durst insult a gentleman and my nephew said the chevalier for release it shall be looked to but unfortunately it is too true that there are orders from the queen in council for your apprehension and it was only on my special entreaty for the honour of the family and the affection i bear you that i was allowed to receive you here instead of your being sent to an ordinary prison  on what pretext demanded berenger  it is known that you have letters in your possession from escaped traitors now in england to la noue duplessis mornay and other heretics  that is easily explained said berenger you know well sir that they were to facilitate my search at la sablerie you shall see them yourself sir  that i must assuredly do replied the chevalier for it is the order of her majesty i regret to say that your person and baggage be searched then as indignant colour rushed into berengers face and an angry exclamation was beginning he added nay i understand my dear cousin it is very painful but we would spare you as much as possible it will be quite enough if the search is made by myself in the presence of this gentleman who will only stand by for forms sake i have no doubt it will enable us quickly to clear up matters and set you free again do me the honour to follow me to the chamber destined for you  let me see the order for my arrest said berenger holding his head high  the english scruple must be gratified said the chevalier and accordingly the gendarme captain unfolded before him a paper which was evidently a distinct order to arrest and examine the person of henri beranger eustache baron de ribaumont and sieur de leurre suspected of treasonable practicesand it bore the signature of catherine  there is nothing here said of my stepfathers son philip thistlewood nor of my servant humfrey holt said berenger gathering the sense with his dizzy eyes as best he could they cannot be detained being born subjects of the queen of england  they intercepted the justice of the king said the captain laying his hand on philips shoulder i shall have them off with me to the garrison of lugon and deal with them there  wait said the chevalier interposing before berengers fierce horrorstruck expostulation could break forth this is an honourable young gentleman son of a chevalier of good reputation in england and he need not be so harshly dealt with you will not separate either him or the poor groom from my nephew so the queens authority be now rightly acknowledged  the captain shrugged his shoulders as if displeased and the chevalier turning to berenger said you understand nephew the lot of you all depends on your not giving umbrage to these officers of her majesty i will do my poor best for you but submission is first needed  berenger knew enough of his native country to be aware that la justice du roi was a terrible thing and that philips resistance had really put him in so much danger that it was needful to be most careful not further to offend the functionary of government and abhorrent as the proposed search was to him he made no further objection but taking philips arm lest they should be separated he prepared to follow wherever he was to be conducted the chevalier led the way along a narrow stone passage with loopholewindows here and there and philip for all his proud indifferent bearing felt his flesh creep as he looked for a stair descending into the bowels of the earth a stair there was but it went up instead of down and after mounting this and going through a sort of anteroom a door was opened into a tolerably spacious apartment evidently in the old keep for the two windows on opposite sides were in an immensely massive wall and the floor above and vaulting below were of stone but otherwise there was nothing repulsive in the appearance of the room there was a wood fire on the hearth the sun setting far to the north peeped in aslant at one window a mat was on the floor tapestry on the lower part of the walls a table and chairs and a walnut chest with a chessboard and a few books on it were as much furniture as was to be seen in almost any livingroom of the day humfrey and guibert too were already there with the small riding valises they and poor smithers had had in charge these were at one opened but contained merely clothes and linen nothing else that was noticed except three books at which the captain looked with a stupid air and the chevalier did not seem capable of discovering more than that all three were latinone he believed the bible  yes sir the vulgatea copy older than the reformation so not liable to be called an heretical version said berenger to whom a copy had been given by lady walwyn as more likely to be saved if his baggage were searched the other is the office and psalter after our english rite and this last is not mine but mr sidneysa copy of virgilius maro which he had left behind at paris  the chevalier not willing to confess that he had taken the english prayerbook for latin hastily said nothing wrong thereno no nothing that will hurt the state may it only be so with what you carry on your person fair cousin stand back gentleman this is gear for myself alone now fair nephew he added not a hand shall be laid on you if you will give me your honourable word as a nobleman that you are laying before me all that you carry about you  an instants thought convinced berenger that resistance would save nothing and merely lead to indignity to himself and danger to philip and therefore he gave the promise to show everything about him without compulsion accordingly he produced his purse for current expenses poor king charless safeconduct and other articles of no consequence from his pockets then reluctantly opened his doublet and took off the belt containing his store of gold which had been replenished at walsinghams this was greedily eyed by the captain but the chevalier at once made it over to philips keeping graciously saying we do no more than duty requires but at the same time he made a gesture towards another small purse that hung round berengers neck by a black ribbon  on my sacred word and honour said berenger it contains nothing important to any save myself  alas my bounden duty urged the chevalier  an angry reply died on berengers lip at the thought of philip he opened the purse and held out the contents on his palm a tiny gold ring a tress of black hair a fragment of carnationribbon pricked with pinholes a string of small worthless yellow shells and threaded with them a large pearshaped pearl of countless price even the chevalier was touched at the sight of this treasury resting on the blanched palm of the thin trembling hand and jealously watched by eyes glistening with sudden moisture though the lips were firm set alas my poor young cousin he said you loved her well  not loved but love muttered berenger to himself as if having recourse to the only cordial that could support him through the present suffering and he was closing his fingers again over his precious hoard when the chevalier added stay nephewthat pearl  is one of the chaplet the token she sent to england he answered  pauvre petite then at least a fragment remains of the reward of our ancestors courage said the chevalier  and berenger did not feel it needful to yield up that still better possession stored within his heart that la petite and her pearls were safe together it was less unendurable to produce the leather case from a secret pocket within his doublet since unwilling as he was that any eye should scan the letters it contained there was nothing in them that could give any clue towards tracing her nothing had been written or received since his interview with the children at lucon there was indeed eustacies letter to his mother a few received at paris from lord walwyn reluctantly consenting to his journey in quest of his child his english passport the unfortunate letters to la noue and what evidently startled the chevalier more than all the rest the copy of the certificate of the ratification of the marriage but his consternation was so arranged as to appear to be all on behalf of his young kinsman this is serious he said striking his forehead you will be accused of forging the late kings name  this is but a copy said berenger pointing to the heading the original has been sent with our ambassadors dispatches to england  it is a pity said the chevalier looking thoroughly vexed that you should have brought fresh difficulties on yourself for a mere piece of waste paper to be affected by the validity of your marriage dear cousinhe glanced at the officer and lowered his voicelet me tear this paper it would only do you harm and the papal decree annuls it  i have given my word said berenger that all that could do me harm should be delivered up besides he added even had i the feeling for my own honour and that of my wife and child living or dead the harm it seems to me would be to those who withhold her lands from me  ah fair nephew you have fallen among designing persons who have filled your head with absurd claims but i will not argue the point now since it becomes a family not a state matter these papersand he took them into his handmust be examined and tomorrow captain delarue will take them to paris with any explanation you may desire to offer meantime you and your companions remain my guest at full liberty provided you will give me your parole to attempt no escape  no sir said berenger hotly we will not become our own jailers nor acquiesce in this unjust detention i warn you that i am a naturalized englishman acknowledged by the queen as my grandfathers heir and the english ambassador will inform the court what queen elizabeth thinks of such dealings with her subjects  well said exclaimed philip and drawing himself up he added i refuse my parole and warn you that it is at your peril that you imprison an englishman  very well gentlemen said the chevalier the difference will be that i shall unwillingly be forced to let captain delarue post guards at the outlets of this tower a room beneath is prepared for your grooms and the court is likewise free to you i will endeavour to make your detention as little irksome as you will permit and meantime allow me to show you your sleeping chamber he then politely as if he had been ushering a prince to his apartment led the way pointing to the door through which they had entered the keep and saying this is the only present communication with the dwellinghouse two gendarmes will always be on the outside he conducted the young men up a stone spiral stair to another room over that which they had already seen and furnished as fairly as ordinary sleeping chambers were wont to be  here said their compulsory host he would leave them to prepare for supper when they would do him the honour to join him in the eatinghall on their summons by the steward  his departing bow was duly returned by berenger but no sooner did his steps die away on the stairs than the young man threw himself down on his bed in a paroxysm of suffering both mental and bodily  berry berry what is this speak to me what does it all mean cried philip  how can i tell said berenger showing his face for a moment covered with tears only that my only friend is dead and some villainous trick has seized me justjust as i might have found her and ive been the death of my poor groom and got you into the power of these vile dastards oh would that i had come alone would that they had had the sense to aim direct  brother brother anything but this cried philip the rogues are not worth it sir francis will have us out in no time or know the reason why id scorn to let them wring a tear from me  i hope they never may dear phil nor anything worse  now continued philip the way will be to go down to supper since they will have it so and sit and eat at ones ease as if one cared for them no more than cat and dog hark theres the steward speaking to guibert come berry wash your face and come  imy head aches far too much were there nothing else  what it is nothing but the sun said philip put a bold face on it man and show them how little you heed  how little i heed bitterly repeated berenger turning his face away utterly unnerved between disappointment fatigue and pain and philip at that moment had little mercy dismayed and vaguely terrified yet too resolute in national pride to betray his own feelings he gave vent to his vexation by impatience with a temperament more visibly sensitive than his own i never thought you so mere a frenchman he said contemptuously if you weep and wail so like a sick wench they will soon have their will of you id have let them kill me before they searched me  tis bad enough without this from you phil said berenger faintly for he was far too much spent for resentment or selfdefence and had only kept up before the chevalier by dint of strong effort philip was somewhat aghast both at the involuntary gesture of pain and at finding there was not even spirit to be angry with him but his very dismay served at the moment only to feed his displeasure and he tramped off in his heavy boots which he chose to wear as a proof of disdain for his companions he explained that m de ribaumont was too much fatigued to come to supper and he was accordingly marched along the corridor with the steward before him bearing a lighted torch and two gendarmes with halberds behind him and in his walk he had ample time for first the resolution that illness and not dejection should have all the credit of berengers absence then for recollecting of how short standing had been his brothers convalescence and lastly for a fury of selfexecration for his own unkindness rude taunts and neglect of the recurring illness he would have turned about and gone back at once but the two gendarmes were close behind and he knew humfrey would attend to his brother so he walked on to the halla handsome chamber hung with armour and spoils of hunting with a few pictures on the panels and a great carved musicgallery at one end the table was laid out somewhat luxuriously for four according to the innovation which was beginning to separate the meals of the grandees from those of their household  great concern was expressed by the chevalier as philip in french much improved since the time of his conversation with madame de selinville spoke of his brothers indisposition saying with emphasis as he glared at captain delarue that maitre pare had forbidden all exposure to midday heat and that all their journeys had been made in morning or evening coolness my young friend as his host called him should he was assured have mentioned this since captain delarue had no desire but to make his situation as little painful as possible and the chevalier sent his steward at once to offer everything the house contained that his prisoner could relish for supper and then anxiously questioned philip on his health and diet obtaining very short and glum answers the chevalier and the captain glanced at each other with little shrugs and philip becoming conscious of his shock hair splashed doublet and dirty boots had vague doubts whether his english dignity were not being regarded as english lubberliness but of course he hated the two frenchmen all the more and received their civility with greater gruffness they asked him the present object of his journeythough probably the chevalier knew it before and he told of the hope that they had of finding the child at lucon  vain of course said the chevalier poor infant it is well for itself as for the rest of us that its troubles were ended long ago  philip started indignantly  does your brother still nurture any vain hope said the chevalier  not vain i trust said philip  indeed who can foolishly have so inspired him with a hope that merely wears out his youth and leads him into danger  philip held his tongue resolved to be impenetrable and he was so far successful that the chevalier merely became convinced that the brothers were not simply riding to la rochelle to embark for england but had some hope and purpose in view though as to what that might be philips bluff replies and stubborn silence were baffling  after the meal the chevalier insisted on coming to see how his guest fared and philip could not prevent him they found berenger sitting on the side of his bed having evidently just started up on hearing their approach otherwise he did not seem to have moved since philip left him he had not attempted to undress and humfrey told philip that not a word had been extracted from him but commands to let him alone  however he had rallied his forces to meet the chevalier and answered manfully to his excuses for the broiling ride to which he had been exposed that it mattered not the effect would pass it was a mere chance and refused all offers of medicaments potions and tisanes till his host at length left the room with a most correct exchange of good nights  berry berry what a brute i have been cried philip  foolish lad and berenger half smiled now help me to bed for the room turns round     chapter xxx caged in the blackbirds nest          let him shun castles safer shall he be on the sandy plain than where castles mounted standking henry vi   while berenger slept a heavy mornings sleep after a resless night philip explored the narrow domain above and below the keep and its little court had evidently been the original castle built when the oddlynicknamed fulkes and geoffreys of anjou had been at daggers drawn with the dukes of normandy and brittany but it had since like most other such ancient feudal fortresses become the nucleus of walls and buildings for use defence or ornament that lay beneath him like a spiders web when he had gained the roof of the keep garnished with pepperbox turrets at each of the four angles beyond lay the green copses and orchards of the bocage for it was true as he had at first suspected that this was the chateau de nid de merle and that berenger was a captive in his wifes own castle  chances of escape were the lads chief thought but the building on which he stood went sheer down for a considerable way then on the north side there came out the sharp highpitched tiled roof of the corps du logis on the south another roof surmounted by a cross at the gable and evidently belonging to the chapel on the other two sides lay courtsthat to the east a stableyard that to the west a small narrow chillylooking paved inclosure with enormouslymassive walls the doorway walled up and looking like a true prisonyard beyond this wallindeed on every sideextended offices servants houses stables untidy desolatelooking gardens and the whole was inclosed by the white wall with flanking redtiled turrets whose gaudy appearance had last night made philip regard the whole as a flimsy frenchchified erection but he now saw it to be of extremely solid stone and lime and with no entrance but the great barbican gateway they had entered by moreover with a yawning dry moat all round wherever he looked he saw these tall pointed red caps resembling he thought those worn by the victims of an autodefe as one of walsinghams secretaries had described them to him and he ground his teeth at them as thought they grinned at him like emissaries of the inquisition  descending he found berenger dressing in haste to avoid receiving an invalid visit from the chevalier looking indeed greatly shaken but hardly so as would have been detected by eyes that had not seen him during his weeks of hope and recovery he was as resolved as philip could wish against any sign of weakness before his enemy and altogether disclaimed illness refusing the stock of cooling drinks cordials and febrifuges which the chevalier said had been sent by his sister the abbess of bellaise he put the subject of his health aside only asking if this were the day that the gendarmecaptain would return to paris and then begging to see that officer so as to have a distinct understanding of the grounds of his imprisonment the captain had however been a mere instrument and when philip clamoured to be taken before the next justice of the peace even berenger smiled at him for thinking that such a being existed in france the only cause alleged was the vague but dangerous suspicion of conveying correspondence between england and the heretics and this might become extremely perilous to one undeniably half english regarded as whole huguenot caught on the way to la rochelle with a letter to la noue in his pocket and moreover to one who had had a personal affray with a king famous for storing up petty offences whom the last poor king had favoured and who in fine had claims to estates that could not spared to the huguenot interest  he was really not sure that there was not some truth in the professions of the chevalier being anxious to protect him from the queenmother and the guises he had never been able to divest himself of a certain trust in his old kinsmans friendliness and he was obliged to be beholden to him for the forms in which to couch his defence at the same time he wrote to sir francis walsingham and to his grandfather but with great caution lest his letters should be inspected by his enemies and with the less hope of their availing him because it was probable that the ambassador would return home on the kings death no answer could be expected for at least a fortnight and even then it was possible that the queenmother might choose to refer the cause to king henry who was then in poland  berenger wrote these letters with much thought and care but when they were once sealed he collapsed again into despair and impatience and frantically paced the little court as if he would dash himself against the walls that detained him from eustacie then threw himself moodily into a chair hid his face in his crossed arms and fell a prey to all the wretched visions called up by an excited brain  however he was equally alive with philip to the highspirited resolution that his enemies should not perceive or triumph in his dejection he showed himself at the noonday dinner before captain delarue departed grave and silent but betraying no agitation and he roused himself from his sad musings at the supperhour to arrange his hair and assume the ordinary dress of gentlemen in the evening though philip laughed at the roses adorning his shoes and his fresh ruff as needless attentions to an old ruffian like the chevalier however philip started when he entered the hall and beheld not the chevalier alone but with him the beautiful lady of the velvet coach and another stately extremely handsome dame no longer in her first youth and in costly black and white garments when the chevalier called her his sister madame de bellaise philip had no notion that she was anything but a widow living a secular life and though a couple of nuns attended her their dress was so much less conventual than cecilys that he did not at first find them out it was explained that madame de selinville was residing with her aunt and that having come to visit her father he had detained the ladies to supper hoping to enliven the sojourn of his beaux cousins  madame de selinville looking anxiously at berenger hoped she saw him in better health he replied stiffly that he was perfectly well and then by way of safety repaired to the society of the abbess who immediately began plying him with questions about england its court and especially the secret marriage of queen elisabeth and ce comte de dudley on which she was so minutely informed as to put him to the blush then she was very curious about the dispersed convents and how many of the nuns had married and she seemed altogether delighted to have secured the attention of a youth from the outer world his soul at first recoiled from her as one of eustacies oppressors and from her unconventlike talk and yet he could not but think her a goodnatured person and wonder if she could rally have been hard upon his poor little wife and she who had told eustacie she would strangle with her own hands the scion of the rival houseshe like most women was much more bitter against an unseen being out of reach than towards a courteouslymannered pale sufferinglooking youth close beside her she had enough affection for eustacie to have grieved much at her wanderings and at her fate and now the sorrowstricken look that by no effort could be concealed really moved her towards the youth bereaved husband besides were not all feuds on the point of being made up by the excellent device concocted between her brother and her niece  meantime philip was in raptures with the kindness of the beautiful madame de selinville he whom the mistresses walsingham treated as a mere clumsy boy was promoted by her manner to be a man and a cavalier he blushed up to the roots of his hair and looked sheepish whenever one of her entrancing smiles lit upon him but then she inquired after his brother so cordially she told him so openly how brilliant had been berengers career at the court she regretted so heartily their present danger and detention and promised so warmly to use her interest with queen catherine that in the delight of being so talked to he forgot his awkwardness and spoke freely and confidentially maybe too confidentially for he caught berenger frowning at him and made a sudden halt in his narrative disconcerted but very angry with his brother for his distrust  when the ladies had ridden away to the convent in the summer evening and the two brothers had returned to their prison philip would have begun to rave about madame de selinville but his mouth was stopped at once with dont be such a fool phil and when perrine shut his eyes leant back and folded his arms together there was no more use in talking to him  this exceeding defection continued for a day or two while berengers whole spirit chafed in agony at his helplessness and like demons there ever haunted him the thoughts of what might betide eustacie young fair forsaken and believing herself a widow proudly defiant as he showed himself to all eyes beyond his tower he seemed to be fast gnawing and pining himself away in the anguish he suffered through these long days of captivity  perhaps it was philips excitement about any chance of meeting madame de selinville that first roused him from the contemplation of his own misery it struck him that if he did not rouse himself to exert his influence the boy left to no companionship save what he could make for himself might be led away by intercourse with the gendarmes or by the blandishments of diane whatever might be her game he must be watched over and returned to sir marmaduke the same truehearted honest lad who had left home nor had berenger lain so long under cecily st johns tender watching without bearing away some notes of patience trust and dutifulness that returned upon him as his mind recovered tone after the first shock the whispers that had bidden him tarry the lords leisure be strong and commit his way to him who could bring it to pass and could save eustacie as she had already been saved returned to him once more he chid himself for his faintness of heart rallied his powers and determined that cheerfulness dutifulness and care for philip should no longer fail  so he reviewed his resources and in the first place arranged for a brief daily worship with his two english fellowprisoners corresponding to the home hours of chapel service then he proposed to philip to spend an hour every day over the study of the latin bible and when philip showed himself reluctant to give up his habit of staring over the battlements he represented that an attack on their faith was not so improbable but that they ought to be prepared for it  im quite prepared quoth philip i shall not listen to a word they say  however he submitted to this but was more contumacious as to berengers other proposal of profiting by sidneys copy of virgil here at least he was away from mr adderley and study and it passed endurance to have latin and captivity both at once he was more obliged for berengers offer to impart to him the instruction in fencing he had received during his first visit to paris the chevalier made no difficulty about lending them foils and their little court became the scene of numerous encounters as well as of other games and exercises more sedentary sports were at their service chess tables dice or cards but philip detested these and they were only played in the evening or on a rainy afternoon by berenger and the chevalier  it was clearly no part of the old gentlemans plan to break their health or spirits he insisted on taking them out riding frequently though always with four gendarmes with loaded arquebuses so as to preclude all attempt at escape or conversation with the peasants the rides were hateful to both youths but berenger knew that so many hours of tedium were thus disposed of and hoped also to acquire some knowledge of the country indeed he looked at every cottage and every peasant with affectionate eyes as probably having sheltered eustacie and philip after one visit paid to the convent at bellaise was always in hopes of making such another his boyish admiration of madame de selinville was his chief distraction coming on in accesses whenever there was a hope of seeing her and often diverting berenger by its absurdities even though at other times he feared that the lad might be led away by it or dissension sown between them meetings were rarenow and then madame de selinville would appear at dinner or at supper as her fathers guest and more rarely the chevalier would turn his horses head in the direction of bellaise and the three gentlemen would be received in the unpartitioned parlour and there treated to such lemon cakes as had been the ruin of la sablerie but in general the castle and the convent had little intercourse or only just enough to whet the appetite of the prisoners for what constituted their only variety  six weeks had lagged by before any answer from paris was received and then there was no reply from walsingham who had it appeared returned home immediately after king charless funeral the letter from the council bore that the queenmother was ready to accept the baron de ribaumonts excuses in good part and to consider his youth and she had no doubt of his being treated with the like indulgence by the king provided he would prove himself a loyal subject by embracing the catholic faith renouncing all his illegitimate claims to the estates of nid de merle and in pledge of his sincerity wedding his cousin the countess de selinville so soon as a dispensation should have been procured on no other consideration could he be pardoned or set at liberty  then said berenger slowly a prisoner i must remain until it be the will of heaven to open the doors  fair nephew exclaimed the chevalier make no rash replies bethink you to what you expose yourself by obstinacy i may no longer be able to protect you when the king returns and he further went on to represent that by renouncing voluntarily all possible claims on the nid de merle estates the baron would save the honour of poor eustacie which indeed equally concerned the rest of the family since they then would gladly drop all dispute of the validity of the marriage and the lands of selinville would be an ample equivalent for these as well as for all expectations in england  sir it is impossible said berenger my wife lives  comment when you wear mourning for her  i wear black because i have been able to procure nothing else since i have been convinced that she did not perish at la sablerie i was on my way to seek her when i was seized and detained here  where would you have sought her my poor cousin compassionately asked the chevalier  that i know not she may be in england by this time but that she escaped from la sablerie i am well assured  alas my poor friend you feed on delusion i have surer evidenceyou shall see the man yourselfone of my sons people who was actually at the assault and had strict orders to seek and save her would that i could feel the least hope left  is the man here let me see him said berenger hastily  he was at once sent for and proved to be one of the stable servants a rough soldierlylooking man who made no difficulty in telling that m de nid de merle had bidden his own troop to use every effort to reach the widow laurents house and secure the lady they had made for it but missed the way and met with various obstacles and when they reached it it was already in flames and he had seen for a moment mademoiselle de nid de merle whom he well knew by sight with an infant in her arms at an upper window he had called to her by name and was about to send for a ladder when recognizing the ribaumont colours she had turned back and thrown herself and her child into the flames m de nid de merle was frantic when he heard of it and they had searched for the remains among the ruins but bah it was like a limekiln nothing was to be foundall was calcined  no fragment left said berenger not a corner of tile or beam  not so much wood as you could boil an egg with i will swear it on the mass  that is needless said berenger i have seen the spot myself that is all i desired to ask  the chevalier would have taken his hand and condoled with him over the horrible story but he drew back repeating that he had seen widow laurents house and that he saw that some parts of the mans story were so much falsified that he could not believe the rest moreover he knew that eustacie had not been in the town at the time of the siege  now the chevalier bona fide believed the mans story so far as that he never doubted that eustacie had perished and he looked on berengers refusal to accept the tale as the mournful last clinging to a vain hope in his eyes the actual sight of eustacie and the total destruction of the house were mere matters of embellishment possibly untrue but not invalidating the main fact he only said well my friend i will not press you while the pain of this narration is still fresh  thank you sir but this is not pain for i believe not a word of it therefore it is impossible for me to entertain the proposal even if i could forsake my faith or my english kindred you remember sir that i returned this same answer at paris when i had no hope that my wife survived  true my fair cousin but i fear time will convince you that this constancy is unhappily misplaced you shall have time to consider and when it is proved to you that my poor niece is out of the reach of your fidelity and when you have become better acquainted with the claims of the church to your allegiance then may it only prove that your conversion does not come too late i have the honour to take my leave  one moment more sir is there no answer as to my brother  none cousin as i told you your country has at present no ambassador but of course on your fulfillment of the conditions he would be released with you  so said philip when the old knight had quitted the room of course you cannot marry while eustacie lives but if  not another word profane boy angrily cried berenger  i was only going to say it is a pity of one so goodly not to bring her over to the true faith and take her to england  much would she be beholden to you said berenger so he added sighing i had little hope but that it would be thus i believe it is all a web of this old plotters weaving and that the queenmother acts in it at his request he wants only to buy me off with his daughters estates from asserting my claim to this castle and lands and i trow he will never rise up here tilltill  till when berry  till mayhap my grandfather can move the queen to do something for us or till madame de selinville sees a face she likes better than her brothers carving or what can i tell till malice is tired out and heavens will sets us free may eustacie only have reached home but im sorry for you my poor phil  never heed brother said philip what is prison to me so that i can now and then see those lovely eyes  and the languishing air of the clumsy lad was so comical as to beguile berenger into a laugh yet berengers own feeling would go back to his first meeting with diane and as he thought of the eyes then fixed on him he felt that he was under a trial that might become more severe     chapter xxxi the dark pool of the future          triumph triumph only she       that knit his bonds can set him free                               southey   no change was made in the life of the captives of nid de merle after the answer from paris except that pere bonami who had already once or twice dined at the chevaliers table was requested to make formal exposition of the errors of the reformers and of the tenets of his own church to the baron de ribaumont  philip took such good care not to be deluded that though he sat by to see fair play yet it was always with his elbows on the table and his fingers in his ears regardless of appearing to the priest in the character of the deaf adder after all he was not the object and good pere bonami at first thought the day his own when he found that almost all his arguments against calvinism were equally impressed upon berengers mind but the differences soon revealed themselves and the priest though a good man was not a very happilychosen champion for he was one of the oldfashioned scantilyinstructed country priests who were more numerous before the jesuit revival of learning and knew nothing of controversy save that adapted to the doctrines of calvin so that in dealing with an anglican of the school of ridley and hooker it was like bow ad arrow against sword and tin those days of change controversial reading was one of the primary studies even of young laymen and lord walwyn with a view to his grandsons peculiar position had taken care that he should be well instructed so that he was not at all unequal to the contest moreover apart from argument he clung as a point of honour to the church as to the wife that he had accepted in his childhood and often tried to recall the sketch that philip sidney had once given him of a tale that a friend of his designed to turn into a poem like ariostos in terza rima of a red cross knight separated from his una as the true faith and tempted by a treacherous duessa who impersonated at once falsehood and rome and he knew so well that the last relaxation of his almost terrified resistance would make him so entirely succumb to dianes beauty and brilliancy that he kept himself stiffly frigid and reserved  diane never openly alluded to the terms on which he stood but he often found gifts from unknown hands placed in his room the books which he had found there were changed when he had had time to study them and marks were placed in some of the most striking passages they were of the class that turned the brain of the knight of la mancha but with a predominance of the pastoral such as diane of george of montemayor and his numerous imitatorswhich philip thought horrible stuffenduring nothing but a few of the combats of amadis de gaul or palmerin of england until he found that madame de selinville prodigiously admired the silly swains more silly than their sheep and was very anxious that m le baron should be touched by their beauties whereupon honest philip made desperate efforts to swallow them in his brothers stead but was always found fast asleep in the very middle of arguments between damon and thyrsis upon the devoirs of love or the mournings of some disconsolate nymph over her jealousies of a favoured rival  one day a beautiful ivory box exhaling sweet perfume appeared in the prison chamber and therewith a sealed letter in verse containing an affecting description of how corydon had been cruelly torn by the lions in endeavouring to bear away sylvie from her cavern how sylvie had been rent from him and lost and how vainly he continued to bewail her and disregard the loving lament of daphne who had ever mourned and pined for him as she kept her flock made the rivulets the brooks the mountains reecho with her sighs and plaints and had wandered through the hills and valleys gathering simples wherewith she had compounded a balsam that might do away with the scars that the claws of the lions had left so that he might again appear with the glowing cheeks and radiant locks that had excited the envy of the god of day  berenger burst out laughing over the practical part of this poetical performance and laughed the more at philips hurt injured air at his mirth philip who would have been the first to see the absurdity in any other daphne thought this a passing pleasant device and considered it very unkind in his brother not even to make experiment of the balsam of simples but to declare that he had much rather keep his scars for eustacies sake than wear a smooth face to please diane  still berengers natural courtesy stood in his way he could not help being respectful and attentive to the old chevalier when their terms were apparently at least those of host and guest and to a lady he could not be rude and repellant though he could be reserved so when the kinsfolk met no stranger would have discovered that one was a prisoner and the others his captors  one august day when madame de selinville and her lady attendants were supping at the castle at the early hour of six a servant brought in word that an italian pedlar craved leave to display his wares he was welcome both for needs sake and for amusement and was readily admitted he was a handsome olivefaced italian and was followed by a little boy with a skin of almost moorish dyeand great was the display at once made on the tables of     lawn as white as driven snow     cyprus black as eer was crow     gloves as sweet as fragrant posies     masks for faces and for noses  and there was a good deal of the eager desultory bargaining that naturally took place where purchasing was an unusual excitement and novelty and was to form a whole evenings amusement berenger while supplying the defects of his scanty traveling wardrobe was trying to make out whether he had seen the man before wondering if he were the same whom he had met in the forest of montipipeau though a few differences in dress hair and beard made him somewhat doubtful  perfumes yes lady i have store of perfumes ambergris and violet dew and the turkish essence distilled from roses yea and the finest spirit of the venus myrtletree the secret known to the roman dames of old whereby they secured perpetual beauty and lovethough truly madame should need no such essence that which nature has bestowed on her secures to her all heartsand one valued more than all  enough said diane blushing somewhat though with an effort at laughing off his words these are the tricks of your trade  madame is incredulous yet lady i have been in the east yonder boy comes from the land where there are spells that make known the secrets of lives  the old chevalier who had hitherto been taken up with the abstruse calculationderived from his past days of economyhow much ribbon would be needed to retrim his murrey justaucorps here began to lend an ear though saying nothing philip looked on in openeyed wonder and nudged his brother who muttered in return jugglery  ah the fair company are all slow to believe said the pedlar hola alessio and taking a glove that philip had left on the table he held it to the boy a few unintelligible words passed between them then the boy pointed direct to philip and waved his hand northwards he says the gentleman who owns this glove comes from the north from far away interpreted the italian then as the boy made the gesture of walking in chains that he is a captive  ay cried philip right lad and can he tell how long i shall be so  things yet to come said the mountebank are only revealed after long preparation for them must he gaze into the dark poor of the future the present and the past he can divine by the mere touch of what has belonged to the person  it is passing strange said philip to madame de selinville you credit it madame  ah have we not seen the wonders come to pass that a like diviner fortold to the queenmother said diane her sons should be all kingsthat was told her when the eldest was yet dauphin  and there is only one yet to come said philip awestruck but see what has he now  veroniques kerchief returned madame de selinville as the italian began to interpret the boys gesture  pretty maidens he says serve fair ladiesbear tokens for them this damsel has once been the bearer of a bouquet of heather of the pink and white whose bells were to ring hope  eh eh madame it is true cried veronique crimson with surprise and alarm m le baron knows it is true  berenger had started at this revelation and uttered an inarticulate exclamation but at that moment the boy in whose hand his master had placed a crown from the money newly paid began to make vehement gestures which the main interpreted le balafre he says pardon me gentlemen le balafre could reveal even a deeper scar of the heart than of the visageand the boys brown hand was pressed on his heartyet truly there is yet hope esperance to be found yesas the boy put his hand to his neckhe bears a pearl parted from its sister pearls where they are there is hope who can miss hope who has sought it at a royal deathbed  ah where is it berenger could not help exclaiming  sir said the pedlar as i told messieurs and mesdames before the spirits that cast the lights of the future on the dark pool need invocation ere he can answer m le barons demands he and i must have time and seclusion if monsieur le chevalier will grant us an empty room there will we answer all queries on which the spirits will throw light  and how am i to know that you will not bring the devil to shatter the castle my friend demanded the chevalier or more likely still that you are not laughing all the time at these credulous boys and ladies  of that sir you may here convince yourself said the mountebank putting into his hand a sort of credential in italian signed by renato di milano the queens perfumer testifying to the skill of his compatriot ercole stizzito both in perfumery cosmetics and in the secrets of occult sciences  the chevalier was no italian scholar and his daughter interpreted the scroll to him in a rapid low voice adding i have had many dealings with rene of milan father i know he speaks sooth there can be no harm in letting the poor man play out his playall the castle servants will be frantic to have their fortunes told  i must speak with the fellow first daughter said the chevalier he must satisfy me that he has no unlawful dealings that could bring the church down on us and he looked meaningly at the mountebank who replied by a whole musterroll of ecclesiastics male and female who had heard and approved his predictions  a few more words with thee fellow said the chevalier pointing the way to one of the rooms opening out of the hall as master of the house i must be convinced of his honesty he added if i am satisfied then who will may seek to hear their fortune  chevalier man and boy disappeared and philip was the first to exclaim a strange fellow what will he tell us madame shall you hear him  that depends on my fathers report she said and yet sadly and pensively my future is dark and void enough why should i vex myself with hearing it  nay it may brighten said philip  scarcely while hearts are hard she murmured with a slight shake of the head that philip thought indescribably touching but berenger was gathering his purchases together and did not see and you brother said philip you mean to prove him  no said berenger have you forgotten phil the anger we met with when we dealt with the gipsy at hurst fair  pshaw berry we are past flogging now  out of reach phil of the rod but scarce of the teaching it struck into us  what said philip sulkily  that divining is either cozening manor forsaking god phil either it is falsehood or it is a lying wonder of the devil  but berry this man is not cheat  then he is worse  only turn not away brother how should he have known things that even i know notthe heather  no marvel in that said berenger this is the very man i bought annoras fan from he was prowling round montpipeau and my heather was given to veronique with little secrecy and as to the royal deathbed it was rene his master who met me there  then you think it mere cozeing if so we should find it out  i dont reckon myself keener than an accomplished italian mountebank said berenger dryly  further conference was cut short by the return of the chevalier saying in his paternal genial way well children i have examined the fellow and his credentials and for those who have enough youth and hope to care to have the future made known to them bah it is well  is it sorcery sir asked philip anxiously  the chevalier shrugged his shoulders what know i he said for those who have a fine nose for brimstone there may be but he assures me it is but the white magic practiced in egypt and the boy is christian  did you try this secret father inquired madame de selinville  i my daughter an old mans fortune is in his children what have i to ask  ii scarcely like to be the first said the lady eager but hesitating veronique you would have your fortune told  i will be the first said philip stepping forward manfully i will prove him for you lady and tell you whether he be a cozener or not or if his magic be fit for you to deal with  and confident in the inherent intuition of a plain englishman as well as satisfied to exercise his resolution for once in opposition to berengers opinion master thistlewood stepped towards the closet where the italian awaited his clients and berenger knew that it would be worse than useless to endeavour to withhold him he only chafed at the smile which passed between father and daughter at this doughty selfassertion  there was a long silence berenger sat with his eyes fixed on the window where the twilight horizon was still soft and bright with the pearly gold of the late sunset thinking with an intensity of yearning what it would be could he truly become certain of eustacies present doings questioning whether he would try to satisfy that longing by the doubtful auguries of the diviner and then recollecting how he had heard from wrecked sailors that to seek to delude their thirst with seawater did but aggravate their misery he knew that whatever he might hear would be unworthy of confidence either it merely framed to soothe and please himor were it a genuine oracle he had no faith in the instinct that was to perceive it but what he had faith in was the divine protection over his lost ones no he thought to himself i will not by a presumptuous sin in my own impatience risk incurring woes on them that deal with familiar spirits and wizards that peep and mutter if ever i am to hear of eustacie again it shall be by gods will not the devils  diane de selinville had been watching his face all the time and now said with that almost timid air of gaiety that she wore when addressing him you too cousin are awaiting monsieur philippes report to decide whether to look into the pool of mystery  not at all madame said berenger gravely i do not understand white magic  our good cousin has been too well bred among the reformers to condescend to our little wickednesses daughter said the chevalier and the sneermuch like that which would await a person now who scrupled at joining in tableturning or any form of spiritualismpurpled berengers scar now his only manner of blushing but he instantly perceived that it was the chevaliers desire that he should consult the conjurer and therefore became the more resolved against running into a trap  i am sure said madame de selinville earnestly though with an affectation of lightness a little wickedness is fair when there is a great deal at stake for my part i would not hesitate long to find out how soon the king will relent towards my fair cousin here  that madame said berenger with the same grave dryness is likely to be better known to other persons than this wandering greek boy  here philips step was heard returning hastily he was pale and looked a good deal excited so that madame de selinville uttered a little cry and exclaimed ah is it so dreadful then  no no madame said philip turning round with a fervour and confidence he had never before shown on my word there is nothing formidable you see nothingnothing but the italia and the boy the boy gazes into a vessel of some black liquid and seessees there all you would have revealed ah  then you believe asked madame de selinville  it cannot be false answered philip he told me everything things he could not have known my very home my fathers house passed in review before that strange little blackamoors eyes where ithough i would have given worlds to see itbeheld only the lamp mirrored in the dark pool  how do you know it was your fathers house said berenger  i could not doubt just to test the fellow i bade him ask for my native place the little boy gazed smiled babbled his gibberish pointed the man said he spoke of a fair mansion among green fields and hills a grand cavalier embonpointthose were his very wordsat the door with a tankard in one hand ah my dear father why could not i see him too but who could mistake him or the manor  and did he speak of future as well as past said diane  yes yes yes said philip with more agitation lady that will you know for yourself  it was not dreadful she said rising  oh no and philip had become crimson and hesitated certes not dreadful buti must not say more  save good night said berenger rising see our gendarmes are again looking as if we had long exceeded their patience it is an hour later than we are wont to retire  if it be your desire to consult this mysterious fellow now you have heard your brothers report my dear baron said the chevalier the gendarmes may devour their impatience a little longer  thanks sir said berenger but i am not tempted and he gave the usual signal to the gendarmes who during meals used to stand as sentries at the great door of the hall  it might settle your mind muttered philip hesitating and yetyet  but he used no persuasions and permitted himself to be escorted with his brother along the passages to their own chamber where he threw himself into a chair with a long sigh and did not speak berenger meantime opened the bible glanced over the few verses he meant to read found the place in the prayerbook and was going to the stairs to call humfrey when philip broke forth wait berry dont be in such haste  what you want time to lose the taste of your dealings with the devil said berenger smiling  pshaw no devil in the matter testily said philip no i was only wishing you had not had a puritan fit and seen and heard for yourself then i should not have had to tell you and he sighed  i have no desire to be told said berenger who had become more fixed in the conviction that it was an imposture  no desire ah i have none when i knew what it was but you ought to know  well said berenger you will burst anon if i open not my ears  dear berry speak not thus it will be the worse for you when you do hear alack berenger all ours have been vain hopes i asked for herand the boy fell wellnigh into convulsions of terror as he gazed spoke of flames and falling houses that was wherefore i pressed you not againit would have wrung your heart too much the boy fairly wept and writhed himself crying out in his tongue for pity on the fair lady and the little babe in the burning house alack brother said philip a little hurt that his brother had not changed countenance  this is the lying tale of the manatarms which our own eyes contradicted said berenger and no doubt was likewise inspired by the chevalier  see the boy brother how should he have heard the chevalier nay you might hug your own belief but it is hard that we should both be in durance for your mere dream that she lives  come phil it will be the devil indeed that sows dissension between us said berenger you know well enough that were it indeed with my poor eustacie as they would fain have us believe rather than give up her fair name i would not in prison for life or would you have me renounce my faith or wed madame de selinville upon the witness of a pool of ink that i am a widower he added almost laughing  for that matter muttered philip a good deal ashamed and half affronted you know i value the protestant faith so that i never heard a word from the will old priest nevertheless the boy when i asked of our release saw the gates set open by love  what did love look like in the pool had he wings like the cupids in the ballets at the louvre asked berenger provokingly  i tell you i saw nothing said philip tartly this was the italians interpretation of the boys gesture it was to be by means of love he said and of a lady whohe made it plain enough who she was added the boy colouring  no doubt as the chevalier have instructed him to say that ii he hesitated that mymy lovei mean that he saw my shield per pale with the field fretty and the sable leopard  oh it is to be my daughter is it said berenger laughing i am very happy to entertain your proposals for her  berenger what mocking fiend has possessed you cried philip half angrily half pitifully how can you so speak of that poor child  because the more they try to force on me the story of her fate the plainer it is to me that they do not believe it i shall find her yet and then phil you shall have the first chance  philip growled  well phil said his brother goodhumouredly any way till this love comes that is to let us out dont let moor or fiend come between us let me keep my credence for the honest baillis daughters at lucon and remember i would give my life to free you but i cannot give away my faith philip bent his head he was of too stubborn a mould to express contrition or affection but he mused for five minutes then called humfrey and at the last moment as the heavy tread came upstairs he turned round and said youre in the right ont there berry hap what hap the foul fiend may carry off the conjurer before i murmur at you again still i wish you had seen him you would know tis sooth  while berenger in his prison chamber with the lamplight beaming on his high white brow and clear eye stood before his two comrades in captivity their truehearted faces composed to reverence and as he read i have hated them that hold of superstitious vanities and my trust hath been in the lord i will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy for thou hast considered my trouble and hast known my soul in adversities feeling that here was the oracle by which he was willing to abidediane de selinville was entering the cabinet where the secrets of the future were to be unveiled  there she stoodthe beautiful court ladyher lace coif of the mary of scotland type well framed the beautiful oval of her face and set of the clear olive of her complexion softened by short jetty curls at the temples and lighted splendid dark eyes and by the smiles of a perfect pair of lips a transparent veil hung back over the ruff like frostworkformed fairy wings and over the white silk bodice and sleeves laced with violet and the violet skirt that fell in ample folds on the ground only however in the dim light revealing by an occasional gleam that it was not black it was a stately presence yet withal there was a tremor a quiver of the downcast eyelids and a trembling of the fair hand as though she were ill at ease even though it was by no means the first time she had trafficked with the dealers in mysterious arts who swarmed around catherine de medicis there were words lately uttered that weighed with her in their simplicity and she could not forget them in that gloomy light as she gazed on the brown face of the italian ercole faultless in outline as a classical mask but the black depths of the eyes sparkling with intensity of observation as if they were everywhere at once and gazed through and through he wore his national dress with the short cloak over one shoulder but the little boy who stood at the table had been fantastically arrayed in a sort of semialbanian garb a red cap with a long tassel a dark goldembroidered velvet jacket sitting close to his body and a white kilt over his legs bare except for buskins stiff with gold the poor little fellow looked pale in spite of his tawny hue his enormous black eyes were heavy and weary and he seemed to be trying to keep aloof from the small brazen vessel formed by the coils of two serpents that held the inky liquid of which philip had spoken  no doubt of the veritable nature of the charm crossed diane her doubt was of its lawfulness her dread of the supernatural region she was invading she hesitated before she ventured on her first question and started as the italian first spokewhat would the eccelentissima ladies often hesitate to speak the question nearest their hearts yet is it ever the same but the lady must be pleased to form it herself in words or the lad will not see her vision  where then is my brother said diane still reluctant to come direct to the point  the boy gazed intently into the black pool his great eyes dilating till they seemed like black wells and after a long time that diane could have counted by the throbs of her heart he began to close his fingers perform the action over the other arm of one playing on the lute throw his head back close his eyes and appear to be singing a lullaby then he spoke a few words to his master quickly  he see said ercole a gentleman touching the lute seated in a bedroom where lies on a rich pillow another gentlemanand as the boy stroked his face and pointed to his handswearing a mask and gloves it is he says in my own land in italy and as the boy made the action of rowing in the territory of venice  it is well said madame de selinville who knew that nothing was more probable than that her brother should be playing the king to his sleep in the medicated mask and gloves that cherished the royal complexion and moreover that henry was lingering to take his pastime in italy to the great inconvenience of his kingdom  her next question came nearer her heatyou saw the gentleman with a scar will he leave this castle  the boy gazed then made gestures of throwing his arms wide and of passing out and as he added his few words the master explained he sees the gentleman leaving the castle through open gate in full day on horseback andand it is madame who is with them he added as the lad pointed decidedly to her it is madame who opens their prison  dianes face lighted with gladness for a moment then she said faltering most women of her day would not have been even thus reserved then i shall marry again  the boy gazed and knitted his brow then without any pantomime looked up and spoke the eccellentissima shall be a bride once more he says explained the man but after a sort he cannot understand it is exhausting lady thus to gaze into the invisible future the boy becomes confused and exhausted ere long  once morei will only ask of the past my cousin is he married or a widower  the boy clasped his hands and looked imploringly shaking his head at the dark pool as he murmured an entreating word to his master ah madame said the italian that question hath already been demanded by the young inglese the poor child has been so terrified by the scene it called up that he implored he may not see it again a sacked and burning town a lady in a flaming house  enough enough said de i could as little bear to hear as he to see it is what we have ever known and feared and nowshe blushed as she spokesir you will leave me one of those potions that signor renato is wont to compound  capisco said ercole but the eccellentissima shall be obeyed if she will supply the means for the expense will be heavy  the bargain was agreed upon and a considerable sum advanced for a philter compounded of strange eastern plants and mystic jewels and then diane with a shudder of relief passed into the full light of the hall bade her father good night and was handed by him into the litter that had long been awaiting her at the door  the chevalier then with care on his brow bent his steps towards the apartment where the italian still remained counting the money he had received  so he said as he entered so fellow i have not hindered your gains and you have been true to your agreement  illustrissimo yes the pool of vision mirrored the flames but nothing beyondnothingnothing  they asked you then no more of those words you threw out of esperance  only the english youth sir and there were plenty of other hopes to dance before the eyes of such a lad with m le baron it will be needful to be more guarded  m le baron shall not have the opportunity said the chevalier he may abide by his decision and what the younger one may tell him fear not good man it shall be made good to you if you obey my commands i have other work for you but first repeat to me more fully what you told me before where was it that you saw this unhappy girl under the name of esperance  at a hostel sir at charente where she was attending on an old heretic teacher of the name of gardon who had fallen sick there being pinched by the fiend with rheumatic pains after his deserts she bore the name of esperance gardon and passed for his sons widow  and by what means did you know her not to be the mean creature she pretended said the chevalier with a gesture of scornful horror  illustrissimo i never forget a face i had seen this lady with m le baron when they made purchases of various trinkets at montpipeau and i saw her full again i had the honour to purchase from her certain jewels that the eccellenza will probably redeem and evenpardon siri cut off and bought of her her hair  her hair exclaimed the chevalier in horror the miserable girl to have fallen so low is it with you fellow  surely illustrissimo such tressesso shining so silky so well kepti reserved to adorn the heads of signor renatos most princely customers said the man unpacking from the inmost recesses of one of his most ingeniously arranged packages a parcel which contained the rich mass of beautiful black tresses ah her head looked so noble he added that i felt it profane to let my scissors touch those locks but she said that she could never wear them openly more and that they did but take up her time and were useless to her child and her fatheras she called him and she much needed the medicaments for the old man that i gave her in exchange  heavens a daughter of ribaumont sighed the chevalier clenching his hand and now man let me see the jewels with which the besotted child parted  the jewels were not many nor remarkable no one but a member of the family would have identified them and not one of the pearls was there and the chevalier refrained from inquiring after them lest by putting the italian on the scent of anything so exceptionally valuable he should defeat his own object and lead to the mans securing the pearls and running away with them but ercole understood his glance with the quickness of a man whose trade forced him to read countenances the eccellenza is looking for the pearls of ribaumont the lady made no offer of them to me  do you believe that she has them still  i am certain of it sir i know that she has jewelsthough she said not what they werewhich she preserved at the expense of her hair it was thus the old man had it seems been for weeks on the rack with pains caught by a chill when they fled from la sablerie and though the fever had left him he was still so stiff in the joints as to be unable to move i prescribed for him unguents of balm and indian spice which as the eccellenza knows are worth far more than their weight in gold nor did these jewels make up the cost of these together with the warm cloak for him and the linen for her child that she had been purchasing i tell you sir the babe must have no linen but the finest fabric of cambraiyes and even carnationcoloured ribbonsthough for herself i saw the homespun she was sewing as she mused over what she could throw back i asked if she had no other gauds to make up the price and she said almost within herself they are my childs not mine then remembering that i had been buying the hair of the peasant maidens she suddenly offered me her tresses but i could yet secure the pearls if eccellenza would  do you then believe her to be in any positive want or distress said the chevalier  signor no the heretical households among whom she travels gladly support the families of their teachers and at catholic inns they pay their way i understood them to be on their way to a synod of satan at the nest of heretics montauban where doubtless the old miscreant would obtain an appointment to some village  when did you thus full in with them  it was on one of the days of the week of pentecost said ercole it is at that time i frequent fairs in those parts to gather my little harvest on the maidens heads  parbleu class not my niece with those sordid beings man said the chevalier angrily here is your pricetossing a heavy purse on the tableand as much more shall await you when you bring me sure intelligence where to find my niece you understand and mark not one word of the gentleman you saw here you say she believes him dead  the illustrissimo must remember that she never dropped her disguise with me but i fully think that she supposed herself a widow and i understand the eccellenza she is still to think so i may be depended on  you understand repeated the chevalier this sum shall reward you when you have informed me where to find heras a man like you can easily trace her from montauban if you have any traffickings with her it shall be made worth your while to secure the pearls for the family but remember the first object is herself and that she should be ignorant of the existence of him whom she fancied her husband  i see signor and not a word of course of my having come from you i will discover her and leave her noble family to deal with her has the illustrissimo any further commands  none began the chevalier then suddenly this unhappy infantis it healthy did it need any of your treatment  signor no it was a fair healthy bambina of a year old and i heard the mother boasting that it had never had a days illness  ah the less a child has to do in the world the more is it bent on living said the chevalier with a sigh and then with a parting greeting he dismissed the italian but only to sup under the careful surveillance of the steward and then to be conveyed by early morning light beyond the territory where the affairs of ribaumont were interesting  but the chevalier went through a sleepless night long did he pace up and down his chamber grind his teeth clench his fist and point them at his head and make gestures of tearing his thin gray locks and many a military oath did he swear under his breath as he thought to what a pass things had come his brothers daughter waiting on an old huguenot bourgeois making sugarcakes selling her hair and what next here was she alive after all alive and disgracing herself aliveyes both she and her husbandto perplex the chevalier and force him either to new crimes or to beggar his son why could not the one have really died on the st bartholomew or the other at la sablerie instead of putting the poor chevalier in the wrong by coming to live again  what had he done to be thus forced to peril his soul at his age ah had he but known what he should bring on himself when he wrote the unlucky letter pretending that the silly little child wished to dissolve the marriage how should he have known that the lad would come meddling over and then when he had dexterously brought about that each should be offended with the other and consent to the separation why must royalty step in and throw them together again yes and he surely had a right to feel illused since it was in ignorance of the ratification of the marriage that he had arranged the frustration of the elopement and that he had forced on the wedding with narcisse so as to drive eustacie to flight from the conventin ignorance again of her life that he had imprisoned berenger and tried to buy off his clams to nid de merle with dianes hand circumstances had used him cruelly and he shrank from fairly contemplating the next step  he knew well enough what it must be without loss of time a letter must be sent to rome backed by strong interest so as to make it appear that the ceremony at montpipeau irregular and between a huguenot and catholic had been a defiance of the papal decree and must therefore be nullified this would probably be attainable though he did not feel absolutely secure of it pending this eustacie must be secluded in a convent and while still believing herself a widow must immediately on the arrival of the decree and dispensation be forced into the marriage with narcisse before she heard of berengers being still alive and then berenger would have no longer any excuse for holding out his claims would be disposed of and he might be either sent to england or he might be won upon by madame de selinvilles constancy  and this as the chevalier believed was the only chance of saving a life that he was unwilling to sacrifice for his captives patience and courtesy had gained so much upon his heart that he was resolved to do all that shuffling and temporizing could do to save the lad from narcisses hatred and to secure him dianes love  as to telling the truth and arranging his escape that scarcely ever crossed the old mans mind it would have been to resign the lands of nid de merle to return to the makeshift life he knew but too well and what was worse to ruin and degrade his son and incur his resentment it would probably be easy to obtain a promise from berenger in his first joy and gratitude of yielding up all pretensions of his own or his wifes but however honourably meant such a promise would be worth very little and would be utterly scorned by narcisse besides how could he thwart the love of his daughter and the ambition of his son both at once  no the only security for the possession of nid de merle lay in either the death of the young baron and his child or else in his acquiescence in the invalidity of his marriage and therefore in the illegitimacy of the child  and it was within the bounds of possibility that in his seclusion he might at length learn to believe in the story of the destruction at la sablerie and wearying of captivity might yield at length to the persuasions of diane and her father and become so far involved with them as to be unable to draw back or else be so stung by eustacies desertion as to accept her rival willingly  it was a forlorn hope but it was the only medium that lay between either the death or the release of the captive and therefore the old man clung to it as almost praiseworthy and did his best to bring it about by keeping his daughter ignorant that eustacie lived and writing to his son that the baron was on the point of becoming a catholic and marrying his sister and thus that all family danger and scandal would be avoided provided the matter were properly represented at rome     chapter xxxii jam satis         you may go walk and give me leave a while      my lessons make no music in three parts                       taming of the shrew   whether the dark pool really showed sir marmaduke thistlewood or not at the moment that his son desired that his image should be called up the good knight was in effect sitting nodding over the tankard of sack with which his supper was always concluded while the rest of the family lured out of the sunny hall by the charms of a fresh summer evening had dispersed into the gardens or hall  presently a movement in the neighbourhood made him think it incumbent on him to open his eyes wide and exclaim im not asleep  oh no you never are asleep when theres anything you ought to see returned dame annora who was standing by him with her hand on his chair  how now any tidings of the lads he exclaimed  of the lads no indeed but there will be bad tidings for the lads if you do not see to it where do you think your daughter is sir duke  where how should i know she went out to give her sisters some strawberries i thought  see here said lady thistlewood leading the way to the north end of the hall where a door opened into what was called the yewtree grove this consisted of five rows of yewtrees planted at regular intervals and their natural mode of growth so interfered with by constant cutting that their ruddy trunks had been obliged to rise branchless till about twelve feet above ground they had been allowed to spread out their limbs in the form of ordinary forest trees and altogether their foliage became a thick unbroken dark evergreen roof impervious to sunshine and almost impervious to rain while below their trunks were like columns forming five arcades floored only by that dark red crusty earth and green lichen growth that seems peculiar to the shelter of yewtrees the depth of the shade and the stillness of the place made it something peculiarly soothing and quiet more especially when as now the sunset light came below the branches richly tinted the russet pillars cast long shadows and gleamed into all the recesses of the interlacing boughs and polished leafage above  do you see sir duke demanded his lady  i see my little maids making a rare feast under the trees upon their strawberries set out on leaves bless their little hearts what a pretty fairy feast theyve made of it with the dogs looking on as grave as judges it takes me young again to get a smack of the hautbois your mother brought from chelsea gardens  hautbois hed never see if the house ere afire overhead whats that beyond  no fire my dear but the sky all aglow with sunset and the red cow standing up against the light chewing her cud and looking as well pleased as though she knew there wasnt her match in dorset  lady thistlewood fairly stamped and pointed with her fan like a pistol down a side aisle of the grove where two figures were slowly moving along  eh what lucy with her apron full of roseleaves letting them float away while she cons the childrens lesson for the morrow with merrycourt they be no great loss when the place is full of roses or why could you not call to the wench to take better heed of them instead of making all this pother  a pretty sort of lesson it is like to be a pretty sort of return for my poor son unless you take the better heed  would that i saw any return at all for either of the poor dear lads sighed the knight wearily but what you may be driving at i cannot perceive  what when tis before your very eyes how yonder smoothtongued french impostor after luring him back to his ruin beyond seas is supplanting him even here and your daughter giving herself over to the wily viper  the man is a popish priest said sir marmaduke no more given to love than mr adderley or friar rogers  the dame gave a snort of derision prithee how many popish priests be now wedded parsons nor indeed even if his story be true do i believe he is a priest at all i have seen many a young abbe as they call themselves clerk only in name loitering at court free to throw off the cassock any moment they chose and as insolent as the rest why the abbe de lorraine cardinal that is now said of my complexion  no vows quotha muttered sir marmaduke well aware of the cardinal de lorraines opinion of his ladys complexion so much the better he is too good a young fellow to be forced to mope single and yet i hate mens breaking their word  and thats all you have to say angrily cried her ladyship no one save myself ever thinks how it is to be with my poor dear wounded heartbroken son when he comes home to find himself so scurvily used by that faithless girl of yours ready  hold madam said sir marmaduke with real sternness nothing rash against my daughter how should she be faithless to a man who has been wedded ever since she knew him  he is free now said lady thistlewood beginning to cry for the last letters received from berenger had been those from paris while he still believed eustacie to have perished at la sablerie and i do say it is very hard that just when he is rid of the french baggage the bane of his life and is coming home maybe with a child upon his hands and all wounded scarred and blurred the only wench he would or should have married should throw herself away on a french vagabond beggar and you aiding and abetting  come come dame nan said sir marmaduke who told you i was aiding and abetting  tell me not sir duke you that see them a courting under your very eyes and will not stir a finger to hinder it if you like to see your daughter take up with a foreign adventurer why shes no child of mine thank heaven and ive nought to do with it  pshaw dame theres no taking up in the case and if there were sure it is not you that should be hard on lucy  whereupon annora fell into such a flood of tears at the cruelty of casting such things up to her that sir marmaduke was fain in his blundering way to declare that he only meant that an honest englishman had no chance where a frenchman once came in and then very nearly to surrender at discretion at any rate he escaped from her tears by going out at the door and calling to lucy to mind her roseleaves then as she gazed round dismayed at the pink track along the ground he asked her what she had been doing whereto she answered with bright face and honest eyes that mr mericour had been going over with her the ode jam satis of horatius wherewith to prepare little nan for him tomorrow and then she ran hurriedly away to secure the remainder of the roseleaves while her companion was already on his knees picking up the petals she had dropped  master merrycourt said sir marmaduke a little gruffly never heed the flowerleaves i want a word with you  claude de mericour rose hastily as if somewhat struck by the tone  the matter is this said the knight leading him from the house and signing back the little girls who had sprung towards themit has been brought to my mind that you are but a youth and pardon me my young master but when lads and lasses have their heads together over one book tongues wag  the colour rushed hotly into young mericours face and he answered quickly my ranki mean my ordershould answer that  stay young man we are not in france your order be it what it may has not hindered many a marriage in england though look you no man should ever wed with my consent who broke his word to god in so doing but they tell me your vows are not always made at your age  nor are they exclaimed mericour in a low voice but with a sudden light on his countenance the tonsure was given me as a child but no vow of celibacy has passed my lips  sir marmaduke exclaimed oh with a prolongation of the sound that lasted till mericour began again  but sir let tongues wag as they will it is for nought your fair daughter was but as ever preparing beforehand with me the tasks with which she so kindly indoctrinates her little sisters i never thought of myself as aught but a religious and should never dream of human love  i thought so i said so said sir marmaduke highly gratified i knew you were an honourable man that would never speak of love to my daughter by stealth nor without means to maintain her after her birth  the word birth brought the blood into the face of the son of the peer of france but he merely bowed with considerable stiffness and pride saying you did me justice sir  come dont be hurt man said sir marmaduke putting his hand on his shoulder i told you i knew you for an honourable man youll be over here tomorrow to hear the little maids their jam satis or whatever you call it and dine with us after to taste lucys handiwork in jam cranberry a better thing as i take it  mericour had recovered himself smiled shook the good sir marmaduke proffered hand and begging to excuse himself from bidding good night to the ladies on the score of lateness he walked away to cross the downs on his return to combe walwyn where he was still resident according to the arrangement by which he was there to await berengers return now deferred so much beyond all reasonable expectation  sir marmaduke with a free heart betook himself to the house dreading to find that lucy had fallen under the objurgations of her stepmother but feeling impelled to stand her protector and guided to the spot by the high key of dame annoras voice  he found lucywho on the race occasions when goodnatured lady thistlewood was really angry with her usually cowered meeklynow standing her ground and while the dame was pausing for breath he heard her gentle voice answering steadily no madam to him i could never owe faith nor troth nor love save such as i have for philip  then it is very unfeeling and ungrateful of you nor did you think so once but it is all his scars and  by this time sir marmaduke had come near enough to put his arm round his daughter and say no such thing dame it had been unseemly in the lass had it been otherwise she is a good girl and a discreet and the frenchman if he has made none of their vows feels as bound as though he had hes an honest fellow thinking of his studies and not of ladies or any such trumpery so give me a kiss lucy girl and thou shalt study jam satis or any other jam he pleases without more to vex thee  lucy now that the warfare was over had begun to weep so profusely that so soon as her father released her she turned made a mute gesture to ask permission to depart and hurried away while lady thistlewood who disliked above all that her husband should think her harsh to her stepchildren began to relate the exceeding tenderness of the remonstrance which had been followed with such disproportionate floods of tears  poor sir marmaduke hoped at least that the veil of night had put an end to the subject which harassed him at a time when he felt less capable than usual of bearing vexation for he was yearning sadly after his only son the youths had been absent ten months and had not been heard of for more than three when they were just leaving paris in search of the infant sir francis walsingham whose embassy had ended with the death of charles ix knew nothing of them and great apprehensions respecting them were beginning to prevail and to sir marmaduke especially seemed to be eating out the peace and joy of his life philip always at his fathers side ever since he could run alone was missed at every visit to stable or kennel the ring of his cheery voice was wanting to the house and the absence of his merry whistle seemed to make sir marmadukes heart sink like lead as he donned his heavy boots and went forth in the silver dew of the summer morning to judge which of his cornfields would soonest be ready for the sickle until this expedition of his sons he had for more than fourteen years never been alone in those morning rounds on his farm and much as he loved his daughters they seemed to weigh very light in the scale compared with the sturdy heir who loved every acre with his own ancestral love indeed perhaps sir marmaduke had deeper fonder affection for the children of his first marriage because he had barely been able to give his full heart to their mother before she was taken from him and he had felt almost double tenderness to be due to them when he at length obtained his first and only true love now as he looked over the shinning billows of the waving barley his heart was very sore with longing for philips gladsome shout at the harvestfield and he thought with surprise and compunction how he had seen lucy leave him struggling with a flood of tears while he was still thus gazing a head appeared in the narrow path that led across the fields and presently he recognized the slender upright form of the young frenchman  a fair good morrow to you master merrycourt you come right early to look after your ode  sir said mericour gravely saluting him i come to make you my confession i find that i did not deal truly with you last night but it was all unwittingly  how exclaimed sir marmaduke recollecting lucys tears and looking much startled you have not and there he broke off seeing mericour eager to speak  sir he said i was bred as one set apart from love i had never learnt to think it possible to mei thought so even when i replied to you last evening but sir the words you then spoke the question you asked me set my heart burning and my senses whirling and between agitation and confusion he stammered and clasped his hands passionately trying to continue what he was saying but muttering nothing intelligible  sir marmaduke filled up the interval with a long whistle of perplexity but too kind not to pity the youths distress he laid his hand on his shoulder saying you found out you were but a hotblooded youth after all but an honest one for as i well trust my lass knows nought of this  how should she know sir what i knew not myself  ha ha chuckled sir duke to himself so twas all dame nans doing that the flame has been lighted ho ho but what is to come next is the question and he eyed the french youth from head to foot with the same considering look with which he was wont to study a bullock  sir sir cried mericour absolutely flinging himself on his knee before him with national vehemence do give me hope oh i will bless you i will  get up man said the knight hastily no fooling of this sort the milkmaids will be coming hopewhy what sort of hope can be given you in the matter he continued you are a very good lad and i like you well enough but you are not the sort of stuff one gives ones daughter to ay ay i know you are a great man in your own country but what are you here  a miserable fugitive and beggar i know that said mericour vehemently but let me have but hope and there is nothing i will not be  pish said sir marmaduke  hear me entreated the youth recalled to common sense you know that i have lingered at the chateau yonder partly to study divinity and settle my mind and partly because my friend ribaumont begged me to await his return i will be no longer idle my mind is fixed to france i cannot return while she gives me no choice between such doctrine and practice as i saw at court and such as the huguenots would have imposed on me i had already chosen england as my country beforebefore this wild hope had awakened in me here i know my nobility counts for nothing though truly sir few names in france are prouder but it shall be no hindrance i will become one of your men of the robe i have heard that they can enrich themselves and intermarry with your country noblesse  true true said sir marmaduke there is more sense in that notion than there seemed to be in you at first my poor brother phil was to have been a lawyer if he had lived but it seems to me you are a long way off from that yet why our templars be mostly oxford scholars  so it was explained to me said mericour but for some weeks past the lady burnet to whose sons as you know i have been teaching french has been praying me to take the charge of them at oxford by which means i should at least be there maintained and perchance obtain the means for carrying on my studies at the temple  not ill thought of said the knight a fair course enough for you but look you you must have good luck indeed to be in a state to marry within ten or fifteen yearsvery likely not thenhaving nothing of your own and my wench but little for lucys portion cannot be made equal to her sisters her mother having been no heiress like dame nan and would you have me keep the maid unwedded till she be thirty or thirtyfive years old waiting for your fortune  mericour looked terribly disconcerted at this  moreover added the knight they will all be at me so soon as those poor lads come homeheaven grant they doto give her to berenger  sir said mericour looking up with a sudden smile all that i would ask is what you are too good a father to do that you would not put any force on her inclinations  how now you said you had never courted her  nor have i sir but i see the force of your words should she love another man my dream were of course utterly vain but if not he broke off  well well i am no man to force a girl to a match against her will but never trust to that man i know what women are and let a fantastic stranger come across them theres an end of old friends but yours is an honest purpose and you are a good youth and if you had anything to keep her with you should have lucy tomorrow with all my heart  then came the further question whether mericour should be allowed an interview with lucy sir marmaduke was simple enough to fancy that she need not be made aware of the cause of mericours new arrangement and decided against it the young man sorrowfully acquiesced but whether such a secret could be kept was another thing to him it would have been impossible to renew their former terms of intercourse without betraying his feelings and he therefore absented himself lady thistlewood triumphed openly in sir marmadukes having found him out and banished him from the house lucy looked white and shed silent tears her fathers soft heart was moved and one sunday evening he whispered into her ear that dame nan was all wrong and mericour only kept away because he was an honourable man then lucy smiled and brightened and sir duke fondly asked her if she were fool enough to fancy herself in love with the man  oh no how should she when he had never named love to her she was only glad her father esteemed him  so then foolish fond sir marmaduke told her all that had passed and if it had not been too late he would have sent for mericour from lady burnets but his own story did almost as well in bringing back lucys soft pink color she crept up into cecilys room one day and found that she knew all about it and was as kind and sympathizing as she could bewhen a vocation had been given up though no vows had been taken she did not quite understand it but she would take it on trust     chapter xxxiii the scandal of the synod of montauban         o ye wha are sae guid yourself         sae pious and sae holy      yeve naught to do but mark and tell         your neebours fauts and folly                         burns   the old city of montauban once famous as the home of ariostos rinaldo and his brethren known to french romance as les quatre fils aymon acquired in later times a very diverse species of famethat namely of being one of the chief strongholds of the reformed the bishop jean de lettes after leading a scandalous life had professed a sort of calvinism had married and retired to geneva and his successor had not found it possible to live at montauban from the enmity of the inhabitants strongly situated with a peculiar municipal constitution of its own and used to provencal independence both of thought and deed the inhabitants had been so unanimous in their calvinism and had offered such efficient resistance as to have wrung from government reluctant sanction for the open observance of the reformed worship and for the maintenance of a college for the education of their ministry  there then was convoked the national synod answering to the scottish general assembly excepting that the persecuted french presbyterians met in a different place every year delegated pastors there gathered from every quarter from northern france came men used to live in constant hazard of their lives from paris confessors such as merlin the chaplain who leaving colignys bedside had been hidden for three days in a hayloft feeding on the eggs that a hen daily laid beside him armychaplains were there who had passionately led battlepsalms ere their colleagues charged the foe and had striven with vain endeavours to render their soldiers saints while other pastors came from pyrenean villages where their generation had never seen flames lighted against heresy nor knew what it was to disperse a congregation in haste and secrecy for hear of the enemy  the audience was large and sympathizing montauban had become the refuge of many huguenot families who could nowhere else profess their faith without constant danger and a large proportion of these were ladies wives of gentlemen in the army kept up by la noue or widows who feared that their children might be taken from them to be brought up by their catholic relations elderly dames who longed for tranquillity after having lost husbands or sons by civil war thickly they lodged in the strangely named gasches and vertiers as the divisions and subdivisions of the city were termed occupying floors or apartments of the tall old houses walking abroad in the streets in grave attire stiff hat crimped ruff and huge fan and forming a society in themselves closepacked punctilious and dignified rigidly devout but strictly censorious and altogether as unlike their typical country folks of paris as if they had belonged to a different nation and the sourest and most severe of all were such as had lived farthest south and personally suffered the least peril and alarm  dancing was unheardof enormity cards and dice were prohibited and stronger expletive than the elegant ones invented for the special use of the king of navarre was expiated either by the purse or the skin marots psalmody was the only music black or sad colour the only wear and a few years later the wife of one of the most distinguished statesmen and councilors of henri of navarre was excommunicated for the enormity of wearing her hair curled  to such a community it was a delightful festival to receive a national assembly of ministers ready to regale them on daily sermons for a whole month and to retail in private the points of discipline debated in the public assembly and apart from mere eagerness for novelty many a discreet heart beat with gladness at the meeting with the hunted pastor of her native home who had been the first to strike the spiritual chord and awake her mind to religion  every family had their honoured guest every receptionroom was in turn the scene of some pious little assembly that drank eau sucree and rejoiced in its favourite pastor and each little congress indulged in gentle scandal against its rival coterie but there was one point on which all the ladies agreednamely that good maitre isaac gardon had fallen into an almost doting state of blindness to the vanities of his daughterinlaw and that she was a disgrace to the community and ought to be publicly reprimanded  isaac gardon long reported to have been martyredsome said at paris others averred at la sableriehad indeed been welcomed with enthusiastic joy and veneration when he made his appearance at montauban pale aged bent leaning on a staff and showing the dire effect of the rheumatic fever which had prostrated him after the night of drenching and exposure during the escape from la sablerie crowded as the city was there was a perfect competition among the tradesfolk for the honour of entertaining him and the young widow and child of a st bartholomew martyr a cordwainer of the street of the soubirous hauts obtained this honour and the wife though speaking only the sweet provencal tongue soon established the most friendly relations with m gardons daughterinlaw  two or three more pastors likewise lodged in the same house and ready aid was given by mademoiselle gardon as all called eustacie in the domestic cares thus entailed while her filial attention to her fatherinlaw and her sweet tenderness to her child struck all this home circle with admiration children of that age were seldom seen at home among the better classes in towns then as now they were universally consigned to country nurses who only brought them home at three or four years old fresh from a squalid neglected cottage life and eustacies little moonbeam la petite rayonette as she loved to call her was quite an unusual spectacle and from having lived entirely with grown people and enjoyed the most tender and dainty care she was intelligent and brightly docile to a degree that appeared marvellous to those who only saw children stupefied by a contrary system she was a lovely little thing exquisitely fair and her plump white limbs small but perfectly moulded she was always happy because always healthy and living in an atmosphere of love and she was the pet and wonder of all the household from the grinning apprentice to the grave young candidate who hoped to be elected pastor to the duke de quinets village in the cevennes  and yet it was la petite rayonette who first brought her mother into trouble since her emancipation from swaddling clothes she had been equipped in a little gray woolen frock such as eustacie had learnt to knit among the peasants and varied with broad while stripes which gave it something of the moonbeam effect but the mother had not been able to resist the pleasure of drawing up the bosom and tying it with a knot of the very carnation colour that berenger used to call her own that knot was discussed all up and down the rue soubirous hauts and even through the carriera major the widow of an old friend of maitre gardon had remonstrated on the improprieties of such gay vanities and mdlle gardon had actually replied reddening with insolences that her husband had loved to see her wear the colour  now if the brethren at paris had indulged their daughters in such backslidings see what had come of it but that poor theodore gardon should have admired his bride in such unhallowed adornments was an evident calumny and many a head was shaken over it in grave and pious assembly  worse still when she had been invited to a supper at the excellent madame fargeaus the presumptuous little bourgeoise had evidently not known her place but had seated herself as if she were a noble lady a fille de qualite instead of a mere ministers widow and a watchmakers daughter pretend ignorance that precedence was to be here observed that was another parisian piece of impudence above all in one who showed such ridiculous airs as to wipe her face with her own handkerchief instead of the tablecloth and to be reluctant to help herself from the genera dish of potage with her own spoon even that might have been overlooked if she would have regaled them with a full and particular account of her own rescue from the massacre at paris but she merely coloured up and said that she had been so ill as to know scarcely anything about it and when they pressed her further she shortly said they locked me up and before she could be crossexamined as to who was this they maitre gardon interfered saying that she had suffered so much that he requested the subject might never be mentioned to her nor would he be more explicit and there was evidently some mystery and he was becoming blindly indulgent and besotted by the blandishments of an artful woman  eustacie was saved from hearing the gossip by her ignorance of the provencal which was the only languages of all but the highest and most cultivated classes the hostess had very little langue doui and never ventured on any complicated discourse and isaac gardon who could speak both the oc and oui was not a person whom it was easy to beset with mere hearsay or petty remonstrance but enough reached him at last to make him one day say mildly my dear child might not the little one dispense with her ribbon while we are here  eh father at the bidding of those impertinents  take care daughter you were perfect with the tradesfolk and peasants but you cannot comport yourself as successfully with this petite noblesse or the pastors wives  they are insolent father i in my own true person would treat no one as these petty dames treat me said eustacie i would not meddle between a peasant woman and her child nor ask questions that must needs wring her heart  ah child humility is a bitter lesson and even this world needs it now from you we shall have suspicions and i heard today that the king is in dauphiny and with him m de nid de merle be not alarmed he has no force with him and the peace still subsists but we must avoid suspicion there is a preche at the moustier today in french it would be well if you were to attend it  i understand as little of french sermons as of provencal murmured eustacie but it was only a murmur  maitre gardon had soon found out that his charge had not head enough to be made a thoroughgoing controversial calvinist clever intelligent and full of resources as she was she had no capacity for argument and could not enter into theoretical religion circumstances had driven her from her original church and alienated her from those who had practiced such personal cruelties on her and hers but the mould of her mind remained what it had been previously she clung to the huguenots because they protected her from those who would have forced an abhorrent marriage on her and snatched her child from her and personally she loved and venerated isaac gardon with ardent selfsacrificing filial love and gratitude accepted as truth all that came from his lips read the scriptures sang and prayed with him and obeyed him as dutifully as ever the true esperance could have done but except the merest external objections against the grossest and most palpable popular corruptions and fallacies she really never entered into the matter she had been left too ignorant of her own system to perceive its true clams upon her and though she could not help preferring high mass to a calvinist assembly and shrinking with instinctive pain and horror at the many profanations she witnessed the really spiritual leadings of her own individual fatherlike leader had opened so much that was new and precious to her so full of truth so full of comfort giving so much moral strength that unaware that all the foundations had been laid by mere monique the resolute highspirited little thing out of sheer constancy and constitutional courage would have laid down her life as a calvinist martyr in profound ignorance that she was not in the least a calvinist all the time  hitherto her wandering life amid the persecuted huguenots of the west had prevented her from hearing any preaching but good isaacs own which had been rather in the way of comfort and encouragement than of controversy but in this great gathering it was impossible that there should not be plenty of vehement polemical oratory such as was sue to fly over that weary little head after a specimen or two the chances of the sermon being in provencal and the necessity of attending to her child had been eustacies excuse for usually offering to attend to the menage and set her hostess free to be present at the preachings  however rayonette was considered as no valid excuse for did not whole circles of blackeyed children sit on the floor in sleepy stolidity at the feet of their mothers or nurses and was it not a mere worldly folly to pretend that a child of sixteen months could not be brought to church it was another instance of the mothers frivolity and the grandfathers idolatry  the moustier or minster the monastic church of montauban built on mont auriol in honour of st theodore had twelve years before been plundered and sacked by the calvinists not only out of zeal for iconoclasm but from longstanding hatred and jealousy against the monks catherine de medicis had in 1546 carried off two of the jasper columns from its chief doorway to the louvre and after some years more it was entirely destroyed the grounds of the auriol mountain monastery have been desolate down to the present day when they have been formed into public gardens when eustacie walked through them carrying her little girl in her arms a rose in her bosom to console her for the loss of her bright breastknot they were in raw fresh dreariness with tottering blackened cloisters garden flowers run wild images that she had never ceased to regard as sacred lying broken and defiled among the grass and weeds  up the broad path was pacing the municipal procession headed by the three consuls each with a serjeant bearing a white rod in front and a scarlet mantle and the consuls themselves in long robes with wide sleeves of quartered black and scarlet followed by six halberdiers likewise in scarlet blazoned with the shield of the citygules a golden willowtree pollarded and shedding its branches a chief azure with the three fleurdelys of royalty as little rayonette gleefully pointed at the brilliant pageant eustacie could not help saying rather bitterly that these messieurs seemed to wish to engross all the gay colours from heaven and earth from themselves and maitre isaac could not help thinking she had some right on her side as he entered the church once gorgeous with jasper marbles and mosaics glowing with painted glass resplendent with gold and jewels rich with paintings and draperies of the most brilliant dyes but now all that was soiled dulled defaced the whole building even up to the end of the chancel was closely fitted with benches occupied by the sadcoloured congregation isaac was obliged by a strenuous effort of memory to recall nehushtan and the golden calves before he could clear from his mind now they break down all the carved work thereof with axes and with hammers but then did not the thorough going reformers think master isaac a very weak and backsliding brother  nevertheless in right of his age his former reputation and his sufferings his place was full in the midst of the squarecapped blackrobed ministers who sat herded on a sort of platform together to address the almighty and the congregation in prayers and discourses interspersed with psalms sung by the whole assembly there was no want of piety depth force or fervour these were men refined by persecution who had struggled to the light that had been darkened by the popular system and having once been forced into foregoing their scruples as to breaking the unity of the church regarded themselves even as apostles of the truth listening to them isaac gardon felt himself rapt into the hopes of cleansing the aspirations of universal reintegration that had shone before his early youth ere the church had shown herself deaf and the reformers in losing patience had lost purity and disappointment had crushed him into an aged man  he was recalled by the echo of a gay little inarticulate crythose baby tones that had become such music to his ears that he hardly realized that they were not indeed from his grandchild in a moments glance he saw how it was a little bird had flown in at one of the empty window and was fluttering over the heads of the congregation and a small plump white arm and hand was stretched out and pointinga rosy fair smiling face upturned a little gray figure had scrambled up on the knee of one of the still blackhooded women and the shout of irrepressible delight was breaking on the decorum of the congregation in spite of hushes in spite of the uplifted rod of a scarlet serjeant on his way down the aisle to quell the disturbance nay as the bird came nearer the exulting voice proud of the achievement of a new word shouted moineau moineau angered by defiance to authority down came the rod not indeed with great force but with enough to make the arms clasp round the mothers neck the face hide itself on in a loud terrified wail ring through the church and tempestuous sobbing follow it up then uprose the blackhooded figure the child tightly clasped and her mantle drawn round it while the other hand motioned the official aside and down the aisle even to the door she swept with the lofty carriage highdrawn neck and swelling bosom of an offended princess  maitre gardon heard little more of the discourse indeed he would have followed at once had he not feared to increase the sensation and the scandal he came home to find rayonettes tears long ago dried but her mother furious she would leave montauban that minute she would never set foot in a heretic conventicle again to have her fatherless child daughter of all the ribaumonts struck by base canaille even her uncle could not have done worse he at least would have respected her blood  maitre gardon did not know that his charge could be in such a passion as her eyes flashing through tears she insisted on being taken away at once no she would hear nothing she seemed to fell resentment due to the honour of all the ribaumonts and he was obliged peremptorily to refuse to quit montauban till his business at the synod should be completed and then to leave her in a flood of angry tears and reproaches for exposing her child to such usage and approving it  poor little thing he found her meek and penitent for her unjust anger towards himself whatever he desired she would do she would stay or go with him anywhere except to a sermon at the moustier and she did not think that in her heart her good father desired little infants to be beatenleast of all berengers little one and with rayonette already on his knee stealing his spectacles peace was made  peace with him but not with the congregation were people to stalk out of church in a rage and make no reparation was maitre isaac to talk of orphans only children and maternal love as if weak human affection did not need chastisement was this saucy parisienne to play the offended and say that if the child were not suffered at church she must stay at home with it the ladies agitated to have the obnoxious young widow reprimanded in open synod but to their still greater disgust not a pastor would consent to perform the office some said that maitre gardon ought to rule his own household others that they respected him too much to interfere and there were others abandoned enough to assert that if any one needed a reprimand it was the serjeant  of these was the young candidate samuel mace who had been educated at the expense of the dowager duchess de quinet and hoped that her influence would obtain his election to the pastorate of a certain peaceful little village deep in the cevennes she had intimated that what he wanted was a wife to teach and improve the wives of the peasant farmers and where could a more eligible one be found than esperance gardon her cookery he tasted her industry he saw her tenderness to her child her attention to her father were his daily admiration and her soft velvet eyes and sweet smile went so deep in his heart that he would have bought her ells upon ells of pink ribbon when once out of sight of the old ladies would have given a fathers love to her little daughter and a sons duty and veneration to isaac gardon  his patroness did not deny her approval the gossip had indeed reached her but she had a high esteem for isaac gardon believed in samuel maces good sense and heeded montauban scandal very little her protege would be much better married to a spirited woman who had seen the world than to a mere farmers daughter who had never looked beyond her cheese old gardon would be an admirable adviser and if he were taken into the menage she would add to the endowment another arable field and grass for two more cows if she liked the young woman on inspection the marriage should take place in her own august presence  what had maitre gardon refused forbidden that the subject should be mentioned to his daughter impossible either mace had managed matters foolishly or the old man had some doubt of him which she could remove or else it was foolish reluctance to part with his daughterinlaw or the gossips were right after all and he knew her to be too lightminded if not worse to be the wife of any pious young minister or there was some mystery any way madame la duchesse would see him and bring him to his senses make him give the girl a good husband if she were worthy or devote her to condign punishment if she were unworthy     chapter xxxiv madame la duchesse    he found an ancient dame in dim brocadetennyson   madame la duchesse de quinet had been a great heiress and a personal friend and favourite of queen jeanne dalbret she had been left a widow after five years marriage and for forty subsequent years had reigned despotically in her own name and that of mon fils busied with the support of the huguenot cause sometimes by arms but more usually by politics and constantly occupied by the hereditary government of one of the lesser counties of france the duke was all the better son for relinquishing to her the home administration as well as the education of his two motherless boys and their confidence and affection were perfect though he was almost as seldom at home as she was abroad at times indeed she had visited queen jeanne at nerac but since the good queens death she only left the great chateau of quinet to make a royal progress of inspection through the family towns castles and estates sometimes to winter in her beautiful hereditary hotel at montauban and as at present to attend any great assembly of the reformed  very seldom was her will not law strong sense and judgment backed by the learning that queen marguerite of navarre had introduced among the companions of her daughter had rendered her superior to most of those with whom she came in contact and the huguenot ministers who were much more dependent on their laity than the catholic priesthood for the most part treated her as not only a devout and honourable woman an elect lady but as a sort of state authority that she had the rightmindedness to respect and esteem such men as theodore beza merlin c who treated her with great regard but never cringed had not become known to the rest let her have once pronounced against poor little esperance gardon and public disgrace would be a matter of certainty  there she sat in her wainscoted walnut cabinet a small woman by her inches but stately enough to seem of majestic stature and with gray eyes of inexpressible keenness which she fixed upon the halting broken form of isaac gardon and his grave venerable face as she half rose and made a slight acknowledgment of his low bow  sit maitre gardon you are lame she said with a wave of her hand i gave you the incommodity of coming to see me not openly discuss en pleine sale  madame is considerate said isaac civilly but with an openeyed look and air that at once showed her that she had not to deal with one of the ministers who never forgot their low birth in intercourse with her  i understand said she coming to the point at once that you decline the proposals of samuel mace for your daughterinlaw now i wish you to know that mace is a very good youth whom i have known from his birthand she went on in his praise isaac bowing at each pause until she had exhausted both maces history and her own beneficent intentions for him then he said madame is very good and the young man appeared to me excellent nevertheless this thing may not be my daughterinlaw has resolved not to marry again  nay but this is mere folly said the duchess we hold not catholic tenets on merit in abstaining but rather go by st pauls advice that the younger widows should marry rather than wax wanton and to tell you the truth maitre gardon this daughter of yours does seem to have set tongues in motion  not by her own fault madame  stay my good friend i never found a manminister or laywho was a fair judge in these matters you old men are no better than the youngrather worsebecause you do not distrust yourselves now i say no harm of the young woman and i know an angel would be abused at montauban for not wearing sadcoloured wings but she needs a mans careyou are frail you cannot live for everand how is it to be with her and her child  i hope to bestow them among her kindred ere i die madame said isaac  no kindred can serve a woman like a sensible husband besides i thought all perished at paris listen isaac gardon i tell you plainly that scandal is afloat you are blamed for culpable indifference to alleged levitiesi say not that it is truebut i see this that unless you can bestow your daughterinlaw on a good honest man able to silence the whispers of malice there will be measures taken that will do shame both to your own gray hairs and to the memory of your dead son as well as expose the poor young woman herself you are one who has a true tongue isaac gardon and if you can assure me that she is a faithful good woman as poor mace thinks her and will give her to him in testimony thereof then shall not a mouth open against her if not in spite of all my esteem for you the discipline of the reformed must take its course  and for what said isaac with a grave tone almost of reproof what discipline can punish a woman for letting her infant wear a coloured ribbon and shielding it from a blow  that is not all master isaac said the duchess seriously in spite of your muchrespected name evil and censorious tongues will have it that matters ought to be investigated that there is some mystery that the young woman does not give a satisfactory account of herself and that the child does not resemble either her or your sonin short that you may be deceived by an impostor perhaps a catholic spy mind i say not that i credit all this only i would show you what reports you must guard against  la pauvre petite said isaac under his breath as if appalled then collecting himself he said madame these are wellnigh threats i had come hither nearly resolved to confined in you without them  then there is a mystery  yes madame but the deception is solely in the name she is in very truth a widow of a martyr of the st barthelemy but that martyr was not my son whose wife was happy in dying with him  and who then is she  madame la duchesse had heard of the family of ribaumont  ha m de ribaumont a gay comrade of king henry ii but who had his eyes opened to the truth by m lamiral though he lacked courage for an open profession yes the very last pageant i beheld at court was the wedding of his little son to the count de ribaumonts daughter it was said that the youth was one of our victims at paris  even so madame and this poor child is the little one whom you saw wedded to him and then in answer to the duchesss astonished inquiry he proceeded to relate how eustacie had been forced to fly from her kindred and how he had first encountered her at his own lurkingplaced and had accepted her as a charge imposed on him by providence then explained how at la sablerie she had been recognized by a young gentleman whom she had known at paris but who professed to be fleeing to england there to study the protestant controversy and how she had confided to him a letter to her husbands mother who was married in england begging her to send for her and her daughter the latter being heiress to certain english estates as well as french  madame added gardon heaven forgive me if i do the youth injustice by suspecting him but no answer ever arrived to that letter and while we still expected one a good and kindly citizen who i trust has long been received into glory sent me notice that a detachment of monsieurs army was on its way from la rochelle under command of m de nid de merle to search out this poor lady in la sablerie he good man deemed that were we gone he could make terms for the place and we therefore quitted it alas madame knows how it fared with the pious friend we left little deeming how they would be dealt with we took our way along the sables dolonne where alone we could be safe since as madame knows they are for miles impracticable for troops but we had another enemy therethe tide and there was a time when we truly deemed that the mercy granted us had been that we had fallen into the hand of the lord instead of the hand of cruel man yes madame and even for that did she give thanks as she stood never even trembling on the low sandbank with her babe in her bosom and the sea creeping up on all sides she only turned to me with a smile saying she is asleep she will not feel it or know anything till she wakes up in paradise and sees her father never saw i a woman either through nature or grace so devoid of fear we were rescued at last by the mercy of heaven which sent a fisherman who bore us to his boat when benumbed with cold and scarce able to move he took us to a good priests colombeau of nissard a man who as madame may know is one of those veritable saints who still are sustained by the truth within their church and is full of charity and mercy he asked me no questions but fed warmed sheltered us and sped us on our way perhaps however i was overconfident in myself as the guardian of the poor child for it was heavens will that the cold and wet of our night on the sandsthough those tender young frames did not suffer therefromshould bring on an illness which has made an old man of me i struggled on as long as i could hoping to attain to a safe restingplace for her but the winter cold completed the work and then madameoh that i could tell you the blessing she was to meher patience her watchfulness her tenderness through all the long weeks that i lay helpless alike in mind and body at charente ah madame had my own daughter lived she could not have been more to me than that noble lady and her cheerful love did even more for me than her tender care  i must see her ejaculated the duchesse then added but was it this illness that hindered you from placing her in safety in england  in part madame nay i may say wholly we learnt that the assembly was to take place here and i had my poor testimony to deliver and to give notice of my intention to my brethren before going to a foreign land whence perhaps i may never return  she ought to be in england said madame de quinet she will never be safe from these kinsmen in this country  m de nid de merle has been all the spring in poland with the king said the minister and the poor lady is thought to have perished at la sablerie thus the danger has been less pressing but i would have taken her to england at once if i could have made sure of her reception and besides he faltered  the means demanded the duchess guessing at the meaning  madame is right she had brought away some money and jewels with her but alas madame during my illness without my knowledge the dear child absolutely sold them to procure comforts for me nayhis eyes filled with tearsshe whom they blame for vanities sold the very hair from her head to purchase unguents to ease the old mans pains nor did i know it for many a day after from day to day we can live for our own people willingly support a pastor and his family and in every house my daughter has been lovedeverywhere but in this harshjudging town but for the expense of a voyage even were we at bordeaux or la rochelle we have nothing save by parting with the only jewels that remain to her and thosethose she says are heirlooms and poor child she guards them almost as jealously as her infant around whom she has fastened them beneath her clothes she will not even as yet hear of leaving them in pledge to be redeemed by the family she says they would hardly know her without them and truly madame i scarce venture to take her to england ere i know what reception would await her should her husbands family disown or cast her off i could take better care of her here than in a strange land  you are right maitre gardon said the duchess the risk might be great i would see this lady she must be a rare creature bear her my greetings my friend and pray her to do me the honour of a visit this afternoon tell her i would come myself to her but that i understand she does not wish to attract notice  madame said isaac rising and with a strange manner between a smile and a tear of earnestness allow me to bespeak your goodness for my daughter the poor little thing is scarcely more than a child she is but eighteen even now and it is not always easy to tell whether she will be an angel of noble goodness or pardon me a halfpetulant child  i understand madame de quinet laughed and she probably did understand more than reluctant anxious isaac gardon thought she did of his winning gracious yet haughty headstrong little charge so humbly helpful one moment so selfasserting and childish the next so dear to him yet so unlike anything in his experience  child he said as he found her in the sunny window engaged in plaiting the deep folds of his starched ruffs you have something to forgive me  fathers do not ask their childrens pardon said eustacie brightly but then with sudden dismay ah you have not said i should go to the moustier again  no daughter but madame de quinet entreatsthese are her wordsthat you will do her the honour of calling on her she would come to you but that she fears to attract notice to us  you have told her exclaimed eustacie  i was compelled but i had already thought of asking your consent and she is a true and generous lady with whom your secret will be safe and who can hush the idle tongues here so daughter he added restlessly don your hood that ruff will serve for another day  another day when the morrow is sunday and my fathers ruff is to put to shame all the other pastors said eustacie her quick fingers still moving no he shall not go illstarched for any duchess in france now am i in any haste to be lectured by madame de quinet as they say she lectured the dame de soubrera the other day  my child you will go much depends on it  oh yes i am going only if madame de quinet knows who i am she will not expect me to hurry at her beck and call the first moment here rayonette my bird my beauty thou must have a clean cap ay and these flaxen curls combed  would you take the child  would i go without mademoiselle de rambouillet she is all her mother is and more there now she is a true rosebud ready to perch on my arm no no bon pere so great a girl is too much for you to carry dont be afraid my darling we are not going to a sermon no one will beat her oh no and if the insolent retainers and pert lacqueys laugh at her mother no one will hurt her  nay child said maitre gardon this is a wellordered household where contempt and scorn are not suffered only dear dear daughter let me pray you to be your true self with the duchess  eustacie shrugged her shoulders and had mischief enough in her to enjoy keeping her good father in some doubt and dread as he went halting wearily by her side along the muchdecorated streets that marked the grand gasche of tarn and tarascon the hotel de quinet stretched out its broad stone steps covered with vaultings absolutely across the street affording a welcome shade and no obstruction where wheeled carriages never came  all was as maitre isaac had said decorum itself a couple of armed retainers rigid as sentinels waited on the steps a grave porter maimed in the wars opened the great door half a dozenlaquais in sober though rich liveries sat on a bench in the hall and had somewhat the air of having been set to con a lesson two of them coming respectfully forward ushered maitre gardon and his companion to an anteroom where various gentlemen or pastors or candidatesamong them samuel macewere awaiting a summons to the duchess or merely using it as a place of assembly a page of high birth but well schooled in steadiness of demeanour went at once to announce the arrival and gardon and his companion had not been many moments in conversation with their acquaintance among the ministers before the grave gentleman returned apparently from his audience and the page coming to eustacie intimated that she was to follow him to madame le duchesses presence  he conducted her across a great tapestryhung saloon where twelve or fourteen ladies of all agesfrom seventy to fifteensat at work some at tapestry some spinning some making coarse garments for the poor a great thronelike chair with a canopy over it a footstool a desk and a small table before it was vacant and the worka poor childs knitted caplaid down but an elderly minister seated at a carved desk had not discontinued reading from a great black book and did not even cease while the strangers crossed the room merely making a slight inclination with his head while the ladies half rose rustled a slight reverence with their black gray or russet skirts but hardly lifted their eyes eustacie thought the louvre had never been half so formidable or impressive  the page lifted a heavy green curtain behind the canopy knocked at a door and as it opened eustacie was conscious of a dignified presence that in spite of her previous petulance caused her instinctively to bend in such a reverence as had formerly been natural to her but at the same moment a low and magnificent curtsey was made to her a hand was held out a stately kiss was on her brow and a voice of dignified courtesy said pardon me madame la baronne for giving you this trouble i feared that otherwise we could not safely meet  madame is very good my rayonette make thy reverence kiss thy hand to the lady my lamb and the little one obeyed gazing with her blue eyes full opened and clinging to her mother  ah madame la baronne makes herself obeyed said madame de quinet well pleased is it then a girl  yes madame i could scarcely forgive her at first but she has made herself all the dearer to me  it is a pity said madame de quinet for yours is an ancient stem  did madame know my parents asked eustacie drawn from her spirit of defiance by the equality of the manner with which she was treated  scarcely replied the duchess but with a smile i had the honour to see you married  ah theneustacie glowed almost smiled though a tear was in her eyesyou can see how like my little one is to her fathera true white ribaumont  the duchess had not the most distinct recollection of the complexion of the little bridegroom but rayonettes fairness was incontestable and the old lady complimented it so as to draw on the young mother into confidence on the pet moonbeam appellation which she used in dread of exciting suspicion by using the true name of berangere with all the why and wherefore  it was what the duchess wanted imperious as some thought her she would on no account have appeared to crossexamine any one whose essential nobleness of nature struck her as did little eustacies at the first moment she saw her and yet she had decided before the young woman arrived that her own good opinion and assistance should depend on the correspondence of madame de ribaumonts history of herself with maitre gardons  eustacie had for a year and a half lived with peasants and indeed since the trials of her life had really begun she had never been with a woman of her own station to whom she could give confidence or from whom she could look for sympathy and thus a very few inquiries and tokens of interest from the old lady drew out the whole story and more than once filled madame de quinets eyes with tears  there was only one discrepancy eustacie could not believe that the abbe de mericour had been a faithless messenger oh no either those savagelooking sailors had played him false or else her belemere would not send for her my motherinlaw never loved me said eustacie i know she never did and now she has children by her second marriage and no doubt would not see my little one preferred to them i will not be her suppliant  and what then would you do said madame de quinet with a more severe tone  never leave my dear father said eustacie with a flash of eagerness maitre isaac i mean he has been more to me than anyany one i ever knewsave  you have much cause for gratitude to him said madame de quinet i honour your filial love to him yet you have duties to this little one you have no right to keep her from her position you ought to write to england again i am sure maitre isaac tells you so  eustacie would have pouted but the grave kind authority of the manner prevented her from being childish and she said if i wrote it should be to my husbands grandfather who brought him up designated him as his heir and whom he loved with all his heart but oh madame he has one of those english names so dreadful it sounds like volauvent but it is not that precisely  madame de quinet smiled but she was a woman of resources see my friend she said the pursuivant of the consuls here has the rolls of the heralds visitations throughout the kingdom the arms and name of the baron de ribaumonts wife will there be entered and from my house at quinet you shall write and i too will write my son shall take care that the letters be forwarded safely and you shall await their arrival under my protection that will be more fitting than running the country with an old pastor hein  madame nothing shall induce me to quit him exclaimed eustacie vehemently  hear me out child said the duchess he goes with us to assist my chaplain he is not much fitter for wandering than you or less so and you madame must i fear me still remain his daughterinlaw in my household or if you bore your own name and rank this uncle and cousin of yours might learn that you were still living and did they claim you  oh madame rather let me be your meanest kitchengirl  to bewhat do they call youesperance gardon will be quite enough i have various women herewidows wives daughters or sufferers for the truths sake who either are glad of rest or are trained up to lead a godly life in the discipline of my household among them you can live without suspicion provided the old lady added smiling you can abstain from turning the heads of our poor young candidates  madame said eustacie gravely i shall never turn any ones head there was only one who was obliged to love me and happily i am nor fair enough to win any one else  tenez child is this true simplicity did gardon truly never tell you of poor samuel mace  eustacies face expressed such genuine amazement and consternation that the duchess could not help touching her on the cheek and saying ah simple as a pensionnaire as we used to say when no one else was innocent but it is true my dear that to poor samuel we owe our meeting i will send him off the poor fellow at once to bourgeleroy to preach his three sermons and when they had driven you a little out of his head he shall have mariette therea good girl who will make him an excellent wife she is ugly enough but it will be all the same to him just then i will see him and let him know that i have reasons he lodges in your house does he then you had better come to see me at once so will evil tongues best be silenced  but hold the duchess said smiling you will think me a foolish old woman but is it true that you have saved the pearls of ribaumont of which good canon froissart tells  eustacie lifted her child on her knee untied the little gray frock and showed them fastened beneath well out of sight i thought my treasures should guard one another she said one i sent as a token to my motherinlaw for the rest they are not mine but hers her father lent them to me not gave so she wears them thus and anything but her life should go rather than they should  hein a fine guardian for them was all the duchess said in answer     chapter xxxv the italian pedlar          this caitiff monk for gold did swear       that by his drugs my rival fair           a saint in heaven should bescott   a grand cavalcade bore the house of quinet from montaubancoaches wagons outriders gendarmesit was a perfect court progress and so low and cumbrous that it was a whole week in reaching a grand old castle standing on a hillside among chestnut woods with an avenue a mile long leading up to it and battlemented towers fit to stand a siege  eustacie was ranked among the duchesss gentlewomen she was so far acknowledged as a lady of birth that she was usually called madame esperance and though no one was supposed to doubt her being theodore gardons widow she was regarded as being a person of rank who had made a misalliance by marrying him this madame de quinet had allowed the household to infer thinking that the whole bearing of her guest was too unlike that of a paris bourgeoise not to excite suspicion but she deemed it wiser to refrain from treating her with either intimacy or distinction that might excite jealousy or suspicion even as it was the consciousness of a secret or the remnants of montauban gossip prevented any familiarity between eustacie and the good ladies who surrounded her they were very civil to each other but their only connecting link was the delight that every one took in petting pretty little rayonette and the wonder that was made of her signs of intelligence and attempts at talking even when she toddled fearlessly up to the stately duchess on her canopied throne and held out her entreating hands and lisped the word nontre madame would pause in her avocations take her on her knee and display that wonderful gold and enamel creature which cried tictic and still remained an unapproachable mystery to m le marquis and m le vicomte her grandsons  pale formal stiff boys they looked twelve and ten years old and under the dominion of a very learned tutor who taught them latin greek and hebrew alternately with an equally precise stiff old esquire who trained them in martial exercises which seemed to be as much matters of rote with them as their tasks and to be quite as uninteresting it did not seem as if they ever played or thought of playing and if they were ever to be gay witty frenchmen a wonderful change must come over them  the elder was already betrothed to a bearnese damsel of an unimpeachably ancient and calvinistic family and the whole establishment had for the last three years been employed on tapestry hangings for a whole suite of rooms that were to be fitted up and hung with the histories of ruth of abigail of the shunammite and of esther which their diligent needles might hope to complete by the time the marriage should take place three years later the duchess who really was not unlike that great woman the shunammite in her dignified content with dwelling among her own people and her desire to receive a prophet in the name of a prophet generally sat presiding over the work while some one chaplain grandson or young maiden read aloud from carefully assorted books religious treatises at certain hours and at others history often however madame was called away into her cabinet where she gave audience to intendants notaries from her estates pastors from the villages captains of little garrisons soldiers offering service farmers women shepherds foresters peasants who came either on her business or with their own needsfor all of which she was ready with the beneficence and decision of an autocrat  the chapel had been purified and made bare of all altar or image it was filled with benches and a desk whence isaac gardon the chaplain any pastor on a visit or sometimes a candidate for his promotion would expound and offer prayers shortly in the week more at length on sunday and there too classes were held for the instruction of the peasants  there was a great garden full of medicinal plants and decoctions and distilleries were the chief variety enjoyed by the gentlewomen the duchess had studied much in quaint latin and french medical books and having great experience and good sense was probably as good a doctor as any one in the kingdom except ambroise pare and his pupils and she required her ladies to practise under her upon the numerous ailments that the peasants were continually bringing for her treatment no one could tell she said how soon they might be dealing with gunshot wounds and all ought to know how to sew up a gash or cure an argue  this department suited eustacie much better than the stitching and best of all she liked to be sent with maitre isaac to some cottage where solace for soul and body were needed and the inmate was too ill to be brought to madame la duchess she was learning much and improving too in the orderly household but her wanderings had made her something of a little gipsy she now and then was intolerably weary and felt as if she had been entirely spoilt for her natural post what would become of her she said to maitre isaac if she were too grand to dress rayonette  she was not greatly distressed that the montauban pursuivant turned out to have only the records of the provencal nobility and was forced to communicate with his brethren at bordeaux before he could bring down the ribaumont genealogy to the actual generation and so slow was communication so tardy the mode of doing everything that the chestnut leaves were falling and autumn becoming winter before the blazoned letter showed ribaumont de picardiegules fretty or a canton of the last a leopard sable eustacie berangere m annora daughter and heiress of villiam baron of valvem in the county of dorisette england who beareth azure a siren regardant in a mirror proper the siren was drawn in all her propriety impaled with the leopard and she was so much more comprehensible than the names to both madame de quinet and eustacie that it was a pity they could not direct their letters to her rather than to le baron de valvem whose cruel ws perplexed them so much however the address was the least of eustacies troubles she should be only too glad when she got to that and she was sitting in maitre isaacs room trying to make him dictate her sentences and asking him how to spell every third word when the dinnerbell rang and the whole household dropped down from salon library study or chamber to the huge hall with its pavement of black and white marble and its long tables for madame de quinet was no woman to discard wholesome old practices  then as eustacie with rayonette trotting at her side and maitre isaac leaning on her arm slowly made her way to that high table where dined madame la duchess her grandsons the ministers the gentlemen in waiting and some three or four women besides herself she saw that the lower end of the great hall was full of silks cloths and ribbons heaped together and passing by the lengthy rank of retainers she received a bow and look of recognition from a dark acutelooking visage which she remembered to belong to the pedlar she had met at charente  the duchess at the head of her table was not in the best of humours her son had sent home letters by a courier whom he had picked up for himself and she never liked nor trusted and he required an immediate reply when she particularly resented being hurried it was a galimafre literally a hash she said for indeed most matters where she was not consulted did become a galimafre with her moreover under favour of the courier her porters had admitted this pedlar and the duchess greatly disliked pedlars all her household stores were bought at shops of good repute in montauban and no one ought to be so improvident as to require dealings with these mountebank vagabonds who dangled vanities before the eyes of silly girls and filled their heads with paris fashion if they did not do still worse and excite them to the purchase of cosmetics and lovecharms  yet the excitement caused by the approach of a pedlar was invincible even by madame la duchess it was inevitable that the crying need of glove kerchief needle or the like should be discovered as soon as he came within ken and once in the hall there was no being rid of him except by a flagrant act of inhospitality this time it was worst of all for m le marquis himself must needs be the first to spy him bring him in and be in want of a silver chain for his hawk and his brother the vicomte must follow him up with all manner of wants inspired by the mere sight of the pack  every one with the smallest sum of money must buy every one without inspect and assist in bargaining and all dinnertime eyes thoughts and words were wandering to the gay pile in the corner or reckoning up needs and means the pedlar too knew what a calvinist household was and had been extremely discreet producing nothing that could reasonably be objected to and the duchess seeing that the stream was too strong for her wisely tried to steer her bark through it safely instead of directly opposing it  as soon as grace was over she called her maitre dhotel and bade him look after that galimafre and see that none of these fools were unreasonably cheated and that there was no attempt at gulling the young ones with charms or fortunetelling as well as to conclude the matter so as to give no excuse for the italian fellow lingering to sup and sleep she then retired to her cabinet to prepare her dispatches which were to include a letter to lord walwyn though a nominal friendship subsisted between elisabeth and the french court the huguenot chiefs always maintained a correspondence with england and there was little danger but that the duke de quinet would be able to get a letter sooner or later conveyed to any man of mark in the course of her letter madame de quinet found it necessary to refer to eustacie she rang her little silver handbell for the hall there of course master page had been engulfed in the galimafre and not only forming one of the swarm around the pedlar but was actually aping courtly grimaces as he tried a delicate lace ruffle on the hand of a silly little smirking maiden no older than himself but this little episode was like many others overlooked by madame de quinet as her eye fell upon the little figure of rayonette standing on the table with her mother and two or three ladies besides coaxing her to open her mouth and show the swollen gums that had of late been troubling her while the pedlar was evidently expending his blandishments upon her  the maitre dhotel was the first to perceive his mistress and as he approached received a sharp rebuke from her for allowing the fellow to produce his quack medicines and at the same time she desired him to request madame esperance to come to her immediately on business eustacie who always had a certain selfwilled sense of opposition when the duchess showed herself peremptory towards her at first began to make answer that she would come as soon as her business was concluded but the steward made a gesture towards the great lady sailing up and down as she paced the dais in stately impatience good fellow she said i will return quickly and see you again though i am now interrupted stay there little one with good mademoiselle perrot mother will soon be back  rayonette in her toothfretfulnes was far from enduring to be forsaken so near a strange man and her cry made it necessary for eustacie to take her in arms and carry her to the dais where the duchess was waiting  so said the lady i suspected that the fellow was a quack as well as a cheat  madamesaid eustacie with spirit he sold me unguents that greatly relieved my father last spring  and because rubbing relieved an old mans rheumatics you would let a vagabond cheat drug and sicken this poor child for what is not ailment at alland the teeth will relieve in a few days or if she were feverish have not we decoctions brewed from heavens own pure herbs in the garden with no unknown ingredient  madame said eustacie ruffling into fierceness you are very good to me but i must keep the management of my daughter to myself  the duchess looked at her from head to foot perhaps it was with an impulse to treat her impertinence as she would have done that of a dependant but the old lady never forgot herself she only shrugged her shoulders and said with studied politeness when i unfortunately interrupted your consultation with this eminent physician it was to ask you a question regarding this english family will you do me the honour to enter my cabinet  and whereas no one was looking the old lady showed her displeasure by ushering madame de ribaumont into her cabinet like a true noble stranger guest so that eustacie felt disconcerted  the duchess then began to read aloud her own letter to lord walwyn pausing at every clause so that eustacie felt the delay and discussion growing interminable and the duchess then requested to have madame de ribaumonts own letter at once as she wished to inclose it make up her packet and send it without delay opening a secret door in her cabinet she showed eustacie stair by which she might reach maitre gardons room without crossing the hall eustacie hoped to find him there and tell him how intolerable was the duchess but though she found him it was in company with the tutor who was spending an afternoon on plato with him she could only take up her letter and retreat to madames cabinet where she had left her child she finished it as best she might addressed it after the heralds spelling of the title bound it with some of the duchesss black floss silkwondering meanwhile but little guessing that the pedlar knew where was the tress that had bound her last attempt at correspondence guessing least of all that that tress lay on a heart still living and throbbing for her all this had made her a little forget her haste to assert her liberty of action by returning to the pedlar but behold when she came back to the hall it had resumed its pristine soberness and merely a few lingering figures were to be seen packing up their purchases  while she was still looking round in dismay mademoiselle perrot came up to her and said ah madame you may well wonder i never saw maitre benoit there so cross the poor man did but offer to sell little fanchon the elizir that secures a good husband and old benoit descended on him like a griffin enraged would scarce give him time to compute his charges or pack his wares but hustled him forth like a mere thief and i missed my bargain for that muffler that had so taken my fancy but madame he spoke to me apart and said you were an old customer of his and that rather than the little angel should suffer with her teeth which surely threaten convulsions he would leave with you this sovereign remedy of sweet syrupa spoonful to be given each night  eustacie took the little flask she was much inclined to give the syrup by way of precaution as well as to assure herself that she was not under the duchesss dominion but some strong instinct of the truth of the ladys words that the child was safer and healthier undoctored made her resolve at least to defer it until the little one showed any perilous symptom and as happily rayonette only showed two little white teeth and much greater goodhumour the syrup was nearly forgotten when a fortnight after the duchess received a dispatch from her son which filled her with the utmost indignation the courier had indeed arrived but the packet had proved to be filled with hay and wastepaper and upon close examination under the lash the courier had been forced to confess to having allowed himself to be overtaken by the pedlar and treated by him to a supper at a cabaret no doubt while he was afterwards asleep the contents of his packet had been abstracted there had been important documents for the duke besides eustacies letters and the affair greatly annoyed the duchess though she had the compensation of having been proved perfectly right in her prejudice against pedlars and her dislike of her sons courier she sent for eustacie to tell her privately of the loss and of course the young mother at once turned pale and exclaimed the wicked one ah what a blessing that i gave my little darling none of his dose  hein you had some from him then demanded the duchess with displeasure  no madame thanks thanks to you oh i never will be selfwilled and naughty again forgive me madame and down she dropped on her knee with clasped hands and glistening eyes  forgive you silly child for what said madame de quinet nearly laughing  ah for the angry passionate thoughts i had ah madame i was all but giving the stuff to my little angel in very spiteand then eutacies voice was drowned in passion of tears and she devoured the old ladys hand with her kisses  come come said the duchess let us be reasonable a man may be a thief but it does not follow that he is a poisoner  nay that will we see cried eutacie he was resolved that the little lamb should not escape and he left a flask for her with mademoiselle perrot i will fetch it if madame will give me leave oh the great mercy of heaven that made her so well that i gave her none  madame de quinets analytic powers did not go very far and would probably have decided against the syrup if it had been nothing but virgin honey she was one who fully believed that her dear queen jeanne had been poisoned with a pair of gloves and she had unlimited faith in the powers of evil possessed by rene of milan of course she detected the presence of a slow poison whose effects would have been attributed to the ailment it was meant to cure and though her evidence was insufficient she probably did ercole no injustice she declined testing the compound on any unfortunate dog or cat but sealed it up in the presence of gardon eutacie and mademoiselle perrot to be produced against the pedlar if ever he should be caught  then she asked eutacie if there was any reason to suspect that he recognized her eutacie related the former dealings with him when she had sold him her jewels and her hair but she had no notion of his being the same person whom she had seen when at montpipeau indeed he had altered his appearance so much that he had been only discovered at niddemerle by eyes sharpened by distrust of his pretensions to magic arts  madame de quinet however concluded that eutacie had been known or else that her jewels had betrayed her and that the man must have been employed by her enemies if it had not been the depth of winter she would have provided for the persecuted ladys immediate transmission to england but he storms of the bay of biscay would have made this impossible in the state of french navigation even if isaac gardon had been in a condition to move for the first return of cold had brought back severe rheumatic pains and with them came a shortness of breath which even the duchess did not know to be the token of heart complaint he was confined to his room and it was kneeling by his bedside that eutacie poured out her thankfulness for her childs preservation and her own repentance for the passing fit of selfwill and petulance the thought of rayonettes safety seemed absolutely to extinguish the fresh anxiety that had arisen since it had become evident that her enemies no longer supposed her dead but were probably upon her traces somehow danger had become almost a natural element to her and having once expressed her firm resolution that nothing should separate her from her adopted father to whom indeed her care became constantly more necessary she seemed to occupy herself very little with the matter she nursed him as merrily as ever and left to him and madame de quinet the grave consultations as to what was to be done for her security there was a sort of natural buoyancy about her that never realized a danger till it came and then her spirit was roused to meet it     chapter xxxvi spell and potion         churl upon thy eyes i throw      all the power this charm doth owe                    midsummer nights dream   her rival lived the tidings could not but be communicated to diane de selinville when her father set out en grande tenue to demand his niece from the duke de quinet this however was not till spring was advancing for the pedlar had not been able to take a direct route back to niddemerle since his first measure had necessarily been to escape into a province where the abstraction of a huguenot noblemans despatches would be considered as a meritorious action winter weather and the practice of his profession likewise delayed ercole so much that it was nearly easter before he brought his certain intelligence to the chevalier and to the lady an elixir of love clear and coloured as crystal and infallible as an inspirer of affection  should she administer it now that she knew her cousin not to be the lawful object of affection she had so long esteemed him but as he persisted in considering himself a married man diane had more scruples than she would have had a year before for she had not so long watched and loved one so true and conscientious as berenger de ribaumont without having her perceptions elevated but at the same time the passion of love had become intensified both by long continuance and by resistance she had attached herself believing him free and her affections could not be disentangled by learning that he was boundrather the contrary  besides there was plenty of sophistry her father had always assured her of the invalidity of the marriage without thinking it necessary to dwell on his own arrangements for making it invalid so that was no reasonable ground of objection and a lady of dianes period living in the world where she had lived would have had no notion of objecting to her lover for a previous amour and as such was she bidden to rank berengers relations with eutacie and there was the less scruple on eutacies account because the chevalier knowing that the duchess had a son and two grandsons had conceived a great terror that she meant to give his niece to one of them and this would be infinitely worse both for the interests of the family and of their party than even her reunion with the young baron even narcisse who on his return had written to paris a grudging consent to the experiment of his father and sister had allowed that the preservation of berengers life was needful till eutacie should be in their power so as to prevent such a marriage as that to diane the very suggestion became certainty she already saw eutacies shallow little heart consoled and her vanity excited by these magnificent prospects and she looked forward to the triumph of her own constancy when berenger should find the image so long enshrined in his heart crumble in its sacred niche  yet a little while then would she be patient even though nearly a year had passed and still she saw no effect upon her prisoners unless indeed philip had drunk of one of her potions by mistake and his clumsy admiration was the consequence the two youths went on exactly in the same manner without a complaint without a request occupying themselves as best they mightberenger courteously attentive recovered his health and the athletic powers displayed by the two brothers when wrestling fencing or snowballing in the courtyard were the amazement and envy of their guard twice in the course of the winter there had been an alarm of wolves and in their eagerness and excitement about this new sport they had accepted the chevaliers offer of taking their parole for the hunt they had then gone forth with a huge posse of villagers who beat the woods with their dogs till the beast was aroused from its lair and driven into the alleys where waited gentlemen gendarmes and game keepers with their guns these two chases were chiefly memorable to berenger because in the universal intermingling of shouting peasants he was able in the first to have some conversation with eutacies faithful protector martin who told him the incidents of her wanderings with tears in his eyes and blessed him for his faith that she was not dead and in the second he actually found himself in the ravine of the grange du temple no need to ask every voice was shouting the name and though the gendarmes were round him and he durst not speak to rotrou still he could reply with significative earnestness to the low bow with which the farmer bent to evident certainty that here was the imprisoned protestant husband of the poor lady berenger wore his black vizard mask as had been required of him but the mans eyes followed him as though learning by heart the outline of his tall figure the object of the chevaliers journey was of course a secret from the prisoners who merely felt its effects by having their meals served to them in their own tower and when he returned after about a months absence though him looking harassed aged and so much out of humour that he could scarcely preserve his usual politeness in effect he was greatly chagrined  that she is in their hands is certain the hypocrites he said to his daughter and sister and no less so that they have designs on her but i let them know that these could be easily traversed  but where is she the unhappy apostate child said the abbess they durst not refuse her to you  i tell you they denied all present knowledge of her the duke himself had the face to make as though he never heard of her he had no concern with his mothers household and guests forsooth i do not believe he has the poor fellow stands in awe of that terrible old heretic dragon and keeps aloof from her as much as he can but he is after all a beau jeune home nor should i be surprised if he were the girls gay bridegroom by this time though i gave him a hint that there was an entanglement about the childs first marriage which by french law would invalidate any other without a dispensation from the pope  a hard nut that for a heretic laughed the abbess  he acted the ignorantknew nothing about the young lady but had the civility to give me a guide and an escort to go to quinet ma foi i believe they were given to hinder metake me by indirect roads make me lose time at chateaux when i arrived at the grim old chateaua true dungeon precise as a conventthere was the dame playing the queen jeanne as well as she could and having the insolence to tell me that it was true that madame la baronne de ribaumont as she was pleased to call her had honoured her residence for some months but that she had now quitted it and she flatly refused to answer any question whither she was gone the hag she might at least have had the decorum to deny all knowledge of her but nothing is more impertinent that the hypocritical sincerity of the heretics  but her people exclaimed the abbess surely some of them knew and could be brought to speak  all the servants i came in contact with played the incorruptible but still i have done something there were some fellows in the village who are not at their ease under that rule i caused my people to inquire them out they knew nothing more than that the old heretic gardon with his family had gone away in madame la duchesses litter but whither they could not tell but the cabaretier there is furious secretly with the quinets for having spoilt his trade by destroying the shrine at the holy well and i have made him understand that it will be for his profit to send me off intelligence so soon as there is any communication between them and the lady i made the same arrangement with a couple of gendarmes of the escort the duke gave me so at least we are safe for intelligence such as would hinder a marriage  but they will be off to england said the abbess  i wager they will again write to make sure of a reception moreover i have set that fellow ercole and others of his trade to keep a strict watch on all the roads leading to the ports and give me due notice of their passing thither we have law on our side and did i once claim her no one could resist my right or should the war break out as is probable then could my son sweep their whole province with his troops this time she cannot escape us  the scene that her fathers words and her own imagination conjured up of eustacie attracting the handsome widowerduke removed all remaining scruples from madame de selinville for his own sake the baron must be made to fulfil the prophecy of the inkpool and allow his prison doors to be opened by love many and many a tender art did diane rehearse numerous were her sighs wakeful languishing and restless her nights and days and yet whatever her determination to practise upon her cousin the witcheries that she had learnt in the escadron de la reinemere and seen played off effectually where there was not one grain of love to inspire them her powers and her courage always failed her in the presence of him whom she sought to attract his quiet reserve and simplicity always disconcerted her and any attempt at blandishment that he could not mistake was always treated by him as necessarily an accidental error as if any other supposition would render her despicable and yet there was now and then a something that made her detect an effort in his restraint as if it were less distaste than selfcommand her brother had contemptuously acquiesced in the experiment made by herself and her father and allowed that so long as there was any danger of the quinet marriage the barons existence was needful he would not come to niddemerle nor did they want him there knowing that he could hardly have kept his hands off his rival but when the war broke out again in the summer of 1575 he joined that detachment of guises army which hovered about the loire and kept watch on the huguenot cities and provinces of western france the chevalier made several expeditions to confer with his son and to keep up his relations with the network of spies whom he had spread over the quinet provinces the prisoners were so much separated from all intercourse with the dependants that they were entirely ignorant of the object of his absence from home on these occasions they never left their tower and its court and had no enlivenment save an occasional gift of dainties or message of inquiry from the ladies at bellaise these were brought by a handsome but slight pale lad called aime de selinville a relative of the late count as he told them who had come to act as a gentleman attendant upon the widowed countess the brothers rather wondered how he was disposed of at the convent but all there was so contrary to their preconceived notions that they acquiesced the first time he arrived it was on a long hot summer day and he then brought them a cool iced sherbet in two separate flasks that for philip being mixed with wine which was omitted for berenger and the youth stood lingering and watching anxious he said to be able to tell his lady how the drinks were approved both were excellent and to that effect the prisoners replied but no sooner was the messenger gone than berenger said smilingly that was a love potion phil  and you drank it cried philip in horror  i did not think of it till i saw how the boys eyes were gazing curiously at me as i swallowed it you look at me as curiously phil are you expecting it to work shall i be at the fair ladys feet next time we meet  how can you defy it berry  nay phil holy wedded love is not to be dispelled by a mountebanks decoction  but suppose it were poisonous berry what can be done cried philip starting up in dismay  then you would go home phil and this would be over butseeing his brothers terrorthere is no fear of that she is not like to wish to poison me  and the potion proved equally ineffective on mind and body as indeed did all the manipulations exercised upon a little waxen image that was supposed to represent m le baron another figure was offered to diane in feminine form with black beads for eyes and a black plaster for hair which when stuck full of pins and roasted before the fire was to cause eustacie to peak and pine correspondingly but from this measure diane shrank if aught was done against her rival it must be by her father and brother not by herself and she would not feel herself directly injuring her little cousin nor sinking herself below him whom she loved once his wife she would be good for ever held up by his strength  meantime berenger had received a greater shock than she or her father understood in the looking over of some of the family parchments kept in store at the castle the chevalier in showing them to him had chiefly desired to glorify the family by demonstrating how its honours had been won but berenger was startled at finding that niddemerle had been as it appeared to him arbitrarily and unjustly declared to be forfeited by the sieur de bellaise who had been thrown into prison by louis xi for some demonstration in favour of the poor duke de berri and granted to the favourite ribaumont the original grant was there and to his surprise he found it was to male heirsthe male heirs alone of the direct line of the ribaumontto whom the grant was made how then came it to eustacie the disposal had with almost equal injustice been changed by king henry ii and the late count de ribaumont in favour of the little daughter whose union with the heir of the elder line was to conclude all family feuds only now did berenger understand what his father had said on his deathbed of flagrant injustice committed in his days of darkness he felt that he was reaping the reward of the injuries committed against the chevalier and his son on behalf of the two unconscious children he would willingly at once have given up all claim to the niddemerle estateand he was now of age two birthdays had passed in his captivity and brought him to years of discretionbut he had no more power than before to dispose of what was the property of eustacie and her child and the whole question of the validity of his marriage would be given up by his yielding even the posthumous claim that might have devolved on him in case of eustacies death this would be giving up her honour a thing impossible  alas he sighed my poor father might well say he had bound a heavy burthen round my neck  and from that time his hopes sank lower as the sense of the justice of his cause left him he could neither deny his religion nor his marriage and therefore could do nothing for his own deliverance and he knew himself to be suffering in the cause of a great injustice indeed to be bringing suffering on the still more innocent philip  the once proudly indifferent youth was flagging now was losing appetite flesh and colour was unwilling to talk or to take exercise and had a wan and drooping air that was most painful to watch it seemed as if the return of summer brought a sense of the length and weariness of the captivity and that the sunshine and gaiety of the landscape had become such a contrast to the captives deadness of spirit that they could hardly bear to behold them and felt the dull prison walls more congenial to their feelings than the gaiety of the summer hay and harvestfields     chapter xxxvii beating against the bars    my horse is weary of the stall and i am sick of captive thralllady of the lake   letters they were hailed like drops of water in a thirsty land no doubt they had been long on the way ere they had reached the hands of the chevalier de ribaumont and it was quite possible that they had been read and selected but as berenger said he defied any frenchman to imitate either lord walwyns style or sir marmadukes and when late in the autumn the packet was delivered to him the two captives gloated over the very outsides before they opened them  the first intelligence that greeted them made them give a cry of amusement and surprise lady thistlewood whose regrets that each of her girls was not a boy had passed into a proverb had at length in dollys seventh year given birth to a son on midsummer day  well said philip sighing we must drink his health tonight it is well if we are to rot here that some one should make it up to them  and join walwyn and hurst said berenger and then both faces grew much graver as by these letters dated three months since they understood how many they must have missed and likewise that nothing had been heard of themselves since they had left paris sixteen months ago their letters both to their relations and to sir francis walsingham had evidently been suppressed and lord north who had succeeded walsingham as ambassador had probably been misled by design either by narcisse de niddemerle himself or by some of his agents for lord walwyn had heard from him that the young men were loitering among the castles and garrisons of anjou leading a gay and dissipated life and that it was universally believed that the baron de ribaumont had embraced the catholic faith and would shortly be presented to henry iii to receive the grant of the selinville honours upon his marriage with his cousin the widow of the last of the line with much earnestness and sorrow did good old lord walwyn write to his grandson conjuring him to bethink himself of his some his pure faith his loving friends and the hopes of his youth and at least if he himself had been led away by the allurements of the other party to remember that philip had been intrusted to him in full confidence and to return him to his home it was grief and shame to him said the good old man to look at sir marmaduke who had risked his son in the charge of one hitherto deemed trustworthy and even if berenger had indeed forgotten and cast away those whom he had once seemed to regard with love and duty he commanded him to send home philip who owed an obedience to his father that could not be gainsaid lord walwyn further bade his grandson remember that the arrangements respecting his inheritance had been made in confidence that his heir was english in heart and faith and that neither the queen nor his own conscience would allow him to let his inheritance pass into french of papist hands there was scarcely a direct reproach but the shaken altered handwriting showed how stricken the aged man must be and after his signature was added one still more trembling line an ye return not speedily ye will never see the old grandsire more  berenger scarcely finished the letter through his burning tears of agony and then casting it from him began to pace the room in fierce agitation bursting out into incoherent exclamations grasping at his hair even launching himself against the massive window with such frenzied gestures and wild words that philip who had read through all with his usual silent obtuseness became dismayed and laying hold of him said prithee brother do not thus what serves such passion  berenger burst into a strange loud laugh at the matteroffact tone what serves it what serves anything he cried but to make me feel what a miserable wretch i am but he will die philiphe will dienot having believed me how shall we keep ourselves from the smoothtongued villains throat that i should be thus judged a traitor by my grandfather  and with a cry as of bodily anguish he hid his face on the table and groaned as he felt the utter helplessness of his strong youth in bonds  it cant be helped was the next of the unconsolatory platitudes uttered by philip who always grew sullen and dogged when his brothers french temperament broke forth under any sudden stroke if they will believe such things let them you have not heard what my father says to it  it will be all the same groaned berenger  nay now thats a foul slander and you should be ashamed of doing my father such wrong said philip listen and he read i will believe no ill of the lad no more than of thee phil it is but a wildgoose chase and the poor young woman is scarce like to be above ground but as i daily tell them tis hard a man should forfeit his land for seeking his wife my lord north sends rumours that he is under papist guiding and sworn brother with the black ribaumonts and my lady his grandmother is like to break her heart and my lord credits them more than he ought and never a line as a token comes from you then theres dame annora as proud of the babe as though neither she nor woman born ever had a son before and plains over him that both his brothers should be endowed and he but a younger son what will be the end ont i cannot tell i will stand up for the right as best man may do and never forget that berry is her firstborn and that his child may be living but the matter is none of mine and my lord is very aged nor can a man meddle between his wife and her father so this i tell you that you may make your brother lay it to heart the sooner he is here the better if he be still as i verily believe and maintain him to be an honest english heart that snaps his fingers at french papistry there conclude philip triumphantly he knows an honest man hes friend and good father to you as much as ever heed none of the rest hell never let this little rogue stand in your light  as if i cared for that said berenger beginning his cagedtiger walk again and though he tried to repress his anguish breaking out at times into fierce revilings of the cruel toils that beset him and despairing lamentations over those beloved ones at home with sobs groans and tears such as philip could not brook to witness both because they were so violent and mournfull and because he thought them womanish though in effect no womans grief could have had half that despairing force the fierte of the french noble however came to his aid at the first sound of the great supperbell he dashed away his tears composed his features washed his face and demanded haughtily of philip whether there were any traces in his looks that the cruel hypocrite their jailer could gloat over  and with proud step and indifferent air he marched into the hall answered the chevaliers polite inquiry whether the letter had brought good tidings by coolly thanking him and saying that all at home were well and when he met the old mans inquiring glance out of the little keen black bead in the puckered withered eyelid he put a perfectly stony unmeaningness into his own gaze till his eyes looked like the blue porcelain from china so much prized by the abbess he even played at chess all the evening with such concentrated attention as to be uniformly victorious  yet half the night philip heard suppressed moans and sobsthen knew that he was on his kneesthen after long and comparatively silent weeping he lay down again and from the hour when he awoke in the morning he returned no more to the letters and though for some little time more sad and dispirited he seemed to have come to regard the misjudgment at home as a part of the burthen he was already bearing  that burthen was however pressing more heavily the temperaments of the two brothers so differed that while the french one was prostrated by the agony of a stroke and then rallied patiently to endure the effects the english character opposed a passive resistance to the blow gave no sign of grief or pain and from that very determination suffered a sort of exhaustion that made the effects of the evil more and more left thus from the time philips somewhat tardy imagination had been made to realize his home his father and his sisters the homesickness and weariness of his captivity which had already begun to undermine his health and spirits took increasing effect  he made no complainthe never expressed a wishbut in the words of the prophet he seemed pining away on his feet he did not sleep and though to avoid remark he never failed to appear at meals he scarcely tasted food he never willingly stirred from cowering over the fire and was so surly and illtempered that only berengers unfailing goodhumour could have endured it even a wolfhunt did not stir him he only said he hated outlandish beasts and that it was not like chasing the hare in dorset his calflove for madame de selinville had entirely faded away in his yearnings after home she was only one of the tediously recurring sights of his captivity and was loathed like all the rest the regulation rides with the chevalier were more detestable than ever and by and by they caused such fatigue that berenger perceived that his strength must be warning and became so seriously alarmed that one evening when philip had barely dragged himself to the hall tasted nothing but a few drops of wine and then dropped into an uneasy slumber in his chair he could not but turn to the chevalier an appealing indignant countenance as he said in a low but quivering voice you see sir how he is altered  alas fair nephew it is but too plain he is just of the age when such restraint tells severely upon the health  then berenger spoke out upon the foul iniquity of the boys detention for himself he observed he had nothing to say he knew the term of his release and had not accepted them but philip innocent of all damage to the ribaumont interests the heir of an honourable family what had he done to incur the cruel imprisonment that was eating away his life  i tell you sir said berenger with eyes filled with tears that his liberty is more precious to me than my own were he but restored to our home full half the weight would be gone from my spirit  fair nephew said the chevalier you speak as though i had any power in the matter and were not merely standing between you and the king  then if so said berenger let the king do as he will with me but let philips case be known to our ambassador  my poor cousin said the chevalier you know not what you ask did i grant your desire you would only learn how implacable king henri is to those who have personally offended himabove all to heretics nor could the ambassador do anything for one who resisted by force of arms the kings justice leave it to me put yourself in my hands and deliverance shall come for him first then for you  how sir  one token of concessionone attendance at massone pledge that the alliance shall take place when the formalities have been complied withthen can i report you our own give you almost freedom at once despatch our young friend to england without loss of time so will brotherly affection conquer those chivalrous scruples most honourable in you but which carried too far become cruel obstinacy  berenger looked at philip saw how faded and wan was the ruddy sunburnt complexion how lank and bony the sturdy form how listless and wasted the hands then arose bursting within him the devoted generosity of the french nature which would even accept sin and ruin for self that so the friend may be saved and after all had he not gone to mass out of mere curiositydid he not believe that there was salvation in the gallican church was it not possible that with philip free to tell his story at home his own deliverance might come before he should be irrevocably committed to madame de selinville if eustacie were living her claims must overthrow that which her rival was forcing upon him at her own peril nay how else could he obtain tidings of her and for those at home did they deserve that he should sacrifice all philip included for their sake the thoughts long floating round his brain now surged upon him in one flood and seemed to overwhelm in those moments of confusion all his powers of calling up the other side of the argument he only had an instinct remaining that it would be a lie to god and man alike god help me he sighed to himself and there was sufficient consideration and perplexity expressed in his countenance to cause the chevalier to feel his cause almost gained and rising eagerly with tears in his eyes he exclaimed embrace me my dear dear son the thing is done oh what peace what joy  the instinct of recoil came stronger now he stepped back with folded arms saying again god help me god forbid that i should be a traitor  my son hear me these are but easily removed points of honour began the chevalier but at that moment philip suddenly started from or in his slumber leapt on his feet and called out avaunt satan then opened his eyes and looked as if barely recalling where he was  philip exclaimed berenger did you hear  ii dont know he said halfbewildered was i dreaming that the fiend was parleying with us in the voice of m le chevalier there to sell our souls for one hour of home  he spoke english but berenger replied in french  you were not wrong philip sir he dreamt that the devil was tempting me in your voice while you were promising me his liberty on my fulfilling your first condition  what said philip now fully awake and gathering the state of things as he remembered the words that had doubtless been the cause of his dream and if you did berenger i give you warning they should never see me at home what could i show my face there with such tidings no i should go straight to la noue or to the low countries and kill every papist i could for having debauched you  hush hush philip said berenger i could not break my faith to heaven or my wife even for your sake and my cousin sees how little beholden you would be to me for so doing with your leave monsieur we will retire  the chevalier detained berenger for a moment to whisper what i see is so noble a heart that i know you cannot sacrifice him to your punctilio  philip was so angry with berenger so excited and so determined to show that nothing ailed him that for a short time he was roused and seemed to be recovering but in a few days he flagged again only if possible with more gruffness moodiness and pertinacity in not allowing that anything was amiss it was the bitterest drop of all in berengers cup when in the end of january he looked back at what philip had been only a month before and saw how he had wasted away and lost strength the impulse rather to ruin himself that destroy his brother came with such force that he could scarcely escape it by his everrecurring cry for help to withstand it and then diane in her splendid beauty and withchery would rise before him so that he knew how a relaxation of the lengthened weary effort would make his whole self break its bonds and go out to her dreams of felicity and liberty and not with eustacie would even come over him and he would awaken to disappointment before he came to a sense of relief and thankfulness that he was still his own the dislike distaste and dread that came so easily in his time of pain and weakness were less easy to maintain in his full health and forced inactivity occupation of mind and hope seemed the only chance of enabling either of the two to weather this most dreary desert period and berenger setting his thoughts resolutely to consider what would be the best means of rousing philip decided at length that any endeavour to escape however arduous and desperate would be better than his present apathetic languor even if it led to nothing after the first examination of their prison berenger had had no thought of escape he was then still weak and unenterprising he had for many months lived in hopes of interference from home and besides the likelihood that so english a party as his own would be quickly pursued and recaptured where they did not know their road and had no passports had deterred him lest should fall into still straiter imprisonment but he had since gained in the course of his rides and by observation from the top of the tower a much fuller knowledge of the country he knew the way to the grange du temple and to the chief towns in the neighbourhood philip and humfrey had both lost something of their intensely national look and speech and moreover was having broken out again there was hope of falling in with huguenot partisans even nearer that at la rochelle but whether successful or not some enterprise was absolutely needed to save philip from his despondent apathy and berenger who in these eighteen months had grown into the strength and vigour of manhood felt as if he had force and power for almost any effort save this hopeless waiting  he held council with humfrey who suggested that it might be well to examine the vaults below the keep he had a few days before while going after some of the firewood stored below the groundfloor chamber observed a door locked but with such rusty iron hinges that they might possibly yield to vigorous efforts with a stone and who could tell where the underground passages might come out  berenger eagerly seized the idea philips mood of contradiction prompted him to pronounce it useless folly and he vouchsafed no interest in the arrangements for securing light by selecting all the bits of firewood fittest for torches and saving all the oil possible from the two lamps they were allowed the chief difficulty was that guibert was not trusted so that all had to be done out of his sight and on the first day berenger was obliged to make the exploration alone since humfrey was forced to engross guibert in some occupation out of sight and philip had refused to have anything to do with it or be like a rat routing in the corners of his trap  however berenger had only just ascertained that the ironwork was so entirely rusted away as to offer no impediment when philip came languidly roaming into the cellar saying here ill hold the torch youll be losing yourself in this wolfs mouth of a place if you go alone  the investigation justified philips predictions of its uselessness nothing was detected but rats and vaults and cobwebs it was cold earthy and damp and when they thought they must have penetrated far beyond the precincts of the keep they heard humfreys voice close to them warning them that it was nearly dinnertime  the next day brought them a more promising discovery namely of a long straight passage with a gleam of light at the end of it and this for the first time excited philips interest or curiosity he would have hastened along it at once but for the warning summons from humfrey and in the excitement of even this grain of interest he ate more heartily at supper than he had done for weeks and was afterwards more eager to prove to berenger that night was the best time to pursue their researches  and berenger when convinced that guibert was sound asleep thought so too and accompanied by humfrey they descended into the passage the light of course was no longer visible but the form of the crypt through which they now passed was less antique than that under the keep and it was plain they were beneath a later portion of the castle the gallery concluded in a wall with a small barred unglazed window perfectly dark so that berenger who alone could reach to the bottom of it could not uses where it looked out  we must return by daylight then maybe we may judge sighed philip  hark exclaimed berenger  rats said philip  nolistena voice take care he added in a lower tone we may be close on some of the servants  but much nearer than he expected a voice on his right hand demanded does any good christian hear me  who is there exclaimed philip  ah good sir do i hear the voice of a companion in misery or if you be free would you but send tidings to my poor father  it is a norman accent cried berenger ah ah can it be poor landry osbert  i ami am that wretch oh would that m le baron could know  my dear faithful fosterbrother they deceived me cried berenger in great agitation as an absolute howl came from the other side of the wall m le baron come to this woe worth the day and berenger with difficulty mitigated his affectionate servants lamentations enough to learn from him how he had been seized almost at the gates of bellaise closely interrogated deprived of the letter to madame la baronne and thrown into this dungeon the chevalier not an unmerciful man according to the time had probably meant to release him as soon as the marriage between his son and niece should have rendered it superfluous to detain this witness to berengers existence there then the poor fellow had lain for three years and his work during this weary time had been the scraping with a potsherd at the stone of his wall and his pertinacious perseverance had succeeded in forming a hole just large enough to enable him to see the light of the torch carried by the gentlemen on his side he said there was nothing but a strong iron door and a heavilybarred window looking like that in the passage into the fosse within the walled garden but on the other hand if he could enlarge his hole sufficiently to creep through it he could escape with them in case of their finding a subterranean outlet the opening within his cell was of course much larger than the very small space he had made by loosening a stone towards the passage but he was obliged always to build up each side of his burrow at the hours of his jailers visit lest his work should be detected and to stamp the rubbish into his floor but while they talked humfrey and philip with their knives scraped so diligently that two more stones could be displaced and looking down the widening hole through the prodigious mass of wall they could see a ghastly ragged longbearded scarecrow with an almost piteous expression of joy on his face at once again seeing familiar faces and when at his earnest entreaty berenger stood so as to allow his countenance to be as visible as the torch could make it through the wallshole the vault echoed with the poor fellows delighted cry i am happy m le baron is himself again the assassins cruel work is gone ah thanks to the saints blessed be st lucie it was not in vain that i entreated her  the torches were however waxing so low that the sight could not long be afforded poor osbert and with a promise to return to him next day the party returned to the upper air where they warmed themselves over the fire and held council over measures for the present relief of the captive berenger grieved that he had given him up so entirely for lost as to have made no exertions on his behalf and declared his resolution of entreating that he might be allowed to enjoy comparative comfort with them in the keep it was a risk but the chevalier might fairly suppose that the knowledge of osberts situation had oozed out through the servants and gratitude and humanity alike impelled berenger to run some risk for his fosterbrothers sake he was greatly touched at the poor fellows devotion and somewhat amused though with an almost tearful smile at the joy with which he had proclaimedwhat berenger was quite unaware of since the keep furnished no mirrorsthe disappearance of his scars tis even so said philip though i never heeded it you are as white from crown to beard as one of the statues at paris but the great red gash is a mere seam save when yon old satan angers you and then it blushes for all the rest of your face  and the cheekwound is hidden i suppose said berenger feeling under the long fair moustache and the beard which was developing into respectable proportions  hidden ay entirely no one would think your bald crown had only twentyone years over it but you are a personable fellow still quite enough to please daphne said philip  pshaw replied berenger pleased nevertheless to hear the shadow of a jest again from philip  it was quite true these months of quiescenceenforced though they werehad given his health and constitution time to rally after the terrible shock they had sustained the severe bleedings had indeed rendered his complexion perfectly colourless but there was something in this as well as in the height which the loss of hair gave his brow which added to the depth and loftiness of countenance that this long period of patience and resolution had impressed on his naturally fine features without taking away that open candour that had first attracted diane when he was a rosy lad his frame had strengthened at the same time and assumed the proportions of manhood so that instead of being the overgrown maypole that narcisse used to sneer at he was now broadshouldered and robust exceedingly powerful and so well made that his height upwards of six feet was scarcely observed except by comparison with the rest of the world  and his character had not stood still he had first come to paris a good honest docile though highspirited boy and though manly affections cares and sorrows had been thrust on him he had met them like the boy that he was hardly conscious how deep they went then had come the long dream of physical suffering with only one thought pertinaciously held throughoutthat of constancy to his lost wife and from this he had only thoroughly wakened in his captivity the resolution still holding fast but with more of reflection and principle less of mere instinct than when his powers were lost or distracted in the effort of constant endurance of pain and weakness the charge of philip the endeavour both of educating him and keeping up his spirits as well as the controversy with pere bonami had been no insignificant parts of the discipline of these months and little as the chevalier had intended it he had trained his young kinsman into a far more substantial and perilous adversary both in body and mind than when he had caged him in his castle of the blackbirds nest     chapter xxxviii the enemy in presence         then came and looked him in the face        an angel beautiful and bright      and then he knew it was a fiend        that miserable knight                  coleridge   father dear father what is it what makes you look so ill so haggard cried diane de selinville when summoned the next morning to meet her father in the parlour of the convent  ah child see here your brother will have us make an end of it he has found her  eustacie ah and where  that he will not say but see here this is all billet tells me the hare who has doubled so long is traced to her form my dogs are on her and in a weeks time she will be ours i request you sir to send me a good purse of crowns to reward my huntsmen and in the meantimeone way or the otherthat pet of my sisters must be disposed of kept too long these beasts always become savage either let him be presented to the royal menagerie or there is a still surer way  and that is all he says exclaimed diane  all he was always cautions he mentions no names and now child what is to be done to give him up to the king is at the best lifelong imprisonment yet if he were still here when my son returnsalas alas child i have been ruined body and soul between you how could you make me send after and imprison him it was a mere assassination and the old man beat his head with grief and perplexity  father cried diane tearfully i cannot see you thus we meant it for the best we shall yet save him  save him ah daughter i tossed all night long thinking how to save him so strong so noble so firm so patient so good even to the old man who has destroyed his hopehis life ah i have thought till my brain whirls  poor father i knew you would love him said diane tenderly ah we will save him yet he shall be the best of sons to you look it is only to tell him that she whom he calls his wife is already in my brothers hands wedded to him  daughterand he pushed back his gray hair with a weary distressed gesturei am tired of wiles i am old i can carry them out no longer  but this is very simple it may already be trueat least it will soon be true only tell him that she is my brothers wife then will his generosity awaken then will he see that to persist in the validity of his marriage would be misery dishonour to her then  child you know not how hard he is in his sense of right even for his brothers sake he would not give way an inch and the boy was as obstinate as he  ah but this comes nearer he will be stung his generosity will be piqued he will see that the kindest thing he can do will be to nullify his claim and the child  the chevalier groaned struck his brow with his fist and muttered that will concern no onethat has been provided for ah ah children if i lose my own soul for you you  father my sweet father say not these cruel things did not the queens confessor tell us that all means were lawful that brought a soul to the church and here are two  two why the youths heresy is part of his point of honour child child the two will be murdered in my very house and the guilt will be on my soul  no father we willwe will save him see only tell him this  thiswhat my brain is confused i have thought longlong  only this father dear father you shall not be tormented any more if only you will tell him that my brother has made eustacie his wife then will i do all the rest  diane coaxed soothed and encouraged her father by her caresses till he mounted his mule to return to the castle at dinnertime and she promised to come early in the afternoon to follow up the stroke he was to give she had never seen him falter beforehe had followed out his policy with a clear head and unsparing handbut now that berengers character was better known to him and the crisis long delayed had come so suddenly before his eyes his whole powers seemed to reel under the alternative  the dinnerbell clanged as he arrived at the castle and the prisoners were marched into the hall both intent upon making their request on osberts behalf and therefore as impatient for the conclusion of the meal and the absence of the servants as was their host his hands trembled so much that berenger was obliged to carve for him he made the merest feint of eating and now and then raised his hand to his head as if to bring back scattered ideas  the last servant quitted the room when berenger perceived that the old man was hardly in a state to attend to his request and yet the miserable frostbitten state of poor landry seemed to compel him to speak  sir he began you could do me a great kindness  the chevalier looked up at him with glassy eyes  my son he said with an effort i also had something to say ah let me think i have had enough call my daughter he added feeling helplessly with his hands so that berenger started up in alarm and received him in his arms just in time to prevent his sinking to the floor senseless  it is a stroke exclaimed berenger call phil send the gendarmes  the gendarmes might be used to the sight of death of their own causing but they had a horror of that which came by natures hand the purple face and loud gasps of the stricken man terrified them out of their senses cest un coup was the cry and they went clattering off to the servants these all men but one old crone came in a mass to the door looked in beheld their master rigid and prostrate on the floor supported by the prisoner and with fresh shrieks about mesdames a priest a doctor away they rushed the two brothers were not in much less consternation only they retained their senses berenger loosened the ruff and doublet and bade philip practice that art of letting blood which he had learnt for his benefit when madame de selinville and her aunt with their escort having been met halfway from bellaise arrived sooner than could have been expected they found every door open from hall to entrance gateway not a person keeping watch and the old man lying deathlike upon cushions in the hall philip bandaging his arm and berenger rubbing his temples with wine and the hottest spices on the table he is betterhe is alive said berenger as they entered and as both ladies would have fallen on him with shrieks and sobs he bade them listen assured them that the only chance of life was in immediate care and entreated that bedding might be brought down and strong essences fetched to apply to the nose and temples they obeyed and the sister infirmarer had arrived from the convent he had opened his eyes and as he saw berenger tried to murmur something that sounded like mon fils  he liveshe speakshe can receive the sacraments was the immediate exclamation and as preparations began to be made the brothers saw that their presence was no longer needed and returned to their own tower  so sir said the gendarme sergeant as they walked down the passage you did not seize the moment for escape  i never thought of it said berenger  i hope sir you will not be the worse for it said the sergeant an honourable gentleman you have ever proved yourself to me and i will bear testimony that you did the poor old gentleman no hurt but nobles will have it their own way and pay little heed to a poor soldier  what do you mean friend  why you see sir it is unlucky that you two happened to be alone with m le chevalier no one can tell what may be said when they seek an occasion against a person  to the brothers however this suggestion sounded so horrible and unnatural that they threw it from them they applied themselves at every moment possible to enlarging osbert hole and seeking an outlet from the dungeon but this they had not been able to discover and it was necessary to be constantly on their guard in visiting the vaults lest their absence from their apartment should be detected they believed that if narcisse arrived at the castle they should find in him a far less gentle jailer than the poor old man for whose state their kindly young hearts could not but grieve  they heard that he had recovered consciousness enough to have made a sort of confession and pere bonami brought them his formal request as a dying man for their pardon for all the injuries he had done them but his speech was too much affected for any specification of what these were the first thing they heard in early morning was that in the course of the night he had breathed his last and all day the bells of all the churches round were answering one another with the slow swinging melancholy notes of the knell  in the early twilight pere bonami brought a message that madame de selinville requested m le baron to come and speak with her and he was accordingly conducted with the gendarme behind him to a small chamber opening into the hallthe same where the incantations of the italian pedlar had been played off before philip and diane the gendarme remained outside the door by which they entered the little dark room only lighted by one little lamp  here daughter said the priest is your cousin he can answer the question you have so much at heart and with these words pere bonami passed beneath the black curtain that covered the entrance into the hall admitting as he raised it for a moment a floor of pure light from the wax tapers and allowing the cadence of the chanting of the priests to fall on the ear at first berenger was scarcely able to discern the pale face that looked as if tears were all dried up and even before his eyes had clearly perceived her in the gloom she was standing before him with clasped hands demanding in a hoarse breathless whisper had he said anything to you  anything no cousin said berenger in a kind tone he had seemed suffering and oppressed all dinnertime and when the servants left us he murmured a few confused words then sank  ah ah he spoke it not thank heaven ah it is a load gone then neither will i speak it sighed diane half aloud ah cousin he loved you  he often was kind to us said berenger impelled to speak as tenderly as he could of the enemy who had certainly tortured him but as if he loved him  he bade us save you said diane her eyes shining with strange wild light in the gloom he laid it on my aunt and me to save you you must let us it must be done before my brother comes she added in hurried accents the messengers are gone he may be here any moment he must find you in the chapelasas my betrothed  and you sent for me here to tempt meclose to such a chamber as that demanded berenger his gentleness becoming sternness as much with his own worse self as with her  listen ah it is the only way listen cousin do you know what killed my father it was my brothers letter saying things must be brought to an end either you must be given up to the king or worseworse and now without him to stand between you and my brother you are lost oh take pity on his poor soul that has left his body and bring not you blood on his head  nay said berenger if he repented the after consequences to me will have no effect on him now  have pity then on yourselfon your brother  i have said berenger he had rather die with me than see me a traitor  and least of all she exclaimed with choking grief have you compassion on meon me who have lost the only one who felt for meon me who have loved you with every fibre of my hearton me who have lived on the music of your hardest coldest wordon me who would lay my life my honour in the dust for one grateful glance from youand whom you condemn to the anguish ofyour death aye and for what for the mere shadow of a little girl who had no force to love you or whom you know nothingnothing oh are you a crystal rock or are you a man see i kneel to you to save yourself and me  there were hot tears dropping from berengers eyes as he caught dianes hand and held it forcibly to prevent her thus abasing herself her wild words and gestures thrilled him in every pulse and wrung his heart and it was with a stifled agitated voice that he said  god help you and me both diane to do what you ask wouldwould be no saving of either nay if you will kneel as she struggled with him let it be to him who alone can bring us through and releasing her hand he dropped on his knees by her side and covered his face with his hands in an earnest supplication that the spirit of resistance which he almost felt slipping from him might be renewed the action hushed and silenced her and as he rose he spoke no other word but silently drew back so much of the curtain that he could see into the hall where the dead man still lay uncoffined upon the bed where his own hands had laid him and the low sweet requiem of kneeling priests floated round him rest rest and calm they breathed into one sorely tried living soul and the perturbed heart was quelled by the sense how short the passage was to the world where captivity and longing would be ended he beckoned to pere bonami to return to diane and then protected by his presence from any further demonstrations kissed her hand and left her  he told philip as little as possible of this interview but his brother remarked how much time he spent over the psalms that evening  the next day the brothers saw from their upper winder the arrival of narcisse or as he had called himself for the last three years the marquis de niddemerle with many attendant gentlemen and a band of fifty or sixty gendarmes the court was filled with their horses and rang with their calls for refreshment and the captives judged it wise to remain in their upper room incase they should be called for  they were proved to have been wise in so doing for about an hour after their arrival there was a great clanging of steel boots and narcisse de ribaumont followed by a portly heavilyarmed gentleman wearing a scarf of office by two of the servants and by two gendarmes entered the room it was the first time the cousins had met since le baiser deutacie had been hissed into berengers ear narcisse looked older sallower and more worn than at that time and philip seeing his enemy for the first time contrasted him with the stately presence of berenger and felt as if a rat were strangling a noble steed  each young man punctiliously removed his hat and niddemerle without deigning further salutation addressed his companion sir you are here on the part of the king and to you i deliver up these prisoners who having been detained here on a charge of carrying on a treasonable correspondence and protected by my father out of consideration for the family have requited his goodness by an attempt to strangle him which has caused his death  philip actually made a leap of indignation berenger better prepared said to the officer sir i am happy to be placed in charged of a kings servant who will no doubt see justice done and shelter us from the private malice that could alone devise so monstrous an accusation we are ready to clear ourselves upon oath over the corpse and all the household and our own guards can bear witness  the witnesses are here said narcisse pointing to the servants illlooking men who immediately began to depose to having found their master purplefaced and struggling in the hands of the two young men who had been left alone with him after dinner  berenger felt that there was little use in selfdefence it was a fabrication the more easily to secure his cousins purpose of destroying him and his best hope lay in passing into the hands of persons who were less directly interested in his ruin he drew himself up to his full height saying if there be justice in france our innocence will be proved i demand sir that you examine the abbess the priest the steward the sergeant of gendarmes they are impartial witnesses and will serve the kings justice if justice be his purpose or if this be but m de niddemerles way of completing the work he left unfinished four years ago i am ready only let my brother go free he is heir to nothing here  enough sir words against the kings justice will be reckoned against you said the officer i shall do myself the honour of attending the funeral the day after tomorrow and then i shall convey you to tours to answer for this deed at your leisure monsieur le marquis are the prisoners secure here or would you have them garde a vue  no need for that said narcisse lightly had there been any exit they would have found it long ago your good fellows outside the door keep them safe enough m le baron de ribaumont i have the honour to wish you a good morning  berenger returned his bow with one full of defiance and the door was again locked upon the prisoners while philip exclaimed the cowardly villain berry is it a hanging matter  not for noble blood said berenger we are more likely to be brought to no trial but to lie prisoners for life then as philip grew white and shivered with a sick horror he added bravely but they shall not have us philip we know the vaults well enough to play at hide and seek with them there and even if we find no egress we may hold out till they think us fled and leave open the doors  philips face lighted up again and they did their best by way of preparation collecting wood for torches and putting aside food at their meals it was a very forlorn hope but the occupation it caused was effectual in keeping up philips spirits and saving him from despondency     chapter xxxix the pedlars prediction         but if neer so close you wall him         do the best that you may      blind love if so you call him         will find out his way                       old song   too late muttered berenger to himself as he stood by the fire in his prisonchamber humfrey and philip were busy in the vaults and he was taking his turn in waiting in the sittingroom to disarm suspicion it is too late now and i thank god that so it is  do you indeed m le baron said a low voice close beside him and as he turned in haste he beheld at the foot of the turretstair the youth aime de selinville holding a dark lantern in his hand and veiling its light  ha and he started to his feet whence come you  from my lady was the youths answer she has sent me to ask whether you persist in what you replied to her the other day for if not she bids me say that it is not too late  and if i do persevere  thenah what do i know who can tell how far malice can go and there are towers and bastilles where hope never enters moreover your researches underground are known  sir said berenger the heartsinking quelled by the effort of resistance madame de selinville has my answeri must take the consequences tell her if she truly wishes me well the honourable way of saving us would be to let our english friends know what has befallen us  you forget m le baron even if she could proclaim the dishonour of her family interference from a foreign power might only lead to a surer mode of removing you said aime lowering his voice and shuddering  even so i should thank her then would the bitterest pang be taken away those at our home would not deem us faithless recreants  thank her murmured the lad in an inward voice very well sir i will carry her your decision it is your final one disgrace prison deathrather than freedom love wealth  the semblance of dishonour rather than the reality said berenger firmly  the lightfooted page disappeared and in a few moments a very different tread came up from below and philip appeared  what is it berry methought i heard a voice  forgive me brother said berenger holding out his hand i have thrown away another offer  tush the thing to pardon would be having accepted one i only wish they would leave us in peace what was it this time  a messenger through young selinville strange to trust her secrets to that lad but hush here he is again much sooner than i thought what sir have you been with your lady again  yes sir the young said with a trembling voice and berenger saw that his eyes were red with weeping she bids me tell you that she yields she will save you eve while you have and despite her there is only one thing  and what is that  you must encumber yourself with the poor aime you must let me serve you instead of her listen sir it cannot be otherwise then with a brisker more eager voice he continued monsieur knows that the family burialplace is bellaise well tomorrow at ten oclock all the household all the neighbourhood will come and sprinkle holy water on the bier the first requiem will be sung and then will all repair to the convent there will be the funeral mass the banquet the dole every creature in the castlenay in all the neighbourhood for twenty miles roundwill be at the convent for the abbess has given out that the alms are to be double and the bread of wheat not a soul will remain here save the two gendarmes on guard at that door and the poor aime whom no one will miss even if any person could be distinguished in their black cloaks madame la comtesse has given him this key which opens a door on the upper floor of the keep unknown to the guards who for that matter shall have a good tankard of spiced wine to console and occupy them then is the way clear to the castle court which is not over looked by their window the horses are in the stables and we are offthat is if m le baron will save a poor youth from the wrath of m de niddemerle  you are and honest fellow cried philip shaking him vehemently by the hand you shall go with us to england and we will make a brave man of you  we shall owe you our lives said berenger warmly and be ever bound to you tell your lady that this is magnanimity that now i truly thank her as our preserver and shall bless her all the days of the life she gives us but my servants  guibert is a traitor said aime he has been so ever since you were at paris breathe no word to him but he as a catholic shall be invited to the funeral your stout englishman should by all means be with us  my norman also added berengermy dear fosterbrother who has languished in the dungeon for three years and when the explanation had been made aime assented though halfunwillingly to the necessity and presently quitted them to bear back their answer to his lady philip shook his hand violently again patted him on the back so as almost to take away his breath and bade him never fear they would be sworn brothers to him for ever and then threw up his hat into the air and was so near astonishing the donjon walls with a british hurrah that berenger had to put his hand over his mouth and strangle the shout in his very throat  the chief of that night was spent in enlarging the hole in osberts wall so as to admit of his creeping through it and they also prepared their small baggage for departure their stock of money though some had been spent on renewing their clothes and some in needful gratuities to the servants and gendarmes was sufficient for present needs and they intended to wear their ordinary dress they were unlikely to meet any of the peasants in the neighbourhood and indeed berenger had so constantly ridden out in his black mask that its absence now that his scars were gone was as complete a change as could be effected in one whose height was of unusual  there begins the kneel said philip standing at the window its our joybell berry every clang seems to me to say home home home  for you phil said berenger but i must be satisfied of eutacies fate first i shall go first to nissardwhither we were bound when we were seizedthen to la rochelle whence you may  no more of that burst out philip what would you have me leave you now after all we have gone through together not that you will find her i dont want to vex you brother on such a day as this but you conjurers words are coming true in the other matter  how what mean you phil  whats the meaning of aime asked philip even i am french scholar enough for that and who sends him  meantime the court was already filling with swarms of persons of every rank and degree but several anxious hours had passed before the procession was marshaled and friars and monks black white and graypriests in rich robes and tall capsblackcloaked gentlemen and menatarmsall bearing huge wax tapersand peasants and beggars of every conceivable aspectfiled out of the court bearing with them the richlyemblazoned bier of the noble and puissant knight the beausire charles eutache de ribaumont niddemerle his son walking behind in a long black mantle and all who counted kindred of friendship following two and two then all the servants every one who properly belonged to the castle were counted out by the brothers from their windows and guibert among them  messieurs a low anxious voice sounded in the room  we will only fetch osbert  it was a terrible only as precious moments slipped away before there appeared in the lower chamber berenger and humfrey dragging between them a squalid wretch with a skin like stained parchment over a skeleton tangled hair and beard staring bewildered eyes and fragments of garments all dust dirt and rags  leave me leave me dear master said the object stretching his whole person towards the fire as they let him sink down before it you would but ruin yourself  it is madness to take him said aime impatiently  i go not without him said berenger give me the soup philip  some soup and wine had been placed by the fire and likewise a shirt and a suit of humfreys clothes were spread before it aime burst out into the yard absolutely weeping with impatience when unheeding all his remonstrances his three companions applied themselves to feeding rubbing and warming osbert and assuring him that the pains in his limbs would pass away with warmth and exercise he had been valiant of heart in his dungeon but his sudden plunge into upper air was like rising from the grave and brought on all the effects of his dreary captivity of which he had hardly been sensible when he had first listened to the voice of hope  dazzled crippled helpless it seemed almost impossible that he should share the flight but berenger remained resolute and when aime returned from his fourth frantic promenade he was told that all was ready  but for the strength of berenger and humfrey the poor fellow could never have been carried up and up nearly to the top of the keep then along a narrow gallery then down again even to the castle hall now empty though with the candlesticks still around where the bier had been aime knelt for a moment where the head had been hiding his face osbert rested in a chair and philip looked wistfully up at his own sword hung over the chimney  resume your swords messieurs said aime observing him madame desires it and take pistols also  they gladly obeyed and when after this short delay they proceeded osbert moved somewhat less painfully but when they arrived at the stable only four horses stood there  ah this miserable cried aime passionately he ruins all my arrangements  leave me again entreated landry once outside i can act the beggar and cripple and get back to normandy  better leave me said humfrey they cannot keep me when you are out of their clutches  help me humfrey said berenger beginning to lift his fosterbrother to the saddle but there the poor man wavered cried out that his head swam and he could not keep his seat entreating almost in agony to be taken down  lean on me said berenger putting his arms round him there you will be able to get to the grange du temple where you will be in safe shelter  sir sir cried aime ready to tear his hair this is ruin my lady meant you to make all speed to la rochelle and there embark and this is the contrary way  that cannot be helped said berenger it is the only safe place for my fosterbrother  aime with childish petulance muttered something about ingratitude in crossing his ladys plans but as no one attended to him he proceeded to unfasten his horse and then exclaimed half crying will no one help me  not able to saddle a horse a pretty fellow for a cavalier exclaimed philip assisting however and in a few minutes they were all issuing from a low side gate and looking back with bounding hearts at the drooping banner on the keep of niddemerle  only young aime went with bowed head and drooping look as though pouting and berenger putting osberts bridle into humfreys hand stepped up to him saying hark you m de selinville i am sorry if we seemed to neglect you we owe you and your lady all gratitude but i must be the judge of my own duty and you can only be with me if you conform  the young seemed to be devouring his tears but only said i was vexed to see my ladys plan marred and your chance thrown away  of that i must judge said berenger  they were in a bylane perfectly solitary the whole country was at the funeral through the frosty air there came an occasional hum or murmur from berenger or the tinkle of a cowbell in the fields but no human being was visible it was certain however that the rotrous being huguenots and no vassals of niddemerle would not be at the obsequies and berenger walking with swift strides supporting osbert on his horse continued to cheer him with promises of rest and relief there and listened to no entreaties from philip or humfrey to take one of their horses had not osbert borne him on his shoulders through the butchery at paris and endured three years of dungeon for his sake  as for philip the slow pace of their ride was all insufficient for his glee he made his horse caracole at every level space till berenger reminded him that they might have far to ride that night and even then he was constantly breaking into attempts at shouting and whistling as often repressed and springing up in his stirrups to look over the high hedges  the grange was so well concealed in its wooded ravine that only when close upon the gate the party became aware that this farmyard usually so solitary formed an exception to the general desertion of the country there was a jingle and a stamp of horses in the court which could hardly be daylight echoes of the templars berenger feared that the guisards might have descended rotrou and was stepping forward to reconnoiter while young de selinville trembling besought him not to run into danger but to turn and hasten to la rochelle by this time however the party had been espied by two soldiers stationed at the gate but not before berenger had had time to remark that they did not wear either the gold fleurdelys like his late guards or the white cross of lorraine nor had they the strange air of gay ferocity usual with the kings mercenaries and almost by instincts at a venture he made the old huguenot sign he had learnt form his father and answered for god and the religion  the countersign was returned bearn and bourbon is the word today comrade replied the sentinel eh quoi have you had an encounter that you bring a wounded man  not wounded but nearly dead in a guisard prison said berenger with an unspeakable sense of relief and security as the sentries admitted them into the large walled court where horses were eating hay being watered and rubbed down soldiers snatching a hasty meal in corners gentlemen in clanking breastplates coming in and out of the house evidently taking orders from a young man in a gray and silver suit whose brown eagle face thin cheeks arched nose and black eyes of keenest fire struck berenger at once with a sense of recognition as well as of being under a glance that seemed to search out everybody and everything at once  more friends and the tone again recalled a flood of recollections i thank and welcome you what you have met the enemywhere is he  my servant is not wounded sire said berenger removing his hat and bending low this is the effect of long captivity we have but just escaped  then we are the same case pardon me sir i have seen you before but for once i am at fault  when i call myself de ribaumont your grace will not wonder  the dead alive if i mistake not it was in the inferno itself that we last met but we have broken through the gates at last i remember poor king charles was delighted to hear that you lived but where have you been a captive  at niddemerle sire my kinsmen accused me of treason in order to hinder my search for my wife we escaped even now during the funeral of the chevalier  by favour of which we are making our way to parthenay unsuspected though by my faith we gather so like a snowball that we could be a match for a few hundreds of guisards who is with you m de ribaumont  let me present to your majesty my english brother philip thistlewood said berenger drawing the lad forward making due obeisance though entirely ignorant who was the plainlydressed travelsoiled stranger so evidently a born lord of men  an englishman is ever welcome was his gracious reception  and added berenger let me also present the young de selinville to whom i owe my escape where is he philip  he seemed to be busy with the horses and berenger could not catch his eye  selinville i thought that good huguenot house was extinct  this is a relation of the late count de selinville my cousins husband sire he arranged my evasion and would be in danger at niddemerle call him philip  before this was done however the kings attention was otherwise claimed and turning to one of his gentlemen he said here daugigne i present to you an acquaintance made in tartarus see to his entertainment ere we start for parthenay  agrippa daubigne still young but grave and seriouslooking greeted m de ribaumont as men meet in hours when common interests make rapid friendships and from him berenger learnt in a few words that the king of navarres eyes had been opened at last to the treachery of the court and his own dishonourable bondage during a feverish attack one night when daubigne and darmagnac were sitting up with him his resolution was taken and on the first hunting day after his recovery he with these two the baron de rosny and about thirty more of his suite had galloped away and had joined the monsieur and the prince of conde at alencon he had abjured the catholic faith declared that nothing except ropes should bring him back to paris and that he left there the mass and his wifethe first he could dispense with the last he meant to have and he was now on his way to parthenay to meet his sister whom he had sent rosny to demand by the time berenger had heard this he had succeeded in finding honest rotrou who was in a state of great triumph and readily undertook to give osbert shelter and as soon as he should have recovered to send him to headquarters with some young men who he knew would take the field as soon as they learnt that the king of navarre had set up his standard even the inroads made into the good farmers stores did not abate his satisfaction in entertaining the prime hope of the huguenot cause but berenger advanced as large a sum as he durst out of his purse under pretext of the maintenance of osbert during his stay at the grange he examined rotrou upon his subsequent knowledge of isaac gardon and eutacie but nothing had been heard of them since their departure now nearly three years back except a dim rumour that they had been seen at the synod of montauban  well my friend said philip when about to remount this will do rather better than a headlong gallop to rochelle with niddemerle at our heels  if m le baron is safe it is well said aime shortly  is selinville there said berenger coming up here let me take you to the king of navarre he knew your family in lauguedoc  no no petulantly returned the boy what am i that he should notice me it is m de ribaumont whom i follow not him or his cause  boy said berenger dismayed remember i have answered for you  i am no traitor proudly answered the strange boy and berenger was forced to be thus satisfied though intending to watch him closely     chapter xl the sands of olonne        is it the dew of night     that on her glowing cheek     shines in the moonbeam     oh she weeps she weeps     and the good angel that abandoned her     at her hell baptism by her tears drawn down     resumes his charge and the hope          of pardon and salvation rose          as now she understood          thy lying prophecy of truthsouthey   m de ribaumont said henry of navarre as he stood before the fire after supper at parthenay i have been thinking what commission i could give you proportioned to your rank and influence  thanks to your grace that inquiry is soon answered i am a beggar here even my paternal estate in normandy is in the hands of my cousin  you have wrongs said henry and wrongs are sometimes better than possessions in a party like ours  berenger seized the opening to explain his position and mention that his only present desire was for permission in the first place to send a letter to england by the messenger whom the king was dispatching to elisabeth in tolerable security of her secret countenance and secondly to ride to nissard to examine into the story he had previously heeded so little of the old man and his daughter rescued from the waves the day before la sablerie was taken  if pluto relented my dear orpheus surely navarre may said henry goodhumouredly only may the priest not be more adamantine than minos where lies nissard on the sable dolonne then you may go thither with safety while we lie here and i shall wait for my sister or for news of her  so berenger arranged for an early start on the morrow and young selinville listened with a frown and strange look in his dark eyes you go not to england he said  not yet said berenger  this was not what my lady expected he muttered but though berenger silenced him by a stern look he took the first opportunity of asking philip if it would not be far wiser for his brother to place himself in safety in england  wiser but less honest said philip  he who has lost all here who has incurred his grandfathers anger pursued aime were he not wiser to make his peace with his friends in england  his friends in england would not like him the better for deserting his poor wifes cause said philip i advise you to hold your tongue and not meddle or make  aime subsided and philip detected something like tears he had still much of rude english boyhood about him and he laughed roughly a fine fellow to weep at a word hie thee back to feed my ladys lapdog tis all thou art fit for  there spoke english gratitude said aime with a toss of the head and flash of the eye  philip despised him the more for casting up his obligations but had no retort to make he had an idea of making a man of young selinville and his notion of the process had something of the bullying tendency of english young towards the poorspirited or cowardly he ordered the boy roughly teased him for his ignorance of manly exercises tried to cure his helplessness by increasing his difficulties and viewed his fatigue as affectation or effeminacy berenger interfered now and then to guard the poor boy from a horsejest or practical joke but he too felt that aime was a great incumbrance hopelessly cowardly fanciful and petulant and he was sometimes driven to speak to him with severity verging on contempt in hopes of rousing a sense of shame  the timidity so unusual and inexplicable in a youth of eighteen or twenty sowed itself irrepressibly at the sands of olonne these were not misty as on berengers former journey nissard steeple was soon in sight and the guide who joined them on a rough pony had no doubt that there would be ample time to cross before high water there was however some delay for the winter rains had brought down a good many streams of fresh water and the sands were heavy and wet so that their horses proceeded slowly and the rush and dash of the waves proclaimed that the low of the tide had begun to the two brothers the break and sweep was a homesound speaking of freshness and freedom and the salt breeze and spray carried with them life and ecstasy philip kept as near the incoming waves as his inlandbred horse would endure and sang shouted and hallooed to them as welcome as english waves but aime de selinville had never even beheld the sea before and even when the tide was still in the distance was filled with nervous terror as each rushing fall sounded nearer and when the line of white foamy crests became more plainly visible he was impelled to hurry on towards the steeple so fast that the guide shouted to him that he would only bury himself in a quicksand  but said he white with alarm and his teeth chattering how can we creep with those dreadful waves advancing upon us to drown us  berenger silence philips rude laugh and was beginning to explain that the speed of the waves could always be calculated by an experienced inhabitant and his voice had seemed to pacify aime a little when the spreading water in front of a broken wave flowing up to his horses feet again rendered him nearly frantic let us go back he wildly entreated turning his horse but berenger caught his bridle saying that would be truly death boy unless you would be scorned restrain your folly nothing else imperils us  here however the guide interposed saying that it had become too late to pursue their course along the curve of the shore but they must at once cut straight across which he had intended to avoid because of the greater depth of a small river that they would have to cross which divided further out into small channels more easily forded they thus went along the chord of the arc formed by the shore and aime was somewhat reassured as the sea was at first farther off but before long they reached the stream which lost itself in many little channels in the sands so that when the tide was out there was a perfect network of little streams dividing low shingly or grassy isles but at nearly high tide as at present many of these islets were submerged and the strife between river and sea caused sudden deepenings of the water in the channels  the guide eagerly explained that the safest place for crossing was not by the large sandbank furthest inland and looking firm and promisingit was a recent shifting performance of the waters heaping up and would certainly sink away and bury horse the channels on either side had shingly bottoms and were safe  this way called berenger himself setting the example and finding no difficulty the water did not rise above his boots and the current was not strong he had reached the shingly isle when he looked round for his companions humfrey and philip were close behind him but in spite of the loud gare of the guide aime or his horsefor each was equally senseless with alarmwere making inwards the horse was trying to tread on the sandbank which gave way like the water itself under its frantic strugglesthere was a loud crya shrill unmistakable womans shriekthe horse was sinkinga white face and helpless form were being carried out on the waves but not before berenger had flung himself from his horse thrown off his cloak and sword and dashed into the water and in the lapse of a few moments he struggled back to the island where were philip and humfrey legdeep in water the one received his burthen the other helped him to land  on gentlemen not a moment to lose cried the guide and berenger still panting flung himself on his horse held out his arms gathered the small almost inanimate figure upon the horses neck before him and in a few minutes more they had crossed the perilous passage and were on a higher bank where they could safely halt and philip as he came to help his brother exclaimed what a fool the boy is  hush said berenger gravely as they laid the figure on the ground  what he cant have been drowned in that moment well bring him to  hands off said berenger kneeling over the gasping form and adding in a lower voice dont you see he would his hand in the long drenched hair and held it up with cheeks burning like fire and his scar purple  a womanwhatwho then suddenly divining he exclaimed the jade and started with wide eyes  stand back said berenger she is coming to herself  perhaps she had been more herself than he knew for as he supported her head her hand stole over his and held it fast full of consternation perplexity and anger as he was he could not but feel a softening pity towards a creature so devoted so entirely at his mercy at the moment when she lay helpless against him gasps heaving her breast under her manly doublet her damp hair spread on his knees her dark eyes in their languor raised imploring his face her cold hand grasping his he felt as if this great love were a reality and as if he were hunting a shadow and as if fate would have it so he must save and gratify one whose affection must conquer his who was so tender so beautifuleven native generosity seemed on her side but in the midst as in his perplexity he looked up over the gray sea he seemed to see the picture so often present to his mind of the pale resolute girl clasping her babe to her breast fearless of the advancing sea because true and faithful and at that thought faith and prayer rallied once again round his heart shame at the instants wavering again dyed his cheek he recalled himself and speaking the more coldly and gravely because his heart was beating over hotly he said cousin you are better it is but a little way to nissard  why have you saved me if you will not pity me she murmured  i will not pity because i respect my kinswoman who has save our lives he said steadying his voice with difficulty the priests of nissard will aid me in sparing your name and fame  ah she cried sitting up with a start of joy but he would make too many inquiries take me to england first  berenger started as he saw how he had been misunderstood  neither here nor in england could my marriage be set aside cousin no not priest shall take charge of you and place you in safety and honour  he shall not she cried hotly whywhy will you drive me from youme who ask only to follow you as a menial servant  that has become impossible he answered to say nothing of my brother my servant and the guide have seen and as she remembered her streaming hair and tried in dawning confusion to gather it together he continued you shrank from the eye of the king of navarre you cannot continue as you have done you have not even strength  ah have you sailed for england she murmured  it had only been greater shame he said cousin i am head of your family husband of your kinswoman and bound to respect the reputation you have risked for me i shall therefore place you in charge of the priest till you can either return to your aunt or to some other convent you can ride now we will not wait longer in these wet garments  he raised her from the ground threw his own dry cloak round her shoulders and unmanageable hair and lifted her on his horse but as she would have leant against him he drew himself away beckoned philip and put the bridle into his hands saying take care of her i shall ride on and warm the priest  the rock of diamond she murmured not aware that the diamond had been almost melting that youthful gravity and resolution with the mixture of respect and protection imposed as usual upon her passionate nature and daunted her into meekly riding beside philip without a wordonly now and then he heard a low moan and knew that she was weeping bitterly  at first the lad had been shocked beyond measure and would have held aloof as from a kind of monster but madame de selinville had been the first woman to touch his fancy and when he heard how piteously she was weeping and recollected where he should have been but for her as well as all his own harshness to her as a cowardly boy he felt himself brutally ungrateful and spoke dont weep so madame i am sorry i was rude to you but you see how should i take you for a woman  perhaps she heard but she heeded not  my brother will take good care to shield you philip added he will take care you are safe in one of your nunneries and as she only wept the more he added with a sudden thought you would not go there you would embrace the protestant faith  i would embrace whatever was his  philip muttered something about seeing what could be done they were already at the entrance of the village and berenger had come out to meet them and springing towards him philip exclaimed in a low voice berry she would abjure her popish errors you cant give her up to a priest  foolery philip answered berenger sternly  if she would be a convert  let her be a modest woman first and berenger taking her bridle led her to the priests house  he found that pere colombeau was preaching a lent sermon and that nobody was at home but the housekeeper to whom he had explained briefly that the lady with him had been forced to escape in disguise had been nearly drowned and was in need of refreshment and female clothing jacinthe did not like the sound but drenched clothes were such a passport to her masters house that she durst not refuse berenger carried off his other companions to the cabaret and when he had dried himself went to wait for the priest at the church door sitting in the porch where more than one echo of the exhortation to repentance and purity rang in his ears and enforced his conviction that here he must be cruel if he would be merciful  it was long before pere colombeau came out and then if the scar had not blushed for all the rest of his face the sickly lanky lad of three years since would hardly have been recognized to the good cure but the priests aspect was less benignant when berenger tried to set before him his predicament he coldly asked where the unhappy lady was and when berenger expressed his intention of coming the next morning to ask his counsel he only bowed he did not ask the brothers to supper nor show any civility and berenger as he walked back to the cabaret perceived that his story was but half believed and that if dianes passion were still stronger than her truth or generosity she would be able to make out a terrible case against him and to willing ears naturally disposed against a young cavalier and a heretic  he sat much dispirited by the fire of the little wine shop thinking that his forbearance had been wellnigh thrown away and that his character would never be cleared in eustacies eyes attaching indeed more importance to the blot than would have been done by a youth less carefully reared  it was quite dark when a knock came to the door the cures white head appeared in the lamplight he nodded kindly to all the guests and entreated that m de ribaumont would do him a favour to come and speak with him  no sooner were they outside the house than the cure held out his hand saying sir forgive me for a grievous injustice towards you then pressing his hand he added with a voice tremulous with emotion sir it is no slight thing to have saved a wandering sheep by your uprightness and loyalty  have you then opened her eyes father said berenger relieved from a heavy load  you have my son said the old man you have taught her what truth and virtue are for the rest you shall heard for yourself  before berenger knew where he was a door was opened and he found himself in the church the building was almost entirely dark there were two tall lights at the altar in distance and a few little slender tapers burning before certain niches and shrines but without power to conquer with the gloom more than enough to spread a pale circle of yellow light beneath them and to show mysteriously a bit of vaulting above a single lamp hung from an arch near the door and beneath it near a pillar knelt or rather crouched on the floor a female figure with a dark peasant cloak drawn over her head  the first token of penitence is reparation to the injured said the priest  berenger looked at him anxiously  i will not leave you he added see i shall pray for you yonder by the altar and he slowly moved up the aisle  rise cousin i entreat you said berenger much embarrassed as he disappeared in the darkness  i must speak thus she answered in a hoarse exhausted voice ah pardon pardon she added rising however so far as to raise clasped hands and an imploring face ah can you pardon it was through me that you bear those wounds that sheeustaciewas forced into the masque to detain you for that night ah pardon  that is long past said berenger i have been too near death not to have pardoned that long ago rise cousin i cannot see you thus  that is not all continued diane it was ii who moved my father to imprison you then as he bent his head and would have again entreated her to rise she held out her hand as if to silence him and spoke faster more wildly thenthen i thought it would save your life i thought she looked at him strangely with her great dark eyes all hollow and cavernous in her white face  i know said berenger kindly you often urged it on me  there was a sort of movement on the part of the kneeling figure of the priest at the altar and she interrupted saying precipitately thenthen i did think you free  ah he gasped now  now i know that she lives and diane once more sank at his feet a trembling shrinking annihilated heap of shame and misery  berenger absolutely gave a cry that though instantly repressed had the ring of ecstasy in it cousincousin he cried all is forgivenall forgotten if you will only tell me where  that i cannot said diane rousing herself again but speaking in a dull indifferent tone as of one to whom the prime bitterness was past save that she is under the care of the duchess de quinet and she then proceeded as though repeating a lesson you remember the italian conjurer whom you would not consult would that i had not she added clasping her hands his prediction lured me well he saw my father privately told him he had seen her and had bought her jewels even her hair my father sent him in quest of her again but told not me till the man returned with tidings that she was at quinet in favour with the duchess you remember that he went from home it was to demand he and ah you know how long i had loved you and they told me that your marriage was void and that all would be well upon the dispensation coming and now the good father there tells me that i was deceivedcruelly deceivedthat such a dispensation would not be granted save through gross misrepresentation then as berenger began to show tokens of eagerness to come at tidings of eustacie she continued ah it is vain to seek to excuse one you care not for my father could learn nothing from the duchess she avowed that she had been there but would say no more however he and my brother were sure she was under their protection they took measures andand the morning my poor father was stricken there had been a letter from my brother to say he was on her track and matters must be ended with you for he should have her in a week and then as berenger started forward with an inarticulate outburst half of horror half of interrogation she added where he said not nor did i learn from him all our one interview was spend in sneers that answered to my wild entreaties but this i knowthat you would never have reached tours a living man  and now now he is on the way to her cried berenger and you kept it from me  there lay my hope said diane raising her head and now with glittering eyes and altered voice how could i not but hate her who had bereaved me of you her for whose sake i could not earn your love  the change of her tone had perhaps warned the priest to draw nearer and as she perceived him she said yes father this is not the way to absolution but my heart will burst if i say not all  thou shalt not prevail foul spirit said the priest looking earnestly into the darkness as though he beheld the fiend hovering over her neither shall these holy walls be defiled with accents of unhallowed love you have made your reparation daughter it is enough  and can you tell me no more said berenger sadly can you give me no clue that i may save her from the wolf that may be already on her track cousin if you would do this i would bless you for ever  alas i would if i could it is true cousin i have no heart to deceive you any longer but it is to madame de quinet that you must apply and if my brother has though me worth pursuit you may be in time one momentas he would have sprung away as if in the impulse to fly to the rescuecousin had you gone to england as i hoped i would have striven to deserve to win that love of yours but you have conquered by your constancy now father i have spoken my last save as penitent  she covered her head and sank down again  berenger bewildered and impelled to be doing something let the priest lead him out before he exclaimed i said nothing to her of pardon  you do pardon said the priest  he paused a moment freely if i find my wife i can only remember now that she set me on the way i would ease her soul poor thing and thinking would make me hard again  do the english bring up their sons with such feelings asked the cure pausing for a moment  of course said berenger may i say that one word sir  not now said the priest she had better be left to think of her sin towards heaven rather than towards man  but do you leave her there sir  i shall return i shall pray for her true penitence said the priest and berenger perceived from his tone that one without the pale might inquire no further he only asked how safe and honourable shelter could be found for her and the cure replied that he had already spoken to her of the convent of lucon and should take her there so soon as it could safely be done and that abbess monique he trusted would assist her crushed spirit in finding the path of penitence he thought her cousin had better not endeavour to see her again and berenger himself was ready to forget her very existence in his burning anxiety to outstrip narcisse in the quest of eustacie     chapter xli our lady of hope             welcome to dangers hour      brief greeting serves the time of strife                                   scott   as soon as it was possible to leave nissard berenger was on his way back to headquarters where he hoped to meet the duke de quinet among the many huguenot gentlemen who were flocking to the bourbon standard nor was he disappointed in the hope for he was presented to a handsome middleaged gentleman who told him with much politeness that his mother had had the honour to receive and entertain mme de ribaumont and that some months ago he had himself arranged for the conveyance of her letters to england but he said with a smile he made a point of knowing nothing of his mothers guests lest his duties as a governor might clash with those of hospitality he offered to expedite m de ribaumonts journey to quinet observing that if nid de merle were indeed on the point of seizing the lady it must be by treachery indeed he had not ten days back had the satisfaction of hanging an italian mountebank who had last year stolen a whole packet of dispatches among them letters from mme de ribaumont and the fellow was probably acting as a spy upon her so that no time was to be lost in learning from his mother where she was on the next morning he was about to send forward twenty men to reinforce a little frontier garrison on the river dronne and as m le baron must pass through the place it would be conferring a favour on him to take the command the men were all well mounted and would not delay and when once across the frontier of guyenne no escort would be needed  berenger gladly accepted the proposal it did not occur to him that he was thus involved in the civil war and bearing arms against the sovereign in spite of queen elisabeths alliance with the french court she connived at her youthful subjects seeking the bubble reputation in the mouths of valois cannon and so little did henry iii seem to berenger to be his king that he never thought of the question of allegiancenay if the royal officers were truly concerned in his arrest he was already an outlaw this was no moment for decision between catholic and calvinist all he wanted was to recover his wife and forestall her enemies  henry of navarre gave his full consent to the detachment being placed under charge of m de ribaumont he asked somewhat significantly what had become of the young gentleman who had attended m de ribaumont and philip blushed crimson to the ears while berenger replied with greater coolness than he had given himself credit for that the youth had been nearly drowned on the sable dolonne and had been left at dom colombeaus to recover the sharpwitted king looked for a moment rather as sir hugh the heron did when marmion accounted for his pages absence but was far too courteous and too insouciant to press the matter further though berenger saw quite enough of is expression to feel that he had been delivered from his companion only just in time  berenger set forth as soon as his impatience could prevail to get the men into their saddles he would fain have ridden day and night and grudged every halt for refreshment so as almost to run the risk of making the men mutinous evening was coming on and his troop had dismounted at a cabaret in front of which he paced up and down with philip trying to devise some pretext for hastening them on another stage before night when a weary travelstained trooper rode up to the door and was at once hailed as a comrade by the other men and asked what cheer at pont de dronne  bad enough he answered unless you can make the more speed there then making obeisance to berenger he continued his report saying that captain falconnet was sending him to m le duc with information that the guisards were astir and that five hundred gens darmes under the black nid de merle as it was said were on their way intending to surprise pont de dronne and thus cut the king of navarre off from guyenne and his kingdom beyond it after this berenger had no more difficulty with his men who were most of them quinet vassals with homes south of the dronne and the messenger only halted for a hasty meal hastening on to the duke that a more considerable succour might at once be dispatched  is she there whom they call the lady of hope asked one of the soldiers a mercenary less interested than most of his comrades as he had only a fortnight since transferred his services from guise to quinet  our lady of sadness just now replied the messenger her old father is at the point of death however she is there and at our last siege twenty wineskins would not so well have kept up mens hearts  and the little one the white fairy is she there too they say tis a spirit a changeling that could not brook the inside of a church but flew out of the moustier at montauban like a white swan in the middle of a sermon  i only know ive seen her sleep like a dormouse through prayers sermon and all at pont de dronne follette is she be she belongs to the white elves of the moonlight  well they say bullets wont touch her and no place can be taken where she is replied the trooper nay that italian pedlar rogue the same that the duke has since hung has sold to long gilles and snubnosed pierre silver bullets wherewith they have sworn to shoot the one or the other next time they had a chance  these words were spoken at not great distance from berenger but passed by him as mere menatarms gossip in his eagerness to expedite the start of his party and in less than an hour they were en route for pont de dronne but hasten as he would it was not till near noon the next day that he came in sight of a valley through which wound a river crossed by a highbacked bridge with a tall pointed arch in the middle and a very small one on either side an old building of red stone looking like what it wasa monastery converted into a fortressstood on the nearer or northern bank and on the belfry tower waved a flag with the arms of quinet higher up the valley there was an ominous hum and clouds of smoke and dust and the gen darmes who knew the country rejoiced that they were come just in time and exchanged anxious questions whether the enemy were not fording the river above them so as to attack not only the fortress on this northern side but the bridge tower on the southern bank of the river  spurring down the hill the party were admitted at the wellguarded gateway into a large thicklywalled yard where the soldiers and horses remained and berenger and philip passing through a small arched doorway into the body of the old monastery were conducted to a great wainscoted hall where a pulpit projecting from the wall and some defaced emblematic ornaments showed that this had once been the refectory though guardroom appliances now occupied it the man who had shown them in left them saying he would acquaint captain falconnet with their arrival and just then a sound of singing drew both brothers to the window it looked out on what had once been the quadrangle bounded on three sides by the church the refectory and the monks lodgings the cloistered arcade running round all these the fourth side was skirted by the river which was however concealed by an embankment raised no doubt to supply the place of the wall which had been unnecessary to the peaceful original inhabitants what attracted berengers eyes was however a group in the cloister consisting of a few drooping figures some of men in steel caps others of veiled shrouded women and strange mingled feelings swept over him as he caught the notes of the psalm sung over the open grave                si quen paix et seurte bonne                coucherai et reposerai                car seigneur ta bonte tout ordonne                et elle seule espoir donne                que seur et sain regnant serai  listen philip he said with moistening eyes then as they ended it is the 4th psalm i lay me down in peace and take my rest eustacie and i used to sing it to my father it was well done in these mourners to sing it over him whom they are laying down to take his rest while the enemy are at the gates see the poor wife still kneels while the rest disperse how dejected and utterly desolate she looks  he was so intently watching her as not to perceive the entrance of a tall grizzled old man in a steel cap evidently the commander of the garrison there was the brief welcome of dangers hourthe briefer because captain falconnet was extremely deaf and taking it for granted that the newcomers were gentlemen of the dukes proceeded to appoint them their posts without further question berenger had intended to pursue his journey to quinet without delay but the intelligence that the enemy were on the southern as well as the northern side of the river rendered this impossible and besides in defending this key of guyenne against narcisse he was also defending eustacie  the state of affairs was soon made known to him the old monastery covering with its walls an extensive space formed a fortress quite strong enough to resist desultory attacks and protect the long bridge which was itself strongly walled on either side and with a barbican at the further end in former assaults the attacks had always been on the north the catholic side as it might be called but now the enemy had crossed the river above the fort and were investing the place on both sides long foreseeing this the old commandant had guarded the bank of the river with the earthwork a long mound sloped irregularly on either hand over which numerous little paths had since been worn by the women within when on their way to the river with their washing but he had been setting every one to work to destroy and fill up these so that the rampart was smooth and slopping perfectly easy indeed to cross but high and broad enough to serve as an effectual protection against such artillery as the detached troops of the guise party were likely to possess and the river was far too wide deep and strong in its main current to be forded in the face of a hostile garrison the captain had about fifty gen darmes in his garrison besides the twenty newcomers whom he persisted in regarding as berengers charge and there were besides some seventy peasants and silk spinners who had come into the place as a refuge from the enemyand with these he hoped to hold put till succour should come from the duke he himself took the command of the north gate where the former assaults had been made and he instructed to his new ally the tower protecting the bridge advising him to put on armour but berenger trying on a steel cap found that his head could not bear the weight and heat and was forced to return to his broadbrimmed spanish hat while philip in high glee armed himself as best he could with what captain falconnet could lend him he was too much excited to eat of the scanty meal that was set before them a real flight seemed like a fairday to him and he was greatly exalted by his brothers post of commanda post that berenger felt a heavy responsibility only thrust upon him by the commandants incapacity of hearing how utterly inexperienced he was  the formal summons to surrender to the king and the refusal had duly passed and it became evident that the first attack was to be on the bridgegate captain falconnet hurried to the place and the fighting was hot and desperate every assailant who tried to throw his fagot into the moat became a mark for arquebus or pistol and the weapons that had so lately hung over the hearth at nid de merle were now aimed again and again at the heads and corslets of guisards with something of the same exulting excitement as only higher more engrossing and fiercer than that with which the lads had taken aim at a wolf or ridden after a fox scalingladders were planted and hurled down again stones were cast from the battlements crushing the enemy and throughout berengers quick eye alert movements and great height and strength made him a most valuable champion often applauded by a low murmur of commendation from old falconnet or a loud shout of ha well done the dukes englishman from the gen darmesfor english they would have him to beon the presumptions afforded by his companions his complexion and his slow speech nor did philip and humfrey fail to render good service but just as the enemy had been foiled in a sharp assault and were dragging away their wounded philip touched his brother and saying i can hold out no longer showed blood trickling down his right side  berenger threw an arm round him and captain falconnet seeing his case said you are hit petit anglais you have done gallantly there will be time for you to take him to his quarters sir these fellows have had enough for the present and you can tarry with him till you hear the bugle whither did you ask let me see you renaud take him to the chapel the old chancel behind the boarding will be more private and desire madame to look to him farewell i hope it may prove slight you are a brave youth and he shook hands with philip whose intense gratification sustained him for many steps afterwards  he hardly remembered receiving the hurt and was at first too busy to heed it or to call off any one attention until a dread of falling and being trodden on had seized him and made him speak and indeed he was so dizzy that berenger with difficulty kept him on his feet over the bridge and in the court lifted him in his arms and carried him almost fainting into the cloister where by the newmade grave still knelt the blackveiled mourner she started to her feet as the soldier spoke to her and seemed at first not to gather the sense of his words but then as if with an effort took them in made one slight sound like a moan of remonstrance at the mention of the place but again recollecting herself led the way along a stone passage into which a flight of stairs descended into the apsidal chancel roughly boarded off from the rest of the church it was a ruinous desolate place and berenger looked round in dismay for some place on which to lay down his almost unconscious burthen the lady bent her head and signed towards the stone sedilia in the wall then after two ineffectual essays to make her voice audible choked as it was with long weeping she said low and huskily we will make him more comfortable soon and added some orders to the soldier who disappeared up the stairway and berenger understood that he was gone to fetch bedding then taking from under her heavy mourning cloak a large pair of scissors she signed to berenger how to support his brother while they relieved him of his corslet swordbelt and doublet the soldier had meantime returned with an old woman both loaded with bedding which she signed to them to arrange in one of the little bays or niches that served to form a crown of lesser chapels around the chancel she flung aside her muffling cloak but her black hood still hung far over her face and every now and then hand or handkerchief was lifted as if to clear her eyes from the tears that would not cease to gather and blind her and she merely spoke when some direction to an assistant some sympathetic word to the patient was needed even philip in his dizzy trance guessed that he was succeeding to the bed whence one much dearer had gone to his quieter rest in the cloister before he was laid there however the bugle sounded there was a loud shout and philip exclaimed go brother  trust him to me sir said the sunken extinguished voice we will do our best for him  he was forced merely to lift philip to the bed and to hurry away while the soldier followed him saying consolingly fear not sir now our lady of hope has him nothing goes ill to which she sets her hand  another growl of artillery was not heard and it was time for the warriors to forget the wounded in the exigencies of the present an attack was made on both gates at once and the commandant being engaged at his own post berenger had to make the utmost of his brief experience backed by the counsel of a tough old sergeant and great was his sense of exhilaration and absolute enjoyment in this full and worthy taxing of every power of mind or body the cry among the enemy aime at the black plume attested his prominence but he black plum was still unscathed when spring twilight fell the din began to subside recalls were sounded by the besiegers and berenger heard his own exploit bawled in the ear of the deaf commandant who was advancing over the bridge the old captain complimented him told him that he should be well reported of to m le duc and sieur la noue and invited him to supper and bed in his own quarters the supper berenger accepted so soon as he should know how it was with his brother but as to bed he intended to watch his brother and visit his post form time to time  the captain entered by the main door of the chapel where ten or twelve wounded were now lying tended by peasant women berenger merely passed through seeing as he went the black hood busy over a freshlybroughtinpatient he found a door which admitted him through the rough screen of boards to the choir where he had been in the earlier part of the day the moonlight came through the shivered eastern windows but a canvas curtain had been hung so as to shelter philips vaulted recess from the cold draught and the bed itself with a chair beside it looked neat clean and comfortable philip himself was cheery he said the bullet had made a mere fleshwound and had passed out on the other side and the lady of hope as they called he was just such another as aunt cecily and had made him very comfortable with clean linen good cool drinks and the tenderest hand but he was very sleepy so sleepy that he hardly cared to hear of the combat only he roused himself for a moment to say brother i have seen dolly  dolly  our sister dolly  ah phil many a strange visitor has come to me in the walnut chamber at home  i tell you i was in my perfect senses returned philip there she was just as when we left her and what was stranger still she talked french  sleep and see her again laughed berenger     chapter xlii the silver bullet        i am all wonder o my son my soul     is stunned within me powers to speak to him     or to interrogate him have i none     or even to look on him                     cowpers odyssey   in his waking senses philip adhered to his story that his little sister dolly had stood at the foot of his bed called him le pauvre and had afterwards disappeared led away by the nursing lady it seemed to berenger a mere delusion of feverish weakness for philip had lost a great deal of blood and the wound though not dangerous permitted no attempt at moving and gave much pain of the perfections of the lady as nurse and surgeon philip could not say enough and pale and overwept as he allowed her to be he declared that he was sure that her beauty must equal mme de selinvilles berenger laughed and looking round this strange hospital now lighted by the full rays of the morning sun he was much struck by the scene  it was the chancel of the old abbey church the door by which they had entered was very small and perhaps had led merely to the abbots throne as an irregularity for his own convenience and only made manifest by the rending away of the rich wooden stall work some fragments of which still clung to the walls the east end like that of many french churches formed a semicircle the high altar having been in the centre and five tall deep bays forming lesser chapels embracing it their vaults all gathered up into one lofty crown above and a slender pillar separating between each chapel each of which further contained a tall narrow window of course all had been utterly desolated and philip was actually lying in one of these chapels where the sculptured figure of st john and his eagle still remained on the wall and a sufficient remnant of his glowing sanguine robe of love was still in the window to serve as a shield from the bise the high altar of rich marbles was a mere heap of shattered rubbish but what surprised berenger more than all the ruined architectural beauty which his cinquecento trained taste could not understand was that the tiles of the pavement were perfectly clean and diligently swept the rubbish piled up in corners and here and there the relics of a cross or carved figure lay together as by a tender reverential hand even the morsels of painted glass had been placed side by side on the floor so as to form a mosaic of dark red blue and green and a childs toy lay beside this piece of patchwork in the midst of his observations however captain falconnets servant came to summon him to breakfast and the old woman appearing at the same time he could not help asking whether the lady were coming  oh yes she will come to dress his wound in good time answered the old woman  and when i should like to hear what she thinks of it said berenger  how said the old woman with a certain satisfaction in his disappointment is our lady of hope to be coming down among you gay gallants  but who is this lady of hope demanded he  who should she be but our good pastors daughter ah and a brave good daughter she was too abiding the siege because his breath was so bad that he could not be moved  what was his name asked berenger attracted strangely by what he heard  ribault monsieurpasteur ribault ah a good man and sound preacher when preach he could but when he could not his very presence kept the monks revenants from vexing usas a cat keeps mice away and ah the children have been changed creatures since madame dealt with them what monsieur would know why they call her our lady of hope esperance is her true name and moreover in the former days this abbey had an image that they called notredame de lesperance and the poor deceived folk thought it did great miracles and so when she came hither and wrought such cures and brought blessing wherever she went it became a saying among us that at length we had our true lady of hope  a more urgent summons here forced berenger away and his repetition of the same question received much the same answer from deaf old captain falconnet he was obliged to repair to his post with merely a piece of bread in his hand abut though vigilance was needful the day bade fair to be far less actively occupied than its predecessor the enemy were either disposed to turn the siege into a blockade or were awaiting reinforcements and heavier artillery and there were only a few desultory attacks in the early part of the morning about an hour before noon however the besiegers seemed to be drawing out in arms as if to receive some person of rank and at the same time sounds were heard on the hills to the eastward as if troops were on the march berenger having just been told by the old sergeant that probably all would be quiet for some time longer and been almost laughed at by the veteran for consulting him whether it would be permissible for him to be absent a few minutes to visit his brother was setting out across the bridge for the purpose his eyes in the direction of the rampart which followed the curve of the river the paths whichas has been saidthe feet of the washerwomen and drawers of water had worn away in quieter times had been smoothed and scarped away on the outer side so as to come to an abrupt termination some feet above the gay marigolds coltsfoot and other spring flowers that smiled by the waterside suddenly he beheld on the rampart a tiny gray and white figure fearlessly trotting or rather dancing along the summit and the men around him exclaimed the little moonbeam child a fairya changelingthey cannot shoot at such a babe nor could they harm her hola little one gare go back to your mother do not disturb yourself sir she is safer than you were the ejaculations almost at the same moment while he sprang forward horrified at the peril of such an infant he had reached the angle between the bridge and rampart when he perceived that neither humanity nor superstition were protecting the poor child for as she turned down the remnant of one of the treacherous little paths a man in bright steel and deep black had spurred his horse to the rivers brink and was deliberately taking aim at her furious at such brutality berenger fired the pistol he held in his hand and the wretch dropped from his horse but at the same moment his pistol exploded and the child rolled down the bank whence a piteous wail came up impelling berenger to leap down to her assistance in the full face of the enemy perhaps he was protected for the moment by the confusion ensuing on the fall of the officer and when he reached the bottom of the bank he saw the little creature on her feet her round cap and gray woolen dress stripped half off in the fall and her flaxen hair falling round her plump white exposed shoulder but evidently unhurt and gathering yellow marigolds as composedly as though she had been making may garlands he snatched her up and she said with the same infantine dignity yes take me up the naughty people spoilt the path but i must take my beads first and she tried to struggle out of his arms pointing therewith to a broken string among the marshy herbage on which gleamedthe pearls of ribaumont  in the few seconds in which he grasped them and then bore the child up the embankment in desperate bounds a hail of bullets poured round him ringing on his breastplate shearing the plume from his hat but scarcely even heard and in another moment he had sprung down on the inner side grasping the child with all his might but not daring even to look at her in the wondrous flash of that first conviction she spoke first put me down and let me have my beads she said in a grave clear tone and then first he beheld a pair of dark blue eyes a sweet wildrose facedollys all over he pressed her so fast and so close in so speechless and over powering an ecstasy that again she repeated and in alarm put me down i want my mother  yes yes your mother your mother your mother he cried unable to let her out of his embrace and then restraining himself as he saw her frightened eyes in absolute fear of her spurning him or struggling from him my sweet my child ah do you not know me then remembering how wild this was he struggled to speak calmly what are you called my treasure  i am la petite rayonette she said with puzzled dignity and gravity and my mother says i have a beautiful long name of my own besides  berangeremy berangere  that is what she says over me as i go to sleep in her bosom at night said the child in a wondering voice soon exchanged for entreaty oh hug me not so hard oh let me golet me go to her mother mother  my child mine own i am take theeoh do not struggle with me he cried himself imploring now child one kiss for thy father and meantime putting absolute force on his vehement affection he was hurrying to the chancel  there philip hailed them with a shout as of desperate anxiety relieved but before a word could be uttered down the stairs flew the lady of hope crying wildly not thereshe is not but perceiving the little one in the strangers arms she held out her own crying ah is she hurt my angel  unhurt eustacie our child is unhurt berenger said with an agonized endeavour to be calm but for the moment her instinct was so entirely absorbed in examining into the soundness of her childs limbs that she neither saw nor hear anything else  eustacie he said laying his hand on her arm she started back with bewildered eyes eustaciewife do you not know me ah i forgot that i am changed  youyou she gasped utterly confounded and gazing as if turned to stone and though at that moment the vibration of a mighty discharge of cannon rocked the walls and strewed philips bed with the crimson shivers of st johns robe yet neither of them would have been sensible of it had not humfrey rushed in at the same moment crying they are coming on like friends sir  berenger passed his hand over his face you will know me whenif i return my dearest he said if not then still thank god philip to you i trust them  and with one kiss on that still cold almost petrified brow he had dashed away there was a space of absolutely motionless silence save that eustacie let herself drop on the chancel step and the child presently breaking the spell pulled her to attract her notice to the flowers mother here are the soucis for the poor gentlemans broth see the naughty people had spoilt all the paths and i rolled down and tore my frock and down fell the beads but be not angry mother dear for the good gentleman picked them up and carried me up the bank  the bank cried eustacie with a scream as the sense of the words reached her ears ah no wonder well might thy danger bring thy fathers spirit and she grasped the little one fervently in her arms murmuring thank thank god indeed oh my precious one and did he send that blessed spirit to rescue thee  and will you tie up my frock and may i put the flowers into the broth chattered rayonette and why did he kiss me and hug me so tight and how did he know what you say over me as we fall asleep  eustacie clasped her tighter with a convulsive shudder of thankfulness and philip but half hearing and barely gathering the meaning of her mood ventured to speak madame  as if touched by an electric shock eustacie started up as recalled to instant needs and coming towards him said do you want anything sir pardon one who has but newly seen a spirit from the other worldbrought by his childs danger and the dazed trancelike look was returning  spirit cried philip nay madame it was himself ah and you are she whom we have sought so long and this dear childno wonder she has dollys face  whowhat said eustacie pressing her temples with her hands as if to retain her senses speak was yonder a living or dead manand who  living thank god and your own husband that is if you are really eustacie are you indeed he added becoming doubtful  eustacie that am i she murmured but he is deadthey killed him i swathe blood where he had waited for me his childs danger brought him from the grave  no no look at me sister eustacie listen to me osbert brought him home more dead than alivebut alive still  no she cried half passionately never could he have lived and left me to mourn him so bitterly  if you knew cried philip growing indignant for weeks he lay in deadly lethargy and when with his left hand he wrote and sent osbert to you your kinsfolk threw the poor fellow into a dungeon and put us off with lies that you were married to your cousin all believed only hesick helpless speechless as he washe trusted you still and so soon as mericour came though he could scarcely brook the saddle nothing would hold him from seeking you we saw only ruin at la sablerie and wellnigh ever since have we been clapped up in prison by your uncle we were on the way to quinet to seek you he has kept his faith whole through wounds and pain and prison and threatsay and sore temptation cried philip waxing eloquent and oh it cannot be that you do not care for him  doubt not my faith sir said eustacie proudly i have been as true to him as if i had known he lived nor do i know who you are to question me  at this moment the child pressed forward holding between her tow careful plump hands a red earthenware bowl with the tisane steaming in it and the yellow petals strewn over the surface she and philip had taken a great fancy to each other and while her mother was busy with the other patients she had been left to her quiet play with her fragments of glass which she carried one by one to display held up to the light to her new friends who in his weak state and after his long captivity found her the more charming playmate because she so strangely reminded him of his own little sisters she thought herself his little nurse and missing from his broth the yellow petals that she had been wont to think the charm of tisane the housewifely little being had trotted off unseen and unmissed across the quadrangle over the embankment where she had often gathered them or attended on the lessive on the rivers brink and now she broke forth exultingly here here is the tisane with all the soucis let me feed you with them sir  ah thou sweet one gasped philip i could as soon eat them as david could drink the water for thesefor these and the tears rushed into his eyes oh let me but kiss her madame i loved her from the first moment she has the very face of my little sweeting what french word is good enough for her didst run into peril for me not knowing how near i was to thee what must i eat it love me then  but the boarded door was thrown back and madame more wounded resounded the thrill of terror the elastic reaction at the ensuing words from the north gate was what made eustacie in an instant know herself to be not widow but wife she turned round at once holding out her hand and saying with a shaken agitated voice mon frere pardon me i know not what i say and after all he will find me bien mechante still then as philip devoured her hand with kisses and held it fast i must go these poor men need me when i can i will return  only let me have the little one entreated philip it is almost home already to look at her  and when eustacie next looked in on them they were both fast asleep  she poor thing the only woman with brains among the many scared females in the garrison might not rest or look the wonder in the face fresh sufferers needed her care and related gallant things of the dukes englishman things of desperate daring and prowess that sent the blood throbbing to her heart with exultation but only to be followed by a pang of anguish at having let him go back to perilnay perhaps to deathwithout a word of tenderness or even recognition she imaged him as the sunnyfaced youth who had claimed her in the royal castle and her longing to be at his side and cling to him as his own became every moment more fervent and irresistible until she gladly recollected the necessity of carrying food to the defenders and snatching an interval from her hospital cares she sped to the old circular kitchen of the monastery where she found the lame baker vainly trying to organize a party of frightened women to carry provisions to the garrison of the bridgetower  give some to me she said my husband is there i am come to fetch his dinner  the peasant women looked and whispered as if they thought that to add to their misfortunes their lady of hope had become distracted by grief and one or two who held the old faith and were like the crane among the sparrows even observed that it was a judgment for the profane name that had been given her against which she had herself uniformly protested  my husband is come said eustacie looking round with shining eyes let us be brave wives and not let our men famish  she lifted a loaf and a pitcher of broth and with the latter poised on her erect and graceful head and elastic though steady step she led the way the others following her with a sort of awe as of one they fancied in a superhuman state in fact there was no great danger in traversing the bridge with its lofty parapet on either side and her mind was too much exalted and moved to be sensible of anything but a certain exulting awe of the battle sounds there was however a kind of lull in the assault which had raged so fiercely ever since the fall of the officer and the arrival of the reinforcements either the enemy had paused to take food or were devising some fresh mode of attack and as the line of women advanced there started forth from under the arch a broadshouldered whitefaced goldenbearded personage who cried joyously my dearest my bravest this for me and lifted the pitcher from her head as he grasped her hand with a flesh and blood clasp indeed but the brightcheeked wavyhaired lad of her dream withered away with a shock of disappointment and she only looked up with wistful puzzled earnestness instead of uttering the dear name that she had so long been whispering to herself dearest he said this is precious indeed to me that you should let me feast my eyes once more on you but you may not tarry the rogues may renew the attack at any moment  she had thought of herself as insisting on standing beside him and sharing his peril had he been himself she must have don so but this was a stranger whose claiming her made her shrink apart till she could feel the identity which though she believed she could not realize her hand lay cold and tremulous within his warm pressure but he was too much wrought up and too full of joy and haste to be sensible of anything but of the brave affection that had dared all to come to him and he was perfectly happy even as a trumpetcall among the foe warned him to press her fingers to his lips and say as his bright blue eye kindled god grant that we may meet and thank him tonight farewell my lost and found i fight as one who has something to fight for  he might not leave his post but he watched her with eyes that could not be satiated as she recrossed the bridge and verily his superabundant ecstasy and the energy that was born of it were all needed to sustain the spirits of his garrison through that terrible afternoon the enemy seemed to be determined to carry the place before it could be relieved and renewed the storm again and again with increasing violence while the defenders disheartened by their pertinacity dismayed at the effects of the heavy artillery now brought to bear on the tower and direfully afraid of having the bridge destroyed would have abandoned their barbican and shut themselves up within the body of the place had not berenger been here there and everywhere directing commanding exhorting cheering encouraging exciting enthusiasm by word and example winning proud admiration by feats of valour and dexterity sprung of the ecstatic inspiration of newfound bliss and watching as the conscious defender of his own most beloved without a moments respite till twilight stillness sank on the enemy and old falconnet came to relieve him thanking him for his gallant defence and auguring that by noonday tomorrow at latest m le duc would succour them unless he were hampered by any folly of this young navarre  too blissful for the sense of fatigue berenger began to impart to the commandant his delight but the only answer he got was hope yes every hope and he again recognized what he had already perceived that the indistinctness of his utterance made him entirely unintelligible to the deaf commandant and that shouting did but proclaim to the whole garrison perhaps even to the enemys camp what was still too new a joy not to be a secret treasure of delight so he only wrung the old captains hand and strode away as soon as he was released  it was nearly dark in spite of a rising moon but beneath the cloister arch was torchlight glancing on a steel headpiece and on a white cap both bending down over a prostrate figure and he heard the voice he loved so well say it is over i can do no more it were best to dig his grave at once here in silenceit will discourage the people less renaud and armand here  he paused for a few minutes unseen in the shadow while she closed the eyes and composed the limbs of the dead soldier then kneeling said the lords prayer in french over him was this the being he had left as the petted plaything of the palace when she rose she came to the arch and gazed wistfully across the moonlit quadrangle beyond the dark shade cast by the buildings saying to the soldier you are sure he was safe  my eustacie said berenger coming forward we meet in grave times  the relief of knowing him safe after the sickening yearnings and suspense of the day and moreover the old ring of tenderness in his tone made her spring to him with real warmth of gladness and cry it is you all is well  blessedly well ma mie my sweetheart he said throwing his arm round her and she rested against him murmuring now i feel it thou are thyself they were in the dark cloister passage and when he would have moved forward she clung closer to him and murmured oh wait wait yet an instantthus i can feel that i have theethe samemy own  my poor darling said berenger after a second you must learn to bear with both my looks and speech though i be but a sorry shattered fellow for you  no no she cried hanging on him with double fervour no i am loving you the more alreadydoublytreblya thousand times only those moments were so precious they made all these long years as nothing but come to the little one and to your brother  the little one had already heard them and was starting forward to meet them though daunted for a moment by the sight of the strange father she stood on the pavement in the full flood of the moonlight from the east window which whitened her fair face flaxen hair and gray dress so that she did truly look like some spirit woven of the moonbeams eustacie gave a cry of satisfaction ah good good it was by moonlight that i saw her first  berenger took her in his arm and held her to his breast with a sense of insatiable love while philip exclaimed ay well may you make much of her brother well might you seek them far and wide such treasures are not to be found in the wide world  berenger without answering carried the little one to the step of the ruined high altar and there knelt holding eustacie by the hand the child in one arm and with the moon glancing on his high white brow and earnest face he spoke a few words of solemn thanks and prayer for a blessing on their reunion and the babe so wonderfully preserved to them  not till then did he carry her into the lamplight by philips bed and scan therein every feature to satisfy his eyes with the fulfilled hope that had borne him through those darkest days when despairing of the mother the thought of the child had still sustained him to throw his will into the balance of the scale between life and death little berangere gazed up into his face silently with wondering grave and somewhat sleepy eyes and then he saw them fix themselves on his powdergrimed and bloodstained hands ah little heart he said i am truly in no state to handle so pure a piece of sugar as thou i should have rid myself of the battlestains ere touching thee but how recollect anything at such a moment  eustacie was glad he had broken the spell of silence for having recovered her husband her first instinct was to wait upon him she took the child from him explaining that she was going to put her to bed in her own rooms up the stone stair which for the present were filled with fugitive women and children who had come in from the country so that the chancel must continue the lodging of berenger and his brother and for the time of her absence she brought him water to wash away the stains and set before him the soup she had kept warm over her little charcoal brazier it was only when thus left that he could own in answer to philips inquiries that he could feel either hunger or weariness nay he would only acknowledge enough of the latter to give a perfect charm to rest under such auspices eustacie had dispatched her motherly cares promptly enough to be with him again just as in taking off his corselet he had found that it had been pierced by a bullet and pursuing the trace through his doublet he found it lodged in that purse which he had so long worn next his heart where it had spent its force against the single pearl of ribaumont and holding it up to the light he saw that it was of silver then there returned on him and philip the words they had heard two days before of silver bullets forged for the destruction of the white moonlight fairy and he further remembered the moments shock and blow that in the midst of his wild amaze on the rivers bank had made him gather his breath and strength to bound desperately upwards lest the next moment he should find himself wounded and powerless  for the innocent then had the shot been intended and she running into danger out of her sweet tender instincts of helpfulness had been barely saved at the extreme peril of her unconscious fathers life philip whose vehement affection for the little one had been growing all day was in the act of telling berenger to string the bullet in the place of the injured pearl as the most precious heirloom of ribaumont bravery when eustacie returned and learning all grew pale and shuddered as danger had never made her do before but this strange day had almost made a coward of her  and this is has spared said berenger taking out the string of little yellow shells dost know them sweet heart they have been my chaplet all this time  ah cried eustacie poor good mademoiselle noemi she threaded them for my child when she was very little ah could she have given them to youcould it then not have been truethat horror  alas it was too true i found these shells in the empty cradle in the burnt house and deemed them all i should ever have of my babe  poor noemi poor noemi she always longed to be a martyr but we fled from her and the fate we had brought on her that was the thought that preyed on my dear father he grieved so to have left his sheepand it was only for my sake ah i have brought evil on all who have been good to me beginning with you you had better cast me off or i shall bring yet worse  let it be so if we are only together  he drew her to him and she laid her head on his shoulder murmuring ah father father were you but here to see it so desolate yesterday so ineffably blest today oh i cannot even grieve for him now save that he could not just have seen us yet i think he knew it would be so  nay it may be that he does see us said berenger would that i had known who it was whom you were laying down en paix et seurte bonne as it was the psalm brought precious thoughts of chateau leurre and the little wife who was wont to sing it with me  ah said eustacie it was when he sang those words as he was about to sleep in the ruin of the temple that first icowering there in terrorknew him for no templars ghost but for a friend that story ended my worst desolation that night he became my father the next my child came to me  my precious treasure ah what you must have undergone and i all unknowing capable of nothing wiser than going out of my senses and raging in a fever because i could convince no one that those were all lies about your being aught but my true and loving wife but tell me what brought thee hither to be the tutelary patron where but for the siege i had overpassed thee on the way to quinet  then eustacie told him how the italian pedlar had stolen her letters and attempted to poison her childthe pedlar whom he soon identified with that wizard who had talked to him of esperance until the cue had evidently been given by the chevalier soon after the duke had dispatched a messenger to say that the chevalier de ribaumont was on the way to demand his niece and as it was a period of peace and the law was decidedly on his side madame de quinet would be unable to offer any resistance she therefore had resolved to send eustacie awaynot to any of the seaports whither the uncle would be likely to trace her but absolutely to a place which he would have passed through on his journey into guyenne the monastery of notredame de lesperance at pont de dronne had been placed there as well as a colony of silkspinners attracted by the mulberrytrees of the old abbey garden these however having conceived some terror of the ghosts of the murdered monks had entreated for a pastor to protect them and madame la duchesse thought that in this capacity isaac gardon known by one of the many aliases to which the calvinist ministers constantly resorted might avoid suspicion for the present she took the persecuted fugitives for some stages in an opposite direction in her own coach then returned to face and baffle the chevalier while her trusty steward by a long detour conducted them to pont de dronne which they reached the very night after to chevalier had returned through it to nid de merle  the pastor and his daughter were placed under the special protection of captain falconnet and the steward had taken care that they should be well lodged in three rooms that had once been the abbots apartments their stay had been at first intended to be short but the long journey had been so full of suffering to isaac and left such serious effects that eustacie could not bear to undertake it again and madame de quinet soon perceived that she was safer there than at the chateau since strangers were seldom admitted to the fortress and her presence there attracted no attention but for isaac gardons declining health eustacie would have been much happier here than at the chateau the homely housewifely life where all depended on her suited her and using her lessons in domestic arts of nursing and medicine for the benefit of her fathers flock she had found to her dismay that the simple people in their veneration had made her into a sort of successor to the patroness of the convent isaac had revived enough for a time to be able to conduct the worship in the church and to instruct some his flock but the teaching of the young had been more and more transferred to her and as he ingenuously said had taught her more than she ever knew before he gradually became weaker through more suffering and was absolutely incapable of removal when an attack by the guisards was threatened eustacie might have been sent back to quinet but she would not hear of leaving him and this first had been a mere slight attack as if a mere experiment on the strength of the place she had however then had to take the lead in controlling the women and teaching them to act as nurses and to carry out provisions and she must then have been seen by some one who reported her presence there to narcisseperhaps by the italian pedlar indeed humfrey who came in for a moment to receive his masters orders report his watch and greet his lady narrated on the authority of the lately enlisted menatarms that m de nid de merle had promised twenty crowns to any one who might shoot down the heretics little white diablesse  about six weeks had elapsed since the first attack on pont de dronne and in that time gardon had sunk rapidly he died as he lived a gentle patient man not a characteristic calvinist though his lot had been thrown with that party in his perplexed life of truthseeking and disappointment in the aspirations and hopes of early youth he had been however full of peace and trust that he should open his eyes where the light was clear and no cloud on either side would mar his perception and his thankfulness had been great for the blessing that his almost heavensent daughter had been to him in his loneliness bereavement and decay much as he loved her he did not show himself grieved or distressed on her account but as he told her he took the summons to leave her as a sign that his task was done and the term of her trials ended i trust as fully he said that thou wilt soon be in safe and loving hands as though i could commit thee to them  and so he died in her arms leaving her a far fuller measure of blessing and of love than ever she had derived from her own father and as the enemys trumpets were already sounding on the hills she had feared insult to his remains and had procured his almost immediate burial in the cloister bidding the assistants sing as his farewell that evening psalm which had first brought soothing to her hunted spirit  there while unable after hours of weeping to tear herself from the grave of her father and protector had she in her utter desolation been startled by the summons not only to attend to the wounded stranger but to lodge him in the chancel only this was wanting was the first thought in her desolation for this had been her own most cherished resort either the bise or fear of a haunted spot or both had led to the nailing up of boards over the dividing screen so that the chancel was entirely concealed from the church and no one ever thought of setting foot there till eustacie whose catholic reverence was indestructible even when she was only half sure that it was not worse than a foible had stolen down thither grieved at its utter desolation and with fond and careful hands had cleansed it and amended the ruin so far as she might she had no other place where she was sure of being uninterrupted and here had been her oratory where she daily prayed and often came to hide her tears and rally her spirits through that long attendance on her fatherly friend it had been a stolen pleasure her reverent work there if once observed would have been treated as rank idolatry and it was with consternation as well as grief that she found by the captains command that this her sanctuary and refuge was to be invaded by strange soldiers little did she think  and thus they sat telling each other all on the step of the ruined chancel among the lights and shadows of the apse how unlike to stately louvres halls of statuary and cabinets of porcelain or the arcadian groves of montpipeau and yet how little they recked that they were in a beleaguered fortress in the midst of ruins wounded sufferers all around themselves in hourly jeopardy it was enough that they had one another they were so supremely happy that their minds unconsciously gathered up those pale lights and dark fantastic shades as adjuncts of their bliss     chapter xliii le baiser deustacie         no pitying voice no eye affords      one tear to grace his obsequies                         gray   golden sunshine made rubies and sapphires of the fragments of glass in the windows of notredame de lesperance and lighted up the brown face and earnest eyes of the little dark figure who with hands clasped round her knees sat gazing as if she could never gaze her fill upon the sleeping warrior beside whom she sat his clear straight profile like a cameo both in chiseling and in colour as it lay on the brown cloak where he slept the profound sleep of content and of fatigue  neither she nor philip would have spoken or stirred to break that wellearned rest but sounds from without were not long in opening his eyes and as they met her intent gaze he smiled and said good morrow sweet heart what learning how ugly a fellow is come back to thee  no indeed i was trying to trace thine old likeness and then wondering how i ever liked thy boyish face better than the noble look thou bearest now  ah when i set out to come to thee i was a walking rainbow yet i was coxcomb enough to think thou wouldst overlook it  show me those cruel strokes she said i see oneand her finger traced the seam as poor king charles had donebut where is the one my wicked cousin called by that frightful name  nay verily that sweet name spared my life a little less spite at my peach cheek and i had been sped and had not lisped and stammered all my days in honour of le baiser deustacie and as he pushed aside his long golden silk moustache to show the ineffaceable red and purple scar he added smiling it has waited long for its right remedy  at that moment the door in the roodscreen opened captain falconnets one eye stared in amazement and from beneath his gray moustache thundered forth the word comment in accents fit to wake the dead  was this esperance the most irreproachable of pastors daughters and widows what madame so soon as your good father is under ground at least i thought one woman could be trusted but it seems we must see to the wounded ourselves  she blushed but stood her ground and berenger shouted she is my wife sirmy wife whom i have sought so long  that must be as madame la duchesse chooses said the captain she is under her charge and must be sent to her as soon as this canaille is cleared off to your rooms madame  i am her husband again cried berenger we have been married sixteen years  you need not talk to me of dowry madame la duchesse will settle that if you are fool enough to mean anything by it no no mademoiselle ive no time for folly come with me sir and see if that be true which they say of the rogues outside  and putting his arm into berengers he fairly carried him off discoursing by the way on feu m lamirals saying that overstrictness in camp was perilous since a young saint an old devil but warning him that this was prohibited gear as he was responsible for the young woman to madame la duchesse berenger who had never made the captain hear anything that he did not know before looked about for some interpreter whose voice might be more effectual but found himself being conducted to the spiral stair of the church steeple and suddenly gathering that some new feature in the case had arisen followed the old man eagerly up the winding steps to the little square of leaden roof where the quinet banner was planted it commanded a wide and splendid view to the bay of biscay on the one hand and the inland mountains on the other but the warder who already stood there pointed silently to the north where on the road by which berenger had come was to be seen a cloud of dust gilded by the rays of the rising sun  who raised it was a matter of no doubt and berengers morning orisons were paid with folded hands in silent thanksgiving as he watched the sparkling of pikes and gleaming of helmetsand the white flag of bourbon at length became visible  already the enemy below were sending out scoutsthey rode to the top of the hillthen a messenger swan his horse across the river in the camp before the bridgetower men buzzed out of their tents like ants whose hill is disturbed horses were fastened to the cannon tents were struck and it was plain that the siege was to be raised  captain falconnet did his ally the honour to consult him on the expedience of molesting the guisards by a sally and trying to take some of their guns but berenger merely bowed to whatever he said while he debated aloud the pros and cons and at last decided that the garrison had been too much reduced for this and that m le duc would prefer finding them drawn up in good order to receive him to their going chasing and plundering disreputable among the enemythe duke being here evidently a much greater personage than the king of navarre hereditary governor of guyenne though he were indeed nothing was wanting to the confusion of berengers late assailants in the camp on the north side of the river things were done with some order but that on the other side was absolutely abandoned and crowds were making in disorder for the ford leaving everything behind them that they might not have their retreat cut off would there be a battle falconnet taking in with his eye the numbers of the succouring party thought the duke would allow the besiegers to depart unmolested but remembered with a sigh that young king had come to meddle in their affair  however it was needful to go down and marshal the men for the reception of the newcomers or to join in the fight as the case might be  and it was a peaceful entrance that took place some hours later and was watched from the windows of the priors rooms by eustacie her child and philip whom she had been able to install in her own apartments which had been vacated by the refugee women in haste to return home and where he now sat in maitre gardons great straw chair wrapped in his loose gown and looking out at the northern gates thrown open to receive the king and duke old falconnet presenting the keys to the duke the duke bowing low as he offered them to the king and the king waving them back to the duke and the captain then they saw falconnet presenting the tall auxiliary who had been so valuable to him his gesture as he pointed up to the window and the kings upward look as he doffed his hat and bowed low while eustacie responded with the most graceful of reverences such as reminded philip that his little sisterinlaw and tender nurse was in truth a great court lady  presently berenger came upstairs bringing with him his faithful fosterbrother osbert who though looking gaunt and lean had nearly recovered his strength and had accompanied the army in hopes of finding his master the good fellow was full of delight at the welcome of his lady and at once bestirred himself in assisting her in rectifying the confusion in which her guests had left her apartment  matters had not long been set straight when steps were heard on the stone stair and the door opening wide captain falconnets gruff voice was heard this way monseigneur this way sire  this was madame la baronne de ribaumonts first reception she was standing at the dark walnut table fresh starching and crimping berengers solitary ruff while under her merry superintendence those constant playfellows philip and rayonette were washing or pretending to wash radishes in a large wooden bowl and berenger was endeavouring to write his letter of good tidings to be sent by special messenger to his grandfather philip was in something very like a geneva gown eustacie wore her prim white cap and frill and coarse black serge kirtle and there was but one chair besides that one which philip was desired to retain only two threelegged stools and a bench  nevertheless madame de ribaumont was equal to the occasion nothing could have been more courtly graceful or unembarrassed than her manner of receiving of kings gallant compliments and of performing all the courtesies suited to the hostess and queen of the place it was the air that would have befitted the stateliest castle hall yet that in its simplicity and brightness still more embellished the old ruinous conventcell the king was delighted he sat down upon one of the threelegged stools took rayonette upon his knee undertook to finish washing the radishes but ate nearly all he washed declaring that they put him in mind of his old hardy days on the mountains of bearn he insisted on hearing all rayonettes adventure in detail and on seeing the pearls and the silver bullet you could scarcely have needed the token sir said he with a smile to berenger mademoiselle had already shown herself of the true blood of the bravest of knights  the tidings of the attack on pont de dronne had caused the duke to make a forced march to its relief in which the king had insisted on joining him and they now intended to wait at pont de dronne till the rest of the troops came up and to continue their march through guyenne to nerac the capital of henrys county of foix the duke suggested that if philip were well enough to move when the army proceeded the family might then take him to quinet where the duchess would be very desirous to see madame and therewith they took leave with some goodhumoured mirth as to whether m le ribaumont would join them at supper or remain in the bosom of his family and whether he were to be regarded as a gay bridegroom or a husband of sixteen years standing  nay said the king did his good orpheus know how nearly his eurydice had slipped through his fingers again how m de quinet had caught the respectable pluto yonder in the gray moustache actually arranging an escort to send the lady safe back to quinet bon gre malgreand truly a deaf pluto was worse than even orpheus had encountered  so laughing he bowed again his compliments but eustacie demanded so soon as he was gone what he meant by calling her by such names if he thought it was her christian name it was overfamiliarif not she liked it less  it is only that he last saw you in the infernal region ma mie said berenger and i have sought you ever since as orpheus sought eurydice  but her learning did not extend so far and when the explanation was made she pouted and owned that she could not bear to be reminded of the most foolish and uncomfortable scene in her lifethe cause of all her troubles and as berenger was telling her of dianes confession that her being involved in the pageant was part of the plot for their detention at paris osbert knocked at the door and entered with a bundle in his arms and the air of having done the right thing  there sir he said with proud satisfaction i have been to the camp across the river i heard there were good stuffs to be had there for nothing and thought i would see if i could find a coat for monsieur philippe for his own is a mere ruin  this was true for eustacie had been deciding that between blood and rents it had become a hopeless case for renovation and osbert joyfully displayed a beautifullyembroidered coat of soft leather which he had purchased for a very small sum of a plunderer who had been there before him the camp had been so hastily abandoned that all the luggage had been left and like a true valet osbert had not neglected the opportunity of replenishing his masters wardrobe and said he i saw there on whom m le baron knowsm de nid de merle  here cried eustacie startled for a moment but her eyes resting reassured on her husband  madame need not be alarmed said osbert m le baron has well repaid him ah ah there he lies a spectacle for all good christians to delight in  it was then he le scelerat exclaimed berenger i have already thought it possible  and he fell by your hands cried eustacie that is as it should be  yes madame said osbert it did my very heart good to see him writhing there like a crushed viper m le barons bullet was mortal and his own people thought him not worth the moving so there he lies on the ground howling and cursing i would have given him the coup de grace myself but that i thought m le baron might have some family matters to settle with him so i only asked what he thought now of clapping guiltless folk into dungeons and shooting innocent children like sparrows but he grinned and cursed like a demon and i left him  in any ones charge asked berenger  in the fields who is coming for him said the descendant of the norseman i only told humfrey that if he saw any one likely to meddle he should tell them he was reserved for you eh m le baron is not going now supper is about to be served and if m le baron would let me array him with this ruff of spanish point and wax the ends of his belle moustache  it is late added eustacie laying her hand on his arm there may be wild men abouthe may be desperate oh take care  ma mie do you not think me capable of guarding myself from a wild cat leap of a dying man he must not be left thus remember he is a ribaumont  vindictiveness and revenge had their part in the fire of eustacies nature many a time had she longed to strangle narcisse and she was on the point of saying think of his attempts on that little ones lifethink of your wounds and captivity but she had not spent three years with isaac gardon without learning that there was sin in giving way to her keen hatred and she forced herself to silence while berenger said reading her face keep it back sweet heart make it not harder for me i would as soon go near a dying serpent but it were barbarity to leave him as osbert describes  berenger was too supremely and triumphantly happy not to be full of mercy and as osbert guided him to the hut where the miserable man lay he felt little but compassion the scene was worse than he had expected for not only had the attendants fled but plunderers had come in their room rent away the coverings from the bed and torn the dying man from it livid nearly naked covered with blood his fingers hacked and ears torn for the sake of the jewels on them lay the dainty and effeminate tigerfop of former days moaning and scarcely sensible but when the mattress had been replaced and berenger had lifted him back to it laid a cloak over him and moistened his lips he opened his eyes but only to exclaim you there as if i had not enough to mock me away and closed them sullenly  i would try to relieve you cousin said berenger  the answer was a savage malediction on hypocrisy and the words and my sister  your sister is in all honour and purity at the nunnery of lucon  he laughed a horrible incredulous laugh safely disposed of ere you cajoled la petite with the fable of your faithfulness nothing like a huguenot for lying to both sides and then ensued another burst of imprecations on the delay that had prevented him from seizing the fugitivestill hetill he felt as if the breath of hell were upon him and could not help vindicating himself vain though he knew it to be narcisse de ribaumont he said gravely my word has never been broken and you know the keeping of it has not been without cost on that word believe that madame de selinville is as spotless a matron as when she periled herself to save my life i never even knew her sex till i had drawn her half drowned from the sea and after that i only saw her in the presence of dom colombeau of nissard in whose care i left her  narcisses features contorted themselves into a frightful sneer as he muttered the intolerable fool and that he should have got the better of me that is if it be trueand i believe not a word of it  at least said berenger waste not these last hours on hating and reviling me but let this fellow of mine who is a very fair surgeon bind your wound again  eh said narcisse spitefully turning his head your own rogue let me see what work he made of le baiser deustacie pray how does it please her  she thanks heaven that your chief care was to spoil my face  i hear she is a prime doctress but of course you brought her not hither lest she should hear how you got out of our keeping  she knows it  ah she has been long enough at court to know one must overlook that ones own little matters may be overlooked  berenger burst out at last her i will not hear blasphemed the next word against her i leave you to yourself  that is all i want said narcisse these cares of yours are only douceurs to your conceited heretical conscience and a lengthening out of this miserable affair you would scoff at the only real service you could render me  and that is  to fetch a priest ha ha one of your sort would sooner hang me you had rather see me perish body and soul in this huguenot doghole what do you stammer bring a psalmsinging heretic here and ill teach him and you what you may call blasphemy  a priest you shall have cousin said berenger gravely i will do my utmost to bring you one meanwhile strive to bring yourself into a state in which he may benefit you  berenger was resolved that the promise should be kept he saw that despair was hardening the wretched mans heart and that the possibility of fulfilling his churchs rites might lead him to address himself to repentance but the difficulties were great osbert the only catholic at hand was disposed to continue his vengeance beyond the grave and only at his masters express command would even exercise his skill to endeavour to preserve life till the confessor could be brought ordinary huguenots would regard the desire of narcisse as a wicked superstition and berenger could only hurry back to consult some of the gentlemen who might be supposed more unprejudiced  as he was crossing the quadrangle at full speed he almost ran against the king of navarre who was pacing up and down reading letters and who replied to his hasty apologies by saying he looked as if the fair eurydice had slipped through his hands again into the inferno  not so sire but there is one too near those gates nid de merle is lying at the point of death calling for a priest  ventre saintgris exclaimed the king he is the very demon of the piece who carved your face stole your wife and had nearly shot your daughter  the more need of his repentance sire and without a priest he will not try to repent i have promised him one  a bold promise said henry have you thought how our good friends here are likely to receive a priest of baal into the camp  no sire but my best must be done i pray you counsel me  henry laughed at the simple confidence of the request but replied the readiest way to obtain a priest will be to ride with a flag of truce to the enemys campthey are at st esmeand say that m de nid de merle is a prisoner and dying and that i offer safeconduct to any priest that will come to himthough whether a redhot calvinist will respect my safeconduct or your escort is another matter  at least sire you sanction my making this request  have you men enough to take with you to guard you from marauders  i have but two servants sire and i have left them with the wounded man  then i will send with you half a dozen gascons who have been long enough at paris with me to have no scruples  by the time berenger had explained matters to his wife and brother and snatched a hasty meal a party of gay soldierlylooking fellows were in the saddle commanded by a bronzed sergeant who was perfectly at home in conducting messages between contending parties after a dark ride of about five miles the camp at the village of st esme was reached and this person recommended that he himself should go forward with a trumpet since m de ribaumont was liable to be claimed as an escaped prisoner there was then a tedious delay but at length the soldier returned and another horseman with him a priest who had come to the camp in search of m de nid de merle was willing to trust himself to the king of navarres safeconduct  thanks sir cried berenger this is a work of true charity  i think i know that voice said the priest  the priest of nissard  even so sir i was seeking m de nid de merle and had but just learnt that he had been left behind wounded  you came to tell him of his sister  and as they rode together the priest related to berenger that m de solivet had remained in the same crushed humiliated mood not exactly penitent but too much disappointed and overpowered with shame to heed what became of her provided she were not taken back to her brother or her aunt she knew that repentance alone was left for her and permitted herself to be taken to lucon where mere monique was the only person whom she had ever respected there had no doubt been germs of good within her but the crime and intrigue of the siren court of catherine de medicis had choked them and the first sense of better things had been awakened by the frank simplicity of the young cousin while nevertheless jealousy and family tactics had led her to aid in his destruction only to learn through her remorse how much she loved him and when in his captivity she thought him in her power but found him beyond her reach unhallowed as was her passion yet still the contemplation of the virtues of one beloved could not fail to raise her standard it was for his truth and purity that she had loved him even while striving to degrade these quantities and when he came forth from her ordeal unscathed her worship of him might for a time be more intense but when the idol was removed the excellence she had first learnt to adore in him might yet lead that adoration up to the source of all excellence all she sought now was shelter wherein to weep and cower unseen but the priest believed that her tears would soon spring from profound depths of penitence such as often concluded the lives of the gay ladies of france mere monique had received her tenderly and the good priest had gone from lucon to announce her fate to her aunt and brother  at bellaise he had found the abbess much scandalized she had connived at her nieces releasing the prisoner for she had acquired too much regard for him to let him perish under narcisses hands and she had allowed veronique to personate diane at the funeral mass and also purposely detained narcisse to prevent the detection of the escape but the discovery that her niece had accompanied his flight had filled her with shame and furry  pursuit had been made towards la rochelle but when the neighbourhood of the king of navarre became known no doubt was entertained that the fugitives had joined him and narcisse reserving his vengeance for the family honour till he should encounter berenger had hotly resumed the intention of pouncing on eustacie at pont de dronne which had been decided on upon the report of the italian spy and only deferred by his fathers death this once done berengers own supposed infidelity would have forced him to acquiesce in the annulment of the original marriage  it had been a horrible gulf and berenger shuddered as one who had barely struggled to the shore and found his dear ones safe and his enemies shattered and helpless on the strand they hurried on so as to be in time the priest a brave and cautious man who had often before carried the rites of the church to dying men in the midst of the enemy was in a secular dress and when berenger had given the password and obtained admittance they separated and only met again to cross the bridge they found osbert and humfrey on guard saying that the sufferer still lingered occasionally in a terrible paroxysm of bodily anguish but usually silent except when he upbraided osbert with his masters breach of promise or incapacity to bring a priest through his huguenot friends  such a taunt was on his tongue when pere colombeau entered and checked the scoff by saying see my son you have met with more pardon and mercy even on earth than you had imagined possible  there was a strange spasm on narcisses ghastly face as though he almost regretted the obligation forced on him but berenger scarcely saw him again it was needful for the security of the priest and the tranquillity of the religious rites that he should keep watch outside lest any of the more fanatical of the huguenots should deem it their duty to break in on what they had worked themselves into believing offensive idolatry  his watch did not prove uncalled for at different times he had to plead the kings safeconduct and his own honour and even to defend his own protestantism by appealing to his wounds and services hearts were not soft enough then for the cruelty of disturbing a dying man to be any argument at all in that fierce camp but even there the name of pere colombeau met with respect the saintly priest had protected too many enemies for any one who had heard of him to wish him ill  nearly all night was berenger thus forced to remain on guard that the sole hope of narcisses repentance and salvation might not be swept away by violence from without renewing bitterness within not till towards morning was he called back the hard lingering death struggle had spent itself and slow convulsive gasps showed that life was nearly gone but the satanic sneer had passed away and a hand held out a breathing like the word pardon seemed to be half uttered and was answered from the bottom of berengers kind and pitying heart another quarter of an hour and narcisse de ribaumont nid de merle was dead the priest looked pale exhausted shocked but would reveal nothing of the frame of mind he had shown only that if he had been touched by any saving penitence it was owing to his kinsman  berenger wished to send the corpse to rest in the family vault at bellaise where the chevalier had so lately been laid and the priest undertook to send persons with a flag of truce to provide for the transport as well as to announce the death to the sister and the aunt wearied as he was he would not accept berengers earnest invitation to come and take rest and refreshment in the priors rooms but took leave of him at the further side of the fortress with almost reverent blessings as to one not far from the kingdom of heaven and berenger with infinite peacefulness in his heart went home in the silence of the sunday morning and lay sleeping away his long fatigue through the chief part of the day while pastor merlin was preaching and eloquent sermon upon his good brother isaac gardon and eustacie shed filial tears more of tenderness than sorrow     chapter xliv the galimafre       speats and raxes speats and raxes speat and raxes                       lord somervilles billet   never wont to let the grass grow under his feet henry of navarre was impatient of awaiting his troops at pont de dronne and proposed to hasten on to quinet as a convenient centre for collecting the neighbouring gentry for conference thus early on monday a party of about thirty set forth on horseback including the ribaumonts rayonette being perched by turns in front of her father or mother and the duke de quinet declaring that he should do his best to divide the journey into stages not too long for philip since he was anxious to give his mother plenty of time to make preparations for her royal guest  he had however little reckoned on the young kings promptitude the first courier he had dispatched was overtaken at a cabaret only five leagues from pont de dronne baiting his horse as he said the second was found on the road with a lame horse and the halt a days journey remained beyond it the last stage had been ridden much to the dukes discontent for it brought them to a mere village inn with scarcely any accommodation the only tolerable bed was resigned by the king to the use of philip whose looks spoke the exhaustion of which his tongue scorned to complain so painful and feverish a night ensued that eustacie was anxious that he should not move until the duke should as he promised send a mule litter back for him but this proposal he resented and in the height of his constitutional obstinacy appeared booted and spurred at the first signal to mount  nor could eustacie as she soon perceived annoy him more than by showing her solicitude for him or attracting to him the notice of the other cavaliers as the only lady of the party she received a great deal of attention with some of which she would gladly have dispensed whether it were the kings habit of calling her la belle eurydice or because as she said he was si laid and reminded her of old unhappy days of constraint she did not like him and had almost displeased her husband and his brother by saying so she would gladly have avoided the gallantries of this days ride by remaining with philip at the inn but not only was this impossible but the peculiar illtemper of concealed suffering made philip drive her off whenever she approached him with inquiries so that she was forced to leave him to his brother and osbert and ride forward between the king and the duke the last of whom she really liked  welcome was the sight of the grand old chateau its mighty wings of chestnut forest stretching up the hills on either side and the stately avenue extending before it but just then the last courier was discovered reeling in his saddle under the effects of repeated toasts in honour of navarre and quinet  we are fairly sped said the duke to eustacie shrugging his shoulders between amusement and dismay  madame la duchesse is equal to any galimafre said eustacie demurely at which the duke laughed heartily saying it is not for the family credit i fear but for my own  nay triumph makes everything be forgiven  but not forgotten laughed the duke but allons now for the onset we are already seen the forces muster at the gateway  by the time the cavalcade were at the great paved archway into the court the duchess stood at the great door a grandson on either side and a great burly freshcoloured gentleman behind her  m de quinet was off his horse in a second his head bare his hand on the royal rein and signing to his eldest son to hold the stirrup but before the boy had comprehended henry had sprung down and was kissing the old ladys hand saying pardon madame i trust to your goodness for excusing this surprise from an old friends son  neither seeing nor caring for king or prince the stranger gentleman at the same moment pounced upon eustacie and her little girl crying aloud in english here she is my dear i am glad to see you give her to me poor berengers little darling ah she does not understand wheres merrycourt  just then there was another english exclamation my father father dear father and philip flinging himself from the saddle fell almost prone on that broad breast sobbing convulsively while the eyes that as he truly boasted had never wasted a tear on his enemies were streaming so fast that his fathers welcome savoured of reproof whats all this before these french too  take care father cried berenger leaping from his horse he has an ugly wound just where you are holding him  wounded my poor boy look up  where is your room sir said berenger seeing his hosts entirely occupied with the king and at once lifting the almost helpless philip like a little child in his strong arms he followed sir marmaduke who as if walking in his sleep led the way up the great stone staircase that led outside the house to the upper chambers  after a short interval the duchess in the plenitude of her glory at entertaining her dear queens son came up en grande tenue leading the king by the hand the duke walking backwards in front and his two sons each holding a big wax candle on either side  here sire is the chamber where the excellent queen did me the honour to repose herself  the duke swung open the door of the state bedchamber there on the velvethung bed sat le gros chevalier anglais whom she had herself installed there on saturday both his hands were held fast in those of a youth who lay beside him deadly pale and half undressed with the little ribaumont attending to a wound in his side while her child was held in the arms of a very tall baldheaded young man who stood at the foot of the bed the whole group of interlopers looked perfectly glorified with happiness and delight even the wounded youth ghastly and suffering as he was lay stroking the big englishmans hand with a languid caressing air of content almost like that of a dog who has found his master none of them were the least embarrassed they evidently thought this a visit of inquiry after the patient and while the duchess stood confounded and the duke much inclined to laugh eustacie turned eagerly exclaiming ah madame i am glad you are come may i beg mademoiselle perrot for some of your cooling mallow salve riding has sadly inflamed the wound  ridingwith such a wound are we all crazed said madame la duchesse absolutely bewildered out of her dignified equanimity and her son seeing her for once at a loss came to her rescue his grace will condescend to the andromeda chamber madame he kindly gave up his bed to our young friend last night when there was less choice than you can give him  they all moved off again and before eustacie was ready for the mallows madame de quinet for whom the very name of a wound had an attraction returned with two handmaidens bearing bandages and medicaments having by this time come to the perception that the wounded youth was the son of the big englishman who had arrived with young mericour in search of her little protegee and that the tall man was the husband so long supposed to be dead she was curious to see her pupils surgery of which she highly approved though she had no words to express her indignation at the folly of traveling so soon indeed nothing but the passiveness of fatigue could have made her despotism endurable to philip but he cared for nothing so long as he could see his fathers face and hear his voicethe full tones that his ear had yearned for among the sharp expression of the french accentand sir marmaduke seemed to find the same perfect satisfaction in the sight of him indeed all were so rejoiced to be together that they scarcely exerted themselves to ask questions when berenger would have made some explanation sir marmaduke only said tell me not yet my dear boy i see it is all right and my head will hold no more yet but that i have you and the lad again thank god for it never mind how  when however with some difficulty they got him away from philips bedside down to supper the king came and made him high compliments upon the distinguished bravery of his sons and mericour interpreted till sir marmadukethough answering that of course the lads must do their duty and he was only glad to hear they had done itbecame more and more radiant and proud as he began to gather what their trials and what their steadfastness and courage had been his goodly face beaming with honest gladness was as henry told the duchess an absolute ornament to her table  unable however to converse with any one but berenger and mericour and pining all the time to get back to his son the lengthy and ceremonious meal was a weary penance to him and so soon as his release was possible he made his way upstairs again where he found philip much refreshed by a long sleep and only afraid that he should find the sight of his father merely a dream then when satisfied on that head eager to hear of all at homethe sisters the dogs my mother and my little brother as he arranged his inquiry  ha you heard of that did you  yes said philip the villains gave us letters onceonly onceand those what they thought would sting us most o father how could you all think such foul shame of berry  dont speak of it phil i never did nor aunt cecily not for a moment but my lord is not the man he was and those foes of yours must have set abroad vile reports for the very purpose of deceiving us and then this child must needs be born poor little rogue i shall be able to take to him now all is right again but by st george they have tormented me so about him and wanted me to take him as a providence to join the estates together instead of you and berry that i never thought to care so little for a child of my own  we drank his health at nid de merle and were not a little comforted that you would have him in our place  id ratherwell it skills not talking of it but it just shows the way of women after all the outcry dame annora had made about her poor son and no one loving him or heeding his interest save herself no sooner was this little fellow born than she had no thought for any but he and would fain have had her father settle all his lands on him protesting that if berry lived his french lands were enough for him out of sight out of mind is the way with women  womanhood was already made accountable for all lady thistlewoods follies and philip acquiesced asking further nay but how came you hither father was it to seek us or eustacie  both both my lad one morning just after christmas i rid over to combe with my dame behind me and found the house in commotion with a letter that young sidney berrys friend had just sent down by special messenger it had been writ more than a year but bless you these poor foreigners have such crooked ears and tongues that they dont know what to make of a plain mans name and the only wonder was that it ever came at all it seems the duke here had to get it sent over by some of the secret agents the french protestants have in england and what do they do but send it to one of the vivians in cornwall and it was handed about among them for how long i cannot say till there was a chance of sending it up to my lord of warwick and he being able to make nothing if it shows it to his nephew philip sidney who perceiving at once whom it concerned sends it straight to my lord with a handsome letter hoping that it brought good tidings there then it was and so we first knew that the poor lady had not been lost in the sack of the town as master hobbs told us she told us how this duchess had taken her under her protection but that her enemies were seeking her and had even attempted her childs life  the ruffians even so  and she said her old pastor was failing in health and prayed that some trusty person might be sent to bring home at least the child to safety with her kindred there was a letter to the same effect praising her highly too from the duchess saying that she would do her best to guard her but the kinsmen had the law on their side and she would be safer in england well this was fair good news save that we marveled the more how you and berry should have missed her but the matter now was who was the trusty person who should go claude merrycourt was ready  how came he there demanded philip i thought he had gone or been sent off with lady burnets sons  why so he had but theres more to say on that score he was so much in favour at combe that my lord would not be denied his spending the holiday times there and besides last summer we had a mighty coil the horners of mells made me a rare good offer for lucy for their eldest son chiefly because they wanted a wife for him of my lady walwyns and mistress cecilys breeding and my wife was all for accepting it having by that time given up all hope of poor berry but i would have no commands laid on my girl seeing that i had pledged my word not to cross her in the matter and she hung about my neck and prayed me so meekly to leave her unwedded that i must have been made of stone not to yield to her so i told mr horner that his son jack must wait for little nancy if he wanted a daughter of mineand the stripling is young enough i believe he will but womens tongues are not easy to stop and lucy was worn so thin and had tears in her eyesthat she thought i never markedwhenever she was fretted or flouted and at last i took her back to stay at combe for aunt cecily to cheer up a bit andwell well to get rid of the matter and silence dame nan i consented to a betrothal between her and merrycourtsince she vowed she would rather wait single for him than wed any one else he is a good youth and is working himself to a shadow between studying and teaching but as to sending him alone to bring berrys wife back he was overyoung for that no one could do that fitly save myself and i only wish i had gone three years ago to keep you two foolish lads out of harms way but they set up an unheardof hubbub and made sure i should lose myself what are you laughing at you jacksauce  to think of you starting father with not a word of french and never from home further than once to london  ah you thought to come the traveled gentleman over me but ive been even with you i made dame nan teach me a few words but i never could remember anything but that mercy is thank ye however merrycourt offered to come with me and my lord wished it moreover i thought he might aid in tracing you out so i saw my lord alone and he passed his word to me that come what would no one should persuade him to alter his will to do wrong to berengers daughter and so soon as master hobbs could get the throstle unladen and fitted out again we sailed for bordeau and there he is waiting for us while clause and i bought horses and hired a guide and made our way here on saturday where we were very welcome and the duchess said she would but wait till she could learn there were no bands of the enemy at hand to go down with me herself to the place where she had sent the lady a right worthy dame is this same duchess and a stately and that young king as they call him seems hard to please for he told berry that his wifes courtliness and ease in his reception were far above aught that he found here what he means is past a plain man for as to berrys wife she is handy and notable enough and tis well he loves her so well but what a little brown thing it is for a man to have gone through such risks for nothing to look at beside his mother  if you could only see madame de selinville sighed philip thenah sir you would know the worth of eustacie had you seen her in yonder town  very like said sir marmaduke but after all our fears at home of a fine court madam it takes one aback to see a little homely brown thing clad like a serving wench well dame nan will not be displeased she always said the girl would grow up no beauty and tis the way of women to brook none fairer than themselves better so she is a good protestant and has done rarely by you phil  truly i might be glad twas no court madam that stood by me when berry was called back to the fight and for the little one tis the loveliest and bravest little maid i ever saw have they told you of the marigolds father  why the king told the whole to the duchess so berry said and then drank the health of the daughter of the bravest of knights and berry held her up in his arms to bow again and drink to them from his glass berry looked a proud man i can tell you and a comely spite of his baldness and tis worth having come here to see how much you lads are thought ofthough to be sure tis not often the poor creatures here see so much of an englishman as we have made of berry  philip could not but laugh tis scarce for that that they value him sir  say you so nay methinks his english heart and yours did them good service indeed the king himself told me as much by the mouth of merrycourt may that youngsters head only not be turned why they set him at table above berenger and above half the kings gentlemen even the duchess makes as if he were one of her highest guestshe a poor oxford scholar doubting if he can get his bread by the law and flouted as though he were not good enough for my daughter tis the world topsy turvy sure enough and that this true love that berenger has run through fire and water after like a knight in a pedlars run through turn out a mere little brown commonlooking woman after all not one whit equal to lucy  sir marmaduke modified his disappointment a little that night when he had talked philip into a state of feverishness and suffering that became worse under madame de quinets reproofs and remedies and only yielded to eustacies long and patient soothing he then could almost have owned that it was well she was not like his own cherished type of womanhood and the next day he changed his opinion still more even as to her appearance  there was a great gathering of favourers of the huguenot cause on that day gentlemen came from all parts to consult with henry of navarre and madame de quinet had too much sense of the fitness of things to allow madame de ribaumont to appear at the ensuing banquet in her shabby rusty black serge and tight white borderless cap the whole wardrobe of the poor young duchess de quinet was placed at her service and though with the thought of her adopted father on her heart she refused gay colours yet when her toilette complete she said into philips room he almost sprang up in delight and sir marmaduke rose and ceremoniously bowed as to a stranger and was only undeceived when little rayonette ran joyously to philip asking if manan was not si belle si belle  the effects of her unrestful nights has now passed away and left her magnificent eyes in their full brilliancy and arch fire the blooming glow was restored to her cheek and though neck brow and hands were browner than in the shelter of convent or palace she was far more near absolute beauty than in former days both from countenance and from age her little proud head was clustered with glossy locks of jet still short but curling round her brow and neck whose warm brunette tints contrasted well with the delicate stiffened cobweb of her exquisite standing ruff which was gathered into a white satin bodice with a skirt of the same material over which swept a rich black brocade train open in front with an open body and halfsleeves with falling lace and the hands delicate and shapely as ever if indeed a little tanned held fan and handkerchief with as much courtly grace as though they had never stirred broth nor wrung out linen sir marmaduke really feared he had the court madam on his hands after all but he forgot all about his fears as she stood laughing and talking and by her pretty airs and gestures smiles and signs making him enter into her mirth with philip almost as well as if she had not spoken french  even berenger started when he came up after the counsel to fetch her to the banquetinghall she was more entirely the eustacie of the louvre than he had ever realized seeing her and yet so much more and when the duchess beheld the sensation she produced among the noblesse it was with selfcongratulation in having kept her in retirement while it was still not known that she was not a widow the king of navarre had already found her the only lady present possessed of the peculiar aroma of highbreeding which belonged to the society in which both he and she had been most at home and his attentions were more than she liked from one whose epithet of eurydice she had never quite forgiven at least that was the only reason she could assign for her distaste but the duchess understood her better than did berenger nay better than she did herself and kept her under the maternal wings of double form and ceremony  berenger meanwhile was in great favour a command had been offered him by the king of navarre who had promised that if he would cast in his lot with the huguenots his claims on all the lands of ribaumont should be enforced on the king of france when terms were wrung from him and narcisses death removed all valid obstacle to their recognition but berenger felt himself bound by all home duties to return to england nor had he clear convictions as to the absolute right of the war in which he had almost unconsciously drawn his sword under the tudors the divine right of kings was strongly believed in and it was with many genuine misgivings that the cause of protestant revolt was favoured by elisabeth and her ministers and berenger bred up in a strong sense of loyalty as well as in doctrines that as he had received them savoured as little of calvinism as of romanism was not ready to espouse the huguenot cause with all his heart and as he could by no means have fought on the side of king henry iii or of the guises felt thankful that the knot could be cut by renouncing france altogether according to the arrangement which had been defeated by the chevaliers own suppersubtle machinations  at the conference of gentlemen held at quinet he had been startled by hearing the name of the sieur de bellaise and had identified him with a grave thin noblelooking man with an air of highbred and patient poverty he was a catholic but no guisard and supported the middle policy of the montmorency party so far as he possessed any influence but his was only the weight of personal character for he had merely a small property that had descended to him through his grandmother the wife of the unfortunate bellaise who had pined to death in the dungeon at loches under louis xi here then berenger saw the right means of riding himself and his family of the burthen that his father had mourned over and it only remained to convince eustacie her first feeling when she heard of the kings offer was that at last her ardent wish would be gratified she should see her husband at the head of her vassals and hear the warcry motto a moi ribaumont then came the old representation that the vendeen peasants were faithful catholics who could hardly be asked to fight on the calvinist side the old spirit rose in a flush a pout a halfuttered query why those creatures should be allowed their opinions madame la baronne was resuming her haughty temperament in the noblesse atmosphere but in the midst came the remembrance of having made that very speech in her temple ruinof the grave sad look of rebuke and shake of the head with which the good old minister had received itand how she had sulked at him till forced to throw herself on him to hinder her separation from her child she burst into tears and as berenger in some distress began to assure her that he would and could do nothing without her consent she struggled to recover voice to say no no i only grieve that i am still as wicked as ever after these three years with that saint my dear father do as you will only pardon me the little fierce one  and then when she was made to perceive that her husband would have to fight alone and could not take her with him to share his triumphs or bind his wounds at least not except by bringing her in contact with henry of navarre and that atmosphere of the old court she acquiesced the more readily she was a woman who could feel but not reason and though she loved nid de merle and had been proud of it berengers description of the illused sieur de bellaise had the more effect on her because she well remembered the traditions whispered among the peasants with whom her childhood had been passed that the village crones declared nothing had gone well with the place since the bellaise had been expelled with a piteous tale of the brokenhearted lady that she had never till now understood  for the flagrant injustice perpetrated on her uncle and cousin in the settlement on berenger and herself she cared little thinking they had pretty well repaid themselves and not entering into berengers deeper view that this injustice was the more to be deplored as the occasion of their guilt but she had no doubt or question as to the grand stroke of yielding up her claims on the estate to the sieur de bellaise the generosity of the deed struck her imagination and if berenger would not lead her vassals to battle she did not want them there was no difficulty with sir marmaduke he only vowed that he liked berengers wife all the better for being free of so many yards of french dirt tacked to her petticoat and philip hated the remembrance of those red sugarloaf pinnacles far too much not to wish his brother to be rid of them  m de bellaise when once he understood that restitution was intended astonished sir marmaduke by launching himself on berengers neck with tears of joy and henry of navarre though sorry to lose such a partisan as the young baron allowed that the bellaise claims being those of a catholic might serve to keep out some far more dangerous person whom the court party might select in opposition to an outlaw and a protestant like m de ribaumont  so you leave us he said in private to berenger to whom he had taken a great liking i cannot blame you for not casting your lot into such a witchs caldron as this poor country my friends think i dallied at court like rinaldo in armidas garden they do not understand that when one hears the name of bourbon one does not willingly make war with the crown still less that the good calvin left a doctrine bitter to the taste and tough of digestion maybe since i have been forced to add my spoon to stir the caldron it may clear itself if so you will remember that you have rights in normandy and picardy  this was the royal farewell henry and his suite departed the next morning but the duchess insisted on retaining her other guests till philips cure should be complete meantime claude de mericour had written to his brother and arranged a meeting with him he was now no boy who could be coerced but a staid selfreliant scholarly person with a sword by his side and an english passport to secure him and his brother did not regard him as quite the disgrace to his family he had at first deemed him he was at least no rebel and though the law seemed to french eyes infinitely beneath the dignity of a scion of nobility still it was something not to have him a heretic preacher and to be able at least to speak of him as betrothed to the sister of the baron de ribaumont moreover that huguenot kinsman whose extreme calvinist opinions had so nearly revolted mericour had died and left him all his means as the only protestant in the family and the amount when claude arranged matters with his brother proved to be sufficient to bear him through his expenses handsomely as a student with the hope of marriage so soon as he should have kept his terms at the temple  and thus the good ship throstle bore home the whole happy party to weymouth and good sir marmaduke had an unceasing cause for exultation in the brilliant success of his mission to france  after all the first to revisit that country was no other than the once homesick philip he wearied of inaction and thought his county neighbours ineffably dull and lubberly while they blamed him for being a fine frenchified gentleman even while finding no fault with their old friend berenger or that notable little lively housewifely lady his wife whose broken english and bright simplicity charmed every one sorely philip needed something to do he might have been a gentleman pensioner but he had no notion he said of loitering after a lady to boat and hunt when such a king as henry of navarre was in the field and he agreed with eustacie in her estimate of the court that it was horribly dull and wanting in all the sparkle and brilliancy that even he had perceived at paris  eustacie gladly retreated to housewifery at combe walwyn but a strenuous endeavour on lady thistlewoods part to marry her stepson to a dorset kings daughter together with the tidings of the renewed war in france spurred philip into writing permission from his father to join the king of navarre as a volunteer  years went by and philip was only heard of in occasional letters accompanied by presents to his sisters and to little rayonette and telling of marches exploits and battleshow he had taken a standard of the league at coutras and how he had led a charge of pikemen at ivry for which he received the thanks of henry iv but though so near home he did not set foot on english ground till the throne of france was secured to the hero of navarre and he had marched into paris in guise very unlike the manner he had left it  then home he came a bronzed gallantlooking warrior the pride of the county ready for repose and for aid to his father in his hearty old age and bearing with him a pressing invitation from the king to monsieur and madame de ribaumont to resume their rank at court berenger who had for many years only known himself as lord walwyn shook his head i thank the king he said but i am better content to breed up my children as wholly english he bade me to return when he should have stirred the witchs caldron into clearness alas all he has done is to make brilliant colours shine on the vapour thereof nay phil i know your ardent love for him and marvel not at it before he joined the catholic church i trusted that he might have given truth to the one party and unity to the other but when the clergy accepted him with all his private vices and he surrendered unconditionally i lost hope i fear there is worse in store queen catherine did her most fatal work of evil when she corrupted henry of navarre  if you say more berry i shall be ready to challenge you said philip when you saw him you little knew the true king of souls that he is is greatness or his love for his country  nay i believe it but tell me philip did you not hint that you had been among former friendsat lucon you said i think  philips face changed yes it was for that i wished to see you alone my troop had to occupy the place i had to visit the convent to arrange for quartering my men so as least to scandalize the sisters the abbess came to speak to me i knew her only by her eyes she is changedaged wan thin with their discipline and fastsbut she once or twice smiled as she alone in old times could smile the place rings with her devotion her charity her penances and truly her face ishe could hardly speaklike that of a saint she knew me at once asked for you all and bade me tell you that now she prays for you and yours continually and blesses you for having opened to her the way of peace ah berry i always told you she had not her equal  think you so even now  how should i not when i have seen what repentance has made of her  so said berenger rather sorrowfully our great protestant champion has still left his heart behind in a french convent  stay berenger do you remember yonder villain conjurers prediction that i should wed none but a lady whose cognizance was the leopard  and you seem bent on accomplishing it said berenger  nay but in another mannerthat which you devised on the spur of the moment berenger i knew the sorcerer spake sooth when that little moonbeam child of yours brought me the flowers from the rampart i had speech with her last night she has all the fair loveliness that belongs of right to your mothers grandchild but her eye blue as it is has the ribaumont spirit the turn of the head and the smile are what i loved long ago in yonder lady and above all she is her own sweet self berenger give me your daughter berangere and i ask no portion with her but the silver bullet keep the pearls for your sons heirloom all i ask with rayonette is the silver bullet   the end
