civilisation                     125       lecture i westminster abbey   reverence for age at least so it has long seemed to me reverence for age i say is a fair test of the vigour of youth and conversely insolence toward the old and the past whether in individuals or in nations is a sign rather of weakness than of strength  and the cause i think is this  the rich and strong young natures which feel themselves capable of original thought and work have a corresponding respect for those who in the generations gone by have thought and worked as they hope to do hereafter  and this temper understand me so far from being servile or even merely conservative usually accompanies true independence of spirit  the young athlete like the young racehorse does not despise but emulate his sire even though the old victor be long past his prime  the young soldier admires the old general the young midshipman the old admiral just in proportion as he himself is likely to be a daring and able officer hereafter  the son when grown to man’s estate may say to his father i look on you still with all respect and admiration  i have learnt and desire always to learn from you but you must be to me now not a dictator but an example  you became what you are by following your own line and you must let me rival you and do you honour by following mine  this i believe is true of nations as well as of individuals  i do not hesitate to say that paradoxical as it may seem the most original races—those who have succeeded best and left their stamp most broadly and permanently on the human race—have also been the most teachable provided they were allowed to learn in their own way and to adapt to their own purposes any higher ancient civilisation with which they came in contact what more striking instances of this truth—for truth it is—than the reverence of the free republican greek for the old despotic civilisation of egypt and of the free norseman our own ancestor for the old and equally despotic civilisation of rome  these—the two most originative and most progressive races of europe—had a faith in an awe of the supposed or real wisdom of the men of old time which was often exaggerated into a superstition but never—thanks to their own innate force—degenerated into a bondage  pardon me this somewhat dry proœmium and pardon me too if it leads me on to a compliment to the american people which i trust you will not think impertinent  for i have seen and seen with joy a like spirit in those americans whom it has been my good fortune to meet in my own land  i mean this—that i found in them however selfteaching and selfdetermining they might be that genial reverence for antiquity which i hold to be the sign of a truly generous—that is in the right sense of the grand old word—a truly highbred nature  i have been touched and deeply touched at finding so many of them on landing for the first time at liverpool hurrying off to our quaint old city of chester to gaze on its old girdle of walls and towers roman mediæval caroline its curious ‘rows’ of overhanging houses its fragments of roman baths and inscriptions its modest little cathedral and the—really very few—relics of english history which it contains  even two banners of an old cheshire regiment which had been in the peninsular war were almost as interesting to some as an illuminated bible of the early middle age  more than once have i had to repress the enthusiasm of some charming lady and say ‘but this is nothing  do not waste your admiration here  go on  see the british museum its marbles and its manuscripts—see the french cathedrals the ruins of provence and italy the galleries of florence naples rome’  ‘ah but you must remember’ was the answer ‘these are the first old things i ever saw’  a mere sentiment  yes but as poets know and statesmen ought to know it is by sentiment when well directed—as by sorrow when well used—by sentiment i say great nations live  when sentiment dies out and mere prosaic calculation of loss and profit takes its place then comes a byzantine epoch a chinese epoch decrepitude and slow decay  and so the eagerness of those generous young souls was to me a good augury for the future of them and of their native land  they seemed to me—and i say again it touched me often deeply—to be realising to themselves their rightful place in the community of the civilised nations of all lands and of all times—realising to themselves that they were indeed      heirs of all the ages foremost in the ranks of time  and minded therefore like wise and noble heirs not to despise and squander but to treasure and to use that inheritance and the accumulated labours of the mighty dead  i saw this i say at chester  and therefore i was not surprised to find the pleasant experience repeated and to even a higher degree at westminster  a pleasant experience i say  i know few more agreeable occupations than showing a party of americans round our own great abbey and sentimentalising if you will in sympathy with them over england’s pantheon  i pause to confess once more that it is almost an impertinence in me to pay you such a compliment  you have a right to answer me—how could it be otherwise—are we not educated people  has not our taste been trained by native authors who were at least civilised enough to value the great past without the need of any european crossing the seas to tell us of its wealth  if you reprove me thus i can but say that the reproof is just and will remain just as long as your poets are what they are and as long above all as you reverence as much in america as we do in england the poetry of mr longfellow  he has not if i recollect aright ever employed his muse in commemorating our great abbey but that muse is instinct with all those lofty and yet tender emotions which the sight of that great abbey should call out  he knows as few know on our side of the wide water the effect chastening and yet ennobling of such architecture consecrated by such associations  he has not only perceived and drank in all that is purest and noblest in the now sleeping last ten centuries but he has combined it again and again with that which is purest and noblest in the waking and yearning present and combined it organically and livingly as leaf and stem combines with flower and fruit  yes as long as the poet who could write both the belfry of bruges and the village blacksmith is read among you there is no need for me to bid you reverence the past and little need i trust for me to tell those whom i leave at home to reverence the present  for it is a fact—of which some americans may not be as well aware as they should be—that your exquisite poet has exercised an influence in britain it may be as great as and certainly more varied than that which he has exercised in his native land  with us—as i presume with you—he has penetrated into thousands of puritan homes and awakened tens of thousands of young hearts to the beauty and the nobleness of the old prereformation age and of that romance and art from which their too exclusive hereditary training had until his time shut them out  and he has thus truly done a sacred deed in turning the hearts of the children to their fathers  that was enough but that is not the whole  he has conversely turned the hearts of the fathers to the children  the worldwide humanity of his poems and to be just of all your american poets who have studied in his school has produced throughout great britain a just reverence and affection for the american mind which will have—which has had already—large social and political results  be sure be sure that in spite of passing jars our empire will never be long unjust to yours while mr longfellow and mr lowell remain not merely the household bards—though that is much—but counsellors comforters and trusted friends to hundreds of thousands of gentle and earnest souls from the palace to the parsonage from the little village shop to the farmhouse on the lonely down  but there is another american author—who was the delight of my own youth and who should have been my teacher also for he was a master of our common tongue and his prose is as graceful and felicitous as poor elia’s own and it is certainly more manly—another american author i say who with that highbred reverence for what is old has told you already more about westminster abbey and told it better than i am likely to tell it need i say that i mean the lamented washington irving  ah that our authors had always been as just to you as he was just to us and indeed more than just for in his courtesy and geniality he saw us somewhat en beau and treated old john bull too much as the poet advises us to treat young and fair ladies—      be to their faults a little blind     be to their virtues very kind  but what a charming book is that old ‘sketchbook’  and what a charming essay that on our great abbey set with such gems of prose as these—  ‘the sun was pouring down a yellow autumnal ray into the square of the cloisters beaming upon a scanty spot of grass in the centre and lighting up an angle of the vaulted passage with a kind of dusty splendour  from between the arcades the eye glanced up to a bit of blue sky or a passing cloud and beheld the sungilt pinnacles of the abbey towering into the azure heaven’  or this again describing the general effect of henry the seventh’s unrivalled chapel—‘the very walls are wrought into universal ornament encrusted with tracery and scooped into niches crowded with the statues of saints and martyrs  stone seems by the cunning labour of the chisel to have been robbed of its weight and density suspended aloft as if by magic and the fretted roof achieved with the wonderful minuteness and airy security of a cobweb’  ‘dusty splendour’ ‘airy security’ epithets so unexpected and yet so felicitous as to be seemingly accidental  such are the tokens of that highest art which is—to conceal its own existence  after such speech as that what have i to tell you of the great old abbey  yet there are one or two things i dare to say which washington irving would have written differently had he visited westminster not forty years ago but now  i think in the first place that if he visited the great abbey now he would not have noticed that look of dilapidation at which he hints—and perhaps had a right to hint—some forty years ago  dilapidation dirt and negligence are as hateful to us now as to the builder of the newest house outside  we too for more than a generation past have felt in common with the rest of england and with all the nations of northern europe that awakened reverence for mediæval art and mediæval history which is—for good and for evil—the special social phenomenon of our times the natural and on the whole useful countercheck to that extreme of revolutionary feeling which issues—as it did in paris but three years ago—in utter hatred and renunciation of the past and destruction of its monuments  to preserve to restore and if not to copy as a sort of filial duty the buildings which our forefathers have left us is now held to be the very mark of cultivation and good taste in britain  it may be that we carry it too far that by a servile and chinese exactness of imitation we are crippling what originality of genius may exist among our draughtsmen sculptors architects  but we at least confess thereby that we cannot invent and create as could our ancestors five hundred years ago and as long as that is the case it is more wise in us—as in any people—to exhaust the signification and power of the past and to learn all we can from older schools of art and thought ere we attempt novelties of our own which i confess freely usually issue in the ugly and the ludicrous  be that as it may we of westminster abbey have become like other englishmen repairers and restorers  had we not so become the nation would have demanded an account of us as guardians of its national mausoleum the building of which our illustrious dean has so well said—  ‘of all the characteristics of westminster abbey that which most endears it to the nation and gives most force to its name—which has more than anything else made it the home of the people of england and the most venerated fabric of the english church—is not so much its glory as the seat of the coronations or as the sepulchre of the kings not so much its school or its monastery or its chapter or its sanctuary as the fact that it is the restingplace of famous englishmen from every rank and creed and every form of genius  it is not only reims cathedral and st denys both in one but it is what the pantheon was intended to be to france—what the valhalla is to germany—what santa croce is to italy   it is this which inspired the saying of nelson—victory or westminster abbey  it is this which has intertwined it with so many eloquent passages of macaulay  it is this which gives point to the allusions of recent nonconformist statesmen least inclined to draw illustrations from ecclesiastical buildings  it is this which gives most promise of vitality to the whole institution  kings are no longer buried within its walls even the splendour of pageants has ceased to attract  but the desire to be buried in westminster abbey is as strong as ever  ‘this sprang in the first instance as a natural offshoot from the coronations and interments of the kings  had they like those of france of spain of austria of russia—been buried far away in some secluded spot or had the english nation stood aloof from the english monarchy it might have been otherwise  the sepulchral chapels built by henry the third and henry the seventh might have stood alone in their glory  no meaner dust need ever have mingled with the dust of plantagenets tudors stuarts and guelphs     but it has been the peculiar privilege of the kings of england that neither in life nor in death have they been parted from their people  as the council of the nation and the courts of law have pressed into the palace of westminster and engirdled the very throne itself so the ashes of the great citizens of england have pressed into the sepulchre of the kings and surrounded them as with a guard of honour after their death  we are sometimes inclined bitterly to contrast the placid dignity of our recumbent kings with chatham gesticulating from the northern transept or pitt from the western door or shakspeare leaning on his column in poet’s corner or wolfe expiring by the chapel of st john  but in fact they are in their different ways keeping guard over the shrine of our monarchs and our laws and their very incongruity and variety become symbols of that harmonious diversity in unity which pervades our whole commonwealth’  honoured by such a trust we who serve god daily in the great abbey are not unmindful of the duty which lies on us to preserve and to restore to the best of our power the general fabric and to call on government and on private persons to preserve and restore those monuments for which they not we are responsible  a stranger will not often enter our abbey without finding somewhere or other among its vast arcades skilled workmen busy over mosaic marble bronze or ‘storied window richly dight’ and the very cloisters which to washington irving’s eye were ‘discoloured with damp crumbling with age and crusted with a coat of hoary moss’ are being repaired till that ‘rich tracery of the arches and that leafy beauty of the roses which adorn the keystones’—of which he tells—shall be as sharp and bright as they were first 500 years ago  one sentiment again which was called up in the mind of your charming essayist at the sight of westminster abbey i have not felt myself i mean its sadness  ‘what’ says he ‘is this vast assembly of sepulchres but a treasury of humiliation a huge pile of reiterated homilies on the emptiness of renown and the certainty of oblivion’  so does that ‘mournful magnificence’ of which he speaks seem to have weighed on him that he takes for the motto of his whole essay that grand elizabethan epigram—      when i behold with deep astonishment     to famous westminster how there resort     living in brasse or stony monument     the princes and the worthies of all sort     do i not see reformed nobilitie     without contempt or pride or ostentation     and look upon offenseless majestie     naked of pomp or earthly domination     and how a playgame of a painted stone     contents the quiet now and silent sprites     whom all the world which late they stood upon     could not content nor quench their appetites     life is a frost of cold felicities     and death the thaw of all our vanities  true true—who knows it not who has lived fifty years in such a world as this—and yet but half the truth  were there no afterlife no juster home beyond the grave where each good deed—so spake the most august of lips—shall in no wise lose its reward—is it nought virûm volitare per ora to live upon the lips of men and find an immortality even for a few centuries in their hearts i know what answer healthy souls have made in every age to that question and what they will make to the end as long as the respect of their fellowcreatures is as our creator meant that it should be precious to virtuous men  and let none talk of ‘the playgame of a painted stone’ of ‘the worthless honours of a bust’  the worth of honour lies in that same worthlessness  fair money wage for fair work done no wise man will despise  but that is pay not honour the very preciousness whereof—like the old victor’s parsley crown in the greek games—is that it had no value gave no pleasure save that which is imperishable spiritual and not to be represented by gold nor quintessential diamond  therefore to me at least the abbey speaks not of vanity and disappointment but of content and peace      the quiet now and silent sprites  of whom old christolero sings they are content and well for them that they should be  they have received their nation’s thanks and ask no more save to lie there in peace  they have had justice done them and more than one is there who had scant justice done him while alive  even castlereagh is there in spite of byron’s and of shelley’s scorn  it may be that they too have found out ere now that there he ought to be  the nation has been just to him who in such wild times as the world had not seen for full three hundred years did his duty according to his light and died in doing it and his sad noble face looks down on englishmen as they go by not with reproach but rather with content  content i say and peace  peace from their toil and peace with their fellowmen  they are at least at rest  obdormierunt in pace  they have fallen asleep in peace  the galled shoulder is freed from the collar at last  the brave old horse has done his stage and lain down in the inn  there are no more mistakes now no more sores no more falls and no more whip thank god laid on too often when it was least needed and most felt  and there are no more quarrels too  old personal feuds old party bickerings old differences of creed and hatreds in the name of the god of love—all those are past in that world of which the abbey is to me a symbol and a sacrament  pitt and fox warren hastings and macaulay they can afford to be near to each other in the abbey for they understand each other now elsewhere and the romish abbot’s bones do not stir in their grave beside the bones of the protestant divine whom he it may be would have burned alive on earth  in the south aisle of henry the viith’s chapel lies in royal pomp she who so long was britain’s bane—‘the daughter of debate who discord still did sow’—poor mary queen of scots  but english and scots alike have forgotten the streams of noble blood she cost their nations and look sadly and pityingly upon her effigy—why not      nothing is left of her     now but pure womanly  and in the corresponding aisle upon the north in a like tomb—which the voice of the english people demanded from the son of mary stuart—lies even a sadder figure still—poor queen elizabeth  to her indeed in her last days vanity of vanities—all was vanity  tyrone’s rebellion killed her  ‘this fruit have i of all my labours which i have taken under the sun’—and with a whole book of ecclesiastes written on her mighty heart the old crowned lioness of england coiled herself up in her lair refused food and died and took her place henceforth opposite to her ‘dear cousin’ whom she really tried to save from herself—who would have slain her if she could and whom she had at last in obedience to the voice of the people of england to slay against her will  they have made up that quarrel now  ay and that tomb is the sacred symbol of a reconciliation even more pathetic and more strange  elizabeth lies—seemingly by her own desire—in the same vault as her own sister mary tudor  ‘bloody mary’ now no more  james the first who had no love for either of them has placed at the head of the monument ‘two lines’ as has been well said ‘full of a far deeper feeling than we should naturally have ascribed to him’—  ‘fellows in the kingdom and in the tomb here we sleep mary and elizabeth the sisters in hope of the resurrection’  i make no comment on those words or on that double sepulchre  but did i not say well that the great abbey was a place of peace—a place to remind hardworked purblind and often alas embittered souls—      for mother earth she gathers all     into her bosom great and small     ah could we look into her face     we should not shrink from her embrace  yes all old misunderstandings are cleared up by now in that just world wherein all live to god  they live to god and therefore the great abbey is to me awful indeed but never sad  awful it ought to be for it is a symbol of both worlds the seen and the unseen and of the veil as thin as cobweb yet opaque as night which parts the two  awful it is and ought to be—like that with which it grew—the life of a great nation growing slowly to manhood as all great nations grow through ignorance and waywardness often through sin and sorrow hewing onward a devious track through unknown wildernesses and struggling victorious though with bleeding feet athwart the tangled woods and thorny brakes of stern experience  awful it is and should be  and therefore i at least do not regret that its very form outside should want those heavenpointing spires that delicate lightness that airy joyousness of many a foreign cathedral—even of our own salisbury and lichfield  you will see in its outer shape little if any of that type of architecture which was as i believe copied from scenery with which you as americans must be even more familiar than were the mediæval architects who travelled through the german forests and across the alps to rome  true we have our noble highpitched snowroof  our architect like the rest had seen the mountain ranges jut black and bare above the snows of winter  he had seen those snows slip down in sheets rush down in torrents from the sun off the steep slabs of rock which coped the hillside and he like the rest has copied in that roof for use as well as beauty the mountain rocks  but he has not as many another mediæval architect has done decked his roofs as nature has decked hers with the spruce and firtree spires which cling to the hillside of the crag old above young pinnacle above pinnacle whorl above whorl and clothed with them the sides and summit of the stone mountain which he had raised till like a group of firs upon an isolated rock every point of the building should seem in act to grow toward heaven and the grey leads of the minster roof stand out amid peaks and turrets rich with carven foliage as the grey rocks stand out of the primæval woods  that part of the mediæval builder’s task was left unfinished and indeed hardly attempted by our westminster architects either under henry iii edward i or henry v  their minster is grand enough by grave height and severe proportion and he who enters stooping under that lowbrowed arch of the north door beneath the beetling crag of weatherworn and crumbling stone may feel like one who in some old northern fairy tale enters a cave in some lone mountain side where trolls and dragons guard the hoards of buried kings  and awful it is and should be still inside under that vaulted roof a hundred feet above all more mysterious and more huge and yet more soft beneath the murky london air  but sad i cannot call it  nor i think would you feel it sad when you perceive how richly successive architects have squandered on it the treasures of their fancy and made it so they say perhaps the most splendid specimen in the world of one of those stone forests in which the men of old delighted to reproduce those leafy minsters which god not man has built where they sent the columns aloft like the boles of giant trees and wreathed their capitals sometimes their very shafts with vines and flowers and decked with foliage and with fruit the bosses above and the corbels below and sent up out of those corbels upright shafts along the walls in likeness of the trees which sprang out of the rocks above their head and raised those walls into great cliffs and pierced those cliffs with the arches of the triforium as with wild creatures’ caves or hermits’ cells and represented in the horizontal stringcourses and windowsills the strata of the rocks and opened the windows into wide and lofty glades broken as in the forest by the tracery of stems and boughs through which were seen not only the outer but the upper world  for they craved—as all true artists crave—for light and colour and had the sky above been one perpetual blue they might have been content with it and left their glass transparent  but in our dark dank northern clime rain and snowstorm black cloud and grey mist were all that they were like to see outside for six months in the year so they took such light and colour as nature gave in her few gayer moods and set aloft in their stained glass windows the hues of the noonday and of the sunset and the purple of the heather and the gold of the gorse and the azure of the bugloss and the crimson of the poppy and among them in gorgeous robes the angels and the saints of heaven and the memories of heroic virtues and heroic sufferings that they might lift up the eyes and hearts of men for ever out of the dark sad world of the cold north with all its coarsenesses and its crimes towards a realm of perpetual holiness amid a perpetual summer of beauty and of light as one who from between the black jaws of a narrow glen or from beneath the black shade of gigantic trees catches a glimpse of far lands gay with gardens and cottages and purple mountain ranges and the faroff sea and the hazy horizon melting into the hazy sky and finds his soul led forth into an infinite at once of freedom and repose  awful and yet not sad at least to one who is reminded by it even in its darkest winter’s gloom of the primæval tropic forest at its two most exquisite moments—its too brief twilight and its too swift dawn  awful and yet not sad at least to an englishman while right and left are ranged the statues the busts the names the deeds of men who have helped each in his place to make my country and your country too that which they are  for am i not in goodly company  am i not in very deed upon my best behaviour among my betters and at court  among men before whom i should have been ashamed to say or do a base or foolish thing  among men who have taught me have ennobled me though they lived centuries since men whom i should have loved had i met them on earth  men whom i may meet yet and tell them how i love them in some other world  men too whom i might have hated and who might have hated me had we met on this poor piecemeal earth but whom i may learn to regard with justice and with charity in the world where all shall know even as they are known men too—alas how fast their number grows—whom i have known have loved and lost too soon and all gleaming out of the gloom as every image of the dead should do in pure white marble as if purged from earthly taint  to them too—      nothing is left of them     now but pure manly  yes while their monuments remind me that they are not dead but living—for all live to god—then awed i am and humbled better so but sad i cannot be in such grand company  i said the men who helped to make my country and yours too  it would be an impertinence in me to remind most of you of that  you know as well as i that you are represented just as much as the english people by every monument in that abbey earlier than the civil wars and by most monuments of later date especially by those of all our literary men you know that and you value the old abbey accordingly  but a day may come—a generation may come in a nation so rapidly increasing by foreign immigration as well as by homeborn citizenship—a generation may come who will forget that fact and orators arise who will be glad that it should be forgotten—for awhile  but if you would not that that evil day should come then teach your children—that the history and the freedom of america began neither with the war of independence nor with the sailing of the pilgrim fathers nor with the settlement of virginia but 1500 years and more before in the days when our common teutonic ancestors as free then as this day knew how      in den deutschen forsten     wie der aar zu horsten  when herman smote the romans in the teutoburgerwald and the great cæsar wailed in vain to his slain general ‘varus give me back my legions’ teach your children that the congress which sits at washington is as much the child of magna charta as the parliament which sits at westminster and that when you resisted the unjust demands of an english king and council you did but that which the free commons of england held the right to do and did not only after but before the temporary tyranny of the norman kings  show them the tombs of english kings not of those norman kings—no norman king lies buried in our abbey—there is no royal interment between edward the confessor the last english prince of cerdic’s house and henry the third the first of the new english line of kings  tell them in justice to our common forefathers that those men were no tyrants but kings who swore to keep and for the most part did keep like loyal gentlemen the ancient english laws which they had sworn in westminster abbey to maintain and that the few of them who persisted in outraging the rights or the conscience of the free people of england paid for their perjury with their crowns or with their lives  and tell them too in justice to our common ancestors that there were never wanting to the kings the nobles or the commons of england since the days when simon de montfort organised the house of commons in westminster hall on the 2nd of may 1258—there were never wanting i say to the kings the nobles or the commons of england counsellors who dared speak the truth and defend the right even at the risk of their own goods and their own lives  remind them too—or let our monuments remind them—that even in the worst times of the war of independence there were not wanting here in england statesmen who dared to speak out for justice and humanity and that they were not only confessed to be the leading men of their own day but the very men whom england delighted to honour by places in her pantheon  show them the monuments of chatham pitt and fox—burke sleeps in peace elsewhere—and remind them that the great earl who literally died as much in your service as in ours whose fiery invectives against the cruelties of that old war are i am proud to say still commonplaces for declamation among our english schoolboys dared even when all was at the worst to tell the english house of lords—‘if i were an american as i am an englishman while a foreign troop was landed in my country i never would lay down my arms—never never never’  yes—an american as well as an englishman may find himself in the old abbey in right good company  yes—and i do not hesitate to say that if you will look through the monuments erected in that abbey since those of pitt and fox—you will find that the great majority commemorate the children not of obstruction but of progress not of darkness but of light  holland tierney mackintosh grattan peel canning palmerston isaac watts bell wilberforce sharp the macaulays fowell buxton francis horner charles buller cobden watt rennell telford locke brunel grote thackeray dickens maurice—men who each in his own way toiled for freedom of some kind freedom of race of laws of commerce of locomotion of production of speech of thought of education of human charity and of sympathy—these are the men whom england still delights to honour whose busts around our walls show that the ancient spirit is not dead and that we as you are still as 1500 years ago the sons of freedom and of light  but beside these statesmen who were just and true to you and therefore to their native land there lie men before whose monuments i would ask thoughtful americans to pause—i mean those of our old fighters by land and sea  i do not speak merely of those who lived before our civil wars though they are indeed our common heritage  and when you look at the noble monuments of de vere and norris the fathers of the english infantry you should remember that your ancestors and mine or that of any other englishman may have trailed pike and handled sword side by side under those very men in those old wars of the netherlands which your own great historian mr motley has so well described or have sailed together to cadiz fight and to the spanish main with raleigh or with drake  there are those again who did their duty two and three generations later—though one of the noblest of them all old admiral blake alas lies we know not where—cast out with cromwell and his heroes by the fanatics and sycophants of the restoration—whom not only we but royalty itself would now restore could we recover their noble ashes to their rightful restingplace  and these if not always our common ancestors were often enough our common cousins as in the case of my own family in which one brother was settling in new england to found there a whole new family of kingsleys while the other brother was fighting in the parliamentary army and helping to defeat charles at rowton moor  but there is another class of warriors’ tombs which i ask you if ever you visit the abbey to look on with respect and let me say affection too  i mean the men who did their duty by land and sea in that long series of wars which commencing in 1739 ended in 1783 with our recognition of your right and power to be a free and independent people of those who fought against you i say nought  but i must speak of those who fought for you—who brought to naught by sheer hard blows that family compact of the house of bourbon which would have been as dangerous to you upon this side of the ocean as to us upon the other who smote with a continual stroke the transatlantic power of spain till they placed her once vast and rich possessions at your mercy to this day and who—even more important still—prevented the french from seizing at last the whole valley of the mississippi and girdling your nascent dominion with a hostile frontier from louisiana round to the mouth of the st lawrence  when you see wolfe’s huge cenotaph with its curious bronze basrelief of the taking of the heights of abraham think i pray you that not only for england but for you the ‘little redhaired corporal’ conquered and died  remember too that while your ancestors were fighting well by land and washington and such as he were learning their lesson at fort duquesne and elsewhere better than we could teach them we were fighting well where we knew how to fight—at sea  and when near to wolfe’s monument or in the nave you see such names as cornwallis saumarez wager vernon—the conqueror of portobello—lord aubrey beauclerk and so forth—bethink you that every french or spanish ship which these men took and every convoy they cut off from toulon to carthagena and from carthagena to halifax made more and more possible the safe severance from england of the very colonies which you were then helping us to defend  and then agree like the generoushearted people which you are that if in after years we sinned against you—and how heavy were our sins i know too well—there was a time before those evil days when we fought for you and by your side as the old lion by the young even though like the old lion and the young we began only too soon tearing each other to pieces over the division of the prey  nay i will go further and say this paradoxical as it may seem—when you enter the north transept from st margaret’s churchyard you see on your right hand a huge but not ungraceful naval monument of white marble inscribed with the names of bayne blair lord robert manners—three commanders of rodney’s in the crowning victory of april 12 1782—fought upon tropic waters over which i have sailed flushed with the thought that my own grandfather was that day on board of rodney’s ship  now do you all know what that day’s great fight meant for you—fought though it was while you alas were still at war with us  it meant this  that that day—followed up six months after by lord howe’s relief of gibraltar—settled i hold the fate of the new world for many a year true in one sense it was settled already  cornwallis had already capitulated at york town  but even then the old lion disgraced bleeding fainting ready to yield—but only to you of his own kin and blood—struck though with failing paw two such tremendous blows at his old enemies as deprived them thenceforth of any real power in the new world precipitated that bankruptcy and ruin which issued in the french and spanish revolutions and made certain as i believe the coming day when the anglosaxon race shall be the real masters of the whole new world  of poets and of men of letters i say nought  they are the heritage neither of us nor you but of the human race  the mere man of letters may well sleep in the very centre of that busy civilisation from which he drew his inspiration but not the poet—not at least the poet of these days  he goes not to the town but nature for his inspirations and to nature when he dies he should return  such men—artificial and townbred—however brilliant or even grand at times—as davenant dryden cowley congreve prior gay—sleep fitly in our care here  yet even pope—though one of such in style and heart—preferred the parish church of the then rural twickenham and gray the lonely graveyard of stoke pogis ben jonson has a right to lie with us  he was a townsman to the very heart and a courtpoet too  but chaucer spenser drayton—such are to my mind out of place  chaucer lies here because he lived hard by spenser through bitter need and woe  but i should have rather buried chaucer in some trim garden spenser beneath the forest aisles and drayton by some silver stream—each man’s dust resting where his heart was set  happier it seems to me are those who like shakespeare wordsworth and southey scott and burns lie far away in scenes they knew and loved fulfilling burke’s wise choice ‘after all i had sooner sleep in the southern corner of a country churchyard than in the tomb of all the capulets’  yes—these worthies one and all are a token that the great abbey and all its memories of 800 years does not belong to us alone nor even to the british empire alone and all its colonies but to america likewise that when an american enters beneath that mighty shade he treads on common and ancestral ground as sacred to him as it is to us the symbol of common descent common development common speech common creed common laws common literature common national interests and i trust of a common respect and affection such as the wise can only feel toward the wise and the strong toward the strong  is all this sentiment  remember what i said just now by wellused sentiment and wellused sorrow great nations live     lecture ii the stage as it was once   what the stage is now i presume all know  i am not myself a playgoer but i am informed that in europe at least it is not in a state to arouse any deep interest or respect in any cultivated or virtuous person meanwhile keeping fast to my intention of talking to you only about things worthy of your interest and respect because they are good true and beautiful i wish to tell you what the stage was once in a republic of the past—what it may be again i sometimes dream in some republic of the future  let me take you back in fancy some 2314 years—440 years before the christian era and try to sketch for you—alas how clumsily—a great though tiny people in one of their greatest moments—in one of the greatest moments it may be of the human race  for surely it is a great and a rare moment for humanity when all that is loftiest in it—when reverence for the unseen powers reverence for the heroic dead reverence for the fatherland and that reverence too for self which is expressed in stateliness and selfrestraint in grace and courtesy when all these i say can lend themselves even for a day to the richest enjoyment of life—to the enjoyment of beauty in form and sound and of relaxation not brutalizing but ennobling  rare alas have such seasons been in the history of poor humanity  but when they have come they have lifted it up one stage higher thenceforth men having been such once may become such again and the work which such times have left behind them becomes immortal      a thing of beauty is a joy for ever  let me take you to the then still unfinished theatre of athens hewn out of the limestone rock on the southeast slope of the acropolis  above are the new marble buildings of the parthenon rich with the statues and basreliefs of phidias and his scholars gleaming white against the blue sky with the huge bronze statue of athené promachos fifty feet in height towering up among the temples and colonnades  in front and far below gleams the blue sea and salamis beyond  and there are gathered the people of athens—50000 of them possibly when the theatre was complete and full  if it be fine they all wear garlands on their heads  if the sun be too hot they wear widebrimmed straw hats  and if a storm comes on they will take refuge in the porticos beneath not without wine and cakes for what they have come to see will last for many an hour and they intend to feast their eyes and ears from sunrise to sunset  on the highest seats are slaves and freedmen below them the free citizens and on the lowest seats of all are the dignitaries of the republic—the priests the magistrates and the other χαλοὶ χἀγαθοὶ—the fair and good men—as the citizens of the highest rank were called and with them foreign ambassadors and distinguished strangers  what an audience—the rapidest subtlest wittiest down to the very cobblers and tinkers the world has ever seen  and what noble figures on those front seats pericles with aspasia beside him and all his friends—anaxagoras the sage phidias the sculptor and many another immortal artist and somewhere among the free citizens perhaps beside his father sophroniscus the sculptor a short square pugnosed boy of ten years old looking at it all with strange eyes—‘who will be one day’ so said the pythoness at delphi ‘the wisest man in greece’—sage metaphysician humourist warrior patriot martyr—for his name is socrates  all are in their dresses of office for this is not merely a day of amusement but of religious ceremony sacred to dionysos—bacchus the inspiring god who raises men above themselves for good—or for evil  the evil or at least the mere animal aspect of that inspiration was to be seen in forms grotesque and sensuous enough in those very festivals when the gayer and coarser part of the population in town and country broke out into frantic masquerade of which that silly carnival of rome is perhaps the last paltry and unmeaning relic  ‘when’ as the learned o müller says ‘the desire of escaping from self into something new and strange of living in an imaginary world broke forth in a thousand ways not merely in revelry and solemn though fantastic songs but in a hundred disguises imitating the subordinate beings—satyrs pans and nymphs by whom the god was surrounded and through whom life seemed to pass from him into vegetation and branch off into a variety of beautiful or grotesque forms—beings who were ever present to the fancy of the greeks as a convenient step by which they could approach more nearly to the presence of the divinity’  but even out of that seemingly bare chaos athenian genius was learning how to construct under eupolis cratinus and aristophanes that elder school of comedy which remains not only unsurpassed but unapproachable save by rabelais alone as the ideal cloudland of masquerading wisdom in which the whole universe goes mad—but with a subtle method in its madness  yes so it has been under some form or other in every race and clime—ever since eve ate of the magic fruit that she might be as a god knowing good and evil and found poor thing as most have since that it was far easier and more pleasant to know the evil than to know the good but that theatre was built that men might know therein the good as well as the evil  to learn the evil indeed according to their light and the sure vengeance of até and the furies which tracks up the evildoer but to learn also the good—lessons of piety patriotism heroism justice mercy selfsacrifice and all that comes out of the hearts of men and women not dragged below but raised above themselves and behind all—at least in the nobler and earlier tragedies of Æschylus and sophocles before euripides had introduced the tragedy of mere human passion that sensation tragedy which is the only one the world knows now and of which the world is growing rapidly tired—behind all i say lessons of the awful and unfathomable mystery of human existence of unseen destiny of that seemingly capricious distribution of weal and woe to which we can find no solution on this side the grave for which the old greek could find no solution whatsoever  therefore there was a central object in the old greek theatre most important to it but which does not exist in our theatres and did not in the old roman because our tragedies like the roman are mere plays concerning love murder and so forth while the greek were concerning the deepest relations of man to the unseen  the almost circular orchestra or pit between the benches and the stage was empty of what we call spectators—because it was destined for the true and ideal spectators—the representatives of humanity in its centre was a round platform the θυμελή—originally the altar of bacchus—from which the leader of these representatives the leader of the chorus could converse with the actors on the stage and take his part in the drama and round this thymelé the chorus ranged with measured dance and song chanting to the sound of a simple flute odes such as the world had never heard before or since save perhaps in the templeworship at jerusalem  a chorus now as you know means merely any number of persons singing in full harmony on any subject  the chorus was then in tragedy and indeed in the higher comedy what schlegel well calls ‘the ideal spectator’—a personified reflection on the action going on the incorporation into the representation itself of the sentiments of the poet as the spokesman of the whole human race  he goes on to say and i think truly ‘that the chorus always retained among the greeks a peculiar national signification publicity being according to their republican notions essential to the completeness of every important transaction’  thus the chorus represented idealised public opinion not of course the shifting hasty public opinion of the moment—to that it was a conservative check and it calmed to soberness and charity—for it was the matured public opinion of centuries the experience and usually the sad experience of many generations the very spirit of the greek race  the chorus might be composed of what the poet would  of ancient citizens waiting for their sons to come back from the war as in the agamemnon of Æschylus of seanymphs as in his prometheus bound even of the very furies who hunt the matricide as in his eumenides of senators as in the antigone of sophocles or of village farmers as in his Œdipus at colonos—and now i have named five of the greatest poems as i hold written by mortal man till dante rose  or it may be the chorus was composed—as in the comedies of aristophanes the greatest humourist the world has ever seen—of birds or of frogs or even of clouds  it may rise to the level of don quixote or sink to that of sancho panza for it is always the incarnation of such wisdom heavenly or earthly as the poet wishes the people to bring to bear on the subjectmatter  but let the poets themselves rather than me speak awhile  allow me to give you a few specimens of these choruses—the first as an example of that practical and yet surely not undivine wisdom by which they supplied the place of our modern preacher or essayist or didactic poet  listen to this of the old men’s chorus in the agamemnon in the spirited translation of my friend professor blackie—         ’twas said of old and ’tis said today        that wealth to prosperous stature grown           begets a birth of its own        that a surfeit of evil by good is prepared        and sons must bear what allotment of woe           their sires were spared        but this i refuse to believe i know           that impious deeds conspire        to beget an offspring of impious deeds           too like their ugly sire     but whoso is just though his wealth like a river     flow down shall be scathless his house shall rejoice        in an offspring of beauty for ever         the heart of the haughty delights to beget        a haughty heart  from time to time        in children’s children recurrent appears           the ancestral crime     when the dark hour comes that the gods have decreed     and the fury burns with wrathful fires        a demon unholy with ire unabated        lies like black night on the halls of the fated        and the recreant son plunges guiltily on           to perfect the guilt of his sires      but justice shines in a lowly cell     in the homes of poverty smokebegrimed     with the soberminded she loves to dwell        but she turns aside     from the rich man’s house with averted eye     the goldenfretted halls of pride     where hands with lucre are foul and the praise     of counterfeit goodness smoothly sways     and wisely she guides in the strong man’s despite        all things to an issue of right  let me now give you another passage from the eumenides—or furies of Æschylus  orestes prince of argos you must remember has avenged on his mother clytemnestra the murder of his father king agamemnon on his return from troy  pursued by the furies he takes refuge in the temple of apollo at delphi and then still furyhaunted goes to athens where pallas athené the warriormaiden the tutelary goddess of athens bids him refer his cause to the areopagus the highest court of athens apollo acting as his advocate and she sitting as umpire in the midst  the white and black balls are thrown into the urn and are equal and orestes is only delivered by the decision of athené—as the representative of the nearer race of gods the olympians the friends of man in whose likeness man is made  the furies are the representatives of the older and darker creed—which yet has a depth of truth in it—of the irreversible dooms which underlie all nature and which represent the law and not the gospel the consequence of the mere act independent of the spirit which has prompted it  they break out in fury against the overbearing arrogance of these younger gods  athené bears their rage with equanimity addresses them in the language of kindness even of veneration till these so indomitable beings are unable to withstand the charm of her mild eloquence  they are to have a sanctuary in the athenian land and to be called no more furies erinnys but eumenides—the wellconditioned—the kindly goddesses and all ends with a solemn procession round the orchestra with hymns of blessing while the terrible chorus of the furies clothed in black with bloodstained girdles and serpents in their hair in masks having perhaps somewhat of the terrific beauty of medusamasks are convoyed to their new sanctuary by a procession of children women and old men in purple robes and torches in their hands after athené and the furies have sung in response to each other a chorus from which i must beg leave to give you an extract or two                     eldest fury leader of the chorus      far from thy dwelling and far from thy border     by the grace of my godhead benignant i order     the blight which may blacken the bloom of the trees     far from thy border and far from thy dwelling     be the hot blast which shrivels the bud in its swelling     the seedrotting taint and the creeping disease     thy flocks be still doubled thy seasons be steady     and when hermes is near thee thy hand be still ready        the heavendropt bounty to seize                                    athené      hear her words my city’s warders—     fraught with blessings she prevaileth     with olympians and infernals     dread erinnys much revered

olympian seated     and dear to the maiden his daughter the dearest     timely wise ’neath the wings of the daughter ye gather     and mildly looks down on her children the father  those of you here who love your country as well as the old athenians loved theirs will feel at once the grand political significance of such a scene in which patriotism and religion become one—and feel too the exquisite dramatic effect of the innocent the weak the unwarlike welcoming among them without fear because without guilt those ancient snakyhaired sisters emblems of all that is most terrible and most inscrutable in the destiny of nations of families and of men      to their hallowed habitations     ’neath ogygian earth’s foundations     in that darksome hall     sacrifice and supplication     shall not fail  in adoration     silent worship all  listen again to the gentler patriotism of a gentler poet sophocles himself  the village of colonos a mile from athens was his birthplace and in his Œdipus coloneus he makes his chorus of village officials sing thus of their consecrated olive grove         in good hap stranger to these rural seats        thou comest to this region’s blest retreats        where white colonos lifts his head        and glories in the bounding steed     where sadly sweet the frequent nightingale        impassioned pours his evening song     and charms with varied notes each verdant vale        the ivy’s darkgreen boughs among        or sheltered ’neath the clustering vine        which high above him form a bower        safe from the sun or stormy shower        where frolic bacchus often roves     and visits with his fostering nymphs the groves         bathed in the dew of heaven each morn        fresh is the fair narcissus born        of those great gods the crown of old        the crocus glitters robed in gold     here restless fountains ever murmuring glide        and as their crispèd streamlets play     to feed cephisus thine unfailing tide        fresh verdure marks their winding way        here oft to raise the tuneful song        the virgin band of muses deigns     and carborne aphrodite guides her golden reins  then they go on this band of village elders to praise the gods for their special gifts to that small athenian land  they praise pallas athené who gave their forefathers the olive then poseidon—neptune as the romans call him—who gave their forefathers the horse and something more—the ship—the horse of the sea as they like the old norse vikings after them delighted to call it—      our highest vaunt is this—thy grace        poseidon we behold     the ruling curb embossed with gold     controls the courser’s managed pace     though loud oh king thy billows roar     our strong hands grasp the labouring oar     and while the nereids round it play     light cuts our bounding bark its way  what a combination of fine humanities  dance and song patriotism and religion so often parted among us have flowed together into one in these stately villagers each a small farmer each a trained soldier and probably a trained seaman also each a selfgoverned citizen and each a cultured gentleman if ever there were gentlemen on earth  but what drama doing or action—for such is the meaning of the word—is going on upon the stage to be commented on by the sympathizing chorus  one drama at least was acted in athens in that year—440 bc—which you i doubt not know well—that antigone of sophocles which mendelssohn has resuscitated in our own generation by setting it to music divine indeed though very different from the music to which it was set probably by sophocles himself at its first and for ought we know its only representation  for pieces had not then as now a run of a hundred nights and more  the athenian genius was so fertile and the athenian audience so eager for novelty that new pieces were demanded and were forthcoming for each of the great festivals and if a piece was represented a second time it was usually after an interval of some years they did not moreover like the moderns run every night to some theatre or other as a part of the day’s amusement  tragedy and even comedy were serious subjects calling out not a passing sigh or passing laugh but all the higher faculties and emotions  and as serious subjects were to be expressed in verse and music which gave stateliness doubtless even to the richest burlesques of aristophanes and lifted them out of mere streetbuffoonery into an ideal fairy land of the grotesque how much more stateliness must verse and music have added to their tragedy and how much have we lost toward a true appreciation of their dramatic art by losing almost utterly not only the laws of their melody and harmony but even the true metric time of their odes music and metre which must have surely been as noble as their poetry their sculpture their architecture possessed by the same exquisite sense of form and of proportion  one thing we can understand—how this musical form of the drama which still remains to us in lower shapes in the oratorio in the opera must have helped to raise their tragedies into that ideal sphere in which they all like the antigone live and move  so ideal and yet so human nay rather truly ideal because truly human  the gods the heroes the kings the princesses of greek tragedy were dear to the hearts of greek republicans not merely as the founders of their states not merely as the tutelary deities many of them of their country but as men and women like themselves only more vast with mightier wills mightier virtues mightier sorrows and often mightier crimes their inward freewill battling as schlegel has well seen against outward circumstance and overruling fate as every man should battle unless he sink to be a brute  ‘in tragedy’ says schlegel—uttering thus a deep and momentous truth—‘the gods themselves either come forward as the servants of destiny and mediate executors of its decrees or approve themselves godlike only by asserting their liberty of action and entering upon the same struggles with fate which man himself has to encounter’  and i believe this that this greek tragedy with its godlike men and manlike gods and heroes who had become gods by the very vastness of their humanity was a preparation and it may be a necessary preparation for the true christian faith in a son of man who is at once utterly human and utterly divine  man is made in the likeness of god—is the rootidea only halfconscious only halfexpressed but instinctive without which neither the greek tragedies nor the homeric poems six hundred years before them could have been composed  doubtless the idea that man was like a god degenerated too often into the idea that the gods were like men and as wicked  but that travestie of a great truth is not confined to those old greeks  some socalled christian theories—as i hold—have sinned in that direction as deeply as the athenians of old  meanwhile i say that this long acquiescence in the conception of godlike struggle godlike daring godlike suffering godlike martyrdom the very conception which was so foreign to the mythologies of any other race—save that of the jews and perhaps of our own teutonic forefathers—did prepare must have prepared men to receive as most rational and probable as the satisfaction of their highest instincts the idea of a being in whom all those partial rays culminated in clear pure light of a being at once utterly human and utterly divine who by struggle suffering selfsacrifice without a parallel achieved a victory over circumstance and all the dark powers which beleaguer man without a parallel likewise  take as an example the figure which you know best—the figure of antigone herself—devoting herself to be entombed alone for the sake of love and duty  love of a brother which she can only prove alas by burying his corpse  duty to the dead an instinct depending on no written law but springing out of the very depths of those blind and yet sacred monitions which prove that the true man is not an animal but a spirit fulfilling her holy purpose unchecked by fear unswayed by her sisters’ entreaties  hardening her heart magnificently till her fate is sealed and then after proving her godlike courage proving the tenderness of her womanhood by that melodious wail over her own untimely death and the loss of marriage joys which some of you must know from the music of mendelssohn and which the late dean milman has put into english thus—      come fellowcitizens and see     the desolate antigone     on the last path her steps shall tread     set forth the journey of the dead     watching with vainly lingering gaze     her last last sun’s expiring rays      never to see it never more     for down to acheron’s dread shore     a living victim am i led     to hades’ universal bed     to my dark lot no bridal joys     belong nor e’er the jocund noise     of hymeneal chant shall sound for me     but death cold death my only spouse shall be      oh tomb  oh bridal chamber  oh deepdelved     and stronglyguarded mansion  i descend     to meet in your dread chambers all my kindred     who in dark multitudes have crowded down     where proserpine received the dead  but i     the last and oh how few more miserable     go down or ere my sands of life are run  and let me ask you whether the contemplation of such a selfsacrifice should draw you should have drawn those who heard the tale nearer to or further from a certain cross which stood on calvary some 1800 years ago may not the tale of antigone heard from mother or from nurse have nerved ere now some martyrmaiden to dare and suffer in an even holier cause  but to return  this set purpose of the athenian dramatists of the best school to set before men a magnified humanity explains much in their dramas which seem to us at first not only strange but faulty  the masks which gave one grand but unvarying type of countenance to each wellknown historic personage and thus excluded the play of feature animated gesture and almost all which we now consider as ‘acting’ proper the thicksoled cothurni which gave the actor a more than human stature the poverty according to our notions of the scenery which usually represented merely the front of a palace or other public place and was often though not always unchanged during the whole performance the total absence in fact of anything like that scenic illusion which most managers of theatres seem now to consider as their highest achievement the small number of the actors two or at most three only being present on the stage at once—the simplicity of the action in which intrigue in the playhouse sense and any complication of plot are utterly absent all this must have concentrated not the eye of the spectator on the scene but his ear upon the voice and his emotions on the personages who stood out before him without a background sharpcut and clear as a group of statuary which is the same place it where you will complete in itself—a world of beauty independent of all other things and beings save on the ground on which it needs must stand  it was the personage rather than his surroundings which was to be impressed by every word on the spectator’s heart and intellect and the very essence of greek tragedy is expressed in the still famous words of medea—      che resta  io  contrast this with the european drama—especially with the highest form of it—our own elizabethan  it resembles as has been often said in better words than mine not statuary but painting  these dramas affect colour light and shadow background whether of town or country description of scenery where scenic machinery is inadequate all in fact which can blend the action and the actors with the surrounding circumstances without letting them altogether melt into the circumstances which can show them a part of the great whole by harmony or discord with the whole universe down to the flowers beneath their feet  this too had to be done how it became possible for even the genius of a shakespeare to get it done i may with your leave hint to you hereafter  why it was not given to the greeks to do it i know not  let us at least thank them for what they did  one work was given them and that one they fulfilled as it had never been fulfilled before as it will never need to be fulfilled again for the greeks’ work was done not for themselves alone but for all races in all times and greek art is the heirloom of the whole human race and that work was to assert in drama lyric sculpture music gymnastic the dignity of man—the dignity of man which they perceived for the most part with their intense æsthetic sense through the beautiful in man  man with them was divine inasmuch as he could perceive beauty and be beautiful himself  beauty might be physical æsthetic intellectual moral  but in proportion as a thing was perfect it revealed its own perfection by its beauty  goodness itself was a form—though the highest form—of beauty  Καλος meant both the physically beautiful and the morally good αἰσχρὸς both the ugly and the bad  out of this rootidea sprang the whole of that greek sculpture which is still and perhaps ever will be one of the unrivalled wonders of the world  their first statues remember were statues of the gods  this is an historic fact  before bc 580 there were probably no statues in greece save those of deities  but of what form  we all know that the usual tendency of man has been to represent his gods as more or less monstrous their monstrosity may have been meant as it was certainly with the mexican idols and probably those of the semitic races of syria and palestine to symbolise the ferocious passions which they attributed to those objects of their dread appeasable alone by human sacrifice  or the monstrosity as with the hawkheaded or catheaded egyptian idols the winged bulls of nineveh and babylon the manyhanded deities of hindostan—merely symbolised powers which could not so the priest and the sculptor held belong to mere humanity  now of such monstrous forms of idols the records in greece are very few and very ancient—relics of an older worship and most probably of an older race  from the earliest historic period the greek was discerning more and more that the divine could be best represented by the human the tendency of his statuary was more and more to honour that divine by embodying it in the highest human beauty  in lonely mountain shrines there still might linger feared and honoured dolls like those black virgins of unknown antiquity which still work wonders on the european continent  in the mysterious cavern of phigalia for instance on the eleatic shore of peloponnese there may have been in remote times—so the legend ran—an old black wooden image a woman with a horse’s head and mane and serpents growing round her head who held a dolphin in one hand and a dove in the other  and this image may have been connected with old naturemyths about the marriage of demeter and poseidon—that is of encroachments of the sea upon the land and the other myths of demeter the earthmother may have clustered round the place till the phigalians were glad—for it was profitable as well as honourable—to believe that in their cavern demeter sat mourning for the loss of proserpine whom pluto had carried down to hades and all the earth was barren till zeus sent the fates or iris to call her forth and restore fertility to the world  and it may be true—the legend as pausanias tells it 600 years after—that the old wooden idol having been burnt and the worship of demeter neglected till a famine ensued the phigalians warned by the oracle of delphi hired onatas a contemporary of polygnotus and phidias to make them a bronze replica of the old idol from some old copy and from a dream of his own  the story may be true when pausanias went thither in the second century after christ the cave and the fountain and the sacred grove of oaks and the altar outside which was to be polluted with the blood of no victim—the only offerings being fruits and honey and undressed wool—were still there  the statue was gone  some said it had been destroyed by the fall of the cliff some were not sure that it had ever been there at all  and meanwhile praxiteles had already brought to perfection paus 1 2 sec 4 the ideal of demeter motherlike as heré—whom we still call juno now—but softerfeatured and her eyes more closed  and so for mother earth as for the rest the best representation of the divine was the human  now conceive such an idea taking hold however slowly of a people of rare physical beauty of acutest eye for proportion and grace with opportunities of studying the human figure such as exist nowhere now save among tropic savages and gifted moreover in that as in all other matters with that innate diligence of which mr carlyle has said ‘that genius is only an infinite capacity of taking pains’ and we can understand somewhat of the causes which produced those statues human and divine which awe and shame the artificiality and degeneracy of our modern socalled civilisation—we can understand somewhat of the reverence for the human form of the careful study of every line the storing up for use each scattered fragment of beauty of which the artist caught sight even in his daily walks and consecrating it in his memory to the service of him or her whom he was trying to embody in marble or in bronze  and when the fashion came in of making statues of victors in the games and other distinguished persons a new element was introduced which had large social as well as artistic results  the sculptor carried his usual reverence into his careful delineation of the victor’s form while he obtained in him a model usually of the very highest type for perfecting his idea of some divinity  the possibility of gaining the right to a statue gave a fresh impulse to all competitors in the public games and through them to the gymnastic training throughout all the states of greece which made the greeks the most physically able and graceful as well as the most beautiful people known to the history of the human race  a people who reverencing beauty reverenced likewise grace or acted beauty so utterly and honestly that nothing was too humble for a free man to do if it were not done awkwardly and ill  as an instance sophocles himself—over and above his poetic genius one of the most cultivated gentlemen as well as one of the most exquisite musicians dancers and gymnasts and one of the most just pious and gentle of all greece—could not by reason of the weakness of his voice act in his own plays as poets were wont to do and had to perform only the office of stagemanager  twice he took part in the action once as the blind old thamyris playing on the harp and once in his own lost tragedy the ‘nausicaa’  there in the scene in which the princess as she does in homer’s ‘odyssey’ comes down to the seashore with her maidens to wash the household clothes and then to play at ball—sophocles himself a man then of middle age did the one thing he could do better than any there—and dressed in women’s clothes among the lads who represented the maidens played at ball before the athenian people  yes just 60 years after the representation of the antigone 10000 greeks far on the plains of babylon cut through the whole persian army as the railway train cuts through a herd of buffalo and then losing all their generals by treacherous warfare fought their way north from babylon to trebizond on the black sea under the guidance of a young athenian a pupil of socrates who had never served in the army before the retreat of xenophon and his 10000 will remain for ever as one of the grandest triumphs of civilisation over brute force but what made it possible  that these men and their ancestors before them had been for at least 100 years in training physical intellectual and moral which made their bodies and their minds able to dare and suffer like those old heroes of whom their tragedy had taught them and whose spirits they still believed would help the valiant greek  and yet that feat which looks to us so splendid attracted as far as i am aware no special admiration at the time  so was the cultivated greek expected to behave whenever he came in contact with the uncultivated barbarian  but from what had sprung in that little state this exuberance of splendid life physical æsthetic intellectual which made and will make the name of athens and of the whole cluster of greek republics for ever admirable to civilised man  had it sprung from long years of peaceful prosperity  from infinite making of money and comfort according to the laws of socalled political economy and the dictates of enlightened selfishness  not so  but rather out of terror and agony and all but utter ruin—and out of a magnificent want of economy—and the divine daring and folly—of selfsacrifice  in salamis across the strait a trophy stood and round that trophy forty years before sophocles the author of antigone then sixteen years of age the loveliest and most cultivated lad in athens undraped like a faun with lyre in hand was leading the chorus of athenian youths and singing to athené the tutelary goddess a hymn of triumph for a glorious victory—the very symbol of greece and athens springing up into a joyous second youth after invasion and desolation as the grass springs up after the prairie fire has passed  but the fire had been terrible  it had burnt athens at least down to the very roots  true while sophocles was dancing xerxes the great king of the east foiled at salamis as his father darius had been foiled at marathon ten years before was fleeing back to persia leaving his innumerable hosts of slaves and mercenaries to be destroyed piecemeal by land at platea by sea at mycalé  the bold hope was over in which the persian ever since the days of cyrus had indulged—that he the despot of the east should be the despot of the west likewise  it seemed to them as possible though not as easy to subdue the aryan greek as it had been to subdue the semite and the turanian the babylonian and the syrian to rifle his temples to destroy his idols carry off his women and children as colonists into distant lands as they had been doing with all the nations of the east and they had succeeded with isolated colonies isolated islands of greeks and the shores of asia minor  but when they dared at last to attack the greek in his own sacred land of hellas they found they had bearded a lion in his den  nay rather—as those old greeks would have said—they had dared to attack pallas athené the eldest daughter of zeus—emblem of that serene and pure divine wisdom of whom solomon sang of old ‘the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old  when he prepared the heavens i was there when he appointed the foundation of the earth then was i by him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delight was with the sons of men’—to attack her and her brother apollo lord of light and beauty and culture and grace and inspiration—to attack them not in the name of ormuzd nor of any other deity but in the name of mere brute force and lust of conquest  the old persian spirit was gone out of them  they were the symbols now of nothing save despotism and selfwill wealth and selfindulgence  they once the children of ormuzd or light had become the children of ahriman or darkness and therefore it was as i believe that xerxes’ 1000 ships and the two million or as some have it five million human beings availed naught against the little fleets and little battalions of men who believed with a living belief in athené and apollo and therefore—ponder it well for it is true—with a living belief under whatsoever confusions and divisions of personality in a god who loved taught inspired men a just god who befriended the righteous cause the cause of freedom and patriotism a deity the echo of whose mind and will to man was the song of athené on olympus when she      chanted of order and right and of foresight and order of peoples     chanted of labour and craft wealth in the port and the garner     chanted of valour and fame and the man who can fall with the     foremost     fighting for children and wife and the field which his father     bequeathed him     sweetly and cunningly sang she and planned new lessons for mortals     happy who hearing obey her the wise unsullied athené  ah that they had always obeyed her those old greeks  but meanwhile as i said the agony had been extreme  if athens had sinned she had been purged as by fire and the fire—surely of god—had been terrible northern greece had either been laid waste with fire and sword or had gone over to the persian traitors in their despair  attica almost the only loyal state had been overrun the old men women and children had fled to the neighbouring islands or to the peloponnese  athens itself had been destroyed and while young sophocles was dancing round the trophy at salamis the acropolis was still a heap of blackened ruins  but over and above their valour over and above their loyalty over and above their exquisite æsthetic faculty these athenians had a resilience of selfreliant energy like that of the french—like that to do you but justice of your americans after your chicago fire and athens rose from her ashes to be awhile not only as she had nobly earned by suffering and endurance the leading state in greece but a mighty fortress a rich commercial port a living centre of art poetry philosophy such as this earth has never seen before or since  on the plateau of that little crag of the acropolis some 800 feet in length by 400 in breadth—about the size and shape of the castle rock at edinburgh—was gathered within forty years of the battle of salamis more and more noble beauty than ever stood together on any other spot of like size  the sudden relief from crushing pressure and the joyous consciousness of wellearned honours made the whole spiritnature of the people blossom out as it were into manifold forms of activity beauty research and raised in raising greece the whole human race thenceforth  what might they not have done—looking at what they actually did—for the whole race of man  but no—they fell even more rapidly than they rose till their grace and their cultivation for them they could not lose made them the willing ministers to the luxury the frivolity the sentimentality the vice of the whole old world—the scapia or figaro of the old world—infinitely able but with all his ability consecrated to the service of his own base self  the greekling—as juvenal has it—in want of a dinner would climb somehow to heaven itself at the bidding of his roman master  ah what a fall  and what was the inherent weakness which caused that fall  i say at once—want of honesty  the greek was not to be depended on if it suited him he would lie betray overreach change sides and think it no sin  he was the sharpest of men  sharp practice in our modern sense of the word was the very element in which he floated  any scholar knows it  in the grand times of marathon and salamis down to the disastrous times of the peloponnesian war and the thirty tyrants no public man’s hands were clean with the exception perhaps of that aristides who was banished because men were tired of hearing him called the just  the exciting cause of the peloponnesian war and the consequent downfall of athens was not merely the tyranny she exercised over the states allied to her it was the sharp practice of the athenians in misappropriating the tribute paid by the allies to the decoration of athens  and in laying the foundations of the parthenon was sown by a just judgment the seed of ruin for the state which gloried in it  and if the rulers were such what were the people  if the free were such what were the slaves  hence weakness at home and abroad mistrust of generals and admirals paralysing all bold and clear action peculations and corruptions at home internecine wars between factions inside states and between states or groups of states revolutions followed by despotism and final exhaustion and slavery— slavery to a people who were coming across the western sea hardheaded hardhearted caring nothing for art or science whose pleasures were coarse and cruel but with a certain rough honesty reverence for country for law and for the ties of a family—men of a somewhat old english type who had over and above like the english the inspiring belief that they could conquer the whole world and who very nearly succeeded in that—as we have to our great blessing not succeeded—i mean of course the romans     lecture iii the first discovery of america   let me begin this lecture with a scene in the north atlantic 863 years since  ‘bjarne grimolfson was blown with his ship into the irish ocean and there came worms and the ship began to sink under them  they had a boat which they had payed with seals’ blubber for that the seaworms will not hurt  but when they got into the boat they saw that it would not hold them all  then said bjarne “as the boat will only hold the half of us my advice is that we should draw lots who shall go in her for that will not be unworthy of our manhood”  this advice seemed so good that none gainsaid it and they drew lots  and the lot fell to bjarne that he should go in the boat with half his crew  but as he got into the boat there spake an icelander who was in the ship and had followed bjarne from iceland “art thou going to leave me here bjarne”  quoth bjarne “so it must be”  then said the man “another thing didst thou promise my father when i sailed with thee from iceland than to desert me thus for thou saidst that we both should share the same lot”  bjarne said “and that we will not do  get thou down into the boat and i will get up into the ship now i see that thou art so greedy after life”  so bjarne went up into the ship and the man down into the boat and the boat went on its voyage till they came to dublin in ireland  but most men say that bjarne and his comrades perished among the worms for they were never heard of after’  this story may serve as a text for my whole lecture  not only does it smack of the seabreeze and the salt water like all the finest old norse sagas but it gives a glimpse at least of the nobleness which underlay the grim and often cruel nature of the norseman  it belongs too to the culminating epoch to the beginning of that era when the scandinavian peoples had their great times when the old fierceness of the worshippers of thor and odin was tempered without being effeminated by the faith of the ‘white christ’ till the very men who had been the destroyers of western europe became its civilisers  it should have moreover a special interest to americans  for—as american antiquaries are well aware—bjarne was on his voyage home from the coast of new england possibly from that very mount hope bay which seems to have borne the same name in the time of those old norsemen as afterwards in the days of king philip the last sachem of the wampanong indians  he was going back to greenland perhaps for reinforcements finding he and his fellowcaptain thorfinn the esquimaux who then dwelt in that land too strong for them  for the norsemen were then on the very edge of a discovery which might have changed the history not only of this continent but of europe likewise  they had found and colonised iceland and greenland  they had found labrador and called it helluland from its icepolished rocks  they had found nova scotia seemingly and called it markland from its woods  they had found new england and called it vinland the good  a fair land they found it well wooded with good pasturage so that they had already imported cows and a bull whose lowings terrified the esquimaux  they had found selfsown corn too probably maize  the streams were full of salmon  but they had called the land vinland by reason of its grapes  quaint enough and bearing in its very quaintness the stamp of truth is the story of the first finding of the wild foxgrapes  how leif the fortunate almost as soon as he first landed missed a little wizened old german servant of his father’s tyrker by name and was much vexed thereat for he had been brought up on the old man’s knee and hurrying off to find him met tyrker coming back twisting his eyes about—a trick of his—smacking his lips and talking german to himself in high excitement  and when they get him to talk norse again he says ‘i have not been far but i have news for you i have found vines and grapes’  ‘is that true fosterfather’ says leif  ‘true it is’ says the old german ‘for i was brought up where there was never any lack of them’  the saga—as given by rafn—has a detailed description of this quaint personage’s appearance and it would not be amiss if american winegrowers should employ an american sculptor—and there are great american sculptors—to render that description into marble and set up little tyrker in some public place as the silenus of the new world  thus the first cargoes homeward from vinland to greenland had been of timber and of raisins and of vinestocks which were not like to thrive  and more  beyond vinland the good there was said to be another land whiteman’s land—or ireland the mickle as some called it  for these norse traders from limerick had found ari marson and ketla of ruykjanes supposed to have been long since drowned at sea and said that the people had made him and ketla chiefs and baptised ari  what is all this and what is this too which the esquimaux children taken in markland told the northmen of a land beyond them where the folk wore white clothes and carried flags on poles  are these all dreams or was some part of that great civilisation the relics whereof your antiquarians find in so many parts of the united states still in existence some 900 years ago and were these old norse cousins of ours upon the very edge of it  be that as it may how nearly did these fierce vikings some of whom seemed to have sailed far south along the shore become aware that just beyond them lay a land of fruits and spices gold and gems  the adverse current of the gulf stream it may be would have long prevented their getting past the bahamas into the gulf of mexico but sooner or later some storm must have carried a greenland viking to san domingo or to cuba and then as has been well said some scandinavian dynasty might have sat upon the throne of mexico  these stories are well known to antiquarians  they may be found almost all of them in professor rafn’s antiquitates americanæ  the action in them stands out often so clear and dramatic that the internal evidence of historic truth is irresistible  thorvald who when he saw what seems to be they say the bluff head of alderton at the southeast end of boston bay said ‘here should i like to dwell’ and shot by an esquimaux arrow bade bury him on that place with a cross at his head and a cross at his feet and call the place cross ness for evermore gudrida the magnificent widow who wins hearts and sees strange deeds from iceland to greenland and greenland to vinland and back and at last worn out and sad goes off on a pilgrimage to rome helgi and finnbogi the norwegians who like our arctic voyagers in after times devise all sorts of sports and games to keep the men in humour during the long winter at hope and last but not least the terrible freydisa who when the norse are seized with a sudden panic at the esquimaux and flee from them as they had three weeks before fled from thorfinn’s bellowing bull turns when so weak that she cannot escape singlehanded on the savages and catching up a slain man’s sword puts them all to flight with her fierce visage and fierce cries—freydisa the terrible who in another voyage persuades her husband to fall on helgi and finnbogi when asleep and murder them and all their men and then when he will not murder the five women too takes up an axe and slays them all herself and getting back to greenland when the dark and unexplained tale comes out lives unpunished but abhorred henceforth  all these folks i say are no phantoms but realities at least if i can judge of internal evidence  but beyond them and hovering on the verge of mythus and fairy land there is a ballad called ‘finn the fair’ and how      an upland earl had twa braw sons        my story to begin     the tane was hight haldane the strong        the tither was winsome finn  and so forth which was still sung with other ‘rimur’ or ballads in the faroes at the end of the last century  professor rafn has inserted it because it talks of vinland as a wellknown place and because the brothers are sent by the princess to slay american kings but that rime has another value  it is of a beauty so perfect and yet so like the old scotch ballads in its heroic conception of love and in all its forms and its qualities that it is one proof more to any student of early european poetry that we and these old norsemen are men of the same blood  your own professor longfellow may know it far better than i who am no norse scholar  but if he does might i beg him to translate it some day as none but he can translate  it is so sad that no tenderness less exquisite than his can prevent its being painful and at least in its denouement so naive that no purity less exquisite than his can prevent its being dreadful but the rime is as worthy of mr longfellow as he is worthy of the rime  if anything more important than is told by professor rafn and mr black 71 be now known to the antiquarians of massachussets let me entreat them to pardon my ignorance  but let me record my opinion that though somewhat too much may have been made in past years of certain rockinscriptions and so forth on this side of the atlantic there can be no reasonable doubt that our own race landed and tried to settle on the shore of new england six hundred years before their kinsmen and in many cases their actual descendants the august pilgrim fathers of the 17th century  and so as i said a scandinavian dynasty might have been seated now upon the throne of mexico  and how was that strange chance lost  first of course by the length and danger of the coasting voyage it was one thing to have like columbus and vespucci cortes and pizarro the azores as a halfway port another to have greenland or even iceland  it was one thing to run south west upon columbus’ track across the mar de damas the ladies sea which hardly knows a storm with the blazing blue above the blazing blue below in an everwarming climate where every breath is life and joy another to struggle against the fogs and icebergs the rocks and currents of the dreary north atlantic  no wonder then that the knowledge of markland and vinland and whiteman’s land died away in a few generations and became but fireside sagas for the winter nights  but there were other causes more honourable to the dogged energy of the norse  they were in those very years conquering and settling nearer home as no other people—unless perhaps the old ionian greeks conquered and settled  greenland we have seen they held—the western side at least—and held it long and well enough to afford it is said 2600 pounds of walrus’ teeth as yearly tithe to the pope besides peter’s pence and to build many a convent and church and cathedral with farms and homesteads round for one saga speaks of greenland as producing wheat of the finest quality all is ruined now perhaps by gradual change of climate  but they had richer fields of enterprise than greenland iceland and the faroes  their boldest outlaws at that very time—whether from norway sweden denmark or britain—were forming the imperial lifeguard of the byzantine emperor as the once famous varangers of constantinople and that splendid epoch of their race was just dawning of which my lamented friend the late sir edmund head says so well in his preface to viga glum’s icelandic saga ‘the sagas of which this tale is one were composed for the men who have left their mark in every corner of europe and whose language and laws are at this moment important elements in the speech and institutions of england america and australia  there is no page of modern history in which the influence of the norsemen and their conquests must not be taken into account—russia constantinople greece palestine sicily the coasts of africa southern italy france the spanish peninsula england scotland ireland and every rock and island round them have been visited and most of them at one time or the other ruled by the men of scandinavia  the motto on the sword of roger guiscard was a proud one      appulus et calaber siculus mihi servit et afer’  every island says sir edmund head and truly—for the name of almost every island on the coast of england scotland and eastern ireland ends in either ey or ay or oe a norse appellative as is the word island itself—is a mark of its having been at some time or other visited by the vikings of scandinavia  norway meanwhile was convulsed by war and what perhaps was of more immediate consequence svend forkbeard whom we englishmen call sweyn—the renegade from that christian faith which had been forced on him by his german conqueror the emperor otto ii—with his illustrious son cnut whom we call canute were just calling together all the most daring spirits of the baltic coasts for the subjugation of england and when that great feat was performed the scandinavian emigration was paralysed probably for a time by the fearful wars at home  while the king of sweden and st olaf tryggvason king of norway were setting on denmark during cnut’s pilgrimage to rome and cnut sailing with a mighty fleet to norway was driving st olaf into russia to return and fall in the fratricidal battle of stiklestead—during strangely enough a total eclipse of the sun—vinland was like enough to remain still uncolonised after cnut’s shortlived triumph—king as he was of denmark norway england and half scotland and what not of wendish folk inside the baltic—the force of the norsemen seems to have been exhausted in their native lands  once more only if i remember right did ‘lochlin’ really and hopefully send forth her ‘mailed swarm’ to conquer a foreign land and with a result unexpected alike by them and by their enemies  had it been otherwise we might not have been here this day  let me sketch for you once more—though you have heard it doubtless many a time—the tale of that tremendous fortnight which settled the fate of britain and therefore of north america which decided—just in those great times when the decision was to be made—whether we should be on a par with the other civilised nations of europe like them the ‘heirs of all the ages’ with our share not only of roman christianity and roman centralisation—a member of the great comity of european nations held together in one christian bond by the pope—but heirs also of roman civilisation roman literature roman law and therefore in due time of greek philosophy and art  no less a question than this it seems to me hung in the balance during that fortnight of autumn 1066  poor old edward the confessor holy weak and sad lay in his new choir of westminster—where the wicked ceased from troubling and the weary were at rest  the crowned ascetic had left no heir behind  england seemed as a corpse to which all the eagles might gather together and the southenglish in their utter need had chosen for their king the ablest and it may be the justest man in britain—earl harold godwinsson himself like half the upper classes of england then of the alldominant norse blood for his mother was a danish princess  then out of norway with a mighty host came harold hardraade taller than all men the ideal viking of his time  halfbrother of the now dead st olaf severely wounded when he was but fifteen at stiklestead when olaf fell he had warred and plundered on many a coast  he had been away to russia to king jaroslaf he had been in the emperor’s varanger guard at constantinople—and it was whispered had slain a lion there with his bare hands he had carved his name and his comrades’ in runic characters—if you go to venice you may see them at this day—on the loins of the great marble lion which stood in his time not in venice but in athens  and now king of norway and conqueror for the time of denmark why should he not take england as sweyn and canute took it sixty years before when the flower of the english gentry perished at the fatal battle of assingdune  if he and his halfbarbarous host had conquered the civilisation of britain would have been thrown back perhaps for centuries  but it was not to be  england was to be conquered by the norman but by the civilised not the barbaric by the norse who had settled but four generations before in the north east of france under rou rollo rolf the ganger—socalled they say because his legs were so long that when on horseback he touched the ground and seemed to gang or walk  he and his norsemen had taken their share of france and called it normandy to this day and meanwhile with that docility and adaptability which marks so often truly great spirits they had changed their creed their language their habits and had become from heathen and murderous berserkers the most truly civilised people of europe and—as was most natural then—the most faithful allies and servants of the pope of rome  so greatly had they changed and so fast that william duke of normandy the greatgreatgrandson of rolf the wild viking was perhaps the finest gentleman as well as the most cultivated sovereign and the greatest statesman and warrior in all europe  so harold of norway came with all his vikings to stamford bridge by york and took by coming only that which harold of england promised him namely ‘forasmuch as he was taller than any other man seven feet of english ground’  the story of that great battle told with a few inaccuracies but told as only great poets tell you should read if you have not read it already in the heimskringla of snorri sturluson the homer of the north—      high feast that day held the birds of the air and the beasts of the     field     whitetailed erne and sallow glede     dusky raven with horny neb     and the grey deer the wolf of the wood  the bones of the slain men say whitened the place for fifty years to come  and remember that on the same day on which that fight befell—sept 27 1066—william duke of normandy with all his frenchspeaking norsemen was sailing across the british channel under the protection of a banner consecrated by the pope to conquer that england which the norsespeaking normans could not conquer  and now king harold showed himself a man  he turned at once from the north of england to the south  he raised the folk of the southern as he had raised those of the central and northern shires and in sixteen days—after a march which in those times was a prodigious feat—he was entrenched upon the fatal down which men called heathfield then and senlac but battle to this day—with william and his french normans opposite him on telham hill  then came the battle of hastings  you all know what befell upon that day and how the old weapon was matched against the new—the english axe against the norman lance—and beaten only because the english broke their ranks  if you wish to refresh your memories read the tale once more in mr freeman’s history of england or prof creasy’s fifteen decisive battles of the world or even best of all the late lord lytton’s splendid romance of harold  and when you go to england go as some of you may have gone already to battle and there from off the abbey grounds or from mountjoy behind look down off what was then ‘the heathy field’ over the long slopes of green pasture and the rich hopgardens where were no hopgardens then and the flat tidemarshes winding between the wooded heights towards the southern sea and imagine for yourselves the feelings of an englishman as he contemplates that broad green sloping lawn on which was decided the destiny of his native land  here right beneath rode taillefer up the slope before them all singing the song of roland tossing his lance in air and catching it as it fell with all the norse berserker spirit of his ancestors flashing out in him at the thought of one fair fight and then purgatory or valhalla—taillefer perhaps preferred the latter  yonder on the left in that copse where the redochre gully runs is sanguelac the drain of blood into which as the bayeux tapestry woven by matilda’s maids still shows the norman knights fell horse and man till the gully was bridged with writhing bodies for those who rode after  here where you stand—the crest of the hill marks where it must have been—was the stockade on which depended the fate of england  yonder perhaps stalked out one english squire or housecarle after another tall men with longhandled battleaxes—one specially terrible with a wooden helmet which no sword could pierce—who hewed and hewed down knight on knight till they themselves were borne to earth at last  and here among the trees and ruins of the garden kept trim by those who know the treasure which they own stood harold’s two standards of the fighting man and the dragon of wessex  and here close by for here for many a century stood the high altar of battle abbey where monks sang masses for harold’s soul upon this very spot the swanneck found her hero lover’s corpse  ‘ah’ says many an englishman—and who will blame him for it—‘how grand to have died beneath that standard on that day’  yes and how right  and yet how right likewise that the norman’s cry of dexaie ‘god help’ and not the english hurrah should have won that day till william rode up mountjoye in the afternoon to see the english army terrible even in defeat struggling through copse and marsh away toward brede and like retreating lions driven into their native woods slaying more in the pursuit than they slew even in the fight  but so it was to be for so it ought to have been  you my american friends delight as i have said already in seeing the old places of the old country  go i beg you and look at that old place and if you be wise you will carry back from it one lesson that god’s thoughts are not as our thoughts nor his ways as our ways  it was a fearful time which followed  i cannot but believe that our forefathers had been in some way or other great sinners or two such conquests as canute’s and william’s would not have fallen on them within the short space of sixty years  they did not want for courage as stanford brigg and hastings showed full well  english swine their norman conquerors called them often enough but never english cowards their ruinous vice if we are to trust the records of the time was what the old monks called accidia—ἀχηδία—and ranked it as one of the seven deadly sins a general careless sleepy comfortable habit of mind which lets all go its way for good or evil—a habit of mind too often accompanied as in the case of the anglodanes with selfindulgence often coarse enough  huge eaters and huger drinkers fuddled with ale were the men who went down at hastings—though they went down like heroes—before the staid and sober norman out of france  but those were fearful times  as long as william lived ruthless as he was to all rebels he kept order and did justice with a strong and steady hand for he brought with him from normandy the instincts of a truly great statesman  and in his sons’ time matters grew worse and worse after that in the troubles of stephen’s reign anarchy let loose tyranny in its most fearful form and things were done which recall the cruelties of the old spanish conquistadores in america  scott’s charming romance of ivanhoe must be taken i fear as a too true picture of english society in the time of richard i  and what came of it all  what was the result of all this misery and wrong  this paradoxical as it may seem—that the norman conquest was the making of the english people of the free commons of england  paradoxical but true  first you must dismiss from your minds the too common notion that there is now in england a governing norman aristocracy or that there has been one at least since the year 1215 when magna charta was won from the norman john by normans and by english alike  for the first victors at hastings like the first conquistadores in america perished as the monk chronicles point out rapidly by their own crimes and very few of our nobility can trace their names back to the authentic battle abbey roll  the great majority of the peers have sprung from and all have intermarried with the commons and the peerage has been from the first and has become more and more as centuries have rolled on the prize of success in life  the cause is plain  the conquest of england by the normans was not one of those conquests of a savage by a civilised race or of a cowardly race by a brave race which results in the slavery of the conquered and leaves the gulf of caste between two races master and slave  that was the case in france and resulted after centuries of oppression in the great and dreadful revolution of 1793 which convulsed not only france but the whole civilised world  but caste thank god has never existed in england since at least the first generation after the norman conquest  the vast majority all but the whole population of england have been always free and free as they are not where caste exists to change their occupations  they could intermarry if they were able men into the ranks above them as they did sink if they were unable men into the ranks below them  any man acquainted with the origin of our english surnames may verify this fact for himself by looking at the names of a single parish or a single street of shops  there jumbled together he will find names marking the noblest saxon or angle blood—kenward or kenric osgood or osborne side by side with cordery or banister—now names of farmers in my own parish—or other normanfrench names which may be like those two last in battle abbey roll—and side by side the almost ubiquitous brown whose ancestor was probably some danish or norwegian housecarle proud of his name biorn the bear and the ubiquitous smith or smythe the smiter whose forefather whether he now be peasant or peer assuredly handled the tongs and hammer at his own forge  this holds true equally in new england and in old  when i search through as i delight to do your new england surnames i find the same jumble of names—west saxon angle danish norman and frenchnorman likewise many of primæval and heathen antiquity many of high nobility all worked together as at home to form the free commoners of england  if any should wish to know more on this curious and important subject let me recommend them to study ferguson’s teutonic name system a book from which you will discover that some of our quaintest and seemingly most plebeian surnames—many surnames too which are extinct in england but remain in america—are really corruptions of good old teutonic names which our ancestors may have carried in the german forest before an englishman set foot on british soil from which he will rise with the comfortable feeling that we englishspeaking men from the highest to the lowest are literally kinsmen  nay so utterly made up now is the old bloodfeud between norseman and englishman between the descendants of those who conquered and those who were conquered that in the children of our prince of wales after 800 years the blood of william of normandy is mingled with the blood of the very harold who fell at hastings  and so by the bitter woes which followed the norman conquest was the whole population dane angle and saxon earl and churl freeman and slave crushed and welded together into one homogeneous mass made just and merciful towards each other by the most wholesome of all teachings a community of suffering and if they had been as i fear they were a lazy and a sensual people were taught      that life is not as idle ore     but heated hot with burning fears     and bathed in baths of hissing tears     and battered with the strokes of doom     to shape and use  but how did these wild vikings become christian men  it is a long story so staunch a race was sure to be converted only very slowly  noble missionaries as ansgar rembert and poppo had worked for 150 years and more among the heathens of denmark  but the patriotism of the norseman always recoiled even though in secret from the fact that they were german monks backed by the authority of the german emperor and many a man like svend forkbeard father of the great canute though he had the kaiser himself for godfather turned heathen once more the moment he was free because his baptism was the badge of foreign conquest and neither pope nor kaiser should lord it over him body or soul  st olaf indeed forced christianity on the norse at the sword’s point often by horrid cruelties and perished in the attempt  but who forced it on the norsemen of scotland england ireland neustria russia and all the eastern baltic  it was absorbed and in most cases i believe gradually and willingly as a gospel and good news to hearts worn out with the storm of their own passions  and whence came their christianity  much of it as in the case of the danes and still more of the french normans came direct from rome the city which let them defy its influence as they would was still the fount of all theology as well as of all civilisation  but i must believe that much of it came from that mysterious ancient western church the church of st patric st bridget st columba which had covered with rude cells and chapels the rocky islets of the north atlantic even to iceland itself  even to iceland for when that island was first discovered about ad 840 the norsemen found in an isle on the east and west and elsewhere irish books and bells and wooden crosses and named that island papey the isle of the popes—some little colony of monks who lived by fishing and who are said to have left the land when the norsemen settled in it  let us believe for it is consonant with reason and experience that the sight of those poor monks plundered and massacred again and again by the ‘mailed swarms of lochlin’ yet never exterminated but springing up again in the same place ready for fresh massacre a sacred plant which god had planted and which no rage of man could trample out—let us believe i say that that sight taught at last to the buccaneers of the old world that there was a purer manliness a loftier heroism than the ferocious selfassertion of the berserker even the heroism of humility gentleness selfrestraint selfsacrifice  that there was a strength which was made perfect in weakness a glory not of the sword but of the cross  we will believe that that was the lesson which the norsemen learnt after many a wild and bloodstained voyage from the monks of iona or of derry which caused the building of such churches as that which sightrys king of dublin raised about the year 1030 not in the norse but in the irish quarter of dublin a sacred token of amity between the new settlers and the natives on the ground of a common faith  let us believe too that the influence of woman was not wanting in the good work—that the story of st margaret and malcolm canmore was repeated though inversely in the case of many a heathen scandinavian jarl who marrying the princely daughter of some scottish chieftain found in her creed at last something more precious than herself while his brother or his cousin became at dublin or wexford or waterford the husband of some saffronrobed irish princess ‘fair as an elf’ as the old saying was ‘some maiden of the three transcendent hues’ of whom the old book of linane says—      red as the blood which flowed from stricken deer     white as the snow on which that blood ran down     black as the raven who drank up that blood  —and possibly as in the case of brian boru’s mother had given his fairhaired sister in marriage to some irish prince and could not resist the spell of their new creed and the spell too it may be of some sister of theirs who had long given up all thought of earthly marriage to tend the undying fire of st bridget among the consecrated virgins of kildare  i am not drawing from mere imagination  that such things must have happened and happened again and again is certain to anyone who knows even superficially the documents of that time  and i doubt not that in manners as well as in religion the norse were humanised and civilised by their contact with the celts both in scotland and in ireland both peoples had valour intellect imagination but the celt had that which the burly angular norse character however deep and stately and however humorous wanted namely music of nature tenderness grace rapidity playfulness just the qualities combining with the scandinavian and in scotland with the angle elements of character which have produced in ireland and in scotland two schools of lyric poetry second to none in the world  and so they were converted to what was then a dark and awful creed a creed of ascetic selftorture and purgatorial fires for those who escaped the still more dreadful because endless doom of the rest of the human race  but because it was a sad creed it suited better men who had when conscience reawakened in them but too good reason to be sad and the minsters and cloisters which sprang up over the whole of northern europe and even beyond it along the dreary western shores of greenland itself are the symbols of a splendid repentance for their own sins and for the sins of their forefathers  gudruna herself of whom i spoke just now one of those old norse heroines who helped to discover america though a historic personage is a symbolic one likewise and the pattern of a whole class  she too after many journeys to iceland greenland and winland goes on a pilgrimage to rome to get i presume absolution from the pope himself for all the sins of her strange rich stormy wayward life  have you not read—many of you surely have—la motte fouqué’s romance of sintram  it embodies all that i would say  it is the spiritual drama of that early middle age very sad morbid if you will but true to fact the lady verena ought not perhaps to desert her husband and shut herself up in a cloister  but so she would have done in those old days and who shall judge her harshly for so doing  when the brutality of the man seems past all cure who shall blame the woman if she glides away into some atmosphere of peace and purity to pray for him whom neither warnings nor caresses will amend  it is a sad book sintram  and yet not too sad  for they were a sad people those old norse forefathers of ours  their christianity was sad their minsters sad there are few sadder though few grander buildings than a norman church  and yet perhaps their christianity did not make them sad  it was but the other and the healthier side of that sadness which they had as heathens  read which you will of the old sagas—heathen or halfchristian—the eyrbiggia viga glum burnt niall grettir the strong and above all snorri sturluson’s heimskringla itself—and you will see at once how sad they are  there is in the old sagas none of that enjoyment of life which shines out everywhere in greek poetry even through its deepest tragedies  not in complacency with nature’s beauty but in the fierce struggle with her wrath does the norseman feel pleasure  nature to him was not as in mr longfellow’s exquisite poem 91 the kind old nurse to take him on her knee and whisper to him ever anew the story without an end  she was a weird witchwife mother of storm demons and frost giants who must be fought with steadily warily wearily over dreary heaths and snowcapped fells and rugged nesses and tossing sounds and away into the boundless sea—or who could live—till he got hardened in the fight into ruthlessness of need and greed  the poor strip of flat strath ploughed and reploughed again in the short summer days would yield no more or wet harvests spoiled the crops or heavy snows starved the cattle  and so the norseman launched his ships when the lands were sown in spring and went forth to pillage or to trade as luck would have to summerted as he himself called it and came back if he ever came in autumn to the women to help at harvesttime with blood upon his hand  but had he staid at home blood would have been there still  three out of four of them had been mixed up in some manslaying or had some bloodfeud to avenge among their own kin  the whole of scandinavia denmark sweden norway orkney and the rest remind me ever of that terrible picture of the great norse painter tiddeman in which two splendid youths lashed together in true norse duel fashion by the waist are hewing each other to death with the short axe about some hot words over their ale  the loss of life and that of the most gallant of the young in those days must have been enormous  if the vitality of the race had not been even more enormous they must have destroyed each other as the red indians have done off the face of the earth  they lived these norsemen not to live—they lived to die  for what cared they  death—what was death to them what it was to the jomsburger viking who when led out to execution said to the headsman ‘die with all pleasure  we used to question in jomsburg whether a man felt when his head was off  now i shall know but if i do take care for i shall smite thee with my knife  and meanwhile spoil not this long hair of mine it is so beautiful’  but oh what waste  what might not these men have done if they had sought peace not war if they had learned a few centuries sooner to do justly and love mercy and walk humbly with their god  and yet one loves them bloodstained as they are  your own poets men brought up under circumstances under ideas the most opposite to theirs love them and cannot help it  and why  it is not merely for their bold daring it is not merely for their stern endurance nor again that they had in them that shift and thrift those steady and commonsense business habits which made their noblest men not ashamed to go on voyages of merchandise  nor is it again that grim humour—humour as of the modern scotch—which so often flashes out into an actual jest but more usually underlies unspoken all their deeds  is it not rather that these men are our forefathers that their blood runs in the veins of perhaps three men out of four in any general assembly whether in america or in britain startling as the assertion may be i believe it to be strictly true  be that as it may i cannot read the stories of your western men the writings of bret harte or colonel john hay for instance without feeling at every turn that there are the old norse alive again beyond the very ocean which they first crossed 850 years ago  let me try to prove my point and end with a story as i began with one  it is just 30 years before the norman conquest of england the evening of the battle of sticklestead  st olaf’s corpse is still lying unburied on the hillside  the reforming and christian king has fallen in the attempt to force christianity and despotism on the conservative and halfheathen party—the free bonders or yeomanfarmers of norway  thormod his poet—the man as his name means of thunder mood—who has been standing in the ranks at last has an arrow in his left side  he breaks off the shaft and thus sore wounded goes up when all is lost to a farm where is a great barn full of wounded  one kimbe comes a man out of the opposite or bonder part  ‘there is great howling and screaming in there’ he says  ‘king olaf’s men fought bravely enough but it is a shame brisk young lads cannot bear their wounds  on what side wert thou in the fight’  ‘on the best side’ says the beaten thormod  kimbe sees that thormod has a gold bracelet on his arm  ‘thou art surely a king’s man  give me thy gold ring and i will hide thee ere the bonders kill thee’  thormod said ‘take it if thou canst get it  i have lost that which is worth more’ and he stretched out his left hand and kimbe tried to take it  but thormod swinging his sword cut off his hand and it is said kimbe behaved no better over his wound than those he had been blaming  then thormod went into the barn and after he had sung his song there in praise of his dead king he went into an inner room where was a fire and water warming and a handsome girl binding up men’s wounds  and he sat down by the door and one said to him ‘why art thou so dead pale why dost thou not call for the leech’  then sung thormod—      i am not blooming and the fair     and slender maiden loves to care     for blooming youths  few care for me     with fenri’s gold meal i can’t fee  and so forth improvising after the old norse fashion  then thormod got up and went to the fire and stood and warmed himself and the nursegirl said to him ‘go out man and bring some of the splitfirewood which lies outside the door’  he went out and brought an armful of wood and threw it down  then the nursegirl looked him in the face and said ‘dreadful pale is this man  why art thou so’  then sang thormod—      thou wonderest sweet bloom at me     a man so hideous to see     the arrowdrift o’ertook me girl     a fineground arrow in the whirl     went through me and i feel the dart     sits lovely lass too near my heart  the girl said ‘let me see thy wound’  then thormod sat down and the girl saw his wounds and that which was in his side and saw that there was a piece of iron in it but could not tell where it had gone  in a stone pot she had leeks and other herbs and boiled them and gave the wounded men of it to eat  but thormod said ‘take it away i have no appetite now for my broth’  then she took a great pair of tongs and tried to pull out the iron but the wound was swelled and there was too little to lay hold of  now said thormod ‘cut in so deep that thou canst get at the iron and give me the tongs’  she did as he said  then took thormod the gold bracelet off his hand and gave it the nursegirl and bade her do with it what she liked  ‘it is a good man’s gift’ said he  ‘king olaf gave me the ring this morning’  then thormod took the tongs and pulled the iron out  but on the iron was a barb on which hung flesh from the heart some red some white  when he saw that he said ‘the king has fed us well  i am fat even to the heart’s roots’  and so leant back and was dead  i shall not insult your intelligence by any comment or even epithet of my own  i shall but ask you was not this man your kinsman  does not the story sound allowing for all change of manners as well as of time and place like a scene out of your own bret harte or colonel john hay’s writings a scene of the dry humour the rough heroism of your own far west  yes as long as you have your jem bludsos and tom flynns of virginia city the old norse blood is surely not extinct the old norse spirit is not dead     lecture iv the servant of the lord   i wish to speak to you tonight about one of those old despotic empires which were in every case the earliest known form of civilisation  were i minded to play the cynic or the mountebank i should choose some corrupt and effete despotism already grown weak and ridiculous by its decay—as did at last the roman and then the byzantine empire—and after raising a laugh at the expense of the old system say see what a superior people you are now—how impossible under free and enlightened institutions is anything so base and so absurd as went on even in despotic france before the revolution of 1793  well that would be on the whole true thank god but what need is there to say it  let us keep our scorn for our own weaknesses our blame for our own sins certain that we shall gain more instruction though not more amusement by hunting out the good which is in anything than by hunting out its evil  for me true to that which i proposed in my last lecture i have chosen not the worst but the best despotism which i could find in history founded and ruled by a truly heroic personage one whose name has become a proverb and a legend that so i might lift up your minds even by the contemplation of an old eastern empire to see that it too could be a work and ordinance of god and its hero the servant of the lord  for we are almost bound to call cyrus the founder of the persian empire by this august title for two reasons—first because the hebrew scriptures call him so and next because he proved himself to be such by his actions and their consequences—at least in the eyes of those who believe as i do in a farseeing and farreaching providence by which all human history is—      bound by gold chains unto the throne of god  his work was very different from any that need be done or can be done in these our days  but while we thank god that such work is now as unnecessary as impossible we may thank god likewise that when such work was necessary and possible a man was raised up to do it and to do it as all accounts assert better perhaps than it had ever been done before or since  true the old conquerors who absorbed nation after nation tribe after tribe and founded empires on their ruins are now i trust about to be replaced throughout the world as here and in britain at home by free selfgoverned peoples—      the old order changeth giving place to the new     and god fulfils himself in many ways     lest one good custom should corrupt the world  and that custom of conquest and empire and transplantation did more than once corrupt the world  and yet in it too god may have more than once fulfilled his own designs as he did if scripture is to be believed in cyrus well surnamed the great the founder of the persian empire some 2400 years ago  for these empires it must be remembered did at least that which the roman empire did among a scattered number of savage tribes or separate little races hating and murdering each other speaking different tongues and worshipping different gods and losing utterly the sense of a common humanity till they looked on the people who dwelt in the next valley as fiends to be sacrificed if caught to their own fiends at home  among such as these empires did introduce order law common speech common interest the notion of nationality and humanity  they as it were hammered together the fragments of the human race till they had moulded them into one  they did it cruelly clumsily ill but was there ever work done on earth however noble which was not—alas alas—done somewhat ill  let me talk to you a little about the old hero  he and his hardy persians should be specially interesting to us  for in them first does our race the aryan race appear in authentic history  in them first did our race give promise of being the conquering and civilising race of the future world  and to the conquests of cyrus—so strangely are all great times and great movements of the human family linked to each other—to his conquests humanly speaking is owing the fact that you are here and i am speaking to you at this moment  it is an ofttold story but so grand a one that i must sketch it for you however clumsily once more  in that mountain province called farsistan northeast of what we now call persia the dwelling place of the persians there dwelt in the sixth and seventh centuries before christ a hardy tribe of the purest blood of iran a branch of the same race as the celtic teutonic greek and hindoo and speaking a tongue akin to theirs  they had wandered thither said their legends out of the far northeast from off some lofty plateau of central asia driven out by the increasing cold which left them but two months of summer to ten of winter  they despised at first—would that they had despised always—the luxurious life of the dwellers in the plains and the effeminate customs of the medes—a branch of their own race who had conquered and intermarried with the turanian or finnish tribes and adopted much of their creed as well as of their morals throughout their vast but shortlived median empire ‘soft countries’ said cyrus himself—so runs the tale—‘gave birth to small men  no region produced at once delightful fruits and men of a warlike spirit’  letters were to them probably then unknown  they borrowed them in after years as they borrowed their art from babylonians assyrians and other semitic nations whom they conquered from the age of five to that of twenty their lads were instructed but in two things—to speak the truth and to shoot with the bow  to ride was the third necessary art introduced according to xenophon after they had descended from their mountain fastnesses to conquer the whole east  their creed was simple enough  ahura mazda—ormuzd as he has been called since—was the one eternal creator the source of all light and life and good  he spake his word and it accomplished the creation of heaven before the water before the earth before the cow before the tree before the fire before man the truthful before the devas and beasts of prey before the whole existing universe before every good thing created by ahura mazda and springing from truth  he needed no sacrifices of blood  he was to be worshipped only with prayers with offerings of the inspiring juice of the now unknown herb homa and by the preservation of the sacred fire which understand was not he but the symbol—as was light and the sun—of the good spirit—of ahura mazda  they had no images of the gods these old persians no temples no altars so says herodotus and considered the use of them a sign of folly  they were as has been well said of them the puritans of the old world  when they descended from their mountain fastnesses they became the iconoclasts of the old world and the later isaiah out of the depths of national shame captivity and exile saw in them brotherspirits the chosen of the lord whose hero cyrus the lord was holding by his right hand till all the foul superstitions and foul effeminacies of the rotten semitic peoples of the east and even of egypt itself should be crushed though alas only for a while by men who felt that they had a commission from the god of light and truth and purity to sweep out all that with the besom of destruction  but that was a later inspiration  in earlier and it may be happier times the duty of the good man was to strive against all evil disorder uselessness incompetence in their more simple forms  ‘he therefore is a holy man’ says ormuzd in the zendavesta ‘who has built a dwelling on the earth in which he maintains fire cattle his wife his children and flocks and herds he who makes the earth produce barley he who cultivates the fruits of the soil cultivates purity he advances the law of ahura mazda as much as if he had offered a hundred sacrifices’  to reclaim the waste to till the land to make a corner of the earth better than they found it was to these men to rescue a bit of ormuzd’s world out of the usurped dominion of ahriman to rescue it from the spirit of evil and disorder for its rightful owner the spirit of order and of good  for they believed in an evil spirit these old persians  evil was not for them a lower form of good  with their intense sense of the difference between right and wrong it could be nothing less than hateful to be attacked exterminated as a personal enemy till it became to them at last impersonate and a person  zarathustra the mystery of evil weighed heavily on them and on their great prophet zoroaster—splendour of gold as i am told his name signifies—who lived no man knows clearly when or clearly where but who lived and lives for ever for his works follow him  he too tried to solve for his people the mystery of evil and if he did not succeed who has succeeded yet  warring against ormuzd ahura mazda was ahriman angra mainyus literally the being of an evil mind the illconditioned being  he was labouring perpetually to spoil the good work of ormuzd alike in nature and in man  he was the cause of the fall of man the tempter the author of misery and death he was eternal and uncreate as ormuzd was  but that perhaps was a corruption of the purer and older zoroastrian creed  with it if ahriman were eternal in the past he would not be eternal in the future  somehow somewhen somewhere in the day when three prophets—the increasing light the increasing truth and the existing truth—should arise and give to mankind the last three books of the zendavesta and convert all mankind to the pure creed then evil should be conquered the creation become pure again and ahriman vanish for ever and meanwhile every good man was to fight valiantly for ormuzd his true lord against ahriman and all his works  men who held such a creed and could speak truth and draw the bow what might they not do when the hour and the man arrived  they were not a big nation  no but they were a great nation even while they were eating barleybread and paying tribute to their conquerors the medes in the sterile valleys of farsistan  and at last the hour and the man came  the story is half legendary—differently told by different authors  herodotus has one tale xenophon another  the first at least had ample means of information astyages is the old shah of the median empire then at the height of its seeming might and splendour and effeminacy  he has married his daughter the princess mandane to cambyses seemingly a vassalking or prince of the pure persian blood  one night the old man is troubled with a dream he sees a vine spring from his daughter which overshadows all asia  he sends for the magi to interpret and they tell him that mandane will have a son who will reign in his stead  having sons of his own and fearing for the succession he sends for mandane and when her child is born gives it to harpagus one of his courtiers to be slain  the courtier relents and hands it over to a herdsman to be exposed on the mountains the herdsman relents in turn and brings the babe up as his own child  when the boy who goes by the name of agradates is grown he is at play with the other herdboys and they choose him for a mimic king  some he makes his guards some he bids build houses some carry his messages the son of a mede of rank refuses and agradates has him seized by his guards and chastised with the whip  the ancestral instincts of command and discipline are showing early in the lad  the young gentleman complains to his father the father to the old king who of course sends for the herdsman and his boy  the boy answers in a tone so exactly like that in which xenophon’s cyrus would have answered that i must believe that both xenophon’s cyrus and herodotus’ cyrus like xenophon’s socrates and plato’s socrates are real pictures of a real character and that herodotus’ story though xenophon says nothing of it is true  he has done nothing the noble boy says but what was just  he had been chosen king in play because the boys thought him most fit  the boy whom he had chastised was one of those who chose him  all the rest obeyed but he would not till at last he got his due reward  ‘if i deserve punishment for that’ says the boy ‘i am ready to submit’  the old king looks keenly and wonderingly at the young king whose features seem somewhat like his own  likely enough in those days when an iranian noble or prince would have a quite different cast of complexion and of face from a turanian herdsman  a suspicion crosses him and by threats of torture he gets the truth from the trembling herdsman  to the poor wretch’s rapture the old king lets him go unharmed  he has a more exquisite revenge to take and sends for harpagus who likewise confesses the truth  the wily old tyrant has naught but gentle words it is best as it is  he has been very sorry himself for the child and mandane’s reproaches had gone to his heart  ‘let harpagus go home and send his son to be a companion to the newfound prince  tonight there will be great sacrifices in honour of the child’s safety and harpagus is to be a guest at the banquet’  harpagus comes and after eating his fill is asked how he likes the king’s meat  he gives the usual answer and a covered basket is put before him out of which he is to take—in median fashion—what he likes he finds in it the head and hands and feet of his own son  like a true eastern he shows no signs of horror  the king asks him if he knew what flesh he had been eating  he answers that he knew perfectly  that whatever the king did pleased him  like an eastern courtier he knew how to dissemble but not to forgive and bided his time  the magi to their credit told astyages that his dream had been fulfilled that cyrus—as we must now call the foundling prince—had fulfilled it by becoming a king in play and the boy is let to go back to his father and his hardy persian life  but harpagus does not leave him alone nor perhaps do his own thoughts  he has wrongs to avenge on his grandfather  and it seems not altogether impossible to the young mountaineer  he has seen enough of median luxury to despise it and those who indulge in it  he has seen his own grandfather with his cheeks rouged his eyelids stained with antimony living a womanlike life shut up from all his subjects in the recesses of a vast seraglio  he calls together the mountain rulers makes friends with tigranes an armenian prince a vassal of the mede who has his wrongs likewise to avenge  and the two little armies of footsoldiers—the persians had no cavalry—defeat the innumerable horsemen of the mede take the old king keep him in honourable captivity and so change one legend says in a single battle the fortunes of the whole east  and then begins that series of conquests of which we know hardly anything save the fact that they were made  the young mountaineer and his playmates whom he makes his generals and satraps sweep onward towards the west teaching their men the art of riding till the persian cavalry becomes more famous than the median had been  they gather to them as a snowball gathers in rolling the picked youth of every tribe whom they overcome  they knit these tribes to them in loyalty and affection by that righteousness—that truthfulness and justice—for which isaiah in his grandest lyric strains has made them illustrious to all time which xenophon has celebrated in like manner in that exquisite book of his—the cyropædia  the great lydian kingdom of crœsus—asia minor as we call it now—goes down before them  babylon itself goes down after that worldfamed siege which ended in belshazzar’s feast and when cyrus died—still in the prime of life the legends seem to say—he left a coherent and wellorganised empire which stretched from the mediterranean to hindostan  so runs the tale which to me i confess sounds probable and rational enough  it may not do so to you for it has not to many learned men they are inclined to ‘relegate it into the region of myth’ in plain english to call old herodotus a liar or at least a dupe  what means those wise men can have at this distance of more than 2000 years of knowing more about the matter than herodotus who lived within 100 years of cyrus i for myself cannot discover  and i say this without the least wish to disparage these hypercritical persons  for there are—and more there ought to be as long as lies and superstitions remain on this earth—a class of thinkers who hold in just suspicion all stories which savour of the sensational the romantic even the dramatic  they know the terrible uses to which appeals to the fancy and the emotions have been applied and are still applied to enslave the intellects the consciences the very bodies of men and women  they dread so much from experience the abuse of that formula that a thing is so beautiful it must be true that they are inclined to reply ‘rather let us say boldly it is so beautiful that it cannot be true  let us mistrust or even refuse to believe à priori and at first sight all startling sensational even poetic tales and accept nothing as history which is not as dull as the ledger of a dry goods’ store’  but i think that experience both in nature and in society are against that ditchwater philosophy  the weather being governed by laws ought always to be equable and normal and yet you have whirlwinds droughts thunderstorms the sharemarket being governed by laws ought to be always equable and normal and yet you have startling transactions startling panics startling disclosures and a whole sensational romance of commercial crime and folly  which of us has lived to be fifty years old without having witnessed in private life sensation tragedies alas sometimes too fearful to be told or at least sensational romances which we shall take care not to tell because we shall not be believed  let the ditchwater philosophy say what it will human life is not a ditch but a wild and roaring river flooding its banks and eating out new channels with many a landslip  it is a strange world and man a strange animal guided it is true usually by most commonplace motives but for that reason ready and glad at times to escape from them and their dulness and baseness to give vent if but for a moment in wild freedom to that demoniac element which as goethe says underlies his nature and all nature and to prefer for an hour to the normal and respectable ditchwater a bottle of champagne or even a carouse on firewater let the consequences be what they may  how else shall we explain such a phenomenon as those old crusades  were they undertaken for any purpose commercial or other  certainly not for lightening an overburdened population  nay is not the history of your own mormons and their exodus into the far west one of the most startling instances which the world has seen for several centuries of the unexpected and incalculable forces which lie hid in man  believe me man’s passions heated to igniting point rather than his prudence cooled down to freezing point are the normal causes of all great human movement  and a truer law of social science than any that political economists are wont to lay down is that old ‘dov’ é la donna’ of the italian judge who used to ask as a preliminary to every case civil or criminal which was brought before him ‘dov’ é la donna’  ‘where is the lady’ certain like a wise old gentleman that a woman was most probably at the bottom of the matter  strangeness  romance  did any of you ever read—if you have not you should read—archbishop whately’s historic doubts about the emperor napoleon the first  therein the learned and witty archbishop proved as early as 1819 by fair use of the criticism of mr hume and the sceptic school that the whole history of the great napoleon ought to be treated by wise men as a myth and a romance that there is little or no evidence of his having existed at all and that the story of his strange successes and strange defeats was probably invented by our government in order to pander to the vanity of the english nation  i will say this which archbishop whately in a late edition foreshadows wittily enough—that if one or two thousand years hence when the history of the late emperor napoleon the third his rise and fall shall come to be subjected to critical analysis by future philistine historians of new zealand or australia it will be proved by them to be utterly mythical incredible monstrous—and that all the more the more the actual facts remain to puzzle their unimaginative brains  what will they make two thousand years hence of the landing at boulogne with the tame eagle  will not that and stranger facts still but just as true be relegated to the region of myth with the dream of astyages and the young and princely herdsman playing at king over his fellowslaves  but enough of this  to me these bits of romance often seem the truest as well as the most important portions of history  when old herodotus tells me how king astyages having guarded the frontier harpagus sent a hunter to young cyrus with a freshkilled hare telling him to open it in private and how sewn up in it was the letter telling him that the time to rebel was come i am inclined to say that must be true  so beneath the dignity of history so quaint and unexpected it is all the more likely not to have been invented  so with that other story—how young cyrus giving out that his grandfather had made him general of the persians summoned them all each man with a sickle in his hand into a prairie full of thorns and bade them clear it in one day and how when they like loyal men had finished he bade them bathe and next day he took them into a great meadow and feasted them with corn and wine and all that his father’s farm would yield and asked them which day they liked best and when they answered as was to be expected how he opened his parable and told them ‘choose then to work for the persians like slaves or to be free with me’  such a tale sounds to me true  it has the very savour of the parables of the old testament as have surely the dreams of the old sultan with which the tale begins  do they not put us in mind of the dreams of nebuchadnezzar in the book of daniel  such stories are actually so beautiful that they are very likely to be true  understand me i only say likely the ditchwater view of history is not all wrong  its advocates are right in saying great historic changes are not produced simply by one great person by one remarkable event  they have been preparing perhaps for centuries  they are the result of numberless forces acting according to laws which might have been foreseen and will be foreseen when the science of history is more perfectly understood  for instance cyrus could not have conquered the median empire at a single blow if first that empire had not been utterly rotten and next if he and his handful of persians had not been tempered and sharpened by long hardihood to the finest cutting edge  yes there were all the materials for the catastrophe—the cannon the powder the shot  but to say that the persians must have conquered the medes even if cyrus had never lived is to say as too many philosophers seem to me to say that given cannon powder and shot it will fire itself off some day if we only leave it alone long enough  it may be so  but our usual experience of nature and fact is that spontaneous combustion is a rare and exceptional phenomenon that if a cannon is to be fired someone must arise and pull the trigger  and i believe that in society and politics when a great event is ready to be done someone must come and do it—do it perhaps half unwittingly by some single rash act—like that first fatal shot fired at fort sumter—which makes as by an electric spark a whole nation flash into enduring flame  but to return to cyrus and his persians  i know not whether the cyropædia is much read in your schools and universities  but it is one of the books which i should like to see either in a translation or its own exquisite greek in the hands of every young man  it is not all fact  it is but a historic romance  but it is better than history  it is an ideal book like sidney’s arcadia or spenser’s fairy queen—the ideal selfeducation of an ideal hero  and the moral of the book—ponder it well all young men who have the chance or the hope of exercising authority among your fellowmen the noble and most christian moral of that heathen book is this that the path to solid and beneficent influence over our fellowmen lies not through brute force not through cupidity but through the highest morality through justice truthfulness humanity selfdenial modesty courtesy and all which makes man or woman lovely in the eyes of mortals or of god  yes the cyropædia is a noble book about a noble personage  but i cannot forget that there are nobler words by far concerning that same noble personage in the magnificent series of hebrew lyrics which begins ‘comfort ye comfort ye my people saith the lord’—in which the inspired poet watching the rise of cyrus and his puritans and the fall of babylon and the idolatries of the east and the coming deliverance of his own countrymen speaks of the persian hero in words so grand that they have been often enough applied and with all fitness to one greater than cyrus and than all men—      who raised up the righteous man from the east     and called him to attend his steps     who subdued nations at his presence     and gave him dominion over kings     and made them like the dust before his sword     and the driven stubble before his bow     he pursueth them he passeth in safety     by a way never trodden before by his feet     who hath performed and made these things     calling the generations from the beginning     i jehovah the first and the last i am the same      behold my servant whom i will uphold     my chosen in whom my soul delighteth     i will make my spirit rest upon him     and he shall publish judgment to the nations     he shall not cry aloud nor clamour     nor cause his voice to be heard in the streets     the bruised reed he shall not break     and the smoking flax he shall not quench     he shall publish justice and establish it     his force shall not be abated nor broken     until he has firmly seated justice in the earth     and the distant nations shall wait for his law     thus saith the god even jehovah     who created the heavens and stretched them out     who spread abroad the earth and its produce     i jehovah have called thee for a righteous end     and i will take hold of thy hand and preserve thee     and i will give thee for a covenant to the people     and for a light to the nations     to open the eyes of the blind     to bring the captives out of prison     and from the dungeon those who dwell in darkness     i am jehovah—that is my name     and my glory will i not give to another     nor my praise to the graven idols      who saith to cyrus—thou art my shepherd     and he shall fulfil all my pleasure     who saith to jerusalem—thou shalt be built     and to the temple—thou shalt be founded     thus saith jehovah to his anointed     to cyrus whom i hold fast by his right hand     that i may subdue nations under him     and loose the loins of kings     that i may open before him the twoleaved doors     and the gates shall not be shut     i will go before thee     and bring the mountains low     the gates of brass will i break in sunder     and the bars of iron hew down     and i will give thee the treasures of darkness     and the hoards hid deep in secret places     that thou mayest know that i am jehovah     i have surnamed thee though thou knowest not me     i am jehovah and none else     beside me there is no god     i will gird thee though thou hast not known me     that they may know from the rising of the sun     and from the west that there is none beside me     i am jehovah and none else     forming light and creating darkness     forming peace and creating evil     i jehovah make all these  this is the hebrew prophet’s conception of the great puritan of the old world who went forth with such a commission as this to destroy the idols of the east while      the isles saw that and feared     and the ends of the earth were afraid     they drew near they came together     everyone helped his neighbour     and said to his brother be of good courage      the carver encouraged the smith     he that smoothed with the hammer     him that smote on the anvil     saying of the solder it is good     and fixing the idol with nails lest it be moved  but all in vain for as the poet goes on—      bel bowed down and nebo stooped     their idols were upon the cattle     a burden to the weary beast     they stoop they bow down together     they could not deliver their own charge     themselves are gone into captivity  and what to return what was the end of the great cyrus and of his empire  alas alas as with all human glory the end was not as the beginning  we are scarce bound to believe positively the story how cyrus made one war too many and was cut off in the scythian deserts falling before the arrows of mere savages and how their queen tomyris poured blood down the throat of the dead corpse with the words ‘glut thyself with the gore for which thou hast thirsted’  but it may be true—for xenophon states it expressly and with detail—that cyrus from the very time of his triumph became an eastern despot a sultan or a shah living apart from his people in mysterious splendour in the vast fortified palace which he built for himself and imitating and causing his nobles and satraps to imitate in all but vice and effeminacy the very medes whom he had conquered  and of this there is no doubt—that his sons and their empire ran rapidly through that same vicious circle of corruption to which all despotisms are doomed and became within 250 years even as the medes the chaldeans the lydians whom they had conquered children no longer of ahura mazda but of ahriman of darkness and not of light to be conquered by alexander and his greeks even more rapidly and more shamefully than they had conquered the east  this is the short epic of the persian empire ending alas as all human epics are wont to end sadly if not shamefully  but let me ask you did i say too much when i said that to these persians we owe that we are here tonight  i do not say that without them we should not have been here  god i presume when he is minded to do anything has more than one way of doing it  but that we are tonight the last link in a chain of causes and effects which reaches as far back as the emigration of the persians southward from the plateau of pamir we cannot doubt  for see  by the fall of babylon and its empire the jews were freed from their captivity—large numbers of them at least—and sent home to their own jerusalem  what motives prompted cyrus and darius after him to do that deed  those who like to impute the lowest motives may say if they will that daniel and the later isaiah found it politic to worship the rising sun and flatter the persian conquerors and that cyrus and darius in turn were glad to see jerusalem rebuilt as an impregnable frontier fortress between them and egypt  be it so i who wish to talk of things noble pure lovely and of good report would rather point you once more to the magnificent poetry of the later isaiah which commences at the 40th chapter of the book of isaiah and say—there upon the very face of the document stands written the fact that the sympathy between the faithful persian and the faithful jew—the two puritans of the old world the two haters of lies idolatries superstitions—was actually as intense as it ought to have been as it must have been  be that as it may the return of the jews to jerusalem preserved for us the old testament while it restored to them a national centre a sacred city like that of delphi to the greeks rome to the romans mecca to the muslim loyalty to which prevented their being utterly absorbed by the more civilised eastern races among whom they had been scattered abroad as colonies of captives  then another and a seemingly needful link of cause and effect ensued alexander of macedon destroyed the persian empire and the east became greek and alexandria rather than jerusalem became the headquarters of jewish learning  but for that very cause the scriptures were not left inaccessible to the mass of mankind like the old pehlevi liturgies of the zendavesta or the old sanscrit vedas in an obsolete and hieratic tongue but were translated into and continued in the then all but worldwide hellenic speech which was to the ancient world what french is to the modern  then the east became roman without losing its greek speech  and under the wide domination of that later roman empire—which had subdued and organised the whole known world save the parthian descendants of those old persians and our old teutonic forefathers in their german forests and on their scandinavian shores—that divine book was carried far and wide east and west and south from the heart of abyssinia to the mountains of armenia and to the isles of the ocean beyond britain itself to ireland and to the hebrides  and that book—so strangely coinciding with the old creed of the earlier persians—that book long misunderstood long overlain by the dust and overgrown by the parasitic fungi of centuries that book it was which sent to these transatlantic shores the founders of your great nation that book gave them their instinct of freedom tempered by reverence for law  that book gave them their hatred of idolatry and made them not only say but act upon their own words with these old persians and with the jewish prophets alike sacrifice and burntoffering thou wouldst not then said we lo we come  in the volume of the book it is written of us that we come to do thy will o god  yes long and fantastic is the chain of causes and effects which links you here to the old heroes who came down from central asia because the land had grown so wondrous cold that there were ten months of winter to two of summer and when simply after warmth and life and food for them and for their flocks they wandered forth to found and help to found a spiritual kingdom  and even in their migration far back in these dim and mystic ages have we found the earliest link of the long chain  not so  what if the legend of the change of climate be the dim recollection of an enormous physical fact  what if it and the gradual depopulation of the whole north of asia be owing as geologists now suspect to the slow and agelong uprise of the whole of siberia thrusting the warm arctic sea further and further to the northward and placing between it and the highlands of thibet an everincreasing breadth of icy land destroying animals and driving whole races southward in search of the summer and the sun  what if the first link in the chain as yet conceivable by man should be the cosmic changes in the distribution of land and water which filled the mouths of the siberian rivers with frozen carcases of woolly mammoth and rhinoceros and those again doubt it not of other revolutions reaching back and back and on and on into the infinite unknown  why not  for so are all human destinies      bound with gold chains unto the throne of god     lecture v ancient civilisation   there is a theory abroad in the world just now about the origin of the human race which has so many patent and powerful physiological facts to support it that we must not lightly say that it is absurd or impossible and that is that man’s mortal body and brain were derived from some animal and apelike creature  of that i am not going to speak now  my subject is—how this creature called man from whatever source derived became civilised rational and moral  and i am sorry to say there is tacked on by many to the first theory another which does not follow from it and which has really nothing to do with it and it is this—that man with all his wonderful and mysterious aspirations always unfulfilled yet always precious at once his torment and his joy his very hope of everlasting life—that man i say developed himself unassisted out of a state of primæval brutishness simply by calculations of pleasure and pain by observing what actions would pay in the long run and what would not and so learnt to conquer his selfishness by a more refined and extended selfishness and exchanged his brutality for worldliness and then in a few instances his worldliness for nextworldliness  i hope i need not say that i do not believe this theory  if i did i could not be a christian i think nor a philosopher either  at least if i thought that human civilisation had sprung from such a dunghill as that i should in honour to my race say nothing about it here or elsewhere  why talk of the shame of our ancestors  i want to talk of their honour and glory  i want to talk if i talk at all about great times about noble epochs noble movements noble deeds and noble folk about times in which the human race—it may be through many mistakes alas and sin and sorrow and bloodshed—struggled up one step higher on those great stairs which as we hope lead upward towards the faroff city of god the perfect polity the perfect civilisation the perfect religion which is eternal in the heavens  of great men then and noble deeds i want to speak  i am bound to do so first in courtesy to my hearers  for in choosing such a subject i took for granted a nobleness and greatness of mind in them which can appreciate and enjoy the contemplation of that which is lofty and heroic and that which is useful indeed though not to the purses merely or the mouths of men but to their intellects and spirits that highest philosophy which though she can as has been sneeringly said of her bake no bread can at least do this—and she alone—make men worthy to eat the bread which god has given them  i am bound to speak on such subjects because i have never yet met or read of the human company who did not require now and then at least being reminded of such times and such personages—of whatsoever things are just pure true lovely and of good report if there be any manhood and any praise to think as st paul bids us all of such things that we may keep up in our minds as much as possible a lofty standard a pure ideal instead of sinking to the mere selfish standard which judges all things even those of the world to come by profit and by loss and into that sordid frame of mind in which a man grows to believe that the world is constructed of bricks and timber and kept going by the price of stocks  we are all tempted and the easier and more prosperous we are the more we are tempted to fall into that sordid and shallow frame of mind sordid even when its projects are most daring its outward luxuries most refined and shallow even when most acute when priding itself most on its knowledge of human nature and of the secret springs which so it dreams move the actions and make the history of nations and of men  all are tempted that way even the noblesthearted  adhæsit pavimento venter says the old psalmist  i am growing like the snake crawling in the dust and eating the dust in which i crawl  i try to lift up my eyes to the heavens to the true the beautiful the good the eternal nobleness which was before all time and shall be still when time has past away  but to lift up myself is what i cannot do  who will help me who will quicken me as our old english tongue has it  who will give me life  the true pure lofty human life which i did not inherit from the primæval ape which the apenature in me is for ever trying to stifle and make me that which i know too well i could so easily become—a cunninger and more daintyfeatured brute  death itself which seems at times so fair is fair because even it may raise me up and deliver me from the burden of this animal and mortal body—      ’tis life not death for which i pant     ’tis life whereof my nerves are scant     more life and fuller that i want  man  i am a man not by reason of my bones and muscles nerves and brain which i have in common with apes and dogs and horses  i am a man—thou art a man or woman—not because we have a flesh—god forbid but because there is a spirit in us a divine spark and ray which nature did not give and which nature cannot take away  and therefore while i live on earth i will live to the spirit not to the flesh that i may be indeed a man and this same gross flesh this animal apenature in me shall be the very element in me which i will renounce defy despise at least if i am minded to be not a merely higher savage but a truly higher civilised man  civilisation with me shall mean not more wealth more finery more selfindulgence—even more æsthetic and artistic luxury but more virtue more knowledge more selfcontrol even though i earn scanty bread by heavy toil and when i compare the cæsar of rome or the great king whether of egypt babylon or persia with the hermit of the thebaid starving in his frock of camel’s hair with his soul fixed on the ineffable glories of the unseen and striving however wildly and fantastically to become an angel and not an ape i will say the hermit and not the cæsar is the civilised man  there are plenty of histories of civilisation and theories of civilisation abroad in the world just now and which profess to show you how the primæval savage has or at least may have become the civilised man  for my part with all due and careful consideration i confess i attach very little value to any of them and for this simple reason that we have no facts  the facts are lost  of course if you assume a proposition as certainly true it is easy enough to prove that proposition to be true at least to your own satisfaction  if you assert with the old proverb that you may make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear you will be stupider than i dare suppose anyone here to be if you cannot invent for yourselves all the intermediate stages of the transformation however startling  and indeed if modern philosophers had stuck more closely to this old proverb and its defining verb ‘make’ and tried to show how some person or persons—let them be who they may—men angels or gods—made the sow’s ear into the silk purse and the savage into the sage—they might have pleaded that they were still trying to keep their feet upon the firm ground of actual experience  but while their theory is that the sow’s ear grew into a silk purse of itself and yet unconsciously and without any intention of so bettering itself in life why i think that those who have studied the history which lies behind them and the poor human nature which is struggling and sinning and sorrowing and failing around them and which seems on the greater part of this planet going downwards and not upwards and by no means bettering itself save in the increase of operahouses liquorbars and gamblingtables and that which pertaineth thereto then we i think may be excused if we say with the old stoics—ἐπέχω—i withhold my judgment  i know nothing about the matter yet and you o my imaginative though learned friends know i suspect very little either      eldest of things divine equality  so sang poor shelley and with a certain truth  for if as i believe the human race sprang from a single pair there must have been among their individual descendants an equality far greater than any which has been known on earth during historic times  but that equality was at best the infantile innocence of the primary race which faded away in the race as quickly alas as it does in the individual child divine—therefore it was one of the first blessings which man lost one of the last i fear to which he will return that to which civilisation even at its best yet known has not yet attained save here and there for short periods but towards which it is striving as an ideal goal and as i trust not in vain  the eldest of things which we see actually as history is not equality but an already developed hideous inequality trying to perpetuate itself and yet by a most divine and gracious law destroying itself by the very means which it uses to keep itself alive  ‘there were giants in the earth in those days and nimrod began to be a mighty one in the earth’—      a mighty hunter and his game was man  no it is not equality which we see through the dim mists of bygone ages  what we do see is—i know not whether you will think me superstitious or oldfashioned but so i hold—very much what the earlier books of the bible show us under symbolic laws  greek histories roman histories egyptian histories eastern histories inscriptions national epics legends fragments of legends—in the new world as in the old—all tell the same story  not the story without an end but the story without a beginning  as in the hindoo cosmogony the world stands on an elephant and the elephant on a tortoise and the tortoise on—what  no man knows i do not know  i only assert deliberately waiting as napoleon says till the world come round to me that the tortoise does not stand—as is held by certain anthropologists some honoured by me some personally dear to me—upon the savages who chipped flints and fed on mammoth and reindeer in northwestern europe shortly after the age of ice a few hundred thousand years ago  these sturdy little fellows—the kinsmen probably of the esquimaux and lapps—could have been but the avantcouriers or more probably the fugitives from the true mass of mankind—spreading northward from the tropics into climes becoming after the long catastrophe of the age of ice once more genial enough to support men who knew what decent comfort was and were strong enough to get the same by all means fair or foul  no  the tortoise of the human race does not stand on a savage  the savage may stand on an apelike creature  i do not say that he does not  i do not say that he does  i do not know and no man knows  but at least i say that the civilised man and his world stand not upon creatures like to any savage now known upon the earth  for first it seems to be most unlikely and next and more important to an inductive philosopher there is no proof of it  i see no savages becoming really civilised men—that is—not merely men who will ape the outside of our socalled civilisation even absorb a few of our ideas not merely that but truly civilised men who will think for themselves invent for themselves act for themselves and when the sacred lamp of light and truth has been passed into their hands carry it on unextinguished and transmit it to their successors without running back every moment to get it relighted by those from whom they received it and who are bound—remember that—patiently and lovingly to relight it for them to give freely to all their fellowmen of that which god has given to them and to their ancestors and let god not man be judge of how much the red indian or the polynesian the caffre or the chinese is capable of receiving and of using  moreover in history there is no record absolutely no record as far as i am aware of any savage tribe civilising itself  it is a bold saying i stand by my assertion most happy to find myself confuted even in a single instance for my being wrong would give me what i can have no objection to possess a higher opinion than i have now of the unassisted capabilities of my fellowmen  but civilisation must have begun somewhen somewhere with some person or some family or some nation and how did it begin  i have said already that i do not know  but i have had my dream—like the philosopher—and as i have not been ashamed to tell it elsewhere i shall not be ashamed to tell it here  and it is this—  what if the beginnings of true civilisation in this unique abnormal diseased unsatisfied incomprehensible and truly miraculous and supernatural race we call man had been literally and in actual fact miraculous and supernatural likewise  what if that be the true key to the mystery of humanity and its origin  what if the few first chapters of the most ancient and most sacred book should point under whatever symbols to the actual and the only possible origin of civilisation the education of a man or a family by beings of some higher race than man what if the old puritan doctrine of election should be even of a deeper and wider application than divines have been wont to think  what if individuals if peoples have been chosen out from time to time for a special illumination that they might be the lights of the earth and the salt of the world  what if they have each in their turn abused that divine teaching to make themselves the tyrants instead of the ministers of the less enlightened  to increase the inequalities of nature by their own selfishness instead of decreasing them into the equality of grace by their own selfsacrifice  what if the bible after all was right and even more right than we were taught to think  so runs my dream  if after i have confessed to it you think me still worth listening to in this enlightened 19th century i will go on  at all events what we see at the beginning of all known and halfknown history is not savagery but high civilisation at least of an outward and material kind  do you demur  then recollect i pray you that the three oldest peoples known to history on this planet are egypt china hindostan  the first glimpses of the world are always like those which the book of genesis gives us like those which your own continent gives us  as it was 400 years ago in america so it was in north africa and in asia 4000 years ago or 40000 for aught i know  nay if anyone should ask—and why not 400000 years ago on miocene continents long sunk beneath the tropic sea  i for one have no rejoinder save—we have no proofs as yet  there loom up out of the darkness of legend into the as yet dim dawn of history what the old arabs call races of preadamite sultans—colossal monarchies with fixed and often elaborate laws customs creeds with aristocracies priesthoods—seemingly always of a superior and conquering race with a mass of common folk whether free or halffree composed of older conquered races of imported slaves too and their descendants  but whence comes the royal race the aristocracy the priesthood  you enquire and you find that they usually know not themselves  they are usually—i had almost dared to say always—foreigners  they have crossed the neighbouring mountains  they have come by sea like dido to carthage like manco cassae and mama bello to america and they have sometimes forgotten when  at least they are wiser stronger fairer than the aborigines  they are to them—as jacques cartier was to the indians of canada—as gods  they are not sure that they are not descended from gods  they are the children of the sun or what not  the children of light who ray out such light as they have upon the darkness of their subjects  they are at first probably civilisers not conquerors  for if tradition is worth anything—and we have nothing else to go upon—they are at first few in number  they come as settlers or even as single sages  it is in all tradition not the many who influence the few but the few who influence the many  so aristocracies in the true sense are formed  but the higher calling is soon forgotten  the purer light is soon darkened in pride and selfishness luxury and lust as in genesis the sons of god see the daughters of men that they are fair and they take them wives of all that they choose  and so a mixed race springs up and increases without detriment at first to the commonwealth  for by a wellknown law of heredity the cross between two races probably far apart produces at first a progeny possessing the forces and alas probably the vices of both  and when the sons of god go in to the daughters of men there are giants in the earth in those days men of renown  the roman empire remember was never stronger than when the old patrician blood had mingled itself with that of every nation round the mediterranean  but it does not last  selfishness luxury ferocity spread from above as well as from below  the just aristocracy of virtue and wisdom becomes an unjust one of mere power and privilege that again one of mere wealth corrupting and corrupt and is destroyed not by the people from below but by the monarch from above  the hereditary bondsmen may know      who would be free     himself must strike the blow  but they dare not know not how  the king must do it for them  he must become the state  ‘better one tyrant’ as voltaire said ‘than many’ better stand in fear of one lion far away than of many wolves each in the nearest wood  and so arise those truly monstrous eastern despotisms of which modern persia is thank god the only remaining specimen for turkey and egypt are too amenable of late years to the influence of the free nations to be counted as despotisms pure and simple—despotisms in which men instead of worshipping a godman worship the hideous counterfeit a mangod—a poor human being endowed by public opinion with the powers of deity while he is the slave of all the weaknesses of humanity  but such as an historic fact has been the last stage of every civilisation—even that of rome which ripened itself upon this earth the last in ancient times and i had almost said until this very day except among the men who speak teutonic tongues and who have preserved through all temptations and reasserted through all dangers the free ideas which have been our sacred heritage ever since tacitus beheld us with respect and awe among our german forests and saw in us the future masters of the roman empire  yes it is very sad the past history of mankind  but shall we despise those who went before us and on whose accumulated labours we now stand  shall we not reverence our spiritual ancestors  shall we not show our reverence by copying them at least whenever as in those old persians we see in them manliness and truthfulness hatred of idolatries and devotion to the god of light and life and good  and shall we not feel pity instead of contempt for their ruder forms of government their ignorances excesses failures—so excusable in men who with little or no previous teaching were trying to solve for themselves for the first time the deepest social and political problems of humanity  yes those old despotisms we trust are dead and never to revive  but their corpses are the corpses not of our enemies but of our friends and predecessors slain in the worldold fight of ormuzd against ahriman—light against darkness order against disorder  confusedly they fought and sometimes ill but their corpses piled the breach and filled the trench for us and over their corpses we step on to what should be to us an easy victory—what may be to us yet a shameful ruin  for if we be as we are wont to boast the salt of the earth and the light of the world what if the salt should lose its savour  what if the light which is in us should become darkness  for myself when i look upon the responsibilities of the free nations of modern times so far from boasting of that liberty in which i delight—and to keep which i freely too could die—i rather say in fear and trembling god help us on whom he has laid so heavy a burden as to make us free responsible each individual of us not only to ourselves but to him and all mankind for if we fall we shall fall i know not whither and i dare not think  how those old despotisms the mighty empires of old time fell we know and we can easily explain  corrupt luxurious effeminate eaten out by universal selfishness and mutual fear they had at last no organic coherence  the moral anarchy within showed through at last burst through the painted skin of prescriptive order which held them together some braver and abler and usually more virtuous people often some little hardy homely mountain tribe saw that the fruit was ripe for gathering and caring nought for superior numbers—and saying with german alaric when the romans boasted of their numbers ‘the thicker the hay the easier it is mowed—struck one brave blow at the huge inflated windbag—as cyrus and his handful of persians struck at the medes as alexander and his handful of greeks struck afterwards at the persians—and behold it collapsed upon the spot  and then the victors took the place of the conquered and became in their turn an aristocracy and then a despotism and in their turn rotted down and perished  and so the vicious circle repeated itself age after age from egypt and assyria to mexico and peru  and therefore we free peoples as we are have need to watch and sternly watch ourselves  equality of some kind or other is as i said our natural and seemingly inevitable goal  but which equality  for there are two—a true one and a false a noble and a base a healthful and a ruinous  there is the truly divine equality and there is the brute equality of sheep and oxen and of flies and worms  there is the equality which is founded on mutual envy  the equality which respects others and the equality which asserts itself  the equality which longs to raise all alike and the equality which desires to pull down all alike  the equality which says—thou art as good as i and it may be better too in the sight of god  and the equality which says—i am as good as thou and will therefore see if i cannot master thee  side by side in the heart of every free man and every free people are the two instincts struggling for the mastery called by the same name but bearing the same relation to each other as marsyas to apollo the satyr to the god  marsyas and apollo the base and the noble are as in the old greek legend contending for the prize  and the prize is no less an one than all free people of this planet  in proportion as that nobler idea conquers and men unite in the equality of mutual respect and mutual service they move one step further towards realising on earth that kingdom of god of which it is written—‘the despots of the nations exercise dominion over them and they that exercise authority over them are called benefactors  but he that will be great among you let him be the servant of all’  and in proportion as that base idea conquers and selfishness not selfsacrifice is the ruling spirit of a state men move on one step forward towards realising that kingdom of the devil upon earth ‘every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost’  only alas in that evil equality of envy and hate there is no hindmost and the devil takes them all alike  and so is a period of discontent revolution internecine anarchy followed by a tyranny endured as in old rome by men once free because tyranny will at least do for them what they were too lazy and greedy and envious to do for themselves      and all because they have forgot     what ’tis to be a man—to curb and spurn     the tyrant in us the ignobler self     which boasts not loathes its likeness to the brute     and owns no good save ease no ill save pain     no purpose save its share in that wild war     in which through countless ages living things     compete in internecine greed  ah loving god     are we as creeping things which have no lord     that we are brutes great god we know too well     apes daintierfeatured silly birds who flaunt     their plumes unheeding of the fowler’s step     spiders who catch with paper not with webs     tigers who slay with cannon and sharp steel     instead of teeth and claws—all these we are     are we no more than these save in degree     mere fools of nature puppets of strong lusts     taking the sword to perish by the sword     upon the universal battlefield     even as the things upon the moor outside         the heath eats up green grass and delicate herbs     the pines eat up the heath the grub the pine     the finch the grub the hawk the silly finch     and man the mightiest of all beasts of prey     eats what he lists  the strong eat up the weak     the many eat the few great nations small     and he who cometh in the name of all     shall greediest triumph by the greed of all     and armed by his own victims eat up all     while ever out of the eternal heavens     looks patient down the great magnanimous god     who master of all worlds did sacrifice     all to himself  nay but himself to all     who taught mankind on that first christmas day     what ’tis to be a man—to give not take     to serve not rule to nourish not devour     to lift not crush if need to die not live  ‘he that cometh in the name of all’—the popular military despot—the ‘saviour of his country’—he is our internecine enemy on both sides of the atlantic whenever he arises—the inaugurator of that imperialism that cæsarism into which rome sank when not her liberties merely but her virtues were decaying out of her—the sink into which all wicked states whether republics or monarchies are sure to fall simply because men must eat and drink for tomorrow they die  the military and bureaucratic despotism which keeps the many quiet as in old rome by panem et circenses—bread and games—or if need be pilgrimages that the few may make money eat drink and be merry as long as it can last  that let it ape as it may—as did the cæsars of old rome at first—as another emperor did even in our own days—the forms of dead freedom really upholds an artificial luxury by brute force and consecrates the basest of all aristocracies the aristocracy of the money bag by the divine sanction of the bayonet  that at all risks even at the price of precious blood the free peoples of the earth must ward off from them for makeshift and stopgap as it is it does not even succeed in what it tries to do  it does not last have we not seen that it does not cannot last  how can it last  this falsehood like all falsehoods must collapse at one touch of ithuriel’s spear of truth and fact  and—  ‘then saw i the end of these men  namely how thou dost set them in slippery places and casteth them down  ‘suddenly do they perish and come to a fearful end  yea like as a dream when one awaketh so shalt thou make their image to vanish out of the city’  have we not seen that too though thank god neither in england nor in the united states  and then  what then  none knows and none can know  the future of france and spain the future of the tropical republics of spanish america is utterly blank and dark not to be prophesied i hold by mortal man simply because we have no like cases in the history of the past whereby to judge the tendencies of the present  will they revive under the genial influences of free institutions will the good seed which is in them take root downwards and bear fruit upwards and make them all what that fair france has been in spite of all her faults so often in past years—a joy and an inspiration to all the nations round  shall it be thus  god grant it may but he and he alone can tell  we only stand by watching if we be wise with pity and with fear the working out of a tremendous new social problem which must affect the future of the whole civilised world  for if the agonising old nations fail to regenerate themselves what can befall  what when even imperialism has been tried and failed as fail it must  what but that lower depth within the lowest deep               that last dread mood     of sated lust and dull decrepitude     no law no art no faith no hope no god     when round the freezing founts of life in peevish ring     crouched on the bareworn sod     babbling about the unreturning spring     and whining for dead creeds which cannot save     the toothless nations shiver to their grave  and we who think we stand let us take heed lest we fall  let us accept in modesty and in awe the responsibility of our freedom and remember that that freedom can be preserved only in one oldfashioned way  let us remember that the one condition of a true democracy is the same as the one condition of a true aristocracy namely virtue  let us teach our children as grand old lilly taught our forefathers 300 years ago—‘it is virtue gentlemen yea virtue that maketh gentlemen that maketh the poor rich the subject a king the lowborn noble the deformed beautiful  these things neither the whirling wheel of fortune can overturn nor the deceitful cavillings of worldlings separate neither sickness abate nor age abolish’  yes  let us teach our children thus on both sides of the atlantic  for if they—which god forbid—should grow corrupt and weak by their own sins there is no hardier race now left on earth to conquer our descendants and bring them back to reason as those old jews were brought by bitter shame and woe  and all that is before them and the whole civilised world would be long centuries of anarchy such as the world has not seen for ages—a true ragnarok a twilight of the very gods an age such as the wise woman foretold in the old voluspà      when brethren shall be     each other’s bane     and sisters’ sons rend     the ties of kin     hard will be that age     an age of bad women     an axeage a swordage     shields oft cleft in twain     a stormage a wolfage     ere earth meet its doom  so sang 2000 years ago perhaps the great unnamed prophetess of our own race of what might be if we should fail mankind and our own calling and election  god grant that day may never come  but god grant also that if that day does come then may come true also what that wise vala sang of the day when gods and men and earth should be burnt up with fire      when slaked surtur’s flame is     still the man and the maiden     hight valour and life     shall keep themselves hid     in the wood of remembrance     the dew of the dawning     for food it shall serve them     from them spring new peoples  new peoples  for after all is said the ideal form of human society is democracy  a nation—and were it even possible a whole world—of free men lifting free foreheads to god and nature calling no man master—for one is their master even god knowing and obeying their duties towards the maker of the universe and therefore to each other and that not from fear nor calculation of profit or loss but because they loved and liked it and had seen the beauty of righteousness and trust and peace because the law of god was in their hearts and needing at last it may be neither king nor priest for each man and each woman in their place were kings and priests to god  such a nation—such a society  what nobler conception of mortal existence can we form  would not that be indeed the kingdom of god come on earth  and tell me not that that is impossible—too fair a dream to be ever realised  all that makes it impossible is the selfishness passions weaknesses of those who would be blest were they masters of themselves and therefore of circumstances who are miserable because not being masters of themselves they try to master circumstance to pull down iron walls with weak and clumsy hands and forget that he who would be free from tyrants must first be free from his worst tyrant self  but tell me not that the dream is impossible  it is so beautiful that it must be true  if not now nor centuries hence yet still hereafter  god would never as i hold have inspired man with that rich imagination had he not meant to translate some day that imagination into fact  the very greatness of the idea beyond what a single mind or generation can grasp will ensure failure on failure—follies fanaticisms disappointments even crimes bloodshed hasty furies as of children baulked of their holiday  but it will be at last fulfilled filled full and perfected not perhaps here or among our peoples or any people which now exist on earth but in some future civilisation—it may be in far lands beyond the sea—when all that you and we have made and done shall be as the forestgrown mounds of the old nameless civilisers of the mississippi valley
