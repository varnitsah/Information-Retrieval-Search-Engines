coniferous forest which rolls about the rocky hills and shrouds the lonely valleys of british columbia a bitter frost had dried the snow to powder and bound the frothing rivers it had laid its icy grip upon the waters suddenly and the sound of their turmoil died away in the depths of the rockwalled cañons until the rugged land lay wrapped in silence under a sky of intense pitiless blueness that seemed frozen too man and beast shrink from the sudden cold snaps as they call them in that country and the rancher who has sheep to lose sits shivering in his log house through the long forenights with a marlin rifle handy while the famished timber wolves prowl about his clearing still it is the loggers toiling in the wilderness who feel the cold snaps most for the man who labours under an arctic frost must be generously fed or the heat and strength die out of him and now and then it happens that provisions become scanty when no canoe can be poled up the rivers and the trails are blocked with snow  there were four loggers at work in a redwood forest one january afternoon rolling a great log with peevies and handspikes out of a chaos of fallen trunks the bush a wall of sombre green spangled here and there with frost and impressively still closed in about the little gap they had made not a sound came out of the shadowy avenues between the tremendous colonnades of towering trunks and the topmost sprays of the cedars and douglas firs cut motionless against the blue high above there was no wind and the mens breath went straight up a thin white vapour into the biting air still they were warm and comparatively well fed which was a good deal to be thankful for and three of them toiled contentedly with now and then a glance at their companion who realized at length that he was beaten in fact it was only by calling up all the resolution that was in him that this fourth man derrick nasmyth had held himself to his task since early morning for there is no occupation which demands from man more muscular effort and physical courage than logging as it is generally carried on in the forest of western canada  nasmyth was a tall man apparently under thirty and leanly muscular as were his companions for those who swing the axe from dawn to dusk in that wilderness seldom put on flesh his bronzed face was also lean and a trifle worn considering his occupation it was perhaps too finely chiselled and there was a certain elusive suggestion of refinement in it he had clear blue eyes and the hair beneath his battered fur cap was brown for the rest he wore a black leather jacket with several rents in it ragged duck trousers and long boots his companions were the usual bush chopperssimple strongarmed men of kindly natureand nasmyth was quite aware that they had undertaken most of his share in the work during the last few hours  another heave said one of the woodsmen hit her hard boys and away she goes  they strained sinewy backs and splendid arms the great log rolled a trifle farther canted as one of them slipped a handspike under the butt of it and landed on the skids which were laid like railway sleepers down the slope of a steep declivity the snow was ground down and rammed back about the skids and the wornout hollow gleamed a faint bluegrey in the shadow of the firs the men made another strenuous effort as the log started but in another moment it rushed away and like a toboggan sped downwards through the forest to the riverice below the skids screamed beneath it the snow flew up like smoke and then there was a thunderous crash and stillness again nasmyth gasped heavily and dropped his handspike  boys he said im used up ill go along to the shanty and get my time  he generally expressed himself much as his comrades did but now his clean english intonation was a little more noticeable than usual one of the others nodded sympathetically as he answered  well i guess ive seen the trouble trailing you for quite a while got to let up or play out its one ive been up against myself he made a vague gesture a little rough on you  then he and one of his comrades took up a big crosscut saw while the other swung a gleaming axe nasmyth walked back wearily through the silent bush towards the camp his back ached his head ached and he felt a trifle dazed the strength seemed to have gone out of him and he fancied that he was not very far from a physical collapse he was glad when he reached the shanty where after he had shaken the snow from his dilapidated boots he sat down by the glowing stove and smiled wryly as he looked about him the shed was rudely built of logs and a row of bunks packed with swampgrass and sprucetwigs from some of which there hung portions of greasy blankets ran down one side of it it smelt horribly of acrid tobacco and cookery but at least it was warm which counted for much and during the last few months nasmyth had grown to look on it as home he knew also that it would cost him something to leave it now especially as he had nowhere else to go  lying back listlessly in a lounge an ingenious chopper had made out of a few branches and a couple of sacks nasmyth vaguely recalled the comfort of his london chambers and the great pillared smokingroom of a certain exclusive club for he was a man acquainted with the smoother side of life he had various gifts which were apparently of no account in british columbia and he had enjoyed an education that had it seemed unfitted him for anything strictly utilitarian there are a great many men of his description chopping trees and driving cattle in western canada indeed his story was one which with slight variations may be heard frequently in that country financial disaster had overtaken his family friends in high places had regarded him coldly and he had been too proud to ask for favours or to profit by those that were grudgingly offered him that was why he had gone out to canada and spent several years there earning his board and now and then a few dollars as well by bodily labour until he went up into the bush with the loggers  for a time he had somehow contrived to hold his own with the other workers though logging in heavy timber is one of the tasks one could almost fancy that man was never meant for and the logger whose overtaxed muscle fails him for a moment is very likely to have the life crushed out of him by some ponderous slipping trunk perhaps his lack of endurance was due to the excessive strain or the illcooked food but during the last few weeks he had been conscious that a slackness was creeping over him once or twice the handspike or peevie had been torn from his grasp and the lives of his comrades had been placed in peril he had found it more and more difficult to drag himself out to his work each morning but he had held on until that afternoon when his strength had suddenly failed him  nasmyth was halfasleep when the cook and the leader of the gang came in the latter who was a big gaunt man with grizzled hair stopped close by the stove and looked at him  well said the gang leader what do you figure youre doing here  nasmyth explained with some difficulty for in the bush men acquire a certain pride in their physical manhood and it is never a pleasant thing to own oneself defeated the logger however nodded comprehendingly he was a reticent grimfaced person from ontario where they breed hard men though some have also kindly hearts in them  thats quite right ive noticed it myself he commented in fact ive been figuring on asking you to get out the last week or two  nasmyth smiled like other men of his description in that country he had become accustomed to hearing such remarks addressed to him  i wonder he answered reflectively why you didnt  the logger appeared to consider it was characteristic of him and the stock he sprang from that he would never have admitted that he had borne with nasmyth as long as possible out of kindness the thing would have hurt him  well he said it seemed to me we might start you teaming if i could have got a span or two of oxen in but im most afraid i cant get them at my figure he changed the subject abruptly where are you heading for  i dont quite know though i shall probably land in victoria sooner or later i might strike something a little easier than logging there still it would be most of a weeks march before i could reach the railroad and theres not a ranch anywhere near the trail  the logger nodded well he said id head west instead therell be nothing going on along the railroad just now and the mines are running easy while you ought to fetch the settlement south of butte lake on the third day guess you might pick up a dollar or two in that neighbourhood and any way theres a steamer running down the west coast to victoria seems to me quite likely one of those bushranchers would take you in a while even if he didnt exactly want a hired man but they dont do that kind of thing in the city  nasmyth smiled experience had already taught him that as a rule the stranger who is welcomed in the cities arrives there with money in his pockets and that it is the hardhanded men with the axes from whom the wanderer in that country is most likely to receive a kindness still though he was naturally not aware of it a great deal was to depend upon the fact that he followed the advice of the logger who traced out a diagram on the bench upon which they sat  theres an indian trail up the river for the first four leagues said the logger then you strike southwest across the dividehereand you come to the butte river shes running in a little cañon and you cant get over cept where a prospector or somebody has chopped a big fir  the log span across a stream is an old device and was probably primitive mans first attempt at bridgebuilding though it is one frequently adopted on the pacific slope where a giant tree grows conveniently close to an otherwise impassable river it was however important that nasmyth should be able to find the tree  you know exactly where that fir is he asked  southwest of the highest ridge of the divide once youre over youll fetch the butte lake in a long days march when dyou figure youll start  tonight said nasmyth after supper if theres sickness of any kind hanging round meand i feel like ityou dont want me here and i dare say theyd take me into the hospital at victoria walkings easier than logging anyway and it seems wiser to try for that fir in daylight  the logger nodded as if he concurred in this and taking a little book from his pocket he turned it over wrinkling his brows while nasmyth watched him with a smile  well he said at length well count you full time today but theres the four days off when you got crushed by that redwood and the week when you chopped your leg then counting the amount for your board thats thirtysix dollars im due to you  not quite answered nasmyth there was the day or two after i fell through the ice and had the shivers id sooner you knocked off the few dollars  the logger was said to be a hard man and in some respects this was certainly the case but a faint flush crept into his grim face perhaps he had noticed the weariness in nasmyths voice or the hollowness of his cheeks  all right he said awkwardly jake will put you up grub for four days and well call it square  he counted out the money which nasmyth slipped into the receptacle inside his belt when the logger moved away the weary man crossed over to his bunk nasmyth had brought his few possessions up in a canoe and now knowing that he could not take them all away he turned them over with a curious smile there were one or two ragged pairs of duck trousers stained with soil a few old tattered shirts and a jacket of much the same description he remembered that he had once been fastidious about his tailoring as he wondered when he would be able to replace the things that he left behind then he rolled up some of the garments and his two blankets into a pack that could be strapped upon his shoulders and as he did this his comrades came trooping in stamping to shake the snow off their leggings  there were about a dozen of themsimple strenuous brownfaced bushranchers for the most partand they ate in haste voraciously when the abundant but rudely served supper was laid out nasmyth had not much appetite and the greasy salt pork grindstone bread desiccated apples flavoured molasses and flapjacks hot from the pan did not tempt him he preferred to watch his companions and now and then his glance was a trifle wistful he had worked and eaten with them they had slept about him and he knew he had their rude goodwill when his strength had begun to give way some of them had saddled themselves with more than their share of the tasks they were engaged in and he knew that it was possible he might not fall in with comrades of their kind again now that the time had come he who had once been welcomed at brilliant london functions felt that it would cost him an effort to part with these rough comrades perhaps this was not so astonishing for after all strenuous valiant manhood and rude kindliness count for much  the shanty was cheerfully lighted and cosily warm nasmyth had slept soundly there on the springy sprucetwigs and there was at least abundance when the mealtimes came round now he was about to be cast adrift again to face a three days march in the open under the bitter frost and what might await him at the end of it he did not know at length the meal was cleared away and when the pipes were lighted he told his comrades that he was going they were not demonstrative in their expressions of regret but they thrust upon him little plugs of tobacco which could not well be replaced there and several of them told him that if he struck nothing he liked better all he had to do was to present himself at this ranch or the other beside blue lake or frothing river when they went back in the spring what was more to the purpose they meant it  among those western pines men are reared who in point of primitive vigour slow endurance and the dogged courage that leads them to attempt and usually to accomplish the apparently impossible are a match for any in the world and no wanderer who limps up to their lonely ranches is turned away those who have no claim on them are honoured with their hospitality and now and then one new to that country looks with wonder on their handiwork down all the long pacific coast from lonely wrangel wrapped in the northern snow to shasta in the south it is written on hewnback forest rent hillside and dammed river the inhabitants are subduing savage nature but as time will surely show their greatest achievement is the rearing of fearless men  though it cost him an effort nasmyth contrived to smile as he shook hands with the loggers then he set his lips tight as with his pack strapped on his shoulders he opened the door and looked out at the dimly shining snow it was only natural that he hesitated for a moment after all brutal as the toil had been he at least knew what he was leaving behind and his heart sank as he drew the door to the cold struck through him to the bone though there was not a breath of air astir and the stillness was almost overwhelming the frost cramped his muscles and drove the courage out of him and as he plodded down the trail he heard jacques the frenchcanadian cook tuning his battered fiddle a little burst of laughter broke through the twanging of the strings and nasmyth closed one hand hard as he strode on faster into the darkness there was as much of the animal in him as there is in most of us and he longed for the cheerful light and the warmth of the stove while one learns the value of human companionship when the frost king lays his grip on that lonely land he was once more homelessan outcastand it was almost a relief to him when at length the twanging of the fiddle was lost in the silence of the pines  the trees rose about him towering high into the soft darkness in serried ranks and the snow gleamed a cold bluegrey under them not a twig stirred the tall spires were black and motionless and solemn and he felt that their stateliness emphasized his own feebleness and inconsequence in the meanwhile though the snow was loose and frostdried it was not much above his ankles and the trail was comparatively good it seemed to him advisable to push on as fast as possible for he had only four days provisions and he was not sure of his strength there was no doubt as to what the result would be if it failed him in the wilderness that lay between him and the settlement     chapter ii  the trail   a halfmoon rose above the black tops of the pines and a faint light which the snow flung back filtered down between the motionless branches upon the narrow trail that wound sinuously in and out among fallen trunks and thickets draped with withered fern for the siwash indians passed that way when the salmon came up the rivers and the path an indian makes is never straight over and over again an indian will go around an obstacle through which the bushrancher would hew a passage this is essentially characteristic of both for the primitive peoples patiently fit their lives to their environment while the white man grapples with unfavourable conditions and resolutely endeavours to alter them  until daylight nasmyth made a tolerable pace he had been troubled with a curious lassitude and an unpleasant dizziness but walking is considerably easier than rolling ponderous logs and he knew that it was advisable for him to push on as fast as possible at length the dawn broke high up in a dingy grey sky and he stopped to build a fire it did not take long to boil a can of strong green tea and to prepare a piece of doughy bread with a little salt pork for his breakfast then he wrapped one of his blankets around him and took out his pipe he did not remember how long he sat there but it was clear daylight when he noticed that the fire was burning out and somewhat to his annoyance he felt curiously reluctant to get up again  though it cost him an effort he rose and stood a minute or two shivering in the bitter wind which now set the dark firs sighing he could see the trees roll upwards before him in sombre ranks until their topmost sprays cut in a thin filigree very high up against the sky and he knew that he must now leave the easy trail and cross the big divide when he set out he was a little annoyed to find that the packstraps hurt his shoulders and that one of his boots galled his foot kneeboots are not adapted for walking long distances but the only other ones that nasmyth possessed were so dilapidated that he had left them behind  he went up for several hours through withered fern and matted undergrowth and over horrible tangles of fallen treetrunks some of which were raised high above the snow on giant splintered branches the term virgin forest probably conveys very little to the average englishman since the woods with which he is acquainted are for the most part cleaned and dressed by foresters but nature rules untrammelled in the pinebush of the pacific slope and her waste material lies piled in tremendous ruin until it rots away there are forests in that country through which a man accustomed to them can scarcely make a league in a day still nasmyth crossed the divide struggling against a bitter wind and then went down the other side floundering over fallen branches and smashing through thickets of undergrowth and brakes of willows he wanted to find the river and more especially the tree that bridged it as soon as possible it was however noon when he reached the river and it frothed and roared a hundred feet below him in a smooth walled cañon which had apparently kept the frost out for there were only strips of crackling ice in the eddies  it was clearly out of the question for him to get down to the river even if he had wished to make the descent and without stopping to make another fire he plodded along the bank until the afternoon was almost spent there were a good many fallen trees as he discovered to his cost since each one had to be painfully clambered over but none of them spanned the chasm then as his foot was becoming very sore he decided to camp where a big cedar lay across a little ravine that rent the bank it promised to afford him a partial shelter he had no axe but he tore off an armful or two of the thinner branches with the twigs attached to them to form a bed and then crawling down to the river filled his smokeblackened can and came back wearily to make a fire man needs very little in those solitudes but there are two things he must have and those are food to keep the strength in him and warmth though there are times when he finds it singularly difficult to make the effort to obtain them the most unpleasant hour of the long day of persistent toil is often the one when wornout muscle and jaded intelligence must be forced to the task of providing the evening meal and shelter for the night  nasmyth ate his supper so far as it went voraciously but with a prudent check upon his appetite for he had set out with only four days provisions and he could not find the tree when he had eaten he took out his pipe and crouched a while beside the fire shivering in spite of the blankets wrapped about him the heat dies out of the man who has marched for twenty hours as those who have done it know in the meanwhile darkness crept up from the east and the pines faded into sombre masses that loomed dimly against a leaden sky a mournful wailing came out of the gloom and the smoke whirled about the shivering man in the nipping wind while the sound of the rivers turmoil and the crash of streamdriven ice drifted up out of the cañon nasmyth listened drowsily while his thoughts wandered back to the loggers shanty he could see the men with bronzed faces sitting smoking about the snapping stove two or three of them dancing while jacques coaxed music full of fire from his battered fiddle  then his thoughts went farther back to the chambers that he had once occupied in london and he saw himself and frobisher who shared them with him sitting at a little table daintily furnished with choice glass and silver covers there were big candles upon itfrobisher who was a fastidious man had insisted upon them after that the artistically furnished room faded out of his memory and he recalled a larger one in which he had now and then dined he could picture the wine and lights and costly dresses the smiling faces of those who had at that time expected a great deal from him and he saw the girl who usually sat at his side she had a delicate beauty and a dainty mind and he had sometimes fancied they might be drawn closer when he had made his mark which in those days appeared a very probable thing he wondered vaguely what she was doing then or if she ever thought of him after all as she had not answered the one letter which he wrote it scarcely seemed likely that she remembered him those who fail he reflected are soon forgotten  then as he was falling forward into the fire he roused himself and smiled wryly he was once more an outcast shivering halfasleep in the wilderness worn out ragged and aching with a foot that was now distinctly painful it is however fortunate for such men as he and others among the heavily burdened that the exhaustion of the body has its deadening effect upon the mind rolling the blankets round him he lay down on the cedar branches and went to sleep  he did not hear the timber wolves howling in the blackness of the night though several that got wind of him flitted across the ravine after the fire burned low and when at length he awakened it was with the fall of a wet flake upon his face and he saw the dim dawn breaking through a haze of sliding snow it seemed a little warmer and as a matter of fact it was so for the cold snaps seldom last very long near the coast but the raw damp struck through him as he raked the embers of the fire together again he felt singularly reluctant to start when he had finished breakfast and he found that he could hardly place one foot upon the ground but haste was imperative now so he set off limping with the packstraps galling his shoulders cruelly he also felt a little dizzy but he pushed on all that day beside the river through a haze of snow without coming upon the tree the dusk was creeping up across the forest when at length the river emerged from the cañon and he ventured out upon the ice in a slacker pool the ice heaved and crackled under him with the pulsations of the stream but he got across and roused himself with difficulty for the effort to make another fire he was an hour gathering fuel and then after a sparing supper he lay down in his wet clothing  the snow that eddied about him whitened his spongy blankets but he got a little sleep and awakening found the fire out he tried to light it and failed his fingers seemed useless he was cramped and chilled all through and there was in one hipjoint the gnawing pain that those who sleep on wet ground are acquainted with sometimes it goes away when one gets warmed up but just as often it does not nasmyth who found it a difficult matter to straighten himself ate a little damp bread and then strapping his pack upon his shoulders stumbled on into the forest he afterwards fancied it did not snow very much that day but he was not sure of anything except that he fell over many rotten branches and entangled himself frequently in labyrinths of matted willows night came and he went to sleep without a fire he contrived to push on next day walking during most of it half asleep indeed now and then he would stagger along for minutes after consciousness of what he was doing had deserted him for there are men in that bush at least who know what it is to stop with suddenly opened eyes on the verge of a collapse and find that they have wandered from the pathonly in nasmyths case there was no path at all  he was never sure whether it was that day or the next when floundering through an undergrowth of willows he came upon a break in the forest that was covered with sawnoff stumps as he made for it he fell into a splitrail fence some of which he knocked down until he could climb over it there was a faint smell of burning firwood in the air and it was evident to him that there was a house somewhere in the vicinity the snow was not deep in the clearing and he plodded through it staggering now and then until he came to a little slope and fell down it headlong this time he did not seem able to get up again and it was fortunate that when he flung the split fence down the crash made by the falling rails rang far through the silence of the woods  while nasmyth lay in the slushy snow a girl came out from among the firs across the clearing and walked down the little trail that led to a well she was tall and there was something in her face and the way she held herself which suggested that she was not a native of the bush though everything she wore had been made by her own fingersthat is except the little fur cap whose glossy brown enhanced the lustre of her hair this was of a slightly lighter tint and had gleams of ruddy gold in it her eyes were large and brown and there was a reposeful quietness in the face which suggested strength it was significant that her hands were a trifle hard as well as shapely and that her wrists were red  she came to the top of the slope near the foot of which nasmyth who had now raised himself on one elbow lay and though this might well have startled her she stood quietly still looking down on him nasmyth raised himself a trifle further and blinked at her stupidly and she noticed that his face was drawn and grey  i heard the rails fall she said what are you doing there  it did not appear strange to nasmyth that she should speak in wellmodulated english for there are probably as many insular english as canadians in parts of that country besides he was scarcely in a condition to notice a point of that kind just then  i think i upset the fence he answered you see i couldnt get over then i must have fallen down  it naturally struck the girl as significant that he did not seem sure of what had happened but the explanation that would have suggested itself to anyone fresh from england did not occur to her there was not a saloon or hotel within eight or nine miles of the spot  can you get up she asked  ill try said nasmyth but the attempt he made was not a complete success for although he staggered to his feet he reeled when he stood upon them and probably would have fallen had she not run down the slope and taken hold of him  you can rest on me she said laying a firm and capable hand upon his shoulder  with her assistance nasmyth staggered up the slope and there were afterwards times when he remembered the next few minutes with somewhat mixed feelings just then however he was only glad to have someone to lean upon and her mere human presence was a relief since nature had come very near to crushing the life out of him  this is your ranch he inquired looking at her with halfclosed eyes when at length she moved away from him a pace or two and gasping a little stood still beneath a colonnade of towering firs  it is she said simply and a moment or two later he saw a little house of logs half hidden among the trees  they reached it in another minute and staggering in he sank into the nearest chair a stove snapped and crackled in the middle of the little logwalled room which in spite of its uncovered splitboarded floor seemed to possess a daintiness very unusual in the bush he did not however know what particular objects in it conveyed that impression for the whole room seemed to be swinging up and down but he was definitely conscious of a comforting smell of coffee and pork which came from the stove he sat still shivering and blinking at the girl while the water trickled from his tattered clothing he fancied from the patter on the shingle roof that it was raining outside  i wonder if you would let me camp in the barn tonight he said  the girls eyes had grown compassionate as she watched him for there was a suggestive greyness in his face it was evident to her that he was utterly wornout  go in there she said pointing to a door you will find some dry clothes put them on  nasmyth staggered into a very small room which had a rude wooden bunk in it and with considerable difficulty sloughed off his wet things and put on somebody elses clothing then he came back and sank into a deerhide lounge at the table the girl set a cup of coffee as well as some pork and potatoes before him he drank the coffee but finding somewhat to his astonishment that he could scarcely eat he lay back in his chair and looked at the girl deprecatingly with halfclosed eyes  sorry i cant do the supper justice i think im ill he said  then his head fell back against the deerhide lounge and while the girl watched him with a natural consternation he sank into sleep or unconsciousness she was not sure which it was but he certainly looked very ill and being a capable young woman she remembered that within the next hour the weekly mailcarrier would strike a trail which passed within a mile of the ranch rising she touched nasmyths shoulder  stay there and dont try to get up until i come back she commanded in a kindly tone  nasmyth as she had halfexpected said nothing and slipping into another roomthere were three in the houseshe returned wearing a jacket of coarse fur and went quietly out into the rain it was dark now but she had as it happened not long to wait for the mailcarrier  i want you to call at gordons ranch dave she told the man tell him he is to come along as soon as he can theres a stranger here who seems very ill  the mailcarrier would have asked questions but she cut him short  how long will it be before you can tell gordon she asked  well answered the man reflectively im heading right back for the settlement but its a league to gordons anyway he could be here in two hours if he starts right off and considering what the trails like thats blamed fast travelling  he disappeared into the darkness and the girl went back to the ranch it was perhaps significant that she should feel sure that the man she had sent for would obey the summons but she grew anxious while the two hours slipped by at last a man opened the door and walked in with the water dripping from the long outer garment he flung off he was a young man with a bronzed face and keen grey eyes and he had swung the axe as one could see by his lithe carriage and the hardness of his hands but there was something professional in his manner as he stooped down regarding nasmyth closely while he gripped the strangers wrist then he turned to the girl  hes very sick gordon said guess you have no objections to my putting him in your fathers bunk first well warm the blankets  the girl rose to help him andfor she was strongthey stripped off most of nasmyths garments and lifted him into the bunk in the next room then gordon sent her for the blankets and when he had wrapped them round nasmyth he sat down and looked at her  pneumonia he said anyway in the meanwhile ill figure on it as that though theres what one might call a general physical collapse as well where did he come from  i dont know said the girl  your father wont be back for a week  its scarcely likely  the man appeared to reflect for a moment or two then he made a little expressive gesture  well he said its up to us to do what we can first things a poultice ill show you how to fix it but while were here i guess we might as well run through his things  is that needful and the girl glanced at nasmyth compassionately  well said the man with an air of reflection it might be this things quick leaves you or wipes you out right away theres very little strength in him  he turned out the pockets of nasmyths clothes which were however empty of anything that might disclose his identity  not a scrap of paper not a dollar but i guess that wasnt always the case with himyou can see it by his face he said then he laughed hes probably like a good many more of usnot very anxious to let folks know where he came from  the girl though he did not notice it winced at this but next moment he touched her shoulder  get some water on he said after weve made the poultice ill take charge of him we may get mrs custer round in the morning  the girl merely smiled and went out with him she was aware that it was in some respects an unusual thing which she was doing but that did not greatly trouble her they are not very conventional people in that country     chapter iii  waynefleets ranch   though he afterwards endeavoured to recall them nasmyth had never more than a faint and shadowy recollection of the next few days during most of the time he fancied he was back in england and the girl he had left there seemed to be hovering about him now and then she would lay gentle hands upon him and her soothing touch would send him off to sleep again but there was a puzzling change in her appearance he remembered her as slight in figuresylphlike he had sometimes called herfastidious and dainty and always artistically dressed now however she seemed to have grown taller stronger more reserved and as he vaguely realized more capable while her garments were of a different and coarser fashion what was still more curious she did not seem to recognize her name though he addressed her by it now and then he pondered over the matter drowsily once or twice and then ceased to trouble himself about it there were several other things that appeared at least as incomprehensible  after a long time however his senses came back to him and one evening as he lay languidly looking about him in his rude wooden bunk he endeavoured to recall what had passed since he left the loggers camp the little room was comfortably warm and a plain tin lamp burned upon what was evidently a homemade table there was nothing except a rifle upon the rough log walls and nothing upon the floor which was as usual rudely laid with split boards for dressed lumber is costly in the bush looking through the open door into the general livingroom which was also lighted he could see a red twinkle beneath the register of the stove beside which a woman was sitting sewing she was a hardfeatured homely person in coarsely fashioned garments which did not seem to fit her well and nasmyth felt slightly disconcerted when he glanced at her for she was not the woman whom he had expected to see then his glance rested on a man who had also figured in his uncertain memories and now sat not far away from him the man who was young was dressed in plain blue duck and though nasmyth noticed that his hands were hard and that he had broken nails there was something in his bronzed face that suggested mental capacity  i suppose the sick man said you are the doctor who has evidently taken care of me  he was not quite himself yet and he spoke clean colloquial english without any trace of the western accentuation he usually considered it advisable to adopt though as a matter of fact the accent usually heard on the pacific slope is not unduly marked the other man naturally noticed it and laughed somewhat curiously  i have some knowledge of medicine and surgery gordon answered now and then i make use of it though i dont as a rule get a fee then he looked rather hard at nasmyth quite a few of us find it advisable to let our professions go when we come to this country  nasmyth nodded for this was a thing he had discovered already many of the comrades he had made there were outcastsmen outside the paleand they were excellent comrades too  well he said i have evidently been very sick how did i get here i dont seem to remember  miss waynefleet found you lying in the snow in the clearing  ah said nasmytha tall girl with a quiet voice big brown eyes and splendid hair  gordon smiled well he said thats quite like her  where is she now asked nasmyth and though he was very feeble still there was a certain expectancy in his manner  in the barn i believe the working oxen have to be fed its very probable that you will see her in the next halfhour as to your other questionyou were very sick indeedpneumonia once or twice it seemed a sure thing that youd slip through our fingers where were you coming from when you struck the clearing  nasmyth who had no reason for reticence and found his mind rapidly growing clearer briefly related what had led him to set out on his journey through the bush and his companion nodded  its very much as i expected he said they paid you off before you left that logging camp  they did said nasmyth who was pleased to recall the fact i had thirtytwo dollars in my belt  his companion looked at him steadily when you came here you hadnt a belt on there was not a dollar in your pockets either  this was naturally a blow to nasmyth he realized that it would probably be several weeks at least before he was strong enough to work again and he had evidently been a charge upon these strangers for some little time still he did not for a moment connect any of them with the disappearance of his belt he was too well acquainted with the character of the men who are hewing the clearings out of the great forests of the pacific slope as a matter of fact he never did discover what became of his belt  well he said i suppose i forgot to put it on one of those mornings on the march still its not very astonishing that the thing should worry me i cant expect to stay on at this ranch when do you think i can get up and set out again  how long have you been out here  been out  gordon laughed youre from the old countrythats plain enough  several years  in that case im not going to tell you were not likely to turn you out until you have some strength in you i believe im speaking for miss waynefleet now  nasmyth lay still and considered this it was at least quite evident that he could not get up yet but there were one or two other points that occurred to him  does the ranch belong to miss waynefleet he inquired she cant live here alone  she runs the concern she has certainly a father but youll understand things more clearly when you see him hes away in victoria which is partly why mrs custer from the settlement is now in yonder room her husband is at present building a trestle on the dunsmore track i come up here for only an hour every day  nasmyth afterwards discovered that this implied a journey of three or four miles either way over a very indifferent trail but at the moment he was thinking chiefly of miss waynefleet who had given him shelter  you practise at the settlement he asked  yes said his companion dryly chopping big trees ive a ranch there still i dont know that you could exactly call it practising by this time ive acquired a certain proficiency in the thing  nasmyth fancied that he must have gone to sleep soon after this for when he opened his eyes again there was no sign of the doctor and a girl was quietly moving about the room she sat down when she saw that he was awake and looked at him with a little smile and it was only natural that nasmyth should also look at her it struck him once more that she had wonderful hair in the lamplight it seemed to glow with curious redgold gleams she had also quiet brown eyes and a face that was a trifle darkened by sun and wind he guessed that she was tall she looked so as she moved about the room with a supple gracefulness that had a suggestion of strength in it that was all he noticed in detail for he was chiefly conscious of the air of quiet composure that characterized her he was a trifle fanciful that night and while he looked her he felt as he had sometimes felt when he stood at sunset in the silence of the shadowy bush or gazed down into the depths of some still river pool only her gleaming redgold hair and her full red lips slightly counteracted this impression there was in them at least a hint of fire and passion  you are much better she said and her softly modulated voice fell pleasantly on his ears he contrived to raise himself a trifle  i believe i am he answered in any case i know i owe it to you that im alive at all stilland he hesitatedi cant help feeling a bit uncomfortable you see i have really no claim on you  laura waynefleet laughed did you expect me to leave you out in the snow  if you had i couldnt have complained there wasnt the least obligation upon you to look after a penniless stranger  ah said the girl with a little smile which was curiously expressive after all many of us are in one sense strangers in the bush  nasmyth pondered over this for in view of what he had noticed in her voice and manner he fancied he understood her meaning  well he said its evident that i can do nothing in return for all your kindness except take myself off your hands as soon as possible thats partly why im particularly anxious to get better  he stopped a moment with a faint flush in his hollow face it sounds very ungracious doesnt it but after all its sense besides i scarcely feel up to expressing myself very neatly  the girl moved across the room and gently pressed him down again on the pillow  go to sleep again at once she said  nasmyth did as he was bidden which since he felt that he wanted to lie awake and watch her was in one way significant as a matter of fact what laura waynefleet considered advisable was usually done nasmyths head was clearer next morning and during the week that followed he grew stronger rapidly until one night as he sat beside the stove he realized that he could in all probability set out again on his journey in a day or two while he talked to laura waynefleet there were footsteps outside and she ran towards the door as a man came into the room nasmyth fancied the newcomer was her father for he was greyhaired and elderly but he did not look in the least like a bushrancher beneath the fur coat which he flung off when he had kissed his daughter he was dressed as one who lived in the cities though his garments were evidently far from new he was tall but his spareness suggested fragility and his face which emphasized this impression had a hint of querulous discontent in it  i didnt expect to get through until tomorrow but theyve altered the running of the stage he said wiston drove me up from the settlement and said hed send my things across tomorrow i was glad to get out of victoria the cooking and accommodation at the hotel i stayed at were simply disgusting  nasmyth glanced at the speaker in amused astonishment for the bushranchers of the pacific slope are not as a rule particular they can live on anything and sleep more or less contentedly among dripping fern or even in a pool of water as indeed they not infrequently have to do when they go up into the forests surveying or undertake a roadmaking contract laura waynefleet directed her fathers attention to her convalescent guest  this is mr nasmyth she said you will remember i mentioned him in my letter  waynefleet made the young man a little inclination that was formally courteous i am glad to see you are evidently recovering he said i hope they have made you at home here then he turned to his daughter if you could get me some supper  laura busied herself about the stove while waynefleet sat down and talked to nasmyth about generalities waynefleet appeared to be a politician and he criticized the government which in his opinion was neglecting the bushranchers shamefully it was evident that he considered it the duty of the government to contribute indirectly towards the support of settlers then the supper was laid out as he ate fastidiously he made a few faintly sardonic observations about the cookery and after the girl had brought in a pot of coffee he frowned at the cup he put down  there is one place in victoria where you can get coffee as it ought to be but this is merely roasted wheat he said you will excuse me from drinking any more of it as you have probably discovered mr nasmyth one has to put up with a good deal in this country it is in many respects a barbarous land  nasmyth saw the faint flush in laura waynefleets face and said nothing he fancied that he knew the establishment in victoria to which waynefleet referred but it was not one which he had ever visited or which the smaller bushranchers usually frequented  soon after supper nasmyth withdrew to the bed which he had insisted on preparing for himself in the loft above the stables and it was next day when he spoke to laura waynefleet alone  i cant abuse your kindness any longer he said i must go away  the girl looked at him quietly you are far from strong yet andit must be mentionedthere was not a dollar in your pockets  that is certainly the case and nasmyth flushed a little still i can get as far as the settlement and i dare say somebody who wont be too hard on me at first may want a hand i am really rather a good chopper  laura smiled as she glanced at his face but it was not its hollowness she was thinking of nasmyth had not the appearance of the average chopper  well she said perhaps you had better see my father i think he has something to say to you  she left him and half an hour later waynefleet came up to nasmyth who was sunning himself outside the ranchhouse like many other houses in that country it stood beneath a few great firs on the edge of a desolate clearing round which the primeval forest rose in an unbroken wall behind it and a little farther back among the trees was the rude barn built of big notched logs and roofed with cedar shingles in front there lay some twenty acres of cleared land out of which rose the firstumps girdled with withered fern for a warm wind from the pacific had swept the snow away beyond that in turn and outside the splitrail fence rows of giant trunks lay piled in the tremendous ruin usually called the slashing some day these would be sawn up and burnt and the clearing driven farther back into the bush the little gap into which the sunlight shone however had been hewn out at the cost of several years of strenuous labour and nasmyth who was aware of this felt inclined to smile as the man who owned it strolled up to him it was a little difficult to imagine that he had had any great share in the making of that clearing  waynefleet was dressed in duck but it was whole and unsoiled and nasmyth made his own deductions from a glance at the delicate hands as a rule waynefleets expression was discontented and querulous but for the time being his manner was gracious in fact he was generally more or less courteous to nasmyth  miss waynefleet tells me you are thinking of going away said the owner of the ranch  nasmyth replied that he intended to leave the ranch and was explaining that he felt he had already abused his hosts kindness when waynefleet cut him short  we have been glad to have you here he said in fact i have been wondering if you might feel disposed to stay it is probably evident to you that i cannot do all that is necessary about this place with one pair of hands  nasmyth knew from what he had seen on other and larger ranches that one man could do the work though he felt that it was more than one could reasonably have expected from waynefleet it was however clear that somebody did a great deal and he fancied that it was the ranchers daughter  well continued waynefleet i am disposed to spend a little upon the ranch they are talking of building a pulpmill near the settlement that will make land more valuable and probably lead to a demand for produce with that in view i wish to raise a larger crop and im open to hire somebody he made a little gesture my strength scarcely permits me to undertake any severe physical effort and i may confess that my faculty is rather that of administration now i will make you an offer  nasmyth considered it gravely as it happened he was feeling sorry for the ranchers daughter and it was this fact chiefly which led him to come to terms with the man since it seemed to him that there were tasks the girl must shrink fromtasks of which he could relieve her though he was quite aware that when his strength came back he could probably earn more than waynefleet offered him he accepted the chance to stay at the ranch moreover the varied work was likely to be much easier than logging  its a bargain ill make a start now and haul one or two of those logs out with the oxen he said still im afraid you must not expect too much from me for a week or two  waynefleet made no objections there was as a matter of fact a great deal to be done and nasmyth went back to his new quarters over the stable almost too weary to hold himself upright that night he however gathered strength rapidly and a few days later he was chopping a great tree standing on a narrow plank notched into the trunk of it several feet from the ground as he swung the axe when the man who had instructed miss waynefleet how to nurse him came up the trail gordon sat down on a log close by and looked at nasmyth  i was coming round to make sure i was quite through with your case but its tolerably evident you have no more use for me he said stopping here  nasmyth said he was and gordon nodded  well he said in several ways im rather glad its going to make things easier for miss waynefleet guess you understand what i meant when i said she ran the ranch  nasmyth said he thought he did and then with a certain diffidence he changed the subject  you must have spent a good deal of time looking after menprofessionally he said  gordon laughed in a somewhat curious fashion well let that go in one sense ive dropped my profession i had to and its scarcely likely that i shall take it up again  i wonder said nasmyth reflectively if its admissible for me to mention that i had fancied something of the kind you see in the bush i have naturally come across a good many men who have turned their backs upon the cities  gordon made a little gesture its a sure thing youll hear a good deal about me at the settlement where though the boys dont cast it up to me im credited with having killed somebody back east and as ive had an idea that i could hit it rather well with you id sooner tell you the thing myself well i was making my mark in a big city several years ago when i lost my head when success comes too quickly its a thing youre rather apt to do the trouble is that you have usually to face the results of it  he broke off for a moment with a little wry smile in my case they were serious there was a woman of hysterical temperament with a diseased imagination i was overworked and a trifle overwrought and had a glass of brandy too much at a certain committee lunch then there was a rather delicate operation in a hospital and though im not sure yet that i blundered it was suggested that i did and the thing was complicated by what the woman said when the committee took it up it didnt matter that the patient recovered for when he took action against the woman the thing made a sensation in the eastern papers  he looked at nasmyth with a question in his eyes  now he said you more or less understand my reasons for ranching here hows it going to affect you  nasmyth gazed reflectively towards the east i think he replied there are more of us who have left a good deal behind back yonder perhaps its fortunate that the thing is possible  then he swung his axe again and gordon who saw waynefleet approaching strolled away towards the ranchowner     chapter iv  laura waynefleets wish   it was a hot summer evening and a drowsy resinous fragrance stole out of the shadowy bush when nasmyth who had now spent six months at waynefleets ranch lay among the wineberries by the riverside across the strip of sliding water the sombre firs rose in a great colonnade from the grey rocks crest with the fires of sunset blazing behind their widegirthed trunks the river was low and very clear and the sound of it seemed to intensify the solemn stillness of the bush nasmyth had come there to fish after a long day of tolerably arduous labour but he did not expect much success though the trout rise freely just after sunset in those rivers indeed he had almost forgotten that the rod and net lay near his side for his employers daughter sat on a fallen cedar not far away from him  she had laid her hat aside and as it happened two hummingbirds that flashed bejewelled in a ray of ruddy light hung poised on invisible wings about the clustered blossoms of an arrowbush that drooped above her head she was however not looking at them but watching nasmyth with thoughtful eyes everything she wore was the work of her own fingers but the light print dress became her curiously well  you have been here six months now she said  i have answered nasmyth with a little laugh i almost venture to think i do you credit in view of the state i was in when i reached the ranch if you hadnt taken me in hand two or three days would probably have been the length of my stay  the girl made no disclaimer she was one who admitted facts even when they did not chime with her wishes and she still regarded nasmyth thoughtfully he certainly did her credit so far as his physical appearance went for his strength had fully come back to him and as he lay among the wineberries in an easy pose his thin duck garments displayed the fine proportions of a figure that had been trained almost to muscular perfection by strenuous labour the light of the paling sunset was on his bronzed face and it revealed the elusive delicacy that characterized it nasmyth was certainly a wellfavoured man but there were respects in which his companion was not altogether satisfied with him she had as she admitted restored him to bodily health but after all that was only going so far and she felt it was possible that she might accomplish a little more though there was no very evident reason why she should wish to do so still she was conscious of the wish  i was wondering she said how long you would be content to stay  nasmyth gazed at her in evident astonishment stay he exclaimed oh you can call it twenty years if one must be precise  ah replied laura in one sense that is an admission im not exactly pleased that you should make  the man raised himself slowly and his face became intent as he strove to grasp her meaning he was not in the least astonished that she should speak to him as she did for there are few distinctions drawn between the hired man and those who employ him on the pacific slope and he had discovered already that the girl was at least his equal in intelligence and education in fact he had now and then a suspicion that her views of life were broader than his in the meanwhile it was in one respect gratifying to feel that she could be displeased at anything he might think or do  im not quite sure i see the drift of that he said  you would be content to continue a ranchhand indefinitely  why not nasmyth asked with a smile  laura once more looked at him with an almost disconcerting steadiness and she had as he was already aware very fine eyes she however noticed the suggestive delicacy of his face which had as it happened more than once somewhat displeased her and a certain languidness of expression with which she had also grown almost impatient this man she had decided was too readily acquiescent  that she continued is rather a big question isnt it  ah said nasmyth reflectively now i begin to understand well i dont mind admitting that i once had ambitions and the means of gratifying them as well as an optimistic belief in myself that however was rudely shattered when the means were withdrawn and a man very soon learns of how little account he is in western canada why shouldnt i be content to live as the ranchhands do especially when its tolerably evident that i cant do anything else  you are forgetting that most of them were born to it that counts for a good deal have you noticed how far some of the others drift a faint trace of heightened colour crept into her cheeks perhaps one couldnt blame them when they have once acquired the whisky habit and a siwash wife  nasmyth lay very still for a few moments resting on one elbow among the wineberries for she had after all only suggested a question that had once or twice troubled him it was however characteristic of him that he had temporized and though he knew it must be answered some day had thrust it aside  ah he exclaimed you want to send me away now i had almost fancied i had made things easier in various ways for you and we have been good comrades havent we one could call it that  yes agreed laura slowly i think one could call it that  then returned nasmyth why do you want me to go  it was difficult to answer and to begin with laura did not exactly know she desired him to leave the ranchin fact she was willing to admit that there were several reasons why she wished him to stay still perhaps because she had watched over him in his sickness and so gordon said had snatched him back to life again she had a certain pride in him and vaguely felt that in one sense he belonged to her she would not have him throw away the life she had saved and she had recognized as many of his english friends had not the perilously acquiescent side of his character he was she feared one who had an unfortunate aptitude for drifting  that she said is rather more than i could explain either to myself or to you but i will tell you something they are going to build the pulpmill down the valley and they are now asking for tenders for the construction of the dam the thing i have heard is not big enough to interest contractors from the cities and most of the men round here have their hands full with their ranches  nasmyth became a trifle more intent still he remarked i have never built a dam  you told me you were rather a good chopper and i think you are you have made roads too and know how to handle giantpowder in the rockcutting and how to use the drill  there are shoals of men in this country who know considerably more about those things than i do  laura made a little impatient gesture yes she admitted there are but they are simple bushmen for the most part and does intellect count for nothing at all are a trained understanding and a quick comprehension of no use when one builds a dam  nasmyth frowned though she saw a little glow kindle in his eyes im by no means sure that i possess any of those desirable qualities besides theres a rather serious objectionthat of finance  then laura waynefleet made it clear that she had considered the question and she favoured the man with a glimpse of the practical side of her character  the stores give long credit and partial payments are generally made as a work of that kind goes on then it is not a very unusual thing for workmen to wait for their wages until the contract is carried through  nasmyth lay still for at least another minute he had gradually lost his ambition during the few years he had wandered through the bush of british columbia the aimless life was often hard but it had its compensations and he had learned to value its freedom from responsibility and care when he did not like a task he had undertaken he simply left it and went on again still he had had misgivings now and then when he noticed how far some of his comrades had drifted presently he rose slowly to his feet  well he said youre right i think and if im given an opportunity ill undertake the thing the credit will be yours if im successful  the girl rose then she admonished with a faint smile dont tell me that you have failed  she turned away and left him somewhat abruptly but nasmyth did not resume his fishing though he could hear the big trout splashing in the pool as the sunset light faded off the water he lay down among the wineberries which were scattered among the glossy leaves like little drops of blood to think harder than he had thought for a considerable time an hour ago as he had told laura waynefleet he would have been well content to stay on at the ranch and though she had roused him he knew that it would cost him an effort to leave it he was not he fancied in love with her indeed he now and then admitted that she would probably look for more from the man who won her favour than there was in him but the camaraderiehe could think of no better word for itthat had existed between them had been very pleasant to him  he realized that he was in one sense hers to dispose of she had in all probability saved his life and now she was endeavouring to arouse his moral responsibility she was sending him out to play a mans part in the battle of life he admitted that he had shrunk from it of late or at least had been content to sink back among the rank and file he had made the most of things but that he was beginning to realize was after all a somewhat perilous habit laura waynefleet evidently considered that a resolute attempt to alter conditions was more becoming than to accept them even though one was likely to be injured while making it he heard footsteps and looking up saw gordon sit down upon the cedarlog  i came to look at wistons hand and walked across when i heard that waynefleet hadnt been about he explained i dont think you need feel any particular anxiety about your employer  nasmyth grinned at this waynefleet had spent part of one day chopping a big balsam and was apparently feeling the effects of the very unusual exertion then gordon took out his pipe  i guess youre fishing he observed  i came here to get a trout for breakfast  you look like it gordon smiled as it happened i saw miss waynefleet crossing the clearing it occurs to me that she may have said something that set you thinking  i wonder said nasmyth reflectively what made you fancy that  gordon regarded him with a little twinkle in his eyes well he replied i have the honour of miss waynefleets acquaintance and have some little knowledge of her habits  men make friends with one another quickly in the western forests and nasmyth had acquired a curious confidence in his companion in spite of the story gordon had told him as the result of this he related part at least of what the girl had said gordon nodded  its quite likely youll get that contract if you apply for it the folks about the settlement havent sent an offer in he said the notion is naturally miss waynefleets its the kind of thing that would appeal to her and in a way its fortunate you have fallen into her hands shes one of the protesters  the protesters  yes answered gordon i cant think of a better name for them though it doesnt exactly convey all i mean to make the thing a little clearer well take the other kindin this country theyre best typified by the indians the siwash found it a wilderness and made the most of it as such they took their toll of the salmon and fed their ponies on the natural prairie grass if wed left it to them for centuries it would have remained a wilderness we came and found nature omnipotent but we challenged herdrove the steel road down the great cañon to bring us provisions in dyked the swamp meadows ploughed up the forest and rent the hills we made our protest and quite often it was no more than that for the rivers were too strong for us and the bush crept back upon our little clearings still we never let go and its becoming evident that we have done more than hold our own  he paused and laughed in a deprecatory fashion before he went on again now and then i have an outbreak of this kind he added lightly the thing would make an epic but if one could write it it wouldnt be worth while the protest that counts in this land is made with the axe and drill  the outbreak was comprehensible for it must be remembered that the average westerner either by birth or adoption is seldom a reticent man he is in fact usually characterized by a daring optimism and not infrequently filled to overflowing with the clean pride of achievement one can hear this newworld enthusiasm bubble over on public platforms and at brilliant functions as well as in secondrate saloons but it is most forcibly expressed where men toil waistdeep in icy water building dyke and dam or blast their waggon roads out of the side of the gloomy cañons their handiwork is not always beautiful but one wonders to see what they have made of that great desolation  nasmyth lay still among the wineberries for a minute or two and though a cold green transparency had replaced the fires of sunset behind the tall trunks now and the trout were splashing furiously in the pool he forgot all about the rod beside him as he pondered over a question which had often occurred to him  how is it that miss waynefleet is content to stay here he asked  you would hardly expect her to leave her father  no said nasmyth any way that is scarcely an answer what keeps waynefleet here one wouldnt fancy he likes living in the bush  its a little curious that you havent heard anyway somebody is bound to tell you waynefleet had to get out of the old country some trouble about trustmoney he came out to victoria and set up in the land agency business but it was his misfortune that he couldnt keep out of politics there are folks like that when they cant handle their own affairs theyre anxious to manage those of the community somebody found out the story and flung it in his face the man hadnt the grit in him to live it down he struck up into the bush and bought the halfcleared ranch  for the next minute or two nasmyth gazed straight in front of him with a very thoughtful face for he had now a vague recollection of hearing or reading of the affair in which his employer had played a discreditable part he had already decided that he was not in love with laura waynefleetin fact it was perhaps significant that he had done so more than once but he had a warm regard for the girl who had saved his life and after all his ideas were not quite so liberal as he fancied they had become in the western forest it was a trifle disconcerting to discover that she was the daughter of a swindler  it hurts inquired gordon dryly  nasmyth rose to be frank he admitted it does still though the subjects a rather delicate one i dont want you to misunderstand me after all miss waynefleet is not in the least responsible for anything her father may have done  that said gordon is a sure thing well i must be hitting the trail home arent you going to try for some of those trout in the pool  no answered nasmyth and his smile was a trifle grim i dont think i am  he watched gordon stride away through the undergrowth and then in the creeping dusk went slowly back to the ranch waynefleet was out when he reached it but laura was sitting sewing by the lamp and she looked at him sharply when he came in he was unpleasantly conscious that the light was on his face then the girl laid down her sewing and turned fully towards him  i saw mr gordon cross the clearing he has told you why we are living here she said  i think said nasmyth with a slowness that was very expressive it was not done out of unkindness  oh no and laura smiled in a rather curious fashion he had probably quite another motive then she leaned forward a little looking at him steadily i knew that he would tell you  nasmyth stood still with his forehead deeply furrowed and an unusual gravity in his eyes the girls courage and serenity appealed to him and he was conscious that his heart was beating rapidly he said nothing for a moment or two and afterwards remembered how still the little room was and how the sweet resinous scent of the firs flowed in through the open window then he made a vague gesture  there is perhaps a good deal one could say but i fancy most of it would savour of impertinence he said after all the thing doesnt affect you in any way  laura glanced down at her hands and nasmyth guessed what she was thinking for they were hard and workroughened the toil that her hands showed was as he realized only a part of her burden  i think it affects me a very great deal she declared slowly  then a curious compassion for her troubled the man she was young and very comely and it was he felt cruelly hard on her that bearing her fathers shame she must lead a life of hard labour at that desolate ranch he felt an almost uncontrollable desire to comfort her and to take her cares upon himself but that was out of the question since he was merely a ranchhand a bushchopper who owed even the food he ate and the clothes he wore to her there is as he realized then after all very little one can do to lighten anothers load but in that moment the halfformed aspirations that she had called into existence in his mind expanded suddenly there was he felt no reason why he should not acquire money and influence once he made the effort  miss waynefleet he said haltingly i can only offer you my sincere sympathy stilland perhaps he did not recognize how clear the connection of ideas wasi am going down to see about that dambuilding contract tomorrow  then laura smiled and took up her sewing again her burden as she realized was hers alone but she knew that this man would no longer drift she had called up his latent capacities and he would prove his manhood     chapter v  the flood   the autumn afternoon was oppressively hot when gordon floundering among the whitened driftwood piled along the riverbank came upon nasmyth who lay upon a slope of rock with his hands which were badly bruised clenched upon a drill another man who stood upon a plank inserted into a crevice swung a hammer and its ponderous head came ringing down upon the drill which nasmyth jerked round at every stroke so many times to the minute with rhythmic regularity as nasmyth was apparently too busily engaged just then to trouble about him gordon sat down on a big log and taking out his pipe looked about him when he had lighted it  the river had made a gap for itself in the great forest that filled the valley and the sombre firs that rose in serried ranks upon its farther bank rolled back up the hillside streaked here and there with a little thin white mist a mile or so away and lower down the valley there was an opening in their shadowy masses out of which rose the ringing of hammers and a long trail of smoke for workmen from the cities were building the new woodpulp mill there in the foreground the river swirled by frothing at flood level for a weeks fierce sunshine had succeeded a month of torrential rain and the snow high up on a distant peak was melting fast  nobody about the little settlement at the head of the deep inlet had seen the water quite so high at that season and gordon noticed how it frothed and boiled about the row of stonebacked piles that stretched out from either bank as he listened to the hoarse roar of the pentup torrent he understood what that partly completed dam must have cost nasmyth after a little time nasmyth rose and stepping on the plank wearily straightened his back  were down far enough he announced let me have the two sticks of giantpowder and then tell the boys to jump for cover  the other man who sprang down from his perch handed him what appeared to be two thick sticks of yellow wax and gordon watched him as he carefully nipped a copper detonator down on a length of snaky fuse and embedded it in the plastic material then he cautiously tamped the two yellow rolls down into the drilledout hole after that he lighted the fuse and clambering down the slope of rock saw gordon  well get out of this its a short fuse he said  gordon who was acquainted with the action of giantpowder had no desire to stay and they floundered as fast as possible over the driftwood and masses of shattered rock until nasmyth drew his companion behind a towering fir then there was a sharp detonation a crash and a shower of flying stones went smashing through the forest and into the river one which gordon fancied must have weighed about two hundred pounds drove close past them and struck a young cedar which snapped off beneath the impact then there was a sudden silence and nasmyth stretched out his arms with a suggestive weariness before he sat down and took out his pipe  no one could have expected that stone to come this way he remarked with a little laugh its an example of how contrary things can be in fact theyve been about as contrary as its possible the last month or so as no doubt you have noticed one very seldom gets much encouragement when he takes the uphill trail its very rarely made any easier for him  gordon grinned though he realized that the trail his companion had set out upon was very steep indeed he had secured the dambuilding contract which was not astonishing since nobody else appeared anxious to undertake it and he had already acquired a certain proficiency with the axe and drill there is as yet very little specialization in that land which is in many respects fortunate for those who live in it and the small rancher cheerfully undertakes any kind of primitive engineering that seems likely to provide him with a few dollars from building timber bridges to blasting waggon roads out of the hardest rock what is more he usually makes a success of it in nasmyths case however the rise of water had made his task almost insuperably difficult and it had already left a certain mark on him gordon who was after all a doctor naturally noticed this as he watched him  nasmyth was very lean now but he was also hard and muscular and the old blue shirt which hung open at the neck and torn duck trousers which clung about him still wet with riverwater accentuated the wiry suppleness of his frame but it was in his face that gordon noticed the greatest change the goodhumoured tolerant indifference he remembered had melted out of it the lips seemed set more firmly and the eyes were resolute and keen nasmyth so gordon noticed had grown since he first took up his duties as waynefleets hired hand still though it was less apparent the stamp of refinement and what gordon called for want of a better term sensibility clung to him and it seemed to the trained observer that the qualities it suggested might yet handicap his comrade in a country where the struggle with primitive forces chiefly demands from man an unreasoning animal courage in that land the small contractor and bushrancher must bear the brunt on his body every day toiling waistdeep in icy waters or gripping the drill with bleeding hands while each fresh misfortune that follows flood and frost is met with a further strain on weary muscles and sterner resolution it is a fight that is usually hardest for the man who thinks and in which the one thing that counts is the brutal bulldog valour that takes hold and holds on in spite of each crushing blow  this high water said gordon has kept you back considerably  it has nasmyth replied with emphasis it has cost me more money that i care to figure up the last month and were considerably behind the dams still at the mercy of the next big flood  its a little curious that you seem to stand it better than you did the logging said gordon with a quick glance at him  nasmyth appeared to consider this i do and thats a fact for one thing im fighting for my own hand and no doubt that counts though perhaps it doesnt go quite far enough after all its a point you ought to know more about than i do  his companion smiled i can describe the mechanical connection between the thought in a mans brain and the movement of his muscles its comparatively simple but when you understand that youre only beginning theres much more behind to particularize if you had done what youre doing now when you were logging it would in all probability have broken you up again  nasmyth fancied that this was correct though as he had admitted he could give no reason for it he was only conscious that he was being constrained by some new influence and under the pressure it laid upon him he became almost insensible to physical weariness he had now a motive for fighting in place of drifting that no mere hired hand can possess his indolent content had been rudely dissipated and something that had lain dormant in the depths of his nature had come uppermost it was certainly laura waynefleet who had given it the first impulse but why he had permitted her to impose her will on him was a matter that was still incomprehensible to him seeing that he did not answer gordon changed the subject  some of the boys and i have been wondering how you contrived to finance the thing he said  nasmyth smiled though there was just a trace of darker colour in his face well he replied one can get tolerably long credit from most of the bush stores and clipton has let me have provisions for the boys on quite reasonable terms besides as it happens there is money in the family there was a time when one might have considered it almost the duty of certain relatives of mine to give me a lift but i didnt offer them the opportunity i came out here and set about driving cows and chopping trees instead  you felt youd sooner cut your hand off than give them a gentle hint remarked gordon its not an uncommon feeling but when you give way to it it clears the other people wont you go on  when i undertook this affair i laid the opportunity before them and onethe last i expected anything of that kind fromsent me out a draft he kindly pointed out that there appeared to be in me certain capabilities which he had never supposed i possessed and added that if i ever really succeeded in building a dam or anything else useful he would be pleased to take a share in my next venture in the meanwhile he would charge me interest on the amount of that draft perhaps i may mention that the man in question was naturally the one the rest of them rather looked down upon  gordon laughed oh yes he said i like that naturally i guess you would have taken their view of him once well since you can put your pride in your pocket youre evidently growing theres just one way of putting anything through here and thats to take hold and hang right on no matter what it costs i guess theres one of the boys wanting you  a man stood kneedeep in the river waving his hand nasmyth rose and stretched himself  they seem to want me all the time from sunup until its dark he said in one way its a little curious since theres reason to believe that most of them know a good deal more about what were doing than i do myself youll excuse me  gordon smiled as his comrade strode away he was one who had studied human nature and because he was well acquainted with the bushmans capabilities he knew that there were also limitations to them even in such matters as the splitting of hard rock and the driving of massive piles into the riverbed the higher intelligence of the man of intellect had its effect gordon smoked his pipe out as he watched nasmyth flounder into the stream among the other men pushing a little car loaded with broken rock that apparently ran along a submerged track then he strolled back toward the settlement  nasmyth toiled on in the river until the campcook hammered upon a suspended iron sheet as a signal that supper was ready the summons was answered without delay with the water running from their clothing nasmyth and his men went back to the little log shanty one or two changed their dripping garments but the rest left their clothes to dry upon them as their employer did when the plentiful warm supper had been eaten nasmyth went back to the little hut that served him as store and sleeping quarters a big grizzled man from mattawa ontario went in with him and lounged upon the table while he sat in his bunk which was filled with fresh spruce twigs  im pretty well played out and if im to work tomorrow ive got to sleep tonight said nasmyth  the grizzled axeman nodded well he volunteered ill stand watch i was in the last two nights and i guess its up to me to see you through were going to have trouble if one of those big logs fetches up across the sluiceway the rivers full of them and shes risen most a foot since sunup  nasmyth held up one hand and both heard the deep roar of frothing water that came in with the smell of the firs through the open door the bush was very still outside and that hoarse throbbing note flung back by the rock slope and climbing pines filled the valley nasmyth smiled grimly for it was suggestive of the great forces against which he had pitted his puny strength then there was a crash and a few moments later a curious thud and both men listened intent and strung up until the turmoil of the river rose alone again  a big log said the older man she has gone through the run guess well get one byandby long enough to jamb now if youd run out those wingframes i was stuck on shed have took them straight through every one  the trouble was that i hadnt the money mattawa said nasmyth dryly  his companion nodded for this was a trouble he could understand well he answered when you havent got it you have to face the consequences ill roust you out if a big log comes along  mattawa went out and soon afterwards nasmyth whose clothes were now partly dry lay down dressed as he was in his twigpacked bunk with his pipe in his hand it was growing a little colder and a keen air which had in it the properties of an elixir blew in but that was a thing nasmyth scarcely noticed and the dominant roar of the river held his attention he wondered again why he had been drawn into the conflict with it or rather why he had permitted laura waynefleet to set him such a task and the answer that it was because he desired to hold her good opinion and as he had said to do her credit did not seem to go far enough it merely suggested the further question why he should wish to keep her friendship still there was no disguising the fact that once he had undertaken the thing it had got hold of him and he felt he must go on until his task was successfully accomplished or he was crushed and beaten it seemed very likely then that utter defeat would be his fate while he pondered the pipe fell from his hand and the rivers turmoil rang in deep pulsations through his dreams he was awakened suddenly by a wet hand on his shoulder and scrambling out of his bunk on the instant he saw mattawa with a lantern in his hand  log right across the sluicerun said the watcher more coming along behind it theyll sure get piling up  nasmyth did not remember that he gave any directions when he sprang half asleep out of the shanty the roar of water had a different note in it and the clangour of the iron sheet one of the men was pounding rang out harshly a halfmoon hung above the black pines and dimlyseen men were flitting like shadows toward the waterside they appeared to know what it was advisable to do but they stopped just a moment on the edge of the torrent for which nobody could have blamed them the water streaked with smears of froth and foam swirled by and there was a tumultuous white seething where the flood boiled across the log in the midst of the stream the log blocked the gap left open to let the driftwood through and as nasmyth knew great trees torn up in distant valleys were coming down with the flood it seemed to him that he could not reasonably have expected to clear that obstacle with a battalion of logdrivers and he had only a handful of weary men still the men went in floundering kneedeep in the flood along the submerged pile of stone and clutching at the piles that bound it to save themselves when the stream threatened to sweep their feet from under them until they came to the gap where the great tree rolling in the grip of the torrent thrashed its grinding branches against the stone  then though it was difficult to see how a man of them found a foothold or kept it on the heaving trunk the big axes flashed and fell while a few shadowy figures ran along the top of the log to attack the massy butt across the opening it would have been arduous labour in daylight and at lowwater but these were men who had faced the most that flood and frost could do they set about their task in the dark for that land would have been a wilderness still if the men in it had shown themselves unduly careful of either life or limb  the great branches yielded beneath the glinting blades and went on down river again but nasmyth who felt the axehaft slip in his greasy hands did not try to lead it was sufficient if he could keep pace with the rest of the woodchoppers which was after all a thing most men reared as he had been would certainly not have done the lust of conflict was upon him that night and balancing himself ankledeep in water on the trunk that heaved and dipped beneath him he swung the trenchant steel he felt that he was pitted against great primeval forces and with the gorged veins rising on his forehead and the perspiration dripping from him mans primitive pride and passions urged him to the struggle  how long it was before they had stripped the tree to a bare log he did not know but twice as they toiled on he saw a man splash into the river and rising in the eddy beneath the submerged dam crawl dripping out again and at length he found himself beside mattawa whirling his axe above a widening notch and keeping rhythmic stroke he knew he was acquitting himself creditably then for mattawa had swung the axe since he could lift it and there are men and mechanics too who cannot learn to use it as the bushmen do in a lifetime but he also knew that he could not keep pace with his comrade very long in the meanwhile he held his aching muscles to their task and the gleaming blades whirled high above their shoulders in the pale light of the moon as each left the widening gap the other came shearing down  the other men were now plying peevie and handspike at the butt of the log and he and mattawa toiled on alone two dim and shadowy figures in the midst of the flood until at last there was a rending of fibres and mattawa leapt clear  jump he gasped shes going  nasmyth jumped he went down in four or five feet of water and had the sense to stay there while the log drove over him then he came up and clutching it held on while it swept downstream into a slacker eddy there were several other figures apparently clinging to the butt of it and when he saw them slip off into the river one by one he let go too he was swung out of the eddy into a white turmoil which hurled him against frothlapped stones but at length he found sure footing and crawled up the bank which most of his companions had reached before him when the others came up he found that he was aching all over and evidently was badly bruised he stood still shivering a little and blinked at them  youre all here he said where are those axes  it appeared that most of them were in the river which was not very astonishing for a man cannot reasonably be expected to swim through a flood with a big axe in his hand and when somebody said so nasmyth made a little gesture of resignation  well he said the logs will just have to pile up if another big one comes along before the morning  this was evident they were all dead weary and most of them were badly bruised as well and they trooped back to the shanty while nasmyth limped into his hut nasmyth sloughed off his dripping garments and was asleep in five minutes after he had crawled into his bunk     chapter vi  the breaking of the dam   a faint grey light was creeping into the shanty when nasmyth awoke again and lay still for a minute or two while his senses came slowly back to him the first thing of which he was definitely conscious was a physical discomfort that rendered the least movement painful he felt sore all over and there was a distressful ache in one hip and shoulder which he fancied was the result of falling on the log or perhaps of having been hurled against the boulders by the rapids through which he had reached the bank his physical condition did not trouble him seriously for he had grown more or less accustomed to muscular weariness and the cramping pains which spring from toiling long hours in cold water and although he made a grimace as he raised himself a trifle it was the sound outside that occupied most of his attention  the door stood open as he had left it and a clean cold air that stirred his blood came in with the smell of fir and cedar but what he noticed was the deeper tone in the roar of the river that seemed flung back in sonorous antiphones by the climbing pines it had occurred to him on other occasions when he was in a fanciful mood that they were singing a majestic benedicite but just then he was uneasily conscious that there was a new note in the great reverberating harmonies stately pine and towering cedar had raised their voices too and a wild wailing fell through the long waves of sound from the highest of them on the crest of the hill it was evident that a fresh breeze was blowing down the valley and as it must have swept the hollow farther up among the ranges which was filled with a deep blue lake nasmyth realized that it would drive at least another foot of water into the river as well as set adrift the giant logs that lay among the boulders even then they were he fancied in all probability driving down upon his halffinished dam  rousing himself with an effort he clambered out of his bunk and then gripped the little table hard for his hip pained him horribly as his weight came upon it then as he struggled into his clothing there was a heavy thud outside that was followed by a crashing and grinding and a gasping man appeared in the door of the shanty  big log across the run he cried three or four more of them coming along  nasmyth who said nothing set his lips tight and was out of the shanty in another moment or two a glance at the river showed him that any effort he could make would in all probability be futile but he and the others waded out into the flood and recommenced the struggle that at least was a thing they owed to themselves and they toiled for an hour or two very much as they had done in the darkness only that fresh logs were now coming down on them every few minutes and at last they recognized that they were beaten then they went back dejectedly and nasmyth sat down to breakfast though he had very little appetite he felt that all the strength he had would be needed that day  after breakfast he lay among the boulders gnawing his unlighted pipe and watching the growing mass of driftwood that chafed and ground against the piles of the dam nothing he recognized could save the dam now it was bound to go for the piles were only partly backed with stone and in any case men do not build in that new country as they do in england their needs are constantly varying and their works are intended merely to serve the purpose of the hour it is a growing country and the men in it know that the next generation will not be content with anything that they can do and what is more to the purpose they themselves will want something bigger and more efficient in another year or two hence the dam was a somewhat frail and temporary structure of timber as well as stone but it would probably have done what was asked of it had it been completed before the floods set in as it was nasmyth knew that he would see the end of it before another hour slipped by  it came even sooner than he had expected there was a dull crash the piles that rose above the flood collapsed and the mass of grinding timber drove on across the ruined dam then nasmyth rose and stretching himself wearily went back to his shanty he felt he could not face the sympathy of his workmen he was still sitting there in a state of utter physical weariness and black dejection when towards the middle of the afternoon the door was quietly opened and laura waynefleet came in she looked at him as he remembered she had done once or twice at the ranch with compassion in her eyes and he was a little astonished to feel that instead of bringing him consolation her pity hurt him then he felt the blood rise to his face and he looked away from her  you have heard already he asked  yes said the girl softly i was at the settlement and they told me there i am so sorry  nasmyth winced but he contrived to say thank you and then glanced round the untidy shanty which was strewn with dripping clothes of course he added it is something to know that i have your sympathy but i must not keep you here  it was not a tactful speech but laura smiled i meant to take you out she said you have been sitting here brooding since the dam went and from what mattawa told me you havent had any dinner  no said nasmyth now i come to think of it i dont believe i have im not sure its very astonishing  then well go away somewhere and make tea among the pines  nasmyth glanced suggestively at his attire his duck jacket had shrunk with constant wetting and would not button across the old blue shirt which fell apart at his bronzed neck the sleeves had also drawn up from his wrists and left the backs of his hands unduly prominent his hands were scarred and the fingers were bruised where the hammerhead had fallen on them in wet weather as it glanced from the drill the girl was immaculate in a white hat and a dress of light flowered print  do i look like going on a picnic with you he said the few other things i possess are in much the same condition  laura had naturally noticed the state of his attire but it was his face that troubled her it was haggard and his eyes were heavy as she had decided long before it was a face of grecian type and she would sooner have had it roman this man she felt was too sensitive and apt to yield to sudden impulses and just then her heart ached over him still she contrived to laugh  pshaw she said i told mattawa to get me a few things ready  nasmyth followed her out of the shanty and when he had picked up the basket and kettle somebody had left at the door she turned to him  where shall we go she asked  anywhere said nasmyth that is as long as its away from the river  laura saw the shrinking in his eyes as he gazed at the swirling flood and though she was sorry for him it roused in her a momentary spark of anger then she went with him up the hillside beneath the climbing pines until they reached a shadowy hollow near the crest of it out of which a little stream trickled down  now light a fire while i see what there is in the basket she said  she found a splendid trout a packet of tea and a little bag of selfraising flour among other sundries and for the next halfhour she kept nasmyth busy making flapjacks and frying the trout then they sat down to a simple meal and when it was over nasmyth laughed  its a little astonishing in view of how i felt at breakfast but theres nothing left he sighed in one way the admissions a little humiliating but i almost feel myself again  its supposed to be a very natural one in the case of a man said laura you can smoke if you like i want to talk to you  nasmyth stretched himself out on the other side of the fire and laura leaning forward a little looked at him without knowing exactly why he felt somewhat uneasy beneath her gaze  now she said i would like to hear what you are going to do  the man made a little rueful gesture i dont know chop trees again for some rancher most probablyin fact i was wondering whether you would have me back as a ranchhand  ah cried the girl sharply while a trace of hardness crept into her eyes that is very much what i expected as it happens i am far from satisfied with the man we have but i should not think of replacing him with you just now  nasmyth winced and it was characteristic of him that he endeavoured to beguile her away from the object she evidently had in view  whats the matter with the man he asked  a diversity of gifts among other things he appears to possess an extensive acquaintance with colonial politics and he and my father discuss the regeneration of the government when they might with advantage be doing something else  nasmyth frowned i understand thats one reason why i wanted to come back after all there is a good deal i could save you from in fact i get savage now and then when i think of what you are probably being left to do upon the ranch i ventured a hint or two to your father but he seemed impervious he hesitated for a moment no doubt its a delicate subject but its a little difficult quietly to contemplate the fact that while those men talk politics you  i do their work suggested laura with a lifting of her arched eyebrows after all isnt that or something like it what generally happens when men turn their backs upon their task  nasmyth flushed i admit that i was trying to break away from mine but it seems you have undertaken to head me off and drive me back to it again  that was more or less what i wished said laura quietly  well nasmyth replied as i think youre a little hard on me ill try to put my views before you to begin with the dam is done for  you are quite sure you built it so far once is it altogether out of the question for you to do as much again  nasmyth felt his face grow hot she was looking at him with quiet eyes which had however the faintest suggestion of disdain in them  the question is why i should want to do it he said  ah rejoined laura you have no aspirations at all still im not quite sure that is exactly what i meanin fact i think i mean considerably more you are quite content to throw away your birthright and relinquish all claim to the station you were born in  the man smiled somewhat bitterly i think you understand that its a custom of this country not to demand from any man an account of what he may have done before he came out to it in my particular case it was however nothing very discreditable and i once had my aspirations or as you prefer to consider it i recognized my obligations then the blow fell unexpectedly and i came out here and became a hired mana wandering chopper after all one learns to be content rather easily which is in several ways fortunate then you instilled fresh aspirationsits the right word in this caseinto me and i made another attempt only to be hurled back again there doesnt seem to be much use in attempting the impossible  then a thing is to be considered impossible after one fails twice there are men who failand go on againall their lives long  im afraid nasmyth declared in a dull tone i am not that kind of man after all to be flung down from the station you were born toim using your own wordsand turned suddenly adrift to labour with ones hands takes a good deal of the courage out of one i almost think if you could put yourself in my place you would understand  laura smiled in a suggestive fashion and looked down at the hands she laid upon her knee they were capable as well as shapely and as he had noticed more than once the signs of toil were very plain on them  i never did an hours useful work before i came out west she said  she had produced the effect she probably desired for in the midst of his sudden pity for her nasmyth was troubled with a sense of shame this girl he realized had been reared as gently as he had been himself and he knew that she now toiled most of every day at what in the older country would have been considered most unwomanly tasks still she had borne with it cheerfully and had courage to spare for others whose strength was less than hers  he sat silent for almost a minute looking down between the great pines into the valley and as he did so he vaguely felt the influence of the wilderness steal over him the wind had fallen now and there was a deep stillness in the climbing forest which the roar of the river emphasized those trees were vast of girth and they were very cold in spite of whirling snow and gale and frost they had grown slowly to an impressive stateliness in nature as he recognized all was conflict and it was the fine adjustment of opposing forces that made for the perfection of grace and strength and beauty then it seemed to him that his companion was like the foreststill and strong and statelybecause she had been through the stress of conflict too these were however fancies and he turned around again to her with a sudden resolution expressed in his face and attitude  theres an argument you might have used miss waynefleet he told her i said i would try to do you credit and it almost seems as if i had forgotten it well if you will wait a little i will try again  he rose and crossing over stood close beside her with his hand laid gently on her shoulder looking down on her with a quiet smile after all he added theres a good deal you might have said that you haventin fact its one of your strong points that as a rule you content yourself with going just far enough well because you wish it i am somehow going to build that dam again  she looked up at him swiftly with a gleam in her eyes and nasmyth stooped a little while his hand closed hard upon her shoulder  you saved my life and you have tried to do almost as much in a different way since then he went on it is probably easier to bring a sick man back to health than it is to make him realize his obligations and to imbue him with the courage to face them when its evident that he doesnt possess it still you cant do things of that kind without results and i think you ought to know that i belong to you  there was a trace of colour in laura waynefleets face and she quivered a little under his grasp but she looked at him steadily and read his mind in his eyes the man was stirred by sudden evanescent passion and exaggerated gratitude while pity for her had she fancied also its effect on him but that was the last thing she desired and with a swift movement she shook off his hand  ah she said dont spoil things  her tone was quiet but it was decisive and nasmyth whose face flushed darkly let his hand fall back to his side then she rose and turned to him  if we are to be friends this must never happen again she added  then they went down the hillside and back to the settlement where nasmyth harnessed the team which the rancher who lived near occasionally placed at waynefleets disposal to a dilapidated waggon when she gathered the reins up laura smiled down on him  after all she reminded him you will remember that i expect you to do me credit  she drove away and nasmyth walked back to his camp beside the dam where the men were awaiting the six oclock supper he leaned upon a pinestump looking at them gravely when he had called them together  boys he said the river as you know has wiped out most of the dam now it was a tight fit for me to finance the thing and i dont get any further payment until the stoneworks graded to a certain level well if you leave me now ive just enough money in hand to square off with each of you you see if you go youre sure of your pay if you stay most of the money will go to settle the storekeepers and the powder bills and should we fail again youll have thrown your time away id like you to understand the thing but whether you stay or not im holding on  there was silence for half a minute and then the men gathering into little groups whispered to one another until mattawa stood forward  all you have to do is to go straight ahead were coming along with you solidevery blame one of us he said  a red flush crept into nasmyths face  thank you boys after that ive got to put this contract through he answered     chapter vii  laura makes a dress   the frost had grown keener as darkness crept over the forest and the towering pines about the clearing rose in great black spires into the nipping air but it was almost unpleasantly hot in the little general room of waynefleets ranch waynefleet who was fond of physical comfort had gorged the snapping stove and the smell of hot iron filled the logwalled room there was also a dryness in its atmosphere which would probably have had an unpleasant effect upon anyone not used to it the rancher however did not appear to feel it he lay drowsily in a big hide chair and his old velvet jacket and evening shoes were strangely out of harmony with his surroundings waynefleet made it a rule to dress for the six oclock meal which he persisted in calling dinner  he had disposed of a quantity of potatoes and apples at the settlement of late and had now a really excellent cigar in his hand while a little cup of the mocha coffee brought from victoria for his especial use stood on the table beside him waynefleet had cultivated tastes and invariably gratified them when it was possible while it had not occurred to him that there was anything significant in the fact that his daughter confined herself to the acrid green tea provided by the settlement store he never did notice a point of that kind and if anyone had ventured to call his attention to it he would probably have been indignant as well as astonished as a rule however nobody endeavours to impress unpleasant facts upon men of waynefleets character in their case it is clearly not worth while  do you intend to go on with that dressmaking much longer he asked petulantly the click of your scissors has an irritating effect on me and as you may have noticed i cannot spread my paper on the table it cramps ones arms to hold it up  laura swept part of the litter of fabric off the table and it was only natural that she did it a trifle abruptly she had been busy with rough tasks from most of which her father might have relieved her had he possessed a less fastidious temperament until supper and there were reasons why she desired an hour or two to herself  i will not be longer than i can help she said  waynefleet lifted his eyebrows sardonically as he glanced at the scattered strips of fabric this he said is evidently in preparation for that ridiculous pulpmill ball in view of the primitive manners of the people we shall be compelled to mix with i really think i am exercising a good deal of selfdenial in consenting to go at all why you should wish to do so is i confess altogether beyond me  i understood that you considered it advisable to keep on good terms with the manager said laura with a trace of impatience he has bought a good deal of produce from you to feed his workmen with  her father made a gesture of resignation one has certainly to put up with a good deal that is unpleasant in this barbarous landin fact almost everything in it jars upon one he complained you however i have sometimes wondered to notice appear almost content here  laura looked up with a smile but said nothing she at least had the sense and the courage to make the most of what could not be changed it was a relief to her when a minute or two later the hired man opened the door  if youve got the embrocation i guess ill give that oxs leg a rub he said  waynefleet rose and turned to the girl ill put on my rubber overshoes he announced as i mentioned that i might have to go out its a pity you didnt think of laying out my coat to warm  laura brought the overshoes and he permitted her to fasten them for him and to hold his coat while he put it on after which he went out grumbling and she sat down again to her sewing with a strained expression in her eyes for there were times when her father tried her patience severely she sighed as she contemplated the partly riggedup dress stretched out on the table for she could not help remembering how she had last worn it at a brilliant english function then she had been flattered and courted and now she was merely an unpaid toiler on the lonely ranch money was as a rule signally scarce there but even when there were a few dollars in waynefleets possession it seldom occurred to him to offer any of them to his daughter it is also certain that nobody could have convinced him that it was only through her efforts he was able to keep the ranch going at all she never suggested anything of the kind to him but she felt now and then that her burden was almost beyond her strength  she quietly went on with her sewing there was to be a dance at the new pulpmill which had just been roofed and after all she was young and could take a certain pleasure in the infrequent festivities of her adopted country besides the forest ranchers dance well and there were men among them who had once followed other occupations while she knew that nasmyth would be therein fact having at length raised his dam to the desired level he would be to a certain extent an honoured guest she was not exactly sure how she regarded him though it was not altogether as a comrade and she felt there was in one sense some justice in his admission that he belonged to her she had in all probability saved his life andwhat was perhaps as muchhad roused him from supine acquiescence and inspired him with a sustaining purpose after the day when she had saved him from abject despair over his ruined dam he had acquitted himself valiantly and she had a quiet pride in him moreover she was aware of a natural desire to appear to advantage at the approaching dance  there was however difficulty to be grappled with the dress was old and when remade in a later style would be unfortunately plain the few pairs of gloves she had brought from england were stained and spotted with damp and her eyes grew wistful as she turned over the stock list of a victoria dry goods store the thing would be so easy if she had only a little more money but she sighed as she glanced into her purse then she took up the gloves and a strip of trimming and looked at them with a little frown but while she did so there were footsteps outside and the door was opened a man whom she recognized as a hired hand from a ranch in the neighbourhood stood in the entrance with a packet in his hand  i wont come in he said i met nasmyth down at the settlement hed just come back from victoria and he asked me to bring this along  he went away after he had handed her the packet and a gleam of pleasure crept into lauras eyes when she opened it there was first of all a box of gloves of various colours and then inside another packet a wonderful piece of lace the artistic delicacy of the lace appealed to her for though she possessed very few dainty things she was fond of them and she almost fancied that she had not seen anything of the kind more beautiful in england  as she unfolded it a strip of paper fell out and the warm blood swept into her face as she read the message on it  considering everything i really dont think you could regard it as a liberty it ran you have given me a good deal more than this  then for just a moment her eyes grew hazy in proportion to the mans means it was a costly gift and except for him nobody had shown her much consideration since she had left england she was a trifle perplexed for she did not think there was lace of that kind on sale often in victoria and in regard to the gloves it was not evident how he had known her size then she remembered that one of the cotton ones she sometimes wore had disappeared some little time before and once more the flush crept into her cheeks that almost decided her not to wear his lace but she felt that to refrain from doing so would raise the question as to how they stood with regard to one another which was one she did not desire to think out closely then and after all the lace was exactly what she wanted to complete the dress she rolled it together and put it and the gloves away but she treasured the little note  it was a week later when her father drove her to the pulpmill in a jolting waggon and arrived there a little earlier than he had expected a dance usually begins with a bountiful supper in that country but waynefleet who was as a rule willing to borrow implements or teams from his bush neighbours would seldom eat with them when he could help it he was accordingly not quite pleased to find the supper had not yet been cleared away but laura who understood what he was feeling contrived to lead him into a vacant place at one of the tables then she sat down and looked about her  the great room was hung with flags and cedar boughs and the benches down the long uncovered tables were crowded the mens attire was motleybroadcloth and duck white shirts starched or limp and blue ones shoes with the creeperspikes filed down and long boots to the knees there were women present also and they wore anything from light print put together for the occasion to treasured garments made in montreal or toronto perhaps a dozen years before but for all that the assembly was good to look upon there was steadfast courage in the bronzed faces and most of those who sat about the long tables had kindly eyes the stamp of a clean life of effort was upon them and there was a certain lithe gracefulness in the unconscious poses of the straightlimbed men there was no sign of limp slovenliness about them even in their relaxation they were intent and alert and as she watched them laura realized something of their restless activity and daring optimism they believe in anything that is good enough in that country and are in consequence cheerfully willing to attempt anything even if to other men it would appear altogether visionary and impossible and simple faith goes a long way when supplemented by patient labour laura suddenly became conscious that the manager of the pulpmill a little wiry man in white shirt and store clothes was speaking at the head of the table  in one way its not a very big thing we have done boys he said and laura was quick to notice the significance of the fact which was also characteristic of the country that he counted himself as one of them weve chopped a hole in the primeval forest held back the river and set up our mill thats about all on the face of it but theres rather more behind its another round with nature and weve got her down again its a thing you have to do west of the rockies or shell crush the life out of you there are folks in the eastern cities who call her beneficent but they dont quite understand what was laid on man in eden long ago here hes up against flood and frost and snow well i guess weve done about all we can and now that ive paid my respects to the chopper and carpentergang theres another man i want to mention he took hold of the contract to put us up our dam and kept hold through the blamedest kind of luck theres hard grit in him and the boys he led and the river couldnt wash it out of them well when the big turbines are humming and the mills grinding out money for all of you i guess youre going to remember the boys who built the dam  there was a shout which shook the wooden building and laura sat very still when nasmyth stood up there was no doubt that he was a favourite with everybody there and she knew that she had nerved him to the fight he did not appear altogether at ease and she waited with a curious expectancy for what he had to say it was very little but she appreciated the tact which made him use the speech his audience was accustomed to  i had a good crowd he said with the boys i had behind me i couldnt back down then his voice shook a little still i was mighty near it once or twice it was the boys determination to hold onand another thingthat put new grit in me  without being conscious of what he was doing he swept his glance down the long table until it rested on laura waynefleets face she felt the blood creep into her cheeks for she knew what he meant but she looked at him steadily and her eyes were shining then he spread his hands out  i felt i darent shame boys of that kind he said and hastily sat down  his observations were certainly somewhat crude but the little quiver in his voice got hold of those who heard him and once more the big building rang with cheering as the sound of hearty acclamation died away there was a great clatter of thrustback benches through which the tuning of a fiddle broke then out of the tentative twang of strings rose clear and silvery the lament of flora macdonald thrilling with melancholy and there were men and women there whose hearts went back to the other wild and misty land of rock and pine and frothing river which they had left far away across the sea it may be that the musician desired a contrast or that he was merely feeling for command of the instrument for the plaintive melody that ran from shift to shift into a thin elfin wailing far up the sobbing strings broke off suddenly and was followed by the crisp jar of crashing chords then the flowers of edinburgh rang out with caledonian verve in it and a mad seductive swing and the guests streamed out to the middle of the floor that they had just eaten an excellent supper was a matter of no account with them  nasmyth in the meanwhile elbowed his way through the crowd of dancers until he stood at lauras side and as he looked at her there was a trace of embarrassment in his manner she wore his lace but until that moment her attire had never suggested the station to which she had been born now she seemed to have stepped fresh and immaculate untouched by toil out of the world to which he had once belonged she was for that night at least no longer an impoverished ranchers daughter but a lady of station with a twinkle in his eyes he made her a little formal inclination and she knowing what he was thinking answered with an oldworld curtsey after which a grinning oxteamster of habitant extraction turned and clapped nasmyths shoulder approvingly  vla la belle chose he said mamselle laura is altogether ravissante me i dance with no one else if she look at me like dat  then nasmyth and laura laughed and glided into the dance though in the case of most of their companions plunged would have been the better word for it english reserve is not esteemed in that land and the axemen danced with the mingled verve of grey caledonia and lighthearted france while a little man with fiery hair from the misty western isles shrieked encouragement at them and maddened them with his fiddle even nasmyth and laura gave themselves up to the thrill of it but as they swung together through the clashing of the measure which some of their companions did not know very well confused recollections swept through their minds and they recalled dances in far different surroundings now and then they even fell back into old tricks of speech and then remembering broke off with a ringing laughter they were young still and the buoyancy of the country they had adopted was in both of them  the dance ended too soon and when the music broke off with a crash of clanging chords nasmyth led his partner out of the press into a little logwalled room where the halfbuilt dynamos stood it was lighted but a sharp cool air and the fret of the river came in through a black opening in one wall laura sat upon a large deal case and nasmyth looking down upon her leaned against a dynamo he smiled as he recognized that she grasped the significance of the throbbing roar of water  it was very pleasant while it lasted butand its a pitythe music has stopped he said what we are now listening to is the turmoil of a canadian river  laura laughed though there was a wistfulness in her eyes oh i understand but couldnt you have let me forget it just for tonight she said i suppose that privilege was permitted to cinderella  the man felt curiously sorry for her as he remembered how hard her life was at the lonely ranch but he knew she would not be pleased if he expressed his thoughts  well he observed reflectively a thing often looks most attractive when its forbidden you or a long way off and you see there are always compensations in fact im beginning to come across quite a few of them  he broke off for a moment and laura who noticed that he looked at her fancied she understood in what direction his thoughts were drifting but he went on again with a laugh  after all he said there are exiles who realize that they are in various ways better off than in all probability they would have been had they stayed in the land they were driven out of  ah answered laura would you go back if you were given the opportunity  no nasmyth asserted slowly i dont think i should do thatnow  again she understood him the more clearly because she saw by the slight wrinkling of his forehead during the significant pause that he had grappled with the question she did not think he was altogether in love with her but she knew at least that he did not wish to go away while she was left behind in canada it seemed desirable to change the subject and she touched the lace  i have to thank you for this she said it has given me pleasure thenand the words were wholly unpremeditatedshe added i wanted to look welljust for oncetonight  she was sorry a moment later when she saw the quick change in the mans expression for she remembered that they had always seemed to understand what the other meant it was clear that the qualification just for once had not misled him but after all it seemed to her that he must presently realize that the admission was not one a reticent woman really in love with him would have made  oh he said you are always beautiful then his manner became deprecatory i didnt think youd mind in one way what i owe you makes me a privileged person i felt that i could venture  this too was clear to her and though she considered his attitude the correct one it jarred a little upon her she was content that they should be merely comrades or at least that was what she had endeavoured to convince herself but after all there was no reason why he should emphasize the fact  yes she replied quickly i think i understand then once more she changed the subject i want to compliment you on building the dam  nasmyth laughed but there was a light in his eyes i should never have built it if it hadnt been for you stilland he made her a reverent bowi owe you a good deal more than that  laura made no response to this she had thrilled at his achievement when she had heard the managers speech and it became still plainer that there was a certain hazard in dwelling upon his success she could also be practical  in one way she said i suppose the result was not quite so satisfactory  it certainly wasnt of course the work is not quite completed yet but after settling up everything the interim payment left me with about fifteen dollars in hand  laura was not astonished at this but she was more than a little perplexed for she fancied that the lace she was wearing must have cost a good deal more than fifteen dollars still she had no wish to make it evident that he had been extravagant and while she considered the matter a man appeared in the doorway  i guess you two have got to come right out he said what dyou figure you were asked here for  nasmyth held his arm out but when laura would have laid her hand upon it the man broke in with a grin  no sir he said severely miss waynefleets going right round now youre coming along with me and well show them how to waltz  laura smiled goodhumouredly and he swept her into the dance while nasmyth was seized upon by a girl who drove him through it much as she did her brothers steers in the bush  a bump or two dont count for much what you want to do is to hump yourself and make things hum said nasmyths partner when another couple jostled them  nasmyth expressed his concurrence in a gasp and contrived to save her from another crash but when the dance was over he felt limp and was conscious that his partner was by no means satisfied with him  im sorry he said still i really think i did what i could  the girl regarded him half compassionately well she said it wasnt very much but i guess you played yourself out building that blamed dam     chapter viii  by combat   nasmyths partner condescended as she said to give him another show but he escaped from that dance with only a few abrasions and though he failed to obtain another with laura he contrived to enjoy himself all his bush friends were not primitive some of them had once played their parts in much more brilliant functions they had cultivated tastes and he had learned to recognize the strong points of those who had not after all kindly hearts count for much and it was not unnatural that like other exiles who have plodded up and down that rugged land he should think highly of the hardhanded men and patient women who willingly offer a nights shelter and a share of their dried apples salt pork and grindstone bread to the penniless wanderer  what was more to the purpose a number of the guests at the dance had swung the axe by his side and fought the river with him when the valley was filled with the roar of water  they had done their work gallantly when it seemed out of the question that they would ever receive the money he had promised them from sheer pride in their manhood and to keep their word and now they danced as determinedly  there are no cramping conventions and very few shamsand the shams in those forests it must be confessed are as a rule imported ones in fact there was that evening among all those in the pulpmill only one man who seemed to disassociate himself from the general goodwill that man was waynefleet he wore his old velvet jacket as a cloak of superciliousnessor at least that was how it seemed to the bushranchers who recognized and resented an effete pride in the squeak of his very ancient lacquered shoes it is possible that he did not mean to make himself in any way offensive and merely desired to indicate that he was graciously willing to patronize their bucolic festivities there would have been something almost pathetic in his carefully preserved dignity had it not been so obtrusively out of place and when they stood watching him for a moment or two gordon expressed nasmyths thoughts  how a man of that kind ever came to be laura waynefleets father is more than i can figure out he said its a question that worries me every time i look at him guess she owes everything to her mother and mrs waynefleet must have been a mighty patient woman  nasmyth smiled but gordon went on reflectively you folks show your sense when you dump your freaks into this country he said it never seems to strike you that its a little rough on us whats the matter with men like waynefleet is that you cant teach them sense id have told him what i thought of him once or twice when i saw the girl doing his work up at the ranch if id figured it would have made any impression  i expect it would have been useless remarked nasmyth after all im not sure that its exactly your business  gordon watched laura waynefleet as she swung through a waltz on the arm of a sinewy rancher and his eyes softened curiously  only on the girls account he admitted im sorry for her stills the blamed old image isnt actively unkind  then he saw the sudden contraction of nasmyths face and turned toward him now he said i want you to understand this thing if it would be any comfort to her id let miss waynefleet wipe her boots on me and in one way thats about all im fit for i know enough to realize that shed never waste a moment thinking of a man like me even if i hadnt in another way done for myself already  still nasmyth replied quietly some women can forgive a good deal  gordons face hardened and he seemed to straighten himself well there are menany way in this countrywho have too much grit in them to go crawling broken to any womans feet and to expect her to pick them up and mend them now you have heard me and i guess you understand  nasmyth merely made a little gesture of sympathy after all he had the average englishmans reticence and the free speech of that country still jarred upon him now and then he knew what gordon had meant to impress on him and he was touched by generosity of the motive but for all that he felt relieved when gordon abruptly moved away he danced another dance and then sauntered towards the dynamo room where the manager had set up a keg or two of heady ontario cider several men were refreshing themselves there but they did not see him when he approached the door  the only thing thats out of tone about this show is waynefleet said one of them who had once worked for the rancher what do we want that blamed old deadbeat round here for when he cant speak to anyone but the crown landagent and the mill manager  one of the others laughed but nasmyth saw venomous hatred in the big axemans face it was however not his business and waynefleet was a man for whom he had no great liking he was about to turn away when the chopper went on again  waynefleets a blamed old thief as everybody knows he said him being what he is i guess you couldnt blame his daughter  nasmyth whom they had not noticed yet could not quite hear what followed but when somebody flung a sharp incredulous question at the speaker he stood fast in the doorway with one hand clenched  well said the man with a suggestive grin what i means quite plain is there any other girl round this settlement whod make up to that dambuilder as shes doing and slip quietly into his shanty alone  nasmyth never learned what grievance against waynefleet or his daughter had prompted this virulence nor did it appear to matter there was just sufficient foundation for the mans insinuation to render it perilous if it was once permitted to pass unchallenged and nasmyth realized that any attempt to handle the affair delicately was not likely to be successful he was afterwards greatly astonished that he could think clearly and impose a certain command upon himself but he understood exactly what it was most advisable for him to do and he set about it with a curious cold quietness which served his purpose well  there was a gasp of astonishment from one of the group as he stepped forward into the light and looked with steady eyes at the man who had spoken  jake he said you are a d liar  it was what the others had expected and they rose and stood back a little from the pair watching expectantly for they recognized that the affair was serious and though nasmyth had their sympathy an impartial attitude was the correct one now jake was tall and lean and muscular but perhaps the dambuilders quietness disconcerted him or his bitterness had only extended to the rancher  now jake growled you light out of this i dont know that ive anything againstyou  nasmyth had his back to the door and he did not see the grizzled mattawa who was supposed to be one of the strongest choppers about the settlement standing a little behind him and watching him and jake attentively still one of the others did and made a sign to mattawa that any support he might feel disposed to offer his employer would not be tolerated in the meanwhile nasmyth however realized that there was only one course open to him and he drew back one hand as he met the uneasy eyes of the man in front of him  you are going to back down on what you said he asked with incisive quietness  not a d word the other man assured him  then said nasmyth you must take the consequences  he swung forward on his left foot and there was a thud as his scarred knuckles landed heavily in the middle of the detractors face he struck with an unexpected swiftness and all the force that was in him for he had learned that the rules of the trial by combat are by no means so hard and fast in british columbia as they are in england as a matter of fact it is not very frequently resorted to there but when men do fight their one object is to disable their opponents as soon as possible and by any means available  jake reeled backwards a pace or two and the spectators said afterwards there was no reason why nasmyth should have permitted him to recover himself as he did two axes which the carpenters had been using stood against the wall and jake caught up the nearest of them he swung the gleaming blade high while the blood trickled from his cut lips and the swollen veins rose on his forehead this however was going further than the others considered admissible and there was a protesting shout while one sturdy fellow cautiously slid along the wall to get in behind the man who had the axe  still for a second or two which might have proved fatal to him nasmyth had only his own resources to depend upon and he did the one thing that was possible the canadian axehaft is long and he sprang straight in at the man as he did so the big blade came down and flashed by a hands breadth behind his shoulders he felt a burning pain on the outside of his thigh but that did not seem to matter and he was clutching at his opponents throat when he was bodily flung aside then as he fell against the log wall he had a momentary glimpse of jake bent backwards in mattawas arms there was a brief floundering scuffle as the two men reeled towards the black opening in the wall and after that a splash in the darkness outside and mattawa stepped back into the room alone  the d hog is in the flume he said  that did not appear to trouble any of the others the sluice was not deep and though it was certainly running hard it was scarcely likely that a stalwart bushman would suffer greatly from being washed along it  guess it will cool him off said one of them if it doesnt and he comes back to make a fuss well heave him in again  then they turned and looked at nasmyth who sat down somewhat limply on a cider keg the blood which was running down his leg made a little pool at his feet mattawa who crossed over to him asked for a knife and when a man produced one he slit nasmyths trousers up to the hip then he nodded  boys he said one of you will slip out kind of quiet and bring mr gordon along two more of you will stand in the door there and not let anybody in  they obeyed him and mattawa looked down at nasmyth again  i guess the things not serious he commented  well said nasmyth ruefully in one way i think it is you see store clothes are dear and this is the only pair of trousers ive got  there was a little laugh from the others and he knew he had done wisely when they clumsily expressed their satisfaction at his escape he had at least discredited jake and it was evident that if the man made any more assertions of a similar nature which was very unlikely no one would listen to them  in the meanwhile nobody else seemed to be aware that anything unusual was going on all had happened in a minute or two and the clanging of the fiddle and the patter of the dancers feet had drowned any sound that rose from the dynamoroom nasmyth had not long to wait before gordon stepped in and quietly set about his surgical work after someone had dipped up a little water from the sluice  yes said gordon its quite a nice clean slice and i guess its not going to trouble you much though you wont walk very far for a week or two as soon as we can get you to the dam ill put a proper dressing on then he looked up sharply in the meanwhile i dont quite see how you cut yourself like that  as a matter of fact i didnt said nasmyth with evident reluctance i suppose you will have to be told he looked round at the others boys i particularly dont want this thing to go any further  he related what had happened and one of the men stood up i wouldnt worry over that he replied were not going to talk and if jake does one of us will pound a little sense into him now ill slip out and get hightons team  after that they gave nasmyth some cider and a few minutes later he limped out through the opening in the wall and across the plank they laid above the sluice to the waiting waggon it was not far to the dam and before very long gordon was back again at the mill it naturally happened though he was anxious to avoid her that laura waynefleet was the first person who accosted him  have you seen mr nasmyth she asked  oh yes said gordon i saw him a little while ago you are wanting him  laura laughed i believed i promised him another dance its a little curious he hasnt come for it  in one way its deplorably bad taste  the girl was quick to notice that his gaze was not quite frank and he winced when for a moment she laid her hand upon his arm for he saw the veiled anxiety in her eyes  something has been going on she said you dont want to tell me where mr nasmyth is  he has just gone back to the dam he got hurta trifling cutnothing more than that still i insisted on tying it up  ah cried laura sharply you evidently dont wish me to know how he got it  it is just what i dont mean to do any way its not worth while troubling about nasmyths injury isnt in the least serious  it doesnt seem to strike you that i could ask him myself  gordon would have liked to warn her to keep away from the dam but he did not see how it could be done unless he offered some reason and that was a thing he shrank from  oh yes he said you certainly could then he glanced down at her hands those are unusually pretty gloves you have on  his answer was as it happened almost as injudicious as he could have rendered it since it left the girl determined to sift the matter thoroughly she however only smiled just then  i think there isnt a nicer pair of gloves in canada than these she said  gordon took himself away wondering what she could have meant by that and laura waited until next day when although there was as usual a good deal to be done about the ranch she went down to find out what was the matter with nasmyth  the injured man was sitting in his shanty with his foot upon a chair but he rose when she came in and stood leaning rather hard upon the table  it is very kind of you to come he said taking her hand he made shift to limp to the door whence he called for mattawa  bring those two chairs out tom and put them in the sun he said  the old axeman shook his head severely you sit right down again what in the name of wonder are you on your legs for any way he asked then he saw laura and made a little gesture of resignation well i guess it will have to be done  the sudden change in his attitude was naturally not lost upon the girl but she kept her astonishment to herself and waited until mattawa had made nasmyth as comfortable as possible then she turned to him  i am very sorry you are hurt she said i understand it was an axe cut how did it happen  nasmyth appeared to reflect well he answered i suppose i was a little carelessin fact i must have been you see some of the building gang had left their axes in the dynamoroom  that said laura dryly certainly accounts for the axe being there im not sure it goes very much further  it really wasnt very much of a cut nasmyths desire to escape from the topic was a trifle too plain as he added isnt it nice out here  it occurred to laura that it was uncomfortably cold for there was a nip of frost in the air though the sun hung coppery red above the sombre pines  i almost fancied you were not overjoyed to see me she remarked  nasmyth appeared momentarily embarrassed but his expression suddenly changed and laura felt a faint thrill when he laid his hand upon her arm  that he said is a fancy you must never entertain again  in one respect laura was fully satisfied and though there was still a great deal upon which she meant to be enlightened she talked about other matters for almost half an hour and then rose with a little shiver  i must get back to the settlement where i have left the team she said and glanced down at him for a moment with solicitude in her eyes you will be very careful  nasmyth let her go but he did not know that she signed to mattawa who was then busy hewing out a big redwood log the axeman strolled after her into the bush and then stopped to look hard at her as he uttered an inquiring well  tom said the girl cant you understand that it would be very much wiser if somebody told me exactly how mr nasmyth got hurt  the axeman nodded yes he admitted with a wink thats just how it strikes me and im going to the boss has no more arms and legs than hes a use for anyway  laura gazed at him in bewilderment but the mans expression was perfectly grave now he added i guess one can talk straight sense to you and the fact is i cant have you coming round here again just listen about two minutes and ill try to make the thing clear to you  he did so with a certain graphic force that she had not expected from him and the colour crept into her cheeks then to mattawas astonishment she smiled  thank you she said simply but the other man  well replied mattawa if he goes round talking somebody will most pound the life out of him  then he swung round abruptly for he was shrewd and had his primitive notions of delicacy and laura went on through the stillness of the bush with a curious softness in her eyes mattawa had been terse and in some respects his observations had not been tactful but nobody could have impressed her more in nasmyths favour indeed at the moment she scarcely remembered how the aspersions jake had made might affect herself as it happened she met gordon near the settlement and he stopped a moment he had come upon her suddenly and had looked at her with a suggestive steadiness but she smiled  yes she said i have been to the dam after the way in which you made it evident that you didnt want me to go there it was perhaps no more than you could have expected  ah rejoined gordon with a look of anxiety you probably got hold of mattawa well after all i guess he has done the wise thing then after a pause he observed there is very little the matter with your courage  i fancy observed laura half wistfully that is in several respects fortunate  then she went on again and though gordon felt exceedingly compassionate he frowned and closed one hand  its a sure thing ill have to tell waynefleet what kind of a man he is he said     chapter ix  gordon speaks his mind   it was a nipping morning and the clearing outside the ranch was flecked with patches of frozen snow when waynefleet sat shivering in a hide chair beside the stove the broken viands upon the table in front of him suggested that he had just made a tolerable breakfast but his pose was expressive of limp resignation and one could have fancied from the look in his thin face that he was feeling very sorry for himself selfpity in fact was rather a habit of his and perhaps because of it he had usually very little pity to spare for anybody else he looked up when flushed and gasping his daughter came in with two heavy pails of water she shivered visibly  it would be a favour if you would shut that door as soon as you can said waynefleet as i fancy i have mentioned this cold goes right through me it occurred to me that you might have come in a little earlier to see if i was getting my breakfast properly  laura who glanced at the table thought that he had acquitted himself reasonably well but she refrained from pointing out the fact and after shutting the door crossed the room to her storecupboard and took out a can of fruit which she had set aside for another purpose waynefleet watched her open it and made a little sign of impatience  you are very clumsy this morning he said  the girls hands were wet and stiff with cold but she quietly laid another plate upon the table before she answered him  charly is busy in the slashing and i dont want to take him away but there are those logs in the wet patch that ought to be hauled out now the ground is hard she said i suppose you dont feel equal to doing it today  no said waynefleet with querulous incisiveness it is quite out of the question do i look like a man who could reasonably be expected to undertake anything of that kind just now  it occurred to laura that he did not look as if there was very much the matter with him and she stood still a minute considering as gordon had said it was she who managed the ranch and she recognized that it was desirable that the trees in question should be dragged out of the soft ground while the frost lasted still there was the baking and washing and it would be late at night before she could accomplish half she wished to do if she undertook the task in question while she thought over it her father spoke again  i wish you would sit down he said i feel i must have quietness and your restless habits jar upon me horribly  that decided her and slipping into her own room she put on an old blanket coat and went out quietly she walked through the orchard to the little log stable where the working oxen stood and after patting the patient beasts shackled a heavy chain to the yoke she laid upon their brawny necks then picking up a handspike she led them out and for an hour walked beside them tapping them with a long pointed stick while they dragged the big logs out of the swamp now and then it taxed all her strength to lift the thinner end of a log on the chainsling with a handspike but she contrived to do it until at length one heavier than the others proved too much for her she could hear the ringing of the hired mans axe across the clearing but there was a great deal for him to do and taking up the handspike again she strained at it  she heard footsteps behind her and she straightened herself suddenly she turned and saw gordon watching her with a curious smile tall and straight and supple with a ruddy halfguilty glow on her face she stood near the middle of the little gap in the bush the big dappled oxen close at her side the wintry sunlight which struck upon her tinted the old blanket dress a shining ochre and the loose tress of redgold hair which had escaped from beneath her little fur cap struck a dominant tone of glowing colour among the pale reds and russets of the firtrunks and withered fern  gordon shook his head reproachfully sit down a minute or two and ill heave that log on to the sling he said this is not the kind of thing you ought to be doing  laura who was glad of the excuse sat down on one of the logs while the man leaned against a fir and gravely regarded her  the work must be done by somebody and my father is apparently not very well again she explained charly has his hands full in the slashing we must get it cleaned up if it is to be ploughed this spring  nasmyth contrived to look after all these things why didnt you keep him the man didnt want to go away  the colour deepened in lauras face and gordon who saw it made a sign of comprehension well he added i suppose that wasnt a thing one could expect you to tell me though i dont quite see why you shouldnt think of yourself now and then you know it wasnt on your own account you sent him away  how does this concern you she asked  gordon flung one hand out ah he said how does it concern me then he seemed to lay a restraint upon himself well it does in one sense anyway after all i am a doctor and a friend of yours and im going to warn you against attempting things women werent meant to do if that doesnt prove efficacious ill say a word or two to nasmyth and youll have him back here again its a sure thing your father would be glad to get him  if you do i shall never forgive you warned laura with a flash in her eyes  she was sorry she had spoken so plainly when she saw that gordon winced she had guessed more or less correctly what the man felt for her and she had no wish to pain him except for that however the admission she had made did not greatly matter since she fancied that he was quite aware why she had sent nasmyth away gordon changed the subject abruptly  there are very few of those blanket dresses this side of the rockies he said you probably got it back east  the girls eyes had a wistful look as she answered we spent our first winter in montreal and we had some friends who were very kind to us i like to look back upon those first few months in canada  gordon nodded oh yes he replied i knowsleighrides snowshoe meets skatingrinks tobogganslides quite as lively as a london season and considerably more invigorating i guess youve been through that too in one way its a pity you didnt stay in montreal  he saw her sudden embarrassment and fancied that she could have stayed there if she had wished to do so but he felt that he must speak frankly and he shook his head severely  do you never think of your own advantage at all he inquired have you none of the ambitions that most women seem to have  arent you forgetting laura asked with sudden quietness my father found it would not be advisable for him to settle in montrealfor the same reason that afterwards led us to leave victoriaand we went west perhaps he could have faced the trouble and lived it down but i could not leave him alone  gordon sat silent a moment or two he knew though she very rarely mentioned it how heavy was the burden that had been laid upon her and he was divided between a great pity for her and anger against her father then he rose slowly to his feet  miss waynefleet he said if i have said anything that hurt you im sorry but there are times when i must talk i feel i have to in the meanwhile ill heave those logs up on a skid so that you can slip the chain round them  for the next halfhour he exerted himself savagely and when at last he dropped the handspike his face was damp with perspiration he smiled grimly when laura who had hauled one or two of the logs away came back tapping the plodding oxen  now he said im going in to see your father custer happened to tell me he was feeling low again and its going to afford me a good deal of pleasure to prescribe for him  he swung off his wide hat and when he turned away laura wondered with a few misgivings what had brought the little snap into his eyes three or four minutes later he entered the house where waynefleet lay beside the stove with a cigar in his hand  i ran across custer at the settlement and i came along to see how you were keeping said gordon  waynefleet held out a cigarbox make yourself comfortable he answered hospitably well have dinner a little earlier than usual  the sight of the label on the box came near rousing gordon to an outbreak of indignation im not going to stay he declared it seems to me miss waynefleet has about enough to do already  he saw waynefleet raise his eyebrows and he added i guess its not worth while troubling to point out that its not my affair now if youll get ahead with your symptoms  waynefleet looked hard at him for a moment the older man was not accustomed to being addressed in that brusque fashion and it jarred upon him but as a matter of fact he was not feeling well and as he not infrequently pointed out he had discovered that one had to put up with many unpleasant things in that barbarous country he described his symptoms feelingly and was rather indignant when gordon expressed neither astonishment nor sympathy  thats all right said gordon the things quite plainespecially the general lassitude you complain of the trouble is that if you dont make an effort its going to become chronic  again waynefleet looked at him in astonishment for gordons tone was very suggestive  yes added the medical adviser its a complaint a good many men who havent been raised to work are afflicted with well ill mix you up a tonic and youll drive down for it yourself the thing wont be half as efficacious if you send the hired man then youll set to every morning soon as breakfasts over and do a couple of hours smart chopping for a week by that time youll find it easy and you can go on an hour or two in the afternoon nobody round here will recognize you if you keep it up for the next three months  waynefleets thin face grew red but gordons imperturbable demeanour restrained him from betraying his indignation  you dont understand that i couldnt swing an axe for five minutes together he objected  the trouble answered gordon is that you dont want to  waynefleet made an attempt to rise but his companion laid a hand upon his arm and pressed him down again  you were anxious for my advice and now im going to prescribe gordon continued two hours steady chopping every day to be raised by degrees to six then id let up on smoking cigars of that kind and practise a little more selfdenial in one or two other respects you could make things easier for miss waynefleet with the money you save  he rose with a laugh well im going all you have to do is to carry out my suggestions and you may still make yourself and your ranch a credit to the district in the meanwhile this place would be considerably improved by a little ventilation  he went out and left waynefleet gazing in indignant astonishment at the door he carefully fixed open it seemed to waynefleet almost incredible that such words should have been spoken to him and the suggestion that at the cost of a painful effort he should endeavour to make himself a credit to that barbarous neighbourhood rankled most of all he had felt hitherto that he had conferred a favour on the community by settling there he lay still until his daughter came in and glanced at him inquiringly  you have seen mr gordon she queried  i have answered waynefleet with fine disdain you will understand that if he comes back here he must be kept away from me the man is utterly devoid of refinement or consideration  in the meanwhile gordon was riding circumspectly down the rutted trail and it was an hour later when he dismounted at the shanty of nasmyths workmen and shared a meal with the gang employed on the dam after that he sat with nasmyth who still limped a little in the hut from which as the door stood open they could see the men stream up into the bush and out along the dam the dam now stood high above the waterlevel for the frost had bound fast the feeding snow upon the peaks above though the stream roared and frothed through the two big sluicegates byandby the ringing of axes and the clink of drills broke through the sound of the rushing waters gordon who stretched himself out on a deerhide lounge smiled at nasmyth as he lighted his pipe  ive been talking a little sense to waynefleet this morning i felt i had to though im afraid its not going to be any use he announced  whether you were warranted or not is of course another matter said nasmyth perhaps you were if you did it on miss waynefleets account anyway i dont altogether understand why you should be sure it will have no effect  gordon looked at him with a grin well he remarked oracularly its easy to acquire an inflated notion of ones own importance though its quite often a little difficult to keep it somethings very apt to come along and prick you and you collapse flat when it lets the inflation out in some cases one never quite gets ones selfsufficiency back the scar the prick made is always there but its different with waynefleet he is made of selfclosing jelly and when you take the knife out the gap shuts up again its quite hard to fancy it was ever there  nasmyth nodded gravely for there was an elusive something in his comrades tone that roused his sympathy  gordon he said is it quite impossible for you to go back east again  gordon leaned back in his chair and glanced out across the toiling men upon the dam at the frothing river and rugged hillside with a look of longing in his eyes  in one way it is but i want you to understand he replied i might begin again in some desolate little townbut i aimed higherand was once very nearly getting there as it is if i made my mark the thing i did would be remembered against me well let it go as a surgeon of any account im done for  still its a tolerably big country and folks forget you might at least go so far and that would after all give you a good deala competence the right to marry  gordon laughed but his voice was harsh  this is one of the days on which i must talk i feel like that now and then he said then he looked at nasmyth hard well ive seen the one woman i could marry and its certain that if i dare make her the offer she would never marry me  ah said nasmyth you seem quite sure of that  quite declared gordon and there was for a moment or two an almost uncomfortable silence in the shanty  then he made a little forceful gesture as he turned to his companion again  well he said after all what does it count for is it mans one and only business to marry somebody of course we have folks back east who seem to act on that belief and in your country half of them appear to spend their time and energies philandering  i dont think its half said nasmyth dryly  its not a point of any importance and well let it go anyway it seems perilously easy for a man who gets the woman he sets his mind upon to sink into a fireside hog in the civilized world now and then when things go wrong with folks of that kind they come out here and nobody has any use for them what can you do with the man who gets sick the first time he sleeps in the rain and cant do without his dinner oh i know all about the preservation of the species but west of the great lakes weve no room for any species that isnt tough and fit  he broke off for a moment after all this is the single mans country andweknow that it demands from him the best that he was given from the grimmest toil of his body to the keenest effort of his brain marriage is a detailan incident were here to fight to grapple with the wilderness and to break it in and that burden wasnt laid upon us only for the good of ourselves when weve flung our trestles over the rivers and blown room for the steel track out of the cañons side the oatfields and the orchards creep up the valleys and the men from the cities set up their mills prospector tracklayer chopper follow in sequence here and then were ready to hold out our hands to the thousands youve no use or food for back yonder im not sure it matters that the men who do the work dont often share the results of it we bury them beside our bridge trestles and under tons of shattered rock and perhaps when their time comes some of them arent sorry to have done with it anyway theyve stood up to mans primeval task  he rose with another halfdeprecatory laugh but his eyes snapped you dont talk like that in your countryit would hurt some of youbut if we spread ourselves now and then you can look round and see the things we do then he touched nasmyths shoulder oh yes you understandfor somebody has taught youand byandby youre going to feel the thing getting hold of you  he moved towards the doorway but turned as he reached it talkings cheap and i have several dozen blamed big firs to saw up as well as waynefleets tonic to mix hell come along for it when that prick i gave him commences to heal     chapter x  the calling caÑon   there were four wet and weary men in the siwash canoe that nasmyth who crouched astern had just shot across the whirling pool with the back feathering stroke of his paddle which is so difficult to acquire tom from mattawa grasping a dripping pole stood up in the bow gordon and wheeler the pulpmill manager knelt in the middle of the boat wheelers hands were blistered from gripping the paddlehaft and his knees were raw where he had pressed them against the bottom of the craft to obtain a purchase it was several years since he had undertaken any severe manual labour though he was by no means unused to it and he was cramped and aching in every limb he had plied pole or paddle for eight hours during which his companions had painfully propelled the craft a few miles into the cañon he gasped with relief when mattawa ran the bow of the canoe in upon the shingle and then rose and stretched himself wearily the four men stepped ashore curiously they looked about them for they had had little opportunity for observation those who undertake to pole a canoe up the rapids of a river on the pacific slope usually find it advisable to confine their attention strictly to the business in hand  immediately in front of them the river roared and seethed amid giant boulders which rose out of a tumultuous rush of foam but while it was clearly beyond the power of flesh and blood to drive the canoe up against the current a strip of shingle also strewn with boulders and broken by ledges of dripping rock divided the water from the wall of the cañon the cañon a tremendous slope of rock with its dark crest overhanging them ran up high above their heads but they could see the pines clinging to the hillside which rose from the edge of the other wall across the river so steep that it appeared impossible to find a foothold upon it  the four men were down in the bottom of a great rift in the hills and though it would be day above for at least two hours the light was faint in the hollow and dimmed by drifting mist it was a spot from which a man new to that wild country might well have shrunk and the roar of water rang through it in tremendous nervetaxing pulsations nasmyth and his companions however had gone there with no particular purposemerely for relaxationthough it had cost them hours of arduous labour and the journey had been a more or less hazardous one wheeler the pulpmill manager was waiting for his machinery and nasmyth had finished the dam when they planned the journey for pleasure mattawa and gordon had gone with them ostensibly on a shooting trip there are game laws which set forth when and where a man may shoot and how many heads he is entitled to but it must be admitted that the bushrancher seldom concerns himself greatly about them when he fancies a change of diet he goes out and kills a deer still though all the party had rifles no one would have cared very much if they had not come across anything to shoot at  now and then a vague unrest comes upon the bushman and he sets off for the wilderness and stays there while his provisions hold out he usually calls it prospecting but as a rule he comes back with his garments rent to tatters and no record of any mineral claim or timber rights but once more contentedly he goes on with his task it may be a reawakening of forgotten instincts halfconscious lust of adventure or a mere desire for change that impels him to make the journey but it is at least an impulse with which most men who toil in those forests are well acquainted  nasmyth and mattawa pulled the canoe out and when they sat down and lighted their pipes wheeler grinned as he drew up his duck trousers and surveyed his knees which were raw and bleeding then he held up one of his hands that his comrades might notice the blisters upon it he was a little wiry man with dark eyes which had a snap in them  well he observed were here and i guess any man with sense enough to prefer whole bones to broken ones would wonder why we are its most twelve years since i used to head off into the bush this way in washington  gordon glanced at him with a twinkle in his eyes now he observed youve hit the reason the first time when youve done it once youll do it again you have to perhaps its natures protest against your axiom that mans chief business is dollarmaking still im admitting that this is a blamed curious place for nasmyth to figure on killing a wapiti in say are you going to sleep here tonight derrick  it was very evident that none of the big wapitielks as the bushman incorrectly calls themcould have reached that spot but nasmyth laughed  i felt id like to see the falli dont know why he said its scarcely another mile and ive been up almost that far with an indian before theres a ravine with young spruce in it where we could sleep  then announced wheeler resolutely were starting right now when i pole a canoe up a place of this kind i want to see where im going i once went down a big rapid with the canoebottom up in front of me in the dark and one journey of that kind is quite enough  they dumped out their camp gear and took hold of the canoe a beautifully modelled fragile thing hollowed out of a cedar log and for the next halfhour hauled it laboriously over some sixty yards of boulders and pushed it walking waistdeep across rockstrewn pools then they went back for their wet tent axes rifles blankets and a bag of flour and when they had reloaded the canoe they took up the poles again it was the hardest kind of work and demanded strength and skill for a very small blunder would have meant wreck upon some frothlapped boulder or an upset into the fierce white rush of the river but at length they reached a deep whirling pool round which long smears of white froth swung in wild gyrations the smooth rock rose out of the pool without even a cranny one could slip a hand into and the river fell tumultuously over a ledge into the head of it the water swept out of a veil of thin white mist and the great rift rang with a bewildering din one felt that the vast primeval forces were omnipotent there as the men looked about them with the spray on their wet faces and the white mist streaming by mattawa who stood up forward dropped suddenly into the bottom of the canoe  in poles he said paddle get a move on her nasmyth who felt his pole dip into empty water flung it in and grabbed his paddle for the craft shot forward suddenly with the swing of the eddy towards the fall he did not know whether the stream would sweep them under it but he was not desirous of affording it the opportunity for perhaps a minute they exerted themselves furiously gasping as they strained aching arms and backs and meanwhile in spite of them beneath the towering fall of rock the canoe slid on toward the fall it also drew a little nearer to the middle of the pool where there was a curious bevelled hollow round which the white foam spun it seemed to nasmyth that the stream went bodily down  paddle said mattawa hoarsely heave her clear of it  they drove furiously between the whitestreaked shoot of the fall and that horribly suggestive whirling then as they went back towards the outrush from the pool they made another desperate gasping effort for several moments it seemed that they must be swept back again and then they gained a little and with a few more strokes reached the edge of the rapid they let the canoe drive down the rapid while the boulders flashed by them for there was the same desire in all of them and that was to get as far as possible away from that horrible pool at last mattawa standing up forward poled the canoe in where a deep ravine rent the dark rocks side and the party went ashore wet and gasping wheeler looked back up the gorge and solemnly shook his head  if you want to see any more of it youve got to do it alone ive had enough he declared a man who runs a pulpmill has no use for paddling under that kind of fall im not going back again  mattawa and gordon set the tent up in the hollow of the ravine while wheeler hewed off spruce branches with which to make the beds but nasmyth did nothing to assist any of them thinking hard he sat on a boulder with his unlighted pipe in his hand the throbbing roar of water rang about him and it was then that the great project crept into his mind it was rapidly growing dark in the bottom of the great rift but he could still see the dim white flashing of the fall and the vast wall of rock and rugged hillside that ran up in shadowy grandeur high above his head and as he gazed at it all he felt his heart throb fast he was conscious of a curious thrill as he watched and listened to that clash of stupendous forces the river had spent countless ages cutting out that channel hurling down mighty boulders and streamdriven shingle upon the living rock but it was it seemed to him within mans power to alter it in a few arduous months he sat very still astonished at the daring of his own conception until wheeler strolled up to him  how much does the river drop at the fall he asked  about eight feet in the fall itself answered wheeler seems to me it falls much more in the rush above still i cant say i noticed it particularlyi had something else to think about  its a short rapid remarked nasmyth reflectively there is no doubt a great deal of the hardest kind of rock under it which is in one or two respects unfortunate i suppose you dont know very much about geology  i dont confessed the pulpmiller machines are my specialty  well said nasmyth im afraid i dont either and i believe one or two of these cañons have puzzled wiser folks than i you see the general notion is that the rivers made them but it doesnt seem quite reasonable to imagine a river tilting at a solid range and splitting it through the middle in fact it seems to me that some of the cañons were there already and the rivers just ran into them one or two indians have come down from the valley close to the fall and they told me the river was quite deep there the rock just holds it up at the fall its a natural dama dyke i think they call it  i dont quite understand what all this is leading to observed wheeler  nasmyth laughed though there was as his companion noticed a curious look in his eyes ill try to make it clearer when we get into the valley were going there tomorrow  it was almost dark now and they went back together to the little fire that burned redly among the spruces in the ravine there mattawa and gordon had a simple supper ready the others stretched themselves out rolled in their blankets soon after they had eaten but nasmyth lay propped up on one elbow wide awake listening to the roar of water until well into the night the stream drowned the faint rustling of the spruces in a great dominant note and he set his lips as he recognized its depth of tone and volume he had once more determined to pit all his strength of mind and body against the river still he went to sleep at last and awakening some time after it was dawn on the heights above roused his comrades when breakfast was over he started with them up the ravine to cross the range  it was afternoon before they accomplished the climb though the height was not great and a ravine pierced the crest and they had rent most of their clothes to tatters when they scrambled down the slope into the valley those pineshrouded hillsides are strewn with mighty fallen trees amid which the tangled underbrush grows tall and rank and where the pines are less thickly spaced there are usually matted groves of willows if the soil is damp they pitched camp on the edge of the valley and gordon and nasmyth prepared supper while wheeler cut firewood and mattawa went out to prospect for the tracks of feeding deer the axeman came back to say there were no signs of any wapiti though the little bush deer were evidently about and it was decided to try for one that night with the pitlight a mode of shooting now and then adopted when the deer are shy  they ate their supper and afterwards lay down with their blankets rolled about them for it grew very cold as darkness crept up the valley like most of the other valleys this one was walled in by steepsided pineshrouded hills but in this case there were no trees in the bottom of it which while very narrow appeared several miles long it was also nearly level and the river wound through it in deep still bends there are not many valleys in that country in which heavy timber fails to grow and those within reach of a market have been seized upon for all ranch produce is in excellent demand and the clearing of virgin forest is a singularly arduous task in fact there was only one reason why this strip of natural prairie had not already been claimed most of it was swamp nasmyth who was quieter than usual watched the filmy mist creep about it as the soft darkness rolled down the hillsides  gordon rose and hooked a pitlight into his hat this pitlight consists simply of a little open minerslamp which has fixed beneath it a shield cut out of any convenient meatcan the lamp is filled with seal oil once a man has fastened it upon his head the light is cut off from his person so that he stands invisible and the little flame appears unsupported deer of any kind are endued with an inquisitiveness which frequently leads to their destruction and when they notice the twinkling light flitting through the air they approach it to ascertain the reason for such an unusual thing then the rancher shoots as soon as their shining eyes become visible  the party divided gordon and nasmyth who kept near each other fell over several rotting trees and into what appeared to be crumbling drains they floundered kneedeep through withered timothy which is not a natural grass for an hour or two nobody saw any deer then gordon who was cautiously skirting another drain closed in on nasmyth until he touched his comrade nasmyth heard a crackling rustle among the withered grass gordon made a little abrupt movement  if we both blaze off we double the odds on our getting it he said  nasmyth only just heard him for his heart was beating with excitement but as he stood kneedeep in the grass with both hands ready to pitch the heavy rifle up it seemed to him that mattawa could not have been correct when he said that there were only the bush deer about judging by the noise it was making the approaching beast he thought must be as big as a wapiti then he saw two pale spots of light which seemed curiously high above the ground  im shooting he said and in another moment the butt was into his shoulder  he felt the jar of it but as usual in such cases he heard no detonation though the pale flash from gordons rifle was almost in his eyes he however heard the thud of the heavy bullet and a moment or two later a floundering amidst the grass  that cant be a bush deer he cried  it sounds way more like an elephant said gordon with a gasp  they ran forward until they stopped a few yards short of something very big and shadowy that was still struggling in the grass gordon cautiously crept up a little nearer  those arent deers horns anyway he announced plug it quick the blamed things getting up  nasmyth flung the rifle up to his shoulder and twice jerked a fresh cartridge into the chamber but this time there was silence when the crash of the heavy marlin died away among the woods they crept forward a little further circumspectly until gordon stopped again with a gasp of consternation  well he said i guess it couldnt be either a bush deer or a wapiti  they were still standing there when their comrades came running up and mattawa who took down his light broke into a great hoarse laugh  a steer he said and pointed to a mark on the hide one of custers stock guess hell charge you quite a few dollars for killing it  nasmyth smiled somewhat ruefully for he was by no means burdened with wealth but he was after all not greatly astonished few of the small ranchers can feed their stock entirely on their little patches of cleared land and it is not an unusual thing for most of the herd to run almost wild in the bush now and then the cattle acquire a somewhat perilous fondness for wrecking roadmakers and prospectors tents which explains why a steer occasionally fails to be found and some little community of axemen is provided with more fresh meat than can well be consumed  im afraid its rather more than likely ill have to pay a good price said nasmyth do you feel anxious for any more shooting tonight wheeler  no said the pulpmiller with a grin as he surveyed his bemired clothes guess its going to prove expensive and ive had most enough i dont feel like poling that canoe any farther upriver either whats the matter with camping right where we are until we eat the steer  there was however as mattawa pointed out a good deal to be done before they could make their first meal off the beast and none of them quite relished the task especially as they had only an axe and a couple of moderately long knives still it was done and when they carried a portion of the meat out of the swamp and had gone down to wash in the icy river they went wearily back to their tent among the firs     chapter xi  the great idea   the night was cold and a frostladen wind set the fir branches sighing as nasmyth and his comrades sat about a snapping fire the red light flickered upon their faces and then grew dim again leaving their blurred figures indistinct amid the smoke that diffused pungent aromatic odours as it streamed by and vanished between the towering treetrunks  the four men were of widely different type and training though it was characteristic of the country that they sat and talked together on terms of perfect equality two of them were exiles by fault and misfortune from their natural environment one had forced himself upwards by daring and mechanical genius into a station to which in one sense he did not belong and mattawa the chopper alone pursued the occupation which had always been familiar to him still it was as comrades that they lived together in the wilderness and what was more had they come across one another afterwards in the cities they would have resumed their intercourse on exactly the same footing after all they were in essentials very much the same and when that is the case the barriers men raise between themselves do not count for much in the west at least wheeler the pulpmill builder who had once sold oranges on the railroad cars led up to a conversation that gave nasmyth an opportunity for which he had been waiting  you and mattawa are about through with that slashing contract he said you will not net a great pile of money out of it i suppose  my share is about thirty answered nasmyth with a little laugh my partner draws a few dollars more he got in a week when the big log that rolled on my cut leg lamed me i seem to have a particularly unfortunate habit of hurting myself are you going back to ontario when we get that money mattawa  no the big axeman replied slowly anyway not yet though i was thinking of it the ticket costs too much theyve been shoving up their eastern rates  you ought to have a few dollars in hand remarked nasmyth who was quite aware that this was not exactly his business are you going to start a ranch  mattawa appeared to smile i have one half cleared back in ontario  then what dyou come out here for gordon broke in  to give the boy a show hes quite smart and we were figuring we might make a doctor or a surveyor of him that costs money and wages are way higher here than they are back east  it was a simple statement made very quietly by a simple man but it appealed forcibly to those who heard it for they could understand what lay behind it love of change or adventure it was evident had nothing to do with sending the grizzled mattawa out to the forests of the west he had as he said merely come there that his son might be afforded opportunities that he had never had and this was characteristic for it is not often that the second generation stays on the land though teamsters and choppers to the manner born are busy here and there the canadian prairie is to a large extent broken and the forest driven back by young men from the eastern cities and by exiled englishmen their life is a grim one and when they marry they do not desire their children to continue it yet they do not often marry since the wilderness in most cases would crush the wives they would choose the men toil on alone facing flood and drought and frost and some hate the silence of the winter nights during which they sit beside the stove  then inquired wheeler who runs the ranch  the wife and the boy that is when the boys not chopping or ploughing for somebody  there were reasons why nasmyth was stirred by what he had heard and with his pipe he pointed to mattawa as the flickering firelight fell upon the old axemans face  that he said is the man who didnt want his wages when i offered them to him though he knew it was quite likely he would never get them afterwards unless i built the dam hed been working for me two or three months then in the flooded river most of the while now is there any sense in that kind of man  mattawa appeared disconcerted and his hard face flushed well he explained i felt i had to see you through he hesitated for a moment with a gesture which seemed deprecatory of his point of view it seemed up to me  youve heard him said gordon dryly hes from the desolate bush back east and nobody has taught him to express himself clearly the men of that kind are handiest with the axe and drill but it has always seemed to me that the nations are going to sit round and listen when they get up and speak their mind some day  he saw the smile in nasmyths eyes and turned to wheeler who was from the state of washington its a solid fact that you at least can understand its not so very long since your folks headed west across the ohio and its open to anyone to see what you have done then he flung his hand out towards the east they fancy back yonder were still in the leadingstrings and it doesnt seem to strike them that were growing big and strong  it was characteristic that wheeler did not grin as nasmyth certainly did what gordon had said was no doubt a trifle flamboyant but it expressed the views of others in the west and after all it was more or less warranted mattawa however gazed at them both as if such matters were beyond him and wheeler who turned to nasmyth changed the subject  well he said what are you going to strike next  nasmyth took out his pipe and carefully filled it before he answered for he knew that his time had come and he desired greatly to carry his comrades along with him  i have he said quietly a notion in my mind or anyway the germ of one for the thing will want some worrying out its quite a serious undertaking to begin with ill ask gordon who cut these drains weve been falling into and what he did it for  an englishman gordon answered nobody knew much about him he was probably an exile too anyway he saw this valley and it seemed to strike him that he could make a ranch in it  why should he fix on this particular valley  the things plain enough how many years does a man usually spend chopping a clearing out of the bush isnt there a demand for anything that you can eat from our miners and the men on our railroads and in our mills why do we bring carloads of provisions in cant you get hold of the fact that a man can start ranching right away on natural prairie if he can once get the water out of it  oh yes assented nasmyth the point is that one has to get the water out of it i would like mattawa and wheeler to notice it you can go on  well said gordon that man pitched right in and spent most of two years cutting fourfoot trenches through and dyking up the swamp he went on every day from sunup to dark but every time the floods came they beat him when he walked over the range to the settlement the boys noticed he was getting kind of worn and thin but there was clean grit in that man hed taken hold of the contract and he stayed with it then one day a prospector went into the valley after a big freshet and came across his wrecked shanty the river had got him  wheeler nodded gravely it seems to me this country was made by men like that he commented theyre the kind they ought to put up monuments to  there was silence for a moment or two after that except for the sighing of the wind among the firs and the hoarse murmur that came up softened by the distance from the cañon it was not an unusual story but it appealed to those who heard it for they had fought with rock and river and physical weariness and they could understand the grim patience and unflinching valour of the long struggle that had resulted as such struggles sometimes do only in defeat still the men who take those tasks in hand seldom capitulate gordon glanced at nasmyth  now he said if you have anything to say you can get it out  nasmyth raised himself on one elbow that englishman put up a good fight but he didnt start quite right he said i want to point out that in my opinion the river has evidently just run into the cañon its slow and deep until you reach the fall where its merely held up by the ridge of rock the rapid runs across well well call the change of level twelve to sixteen feet and as gordon has suggested a big strip of natural prairie is apt to make a particularly desirable property once you run the water out of it you can get rid of a lot of water when you have a fall of sixteen feet  how are you going to get it asked wheeler  by cutting the strip of rock that holds the river up at the fall i think one could do it with giantpowder  again there was silence for a few moments and nasmyth looked at his comrades quietly with the firelight on his face and a gleam in his eyes they sat still and stared at him for the daring simplicity of his conception won their admiration mattawa slowly straightened himself  its a great idea he declared seen something quite like it in ontario i guess it can be done he turned to nasmyth you can count me in  wheeler made a sign of concurrence it seems to me that mattawa is right in a general way im quite open to take a share in the thing but theres a point you have to consider most of the work could be done only at low water and a man might spend several years on it  well said nasmyth simply  wheeler waved his hand oh he said youre like that other englishman but you want to look at this thing from a business point of view now as you know the men who do the toughest work on this pacific slope are usually the ones who get the least for it well if you run the river down youll dry out the whole valley and youll have every man with a fancy for ranching jumping in or some d land agencys dummies grabbing every rod of it its crown land anybody can locate a ranch on it  you have to buy the land said nasmyth you cant preempt it here  how does that count wheeler persisted if you started clearing a bush ranch youd spend considerably more  nasmyth smiled i fancy our views coincide the point is that the crown agents charge the usual figure for land that doesnt require making which is not the case in this particular valley well before i cut the first hole with the drill they will either have to sell me all i can take up on special terms or make me a grant for the work i do  gordon laughed are you going to hammer your view of the matter into the crown authorities did you ever hear of anyone who got them to sanction a proposition that was out of the usual run  well said nasmyth im going to try if they wont hear reason ill start a syndicate round the settlement  wheeler leaning forward dropped a hand on his shoulder count on me for a thousand dollars when you want the money he turned and looked at gordon its your call  ill raise the same amount said gordon though ill have to put a mortgage on the ranch  mattawa made a little diffident gesture a hundredits the most i can dobut theres the boy he said  nasmyth smiled in a curious way for he knew this offer was after all a much more liberal one than those the others had made  you he said severely will be on wages yet if we put the thing through you will certainly get your share  he looked round at the other two and after they had expressed their approval they discussed the project until far into the night and finally decided to recross the range and look at the fall again early next morning it happened however that mattawa who went down to the river for water soon after sunrise found a siwash canoe neatly covered with cedar branches this was not an astonishing thing since the indians who come up the rivers in the salmon season often hew out a canoe on the spot where they require it and leave it there until they have occasion to use it again after considering the matter at breakfast the four men decided to go down the cañon they knew that one or two indians were supposed to have made the hazardous trip but that appeared sufficient for they were all accustomed to handling a canoe and an extra hazard or two is not often a great deterrent to men who have toiled in the bush  they had a few misgivings when the hills closed about them as they slipped into the shadowy entrance of the cañon no ray of sunlight ever streamed down there and the great hollow was dim and cold and filled with a thin white mist though a nipping wind flowed through it for a mile or two the hillsides which rose precipitously above them were sprinkled here and there with climbing pines that on their far summits cut faintly green against a little patch of blue byandby however the canoe left these slopes behind and drifted into a narrow rift between stupendous walls of rock though there was a narrow strip of shingle strewn with whitened driftwood between the side of the cañon and the river then this disappeared and there was only the sliding water and the smooth rock while the patch of sky seemed no more than a narrow riband of blue very high above  fortunately the river flowed smoothly between its barriers of stone and sounding with two poles lashed together the men got no bottom and as the river swept them on they began to wonder uneasily how they were to get back upstream once indeed wheeler suggested something of the kind but none of the others answered him and he went on with his paddling  at last a deep pulsating roar that had been steadily growing louder swelled suddenly into a bewildering din and mattawa shouted as they shot round a bend there was a whirling haze of spray into which the white rush of a rapid led close in front of them and for the next minute they paddled circumspectly then mattawa ran the canoe in between two boulders at the head of the rapid and they got out and stood almost kneedeep in the cold water the whirling haze of spray which rose and sank was rent now and then as the cold breeze swept more strongly down the cañon and it became evident that the rapid was a very short one the walls of rock stood further apart at this point and there was a strip of thinlycovered shingle and boulders between the fierce white rush of the flood and the worn stone mattawa grinned as the others looked at him  im staying here to hang on to the canoe he said guess you dont feel quite like going down that fall  they certainly did not and they hesitated a moment until nasmyth suddenly moved forward  we came here to look at the fall and im going on he said  they went with him stumbling over the shingle and now and then floundering among the boulders with the stream that frothed about their thighs almost dragging their feet from under them each of them gasped with sincere relief when he scrambled out of the whirling pool they reached a strip of uncovered rock that stretched across part of the wider hollow above the fall and stood there drenched and shivering for several minutes scarcely caring to speak as they gazed at the channel which the stream had cut through the midst of it wheeler dropped his hand on nasmyths shoulder  well he saidand nasmyth could just hear him through the roar of the fallit seems to me the thing could be done if you have nerve enough still i guess if they let you have the whole valley afterwards youd deserve it then he seemed to laugh ill make my share one thousand five hundred dollars in the meanwhile if you have no objections well get back again     chapter xii  wisbech makes inquiries   a little pale sunshine shone down into the opening between the great cedar trunks when laura waynefleet walked out of the shadowy bush the trail from the settlement dipped into the hollow of a splashing creek just in front of her and a yoke of oxen which trailed along a rude jumpersled plodded at her side the sled was loaded with a big sack of flour and a smaller one of sugar among other sundries which a rancher who lived farther back along the trail had brought up from the settlement in his waggon waynefleets hired man was busy that morning and as her stores were running out laura had gone for the goods herself other women from the cities have had to accustom themselves to driving a span of oxen along those forest trails  the beasts descended cautiously for the slope was steep and laura was halfway down it when she saw that a man who sat on the little log bridge was watching her he was clearly a stranger and when she led the oxen on to the bridge tapping the brawny neck of one with a long stick he turned to her  can you tell me if waynefleets ranch is near here he asked  laura glanced at him sharply for there was no doubt that he was english and she wondered with a faint uneasiness what his business was in the meanwhile the big slowlymoving beasts had stopped and stood still blowing through their nostrils and regarding the stranger with mild contemplative eyes one of them turned its head towards the girl inquiringly and the man laughed  one could almost fancy they wondered what i was doing here he remarked  the ranch is about a mile in front of you said laura in answer to his question you are going there  i am said the man i want to see miss waynefleet they told me to ask for her at the store  laura looked at him again with some astonishment  he was a little man apparently about fifty plainly dressed in what appeared to be english clothing nothing in his appearance suggested that he was a person of any importance or indeed of much education but she liked the way in which he had laughed when the ox had turned towards her  then she replied as that is my name you need not go any further  the man made a little bow mines wisbech and i belong to the birmingham district england he explained i walked over from the settlement to make a few inquiries about a relative of mine called derrick nasmyth they told me at the store that you would probably know where he is and what he is doing  laura was conscious of a certain resentment against the loquacious storekeeper it was disconcerting to feel that it was generally recognized that she was acquainted with nasmyths affairs especially as she realized that the fact might appear significant to his english relative it would scarcely be advisable she decided to ask the stranger to walk on to dinner at the ranch since such an invitation would probably strengthen any misconceptions he might have formed  mr nasmyth is expecting you she asked  no said wisbechand a little twinkle which she found vaguely reassuring crept into his eyesi dont think he is in all probability he thinks i am still in england perhaps i had better tell you that i am going to japan and home by india its a trip a good many english people make since the cpr put their new empress steamers on and i merely stopped over at victoria thinking i would see derrick he is as perhaps i mentioned a nephew of mine  there was a certain frankness and something whimsical in his manner which pleased the girl  you have walked from the settlement she asked  i have answered wisbech it is rather a long time since i have walked as much and i found it quite far enough a man is bringing a horse up to take me back but i am by no means at home in the saddle thatand he laughedis i suppose as great an admission in this country as i have once or twice found it to be at home  laura fancied she understood exactly what he meant most of her own male friends in england were accustomed to both horses and guns and this man certainly did not bear the unmistakable stamp that was upon his nephew  then my father and i would be pleased if you will call at the ranch and have dinner with us she said and continued a trifle hastily anyone who has business at a ranch is always expected to wait until the next meal is over  wisbech who declared that it was evidently a hospitable land and that he would be very pleased went on with her but he asked her nothing about nasmyth as they walked beside the plodding oxen instead he appeared interested in ranching and laura who found herself talking to him freely and naturally supplied him with considerable information though she imagined once or twice that he was unobtrusively watching her he also talked to waynefleet and the hired man when they had dinner together at the ranch and it was not until the two men had gone back to their work that he referred to the object he had in hand  i understand that my nephew spent some time here he said  laura admitted that this was the case and when he made further inquiries related briefly how nasmyth had first reached the ranch she saw the mans face grow intent as he listened and there was a puzzling look in his eyes which he fixed upon her  so you took him in and nursed him he said i wonder if i might ask why you did it he had no claim on you  most of our neighbours would have done the same laura answered  that hardly affects the case i presume he was practically penniless  i wonder why you should seem so sure of that as a matter of fact he had rather more than thirty dollars in his possession when he set out from the logging camp but on the journey he lost the belt he kept the money in  a queer light crept into wisbechs eyes that is just the kind of thing one would expect derrick nasmyth to do you see as i pointed out he is my nephew  you would not have lost that belt  wisbech laughed no he said i certainly would not what i meant to suggest was that i am naturally more or less acquainted with derrick nasmyths habits in fact i may admit i was a little astonished to hear he had contrived to accumulate those thirty dollars  laura did not know exactly why she felt impelled to tell him about the building of the dam but she did so and made rather a stirring story of it she was at least determined that the man should realize that his nephew had ability and it is possible that she told him a little more than she had intended for wisbech was shrewd then it suddenly flashed upon her that he had deliberately tricked her into setting forth his nephews strong points and was pleased that she had made the most of them  the dam seems to have been rather an undertaking and i am glad he contrived to carry it through successfully he commented then he looked at her with a twinkle in his eyes i do not know yet where he got the idea from  the girl flushed this was she felt regrettable but she could not help it for the mans keenness was disconcerting and she was also a little indignant with him she had recognized that derrick nasmyths character had its defects but she was by no means prepared to admit it to his relatives  then it didnt occur to you that an idea of that kind was likely to appeal to your nephew she said  no declared wisbech to be candid it didnt he smiled again after all i dont think we need trouble about that point especially as it seems he has acquitted himself very well i however cant help feeling it was in some respects fortunate that he fell into your hands  laura was usually composed but he saw her face harden for she was angry at his insistence it is evident he went on that he would not have had the opportunity of building the dam unless you had nursed him back to health and taken him into your employment  it was my father who asked him to stay on at the ranch  i am not sure that the correction has any very great significance one would feel tempted to believe that your father is to some extent in the habit of doing what you suggest  laura sat still a moment or two she was certainly angry with the stranger and yet in spite of that fact she felt that she liked him there was a candour in his manner which pleased her as his goodhumoured shrewdness did though she would have preferred not to have the shrewdness exercised upon herself it may be that he guessed what she was thinking for he smiled  miss waynefleet he said i almost fancy we should make excellent friends but there is a point on which i should like you to enlighten me why did you take the trouble to make me understand that you were doing nothing unusual when you asked me to dinner  laura laughed well she said if one must be accurate i do not exactly know i may have been a little unwise in endeavouring to impress it on you why did you consider it worth while to explain you had very seldom been in the saddle  wisbechs manner became confidential its a fact that has counted against me now and then besides i think you noticed my accentits distinctly provincial and not like yours or derricksas soon as i told you i was a relative of his you see i know my station in fact im almost aggressively proud of it he spread out his hands in a forceful fashion its a useful one  he reached out and to the girls surprise took up a bowl from the table and appeared to weigh it in his hands it was made of the indurated fibre which is frequently to be met with in the bush ranches  this he said is i suppose the kind of thing they are going to turn out at that woodpulp mill you have probably observed the thickness of it  i believe it is though they are going to make paper stock too  well pursued wisbech it may meet the requirements of the country but it is a very crude and inartistic production i may say that it is my business to make enamelled ware the wisbech bowls and cups and basins are justly celebratedlight and dainty and turned out to resemble marble granite or the most artistic china they will withstand any heat you can subject them to and practically last for ever  he broke off for a moment with a chuckle i cant detach myself from my business as some people seem to fancy one ought to do after all it is only by marriage that derrick nasmyth is my nephew his manner became grave again i married his mothers sistervery much against the wishes of the rest of the family as derrick has lived some time here the latter fact will probably not astonish you  laura said nothing though she understood exactly what he meant she was becoming more sure that she liked the man but she realized that she might not have done so had she met him before she came out to canada where she had learned to recognize the essential points in character there were certainly respects in which his manner would once have jarred upon her  her expression was reassuring when he turned to her again  i was a retail chemist in a little pottery town when i discovered the properties of one or two innocuous fluxes and how to make a certain leadless glaze he said probably you do not know that there were few more unhealthy occupations than the glazing of certain kinds of pottery i was also fortunate enough to make a good deal of money out of my discovery and as i extended its use i eventually started a big enamelling works of my own after that i married but the nasmyths never quite forgave me my little idiosyncrasies and some of my views they dropped me when my wife died shehis face softened curiouslywas in many ways very different from the rest of them  he broke off and when he sat silent a moment or two laura felt a curious sympathy for him  wont you go on she said  we had no children said the man my own folks were dead but i contrived to see derrick now and then my wife had been very fond of him and i liked the lad once or twice when i went up to london he insisted on making a fuss over metook me to his chambers and his club though i believe i was in several ways not exactly a credit to him  laura liked the little twinkle that crept back into his eyes it suggested the genial toleration of a man with a nature big enough to overlook many trifles he might have resented  well he continued his father died suddenly and when it became evident that his estate was deplorably involved derrick went out to canada none of his fastidious relatives seemed inclined to hold out a hand to him perhaps this was not very astonishing but i was a little hurt that he did not afford me the opportunity in one way however the lad was right he was willing to stand on his own feet there was pluck in him  he made an expressive gesture now im anxious to hear where he is and what he is doing  laura was stirred by what he had said she had imagination and could fill in many of the points wisbech had only hinted at nevertheless she was not quite pleased to recognize that he seemed to consider her as much concerned about his nephew as he was himself  he isshe tried to speak in an indifferent tonehe is at present engaged in building a difficult trestle bridge on a railroad it is not the kind of work any man who shrank from hazardous exertion would delight in but i believe there is a reason why the terms offered were a special inducement he has a new project in his mind though i do not know a great deal about it  i think you might tell me what you do know  laura did so though she had never been in the cañon the man listened attentively  well he said i fancy i can promise that he shall at least have an opportunity of putting that project through you havent however told me where the railroad bridge is  the girl made him understand how he could most easily reach it and while she was explaining the various roads he must follow there was a beat of hoofs outside wisbech rose and held out his hand  i expect that is the man with my horse and im afraid i have kept you talking a very long while he pressed her hand as he half apologized i wonder if you will permit me to come back again some time  laura said it would afford her and her father pleasure and she did not smile when he went out and scrambled awkwardly into his saddle the man who had brought the horse up grinned broadly as he watched wisbech jolt across the clearing  i guess that mans not going to make the settlement on that horse he rides most like a bag of flour he remarked with evident enjoyment of the strangers poor horsemanship     chapter xiii  on the trestle   it was with difficulty that wisbech reached the railroad track upon which laura waynefleet had told him nasmyth was occupied from the winding waggonroad he was forced to scramble down several hundred feet through tangled undergrowth and over great fallen logs then he had to walk along the ties which were spaced most inconveniently apart neither far enough for a long stride nor close enough for a short one it is in fact unless one is accustomed to it a particularly wearying thing to walk any distance along a western railroad track since local ticket rates are usually high on the pacific slope and roads of any other kind are not always available the smaller ranchers and other impecunious travellers frequently tramp miles upon the ties  wisbech however had not very far to go and though it entailed an occasional stumble he endeavoured to look about him he was progressing along the side of the wonderful fraser gorge which is the great channel clearly provided by nature for the commerce of the mountain province and he was impressed by the spectacle upon which he gazed in front of him rose great rocky ramparts with here and there a snowtipped peak cutting coldly white against the glaring blue beneath these the climbing pines rolled down in battalions to the brink of a vast hollow in the black depths of which the river roared far below wisps of gauzy mist clung to the hillside and out of them the track came winding down a sinuous gleaming riband that links the nations with a band of steel there were as he knew fleet steamers ready at either end of it in vancouver inlet and at montreal two thousand four hundred odd miles away for this was the allbritish route round half the world from london to yokohama and hongkong  that fact had its effect on wisbech as he plodded painfully along the ties he had democratic notions but he was an imperialist too which was perhaps after all not surprising for he knew something of englands great dependencies there are a good many men with similar views in the dominion and they have certainly lived up to them men undoubtedly work for money in western canada but one has only to listen to their conversation in saloon and shanty to recognize the clean pride in their manhood and their faith in the destiny of the land to which they belong they have also proved their faith by pitting their unshrinking courage and splendid physical strength against savage nature and among their other achievements that track blown out of the living rock flung over roaring rivers and driven through eternal snow supplies a significant hint of what they can bear and do they buried mangled men in roaring cañon and by giddy trestle but the rails crept always on  wisbech came to the brink of a gorge which rent the steep hillside he could not tell how deep it was but it made him dizzy to look down upon the streak of frothing water far below the gorge was spanned by the usual western trestle bridge an openwork fabric of timber just wide enough to carry the single track rising out of the chasm on tapering piers that looked ethereally fragile in that wilderness of towering trees and tremendous slopes of rock the chunk of axes and ringing of hammers jarred through the roar of the stream and he could see men clinging in midair to little stages slung about the piers and moving among the pines below a man in a ragged duck suit strode by him with an axe on his shoulder and wisbech halfdiffidently ventured to inquire if he could tell where derrick nasmyth could be found the man who paid no attention to him stopped close by and shouted to some of his comrades below  you ought to get that beam fixed before the fast freight comes through boys theres no sign of her yet he called in a loud voice  somebody answered him and the man turned to wisbech  now sir he replied tardily you were asking for nasmyth  wisbech said he wished to see derrick nasmyth and the man nodded  well said he youll have to wait a few minutes i guess hes busy theres a log they want to put into the trestle before the train comes along its not his particular business but were rather anxious to get through with our contract  ah returned wisbech then i fancy i know who you must be in fact im rather glad i came across you you are evidently the man who looked after my nephew when he was ill and from what miss waynefleet told me derrick owes you a good deal  gordon looked at wisbech with a little smile as he recalled what nasmyth had said about the man who had sent him the draft  well he remarked as he pointed to the hillside it would be quite hard to fancy there was very much the matter with him now  wisbech agreed with gordon when he saw a man who was running hard beside four brawny oxen that were hauling a great dressed firlog by a chain they came from an opening between the pines and rushed along the rude trail which had a few skids across it the trail led downhill just there and man and oxen went down the slope furiously in the attempt to keep ahead of the big log that jolted over the skids behind them wisbech had never seen cattle of any kind progress in that fashion before but he naturally did not know that the bushbred ox can travel at a headlong pace up and down hills and amidst thickets a man would cautiously climb or painfully crawl through as they approached the level at the foot of the slope the man who drove them ran back and slipping his handspike under it swung the butt of the log round an obstacle wisbech gazed at his nephew with astonishment when nasmyth came up with the beasts again his battered wide hat was shapeless his duck trousers were badly rent and the blue shirt which was all he wore above the waist hung open halfway down his breast he was flushed and gasping but the men upon the trestle were evidently urging him to fresh exertion  oh hit her hard shouted one of them and a comrade clinging to a beam high above the river broke in were waiting get a hump on bring her right along  it was evident that nasmyth was already doing all that reasonably could have been expected of him and in another moment or two four more men who ran out of the bush fell upon the log with handspikes as the beasts came to a long upward slope they went up it savagely and wisbech was conscious of a growing amazement as he watched the floundering oxen and gasping men  do you always worklike this he asked  gordon laughed well he answered it isnt the bosses fault when we dont as it happens however a good many of us are putting a contract through and the boys want to get that beam fixed before the fast freight comes along if they dont its quite likely shell shake it loose or pitch some of them off the bridge it has stood a few years and wants stiffening  a few years said wisbech there are bridges in england that have existed since the first railways were built i believe they dont require any great stiffening yet  oh yes said gordon its quite what one would expect we do things differently we heave our rails down and fill up the country with miners and farmers while youd be worrying over your parliamentary bills we strengthen our track as we go along and well have iron bridges over every river just as soon as theyre wanted  wisbech smiled it seemed to him that these men would probably get exactly what they set their minds upon in spite of every obstacle  why dont they stop the train while they get the beam into place he inquired  nothing short of a big landslip is allowed to hold that fast freight up gordon replied its up to every divisional superintendent between here and winnipeg to rush her along as fast as possible half the cars are billed through to the empress liner that goes out tomorrow  in the meanwhile the men and oxen had conveyed the big log up the slope and while nasmyth drove the beasts back along the skidded track it swung out over the chasm at the end of a rope men leaning out from fragile stages clutched at and guided it and when one of them shouted nasmyth cast the chain to which the rope was fastened loose from his oxen then little lithe figures crawled out along the beams of the trestle and there was a ringing of hammers gordon who gazed up the track swung his arm up in warning  youve got to hump yourselves boys he admonished  the faint hoot of a whistle came ringing across the pines and a little puff of white smoke broke out far up the track from among their sombre masses it grew rapidly larger and the clang of the hammers quickened while wisbech watched the white trail that swept along the steep hillside until there was a sudden shouting then he turned and saw his nephew running across the bridge  somebody has forgotten a bolt or a big spike said gordon  wisbech felt inclined to hold his breath as he watched nasmyth climb down the face of the trestle but in another minute or two he was clambering up again with several other men behind him there was another hoot of the whistle and as wisbech glanced up the track a great locomotive broke out from among the pines it was veiled in whirling dust and flying fragments of ballast and smoke that was grey instead of white for the track led downgrade and the engineer had throttled the steam the engine was a huge one built for mountain hauling and the freight cars that lurched out of the forest behind it were huger still wisbech could see them rock and the roar which they made and which the pines flung back grew deafening most of the cars had been coupled up in the yards at montreal and were covered thick with the dust that had whirled about them along two thousand four hundred miles of track and they were still speeding on through the forests of the west as they had done through those of faroff ontario  it seemed to wisbech as he gazed at the cars that they ran pigmy freight trains in the land he came from and he was conscious of something that had a curious stirring effect on him in the clang and clatter of that giant rolling stock as the engineer hurled his great train furiously downgrade it was mans defiance of the wilderness a symbol of his domination over all the great material forces of the world the engineer who glanced out once from his dustswept cab held them bound and subject in the hollow of the grimy hand he clenched upon the throttle with a deafening roar the great train leapt across the trestle which seemed to rock and reel under it and plunged once more into the forest a whistle soundeda greeting to the men upon the bridgeand then the uproar died away in a long diminuendo among the sombre pines  it was in most respects a fortuitous moment for wisbechs nephew to meet him and the older man smiled as nasmyth strode along the track to grasp his outstretched hand  im glad to see you derrick said wisbech who drew back a pace and looked at his nephew critically  you have changed since i last shook hands with you in london my lad he continued you didnt wear blue duck and you hadnt hands of that kind then  nasmyth glanced at his scarred fingers and broken nails  ive been up against it as they say here since those days he replied  and it has done you a world of good  nasmyth laughed well he said perhaps it has any way thats not a point we need worry over just now where have you sprung from  wisbech told him and added that there were many things he would like to talk about whereupon nasmyth smiled in a deprecatory manner  im afraid youll have to wait an hour or two he said you see there are several more big logs ready for hauling down and i have to keep the boys supplied ill be at liberty after supper and you cant get back tonight in the meanwhile you might like to walk along to where were getting the logs out  wisbech went with him and gordon and was impressed when he saw how they and the oxen handled the giant trunks he however kept his thoughts to himself and quietly smoking sat on a redwood log a little unobtrusive greyclad figure until gordon who had disappeared during the last hour announced that supper was ready then wisbech followed nasmyth and gordon to their quarters which they had fashioned out of canvas a few sheets of corrugated iron and strips of bark for as their work was on the hillside they lived apart from the regular railroad gang the little hut was rudely comfortable and the meal gordon set out was creditably cooked wisbech liked the resinous scent of the wood smoke that hung about the spot and the faint aromatic odour of the pinetwig beds and roofingbark when the meal was over they sat a while beneath the hanginglamp smoking and discussing general topics until nasmyth indicated the canvas walls of the hut and the beds of spruce twigs with a wave of his hand  you will excuse your quarters theyre rather primitive he said  wisbechs eyes twinkled i almost think i shall feel as much at home as i did when you last entertained me at your club and im not sure that i dont like your new friends best he said the others were a trifle patronizing though perhaps they didnt mean to be in fact it was rather a plucky thing you did that day  a faint flush crept into nasmyths bronzed face but wisbech smiled reassuringly as he glanced about the hut  the question is what all this is leading to he observed with inquiry in his tone  gordon rose ill go along and talk to the boys he announced i wont be back for an hour or two  nasmyth glanced at wisbech before he turned to his comrade  i would sooner you stayed where you are he said then he answered wisbech in the first place if we are reasonably fortunate it should lead to the acquisition of about a couple of hundred dollars  still said wisbech that will not go very far what will be the next thing when you have got the money  in a general way i should endeavour to earn a few more dollars by pulling out firstumps for somebody or clearing land  wisbech nodded no doubt theyre useful occupations but one would scarcely fancy them likely to prove very remunerative he said you have it seems to me reached an age when you have to choose are you content to go on as you are doing now  nasmyths face flushed as he saw the smile in gordons eyes for it was evident that wisbech and laura waynefleet held much the same views concerning him they appeared to fancy that he required a lot of what might be termed judicious prodding this was in one sense not exactly flattering but he did not immediately mention his great project for drying out the valley he would not hasten to remove a wrong impression concerning himself  well resumed wisbech seeing he did not answer if you care to go back and take up your profession in england again i think i can contrive to give you a fair start you neednt be diffident i can afford it and the thing is more or less my duty  nasmyth sat silent there was no doubt that the comfort and refinement of the old life appealed to one side of his nature and there were respects in which his present surroundings jarred on him it is also probable that had the offer been made him before he had had a certain talk with laura waynefleet he would have profited by it but she had roused something that was latent in him and at the same time endued him with a vague distrust of himself the effect of which was largely beneficial he had realized then his perilous propensity for what she had called drifting and after all men of his kind are likely to drift fastest when everything is made pleasant for them it was characteristic that he looked inquiringly at gordon who nodded  i think you ought to go if its only for a year or two said gordon its the life you were born to give it another trial you can come back to the bush again if you find it fails  nasmyth appeared to consider this and the two men watched him intently wisbech with a curious expression in his shrewd eyes then somewhat to their surprise nasmyth broke into a little harsh laugh  that there is a possibility of my failing seems sufficient he said here i must fight i am as we say up against it he turned to wisbech now if you will listen i will tell you something  for the next few minutes he described his project for running the water out of the valley and when he sat silent again there was satisfaction in wisbechs face  well said wisbech i am going to give you your opportunity its a thing i insist upon and as it happens im in a position to do it more or less effectually i have letters to folks of some importance in victoriagovernment men among othersand youll go down there and live as you would have done in england just as long as appears advisable while you try to put the project through it is quite evident that you will have to get one of the land exploitation concerns to back you and no doubt a charter or concession of some kind will have to be obtained from the crown authorities the time you spend over the thing in victoria should make it clear where your capacities lieif its handling matters of this kind in the cities or leading your workmen in the bush i purpose to take a share in your venture and im offering you an opportunity of making sure which is the kind of life youre most fitted for  i guess you ought to go remarked gordon quietly  nasmyth smiled that he agreed is my own opinion  then well consider it as decided said wisbech it seems to me i could spend a month or two in this province very satisfactorily and well go down to victoria together as soon as you have carried out this timbercutting contract  they talked of other matters while now and then men from the railroad gang dropped in and made themselves pleasant to the stranger it must be admitted that there are one or two kinds of wandering englishmen who would not have found them particularly friendly but the little quiet man with the twinkling eyes was very much at home with them he had been endued with the gift of comprehension and rockcutter and axeman opened their minds to him in fact he declared his full satisfaction with the entertainment afforded him before he lay down upon his bed of springy spruce twigs     chapter xiv  in the moonlight   there was a full moon in the clear blue heavens and its silvery light streamed into the pillared veranda where nasmyth sat cigar in hand on the seaward front of james actons house which stood about an hours ride from victoria on the dunsmer railroad like many other successful men in that country acton had begun life in a threeroomed shanty and now when at the age of fifty he was in possession of a comfortable competence he would have been well content to retire to his native settlement in the wilderness there was however the difficulty that the first suggestion of such a course would have been vetoed by his wife who was an ambitious woman younger than he and as a rule at least acton submitted to her goodhumouredly that was why he retained his seat on several directorates and had built bonavista on the bluff above the straits of georgia instead of the ranchhouse in the bush he still hankered for  bonavista had cost him much money but mrs acton had seen that it was wisely expended and the long wooden house with its colonnades of slender pillars daintily sawn scrollwork shingled roof and wide verandas justified her taste acton reserved one simply furnished room in it for himself and made no objections when she filled the rest of it with miscellaneous guests wisbech had brought him a letter from a person of consequence and he had offered the englishman and his nephew the freedom of his house he would not have done this to everybody though they are a hospitable people in the west but he had recognized in the unostentatious wisbech one or two of the characteristics that were somewhat marked in himself and his wife as it happened extended her favour to nasmyth as soon as she saw him she had been quick to recognize something she found congenial in his voice and manner though none of the points she noticed would in all probability have appealed to her husband acton leaned upon the veranda balustrade with a particularly rank cigar in his hand a gaunt bigboned man in badlyfitting clothes it was characteristic of him that he had not spoken to nasmyth since he stepped out from one of the windows five minutes earlier  its kind of pretty he said indicating the prospect with a little wave of his hand  nasmyth admitted that it was pretty indeed and his concurrence was justified sombre pinewoods and rocky heights walled in the wooden dwelling but in front of it the ground fell sharply away and beyond the shadow of the tall crags a blaze of moonlight stretched eastwards athwart the sparkling sea  well said acton its most as good a place for a house as i could find anywhere the cars could take me into town and thats partly why we raised it here  then he glanced down at the little white steamer lying in the inlet below thats one of my own particular toys youre coming up the coast with us next week for the salmontrolling  nasmyth said that he did not know what his uncles intentions were but he was almost afraid they had trespassed on their hosts kindness already acton laughed  we have folks here for a month quite oftenfolks that i cant talk to and who dont seem to think it worth while to talk to me now i can get along with your uncle i can mostly tell that kind of man when i see him you have got to let him stay some weeks yet it would be in one way a kindness to me what makes the thing easier is the fact that mrs acton has taken to you and when she gets hold of anyone she likes she doesnt let him go  nasmyth was content to stay and he felt that it would be a kindness to his host acton appeared willing to fall in with the views of his wife but nasmyth fancied that he was now and then a little lonely in his own house  both of you have done everything you could to make our stay pleasant nasmyth declared  it was quite easy in your case and a twinkle crept into his hosts eyes your uncles the same kind of a man as i am and one can see you have been up against it since you came to this country thats one of the best things that can happen to any young man i guess its not our fault we dont like all the young men they send us out from the old country he glanced down at his cigar well ive pretty well smoked this thing out its the kind of cigar i was raised on but im not allowed to use that kind anywhere in my house  in another moment acton swung round and stepped back through an open window he generally moved abruptly and was now and then painfully direct in conversation but nasmyth had been long enough in that country to understand and to like him he was a man with a grip of essential things but it was evident that he could bear goodhumouredly with the views of others  nasmyth sat still after acton left him there were other guests in the house and the row of windows behind him blazed with light one or two of the big casements were open and music and odd bursts of laughter drifted out somebody it seemed was singing an amusing song but the snatches of it that reached nasmyth struck him as pointless and inane he had been at bonavista a week but after his simple strenuous life in the bush he felt at times overwhelmed by the boisterous vivacity with which his new companions pursued their diversions there are not many men without an occupation in the west but mrs acton knew where to lay her hands on them and her husband sometimes said that it was the folks who had nothing worth while to do who always made the greatest fuss but nasmyth found it pleasant to pick up again the threads of the life which he had almost come to the conclusion that he had done with altogether it was comforting to feel that he could sleep as long as he liked and then rise and dress himself in whole dry garments while there was also a certain satisfaction in sitting down to a daintily laid and wellspread table when he remembered how often he had dragged himself back to his tent almost too worn out to cook his evening meal on the whole he was glad that acton had urged him to remain another week or two  then he became interested as a girl stepped out of one of the lighted windows some little distance away and without noticing him leaned upon the veranda balustrade the smile in her eyes he fancied suggested a certain satisfaction at the fact that what she had done had irritated somebody why it should do so he did not know but it certainly conveyed that impression in another minute a man appeared in the portico and the manner in which he moved forward after he had glanced along the veranda was more suggestive still the girl who leaned on the balustrade no doubt saw him and she walked towards nasmyth whom apparently she had now seen for the first time nasmyth thought he understood the reason for this and though it was not exactly flattering to himself he smiled as he rose and drew forward another chair he believed most of mrs actons guests were acquainted with the fact that he was an impecunious dambuilder  the girl who sat down in the chair he offered smiled when he flung his halfsmoked cigar away and nasmyth laughed as he saw the twinkle in her eyes for he had stopped smoking with a halfconscious reluctance  it really was a pity especially as i wouldnt have minded in the least she observed  nasmyth glanced along the veranda and saw that the man who had discovered that there was not another chair available was standing still evidently irresolute probably he recognized that it would be difficult to preserve a becoming ease of manner in attempting to force his company upon two persons who were not anxious for it and were sitting down nasmyth looked at the girl and prepared to undertake the part that he supposed she desired him to play she was attired in what he would have described as modified evening dress and her arms and neck gleamed with an ivory whiteness in the moonlight she was slight in form and curiously dainty as well as pretty her hair was black and she had eyes that matched it for they were dark and soft with curious lights in them but as she settled herself beside him in the pale moonlight it seemed to him that dainty did not describe her very well she was rather elusively ethereal  i really dont think you could expect me to make any admission of that kind about my cigar miss hamilton he said still it would perhaps have been excusable you see i have just come out of the bush  violet hamilton smiled you are not accustomed to throw anything away up there  no answered nasmyth with an air of reflection i scarcely think we are certainly not when its a cigar of the kind mr acton supplies his guests with  he imagined that his companion satisfied herself that the man she evidently desired to avoid had not gone away yet before she turned to him again  arent you risking mrs actons displeasure in sitting out here alone she inquired you are probably aware that this is not what she expects from you  i almost think the retort is obvious and nasmyth wondered whether he had gone further than he intended when he saw the momentary hardness in his companions eyes it suggested that the last thing her hostess had expected her to do was to keep out of the way of the man who had followed her on to the veranda he accordingly endeavoured to divert her attention from that subject  any way i find all this rather bewildering now and then he said and indicated the lights and laughter and music in the house behind him with a little movement of his hand this is a very different world from the one i have been accustomed to and it takes some time to adapt oneself to changed conditions  he broke off as he saw the other man slowly turn away he looked at the girl with a smile i can go on a little longer if it appears worth while  violet hamilton laughed ah she said one should never put ones suspicions into words like that besides i almost think one of your observations was a little misleading there are reasons for believing that you are quite familiar with the kind of life you were referring to  it was clear to nasmyth that she had been observing him but he did not realize that she was then watching him with keen halfcovert curiosity he was certainly a wellfavoured man and though his conversation and demeanour did not differ greatly from those of other young men she was accustomed to there was also something about him which she vaguely recognized as setting him apart from the rest he was a little more quiet than most of them and there were a certain steadiness in his eyes and a faint hardness in the lines of his face which roused her interest he had been up against it as they say in that country which is a thing that usually leaves its mark upon a man it endues him with control and above all with comprehension  oh he said a man not burdened with money is now and then forced to wander he naturally picks up a few impressions here and there i wonder if you find it chilly sitting here  the girl rose with a little laugh that she said was evidently meant to afford me an opportunity i think i should like to go down to the inlet  nasmyth who understood this as an invitation went with her and five minutes later they strolled out upon the crown of the bluff down the side of which a little path wound precipitously nasmyth held his hand out at the head of it and they went down together cautiously until they stood on the smooth white shingle close by where the little steamer lay the girl looked about her with a smile of appreciation  a lane of dusky water that heaved languidly upon the pebbles ran inland past them under the dark rocks side and it was very still in the shadow of the climbing firs on the further shore a flood of silvery radiance against which the dark branches cut black as ebony streamed down into the rift and beyond the rocky gateway there was brilliant moonlight on the smooth heave of sea the girl glanced at it longingly and then though she said nothing her eyes rested on a little beautifully modelled cedar canoe that lay close by in another moment nasmyth had laid his hands on it and she noticed how easily he ran it down the beach as she had noticed how steady of foot he was when she held fast to his hand as they came down the bluff with a curious little smile that she remembered afterwards he glanced towards the shadowy rocks which shut in the entrance to the inlet  shall we go and see what there is out yonder beyond those gates he asked  ah replied the girl what could there be arent you taking an unfair advantage in appealing to our curiosity  nasmyth made a whimsical gesture as he answered her for he saw that she could be fanciful too unsubstantial moonlight glamour mysteryperhaps other things as well he said if you are curious why shouldnt we go and see  she made no demur and helping her into the canoe he thrust the light craft off and with a sturdy stroke of the paddle drove it out into the inlet it was a thing he was used to for he had painfully driven ruder craft of that kind up wildlyfrothing rivers and the girl noticed the powerful swing of his shoulders and the rhythmic splash of his paddle though there were other things that had their effect on herthe languid lapping of the brine on shingle and the gurgle round the canoe that seemed to be sliding out towards the moonlight through a world of unsubstantial shadow she admitted that the man interested her he had a quick wit and a whimsical fancy that appealed to her but he had also hard workmans hands and he managed the canoe as she imagined one who had undertaken such things professionally would have done  when the shimmering blaze of moonlight lay close in front of them he let his paddle trail in the water for a moment or two and turning glanced back at the house on the bluff its lower windows blinked patches of warm orange light against the dusky pines  that he said in one respect typifies all you are accustomed to it stands for the things you know arent you a little afraid of leaving it behind you  i think i suggested that you were accustomed to them too  nasmyth laughed oh he said i was turned out of that world a long while ago we are going to see a different one together  the one you know  well returned the man reflectively im not quite sure that i do its the one i live in but that doesnt go very far after all now and then i think one could live in the wilderness a lifetime without really knowing it theres an elusive something in or behind it that evades onethe mystery that hides in all grandeur and beauty still theres a peril in it like the moonlight it gets hold of you  the girl fancied that she understood him but she wondered how far it was significant that they should slide out into the flood of radiance together when he once more drove the light craft ahead  the smooth sea shimmered like molten silver about the canoe and ran in sparkling drops from the dripping paddle the bluff hung high above them a tremendous shadowy wall and the sweet scent of the firs came off from it with the little land breeze they swung out over the smooth levels that heaved with a slow rhythmic pulsation and nasmyth wondered whether he was wise when he glanced at his companion she sat still looking about her dreamily very daintyalmost ethereal he thoughtin that silvery light and it was so long since he had talked confidentially to a woman of her kind attired as became her station laura waynefleets hands as he remembered were hard and sometimes red and the stamp of care was plain on her but it was very different with violet hamilton she was wholly a product of luxury and refinement and the mere artistic beauty of her attire which seemed a part of her appealed to his imagination  he did not remember how she set him talking but he told her whimsical and now and then grim stories of his life in the shadowy bush and she listened with quick comprehension she seemed to endow him with that quality too since as he talked he began to realize as he had never quite comprehended before the something that lay behind the tense struggle of man with nature and all the strenuous endeavour perhaps he expressed it in a degree for now and then the girls eyes kindled as he told of some heroic grapple with giant rock and roaring river gnawing hunger and loneliness and the beaten mans despair he found her attention gratifying it was certainly pleasant though he had not consciously adopted the pose to figure in the eyes of such a girl as one who had known most of the hardships that man can bear and played his part in the great epic struggle for the subjugation of the wilderness as it happened she did not know that those who bear the brunt of that grim strife are for the most part dumb their share is confined to swinging the axe and gripping the jarring drill  it was an hour after they left the inlet when the land breeze came down a little fresher and swinging the canoe round he drove it back over a glittering sea that commenced to splash about the polished side of the light craft then both of them ceased talking until as they approached the shadowy rift in the rock the girl looked back with a laugh  it is almost a pity to leave all that behind she said softly  nasmyth nodded as he glanced up at the lighted windows of the house in one sense it is still its rather curious that i think i never appreciated it quite so much before he let his paddle trail as he wondered whether he had gone too far i suppose you are going up the coast with mrs acton in the steamer he inquired  yes answered violet hamilton with an air of reflection i was not quite sure whether i would or not but now i almost think i will  nasmyth was sensible of a little thrill of satisfaction for he knew it was understood at bonavista that he was going too he decided that he could certainly go he dipped his paddle strongly and laughed as they slid forward into the shadow  now he said you are safely back in your own realm again  you called it a world a little while ago said the girl  i did replied nasmyth still i almost think the word i substituted is justifiable  violet hamilton said nothing as they climbed the bluff but she wondered how far the change he had made was significant all the men at bonavista were her subjects but until that night at least nasmyth had in that sense stood apart from them and it is always more or less gratifying to extend ones sovereignty     chapter xv  martials misadventure   there was not a breath of wind and the night was soft and warm when nasmyth lay stretched upon the tillicums deck with his shoulder against the saloon skylights and a pipe in his hand the little steamer lay with her anchor down under a long forestshadowed point behind which a halfmoon hung close above the great black pines some distance astern of her a schooner lay waiting for a wind with the loose folds of her big mainsail flapping black athwart the silvery light and her blinking anchorlight flung a faint track of brightness across the sliding tide there was only the soft lap of the water along the steamers side and the splash of the little swell upon the beach to break the stillness for the sea was smooth as oil  the tillicum would not have compared favourably with an english steamyacht she had been built for the useful purpose of towing sawlogs and was sold cheap when as the mill she kept supplied grew larger she proved too small for it acton however was by no means a fastidious person and when he had fitted her with a little saloon and made a few primitive alterations below he said she was quite good enough for him for that matter anyone fond of it might navigate the landlocked waters of puget sound and the straits of georgia in an open whaleboat with satisfaction in summertime there are islands everywhere wonderful rockwalled inlets that one can sail into beaches to which the primeval forest comes rolling down and always above the blue waters tower tremendous ramparts of nevermelting snow  on the evening in question acton was not on board he had taken his wife and guests ashore that morning for an excursion to a certain river where there was excellent troutfishing and as a hotel had lately been built for the convenience of sportsmen visitors it was uncertain whether they would return that night nasmyth had not made one of the party because there was scarcely room for everybody in the gig and six miles which was the distance to the river mouth was rather far to row in the dinghy another guest called martial also had been left behind and afterwards had been rowed ashore to visit a ranching property somewhere in the neighbourhood he was the man who had followed miss hamilton out on to the veranda one night and nasmyth who did not like him understood that he was connected with a big land exploitation agency  nasmyth felt more or less contented with everything as he lay upon the tillicums deck listening to the faint murmur of the swell upon the boulder beach he had made certain propositions to the crown lands authorities which he believed they would look into and while he waited he found the customs and luxuries of civilization pleasant he found the society of violet hamilton more pleasant still and the demeanour of the man martial was almost the only thing that ruffled him martial had constituted himself miss hamiltons special attendant and though nasmyth fancied mrs acton connived at this it was by no means as evident that the girl was pleased with it indeed he surmised that she liked the man as little as he did martial was brusque in mariner and though that is not usually resented in british columbia he now and then went even further than is considered permissible in that country and he had gained the sincere dislike of the redhaired george who acted as the tillicums deckhand cook and skipper  george sat upon the skylights sucking at his pipe and it presently became evident that his thoughts and nasmyths were very much alike there was nobody else on board for the man who fired and drove the engines was ashore  i guess you can catch trout the skipper remarked  oh yes answered nasmyth indifferently as a matter of fact ive had to when there was very little else to eat  george who was big and lank and truculent in appearance nodded  juss so he rejoined youve been up against it in the bush anybody could figure on that by the look of you and the way you use your hands a city man takes holds of things as if they were going to hurt him thats kind of why i froze on to you  nasmyth took this as a compliment and smiled his acknowledgment for george was a privileged person and most of his recent companions held democratic views he however said nothing and george went on again  mrs actons a mighty smart woman but she plays some fool tricks he commented wheres the blame use in taking a boatload of folks after trout when none of them but the boss knows how to fish then he chuckled youd have gone with the rest this morning if she wanted you to guess the gig would have carried another one quite nicely  nasmyth fancied that this was possible though he naturally would not admit it to his companion the fact that his hostess had somewhat cleverly contrived to leave him behind had its significance since it seemed to indicate that she recognized that miss hamilton regarded him with a certain amount of favour  well said george reflectively the boss is quite smart too mrs acton crowded you out of the gig the boss says nothing but he knocks off that blame martial that makes the thing even and unless he does it none of them gets any fish now it kind of seems to me that for a girl like miss hamilton to look at a man like martial is a throwing of herself away i guess it strikes you like that too  this was rather too pointed a question for nasmyth to answer but so far as it went he could readily have agreed with the skipper as a matter of fact it suggested the query why he should object to miss hamilton throwing herself away  well he observed im not quite sure that its any concern of mine  georges grin was expressive of goodnatured toleration oh he replied i guess thats plain enough for me youre not going to talk about the bosss friends still one mans as good as another in this country and if i wasnt way better than martial id drown myself thats the kind of pernicious insect a decent man has no use for whats he come on board for with three bags ram full of clothes when many a better man humps his outfit up and down the bush in an old blanket same as you have done its a sure thing that no man with a conscience wants to get into the land agency business its an institution for selling greensuckers ranching land thats rock and gravel and virgin forest besides i heard the blame insect telling miss hamilton that nobody not raised in the hogpen could drink my coffee  it seemed to nasmyth that there was a little reason in the skippers observations though he thought that martials strictures upon the coffee accounted for most of them  i guess it might have been wiser if martial had kept on good terms with the skipper he laughingly rejoined  george chuckled softly well he declared when anyone up and says my coffees only fit for the hogpen im going to get even with him i kind of feel i have to its up to me  he said nothing further for some little time and nasmyth who fancied that he would sooner or later carry out his amiable intentions lay prone upon the deck smoking placidly nasmyth was one who adapted himself to his environment with readiness and on board the tillicum the environment was particularly comfortable through actons hospitality he was brought into contact with the luxuries of civilization without the galling restraints miss hamilton had been gracious to him of late that was a cause for satisfaction in itself the days when he swung the heavy axe or drenched with icy water stood gripping the drill had slipped far away behind him for the time at least he could bask in the sunshine with ears stopped against the shrill trumpetcall to action that he had heard in the crash of rent trees and the turmoil of the wild flood  a faint cry came from the shore out of the stillness of the woods and george listened carefully  that cant be the boss guess hes stopping at the hotel he said its quite likely its that blame insect martial coming back those ranchers he has been trying to freeze off their holding have no use for him  the cry rose again a trifle louder and george nodded complacently  oh yes he exulted its martial sure well let him howl any way he can walk down the beach until hes abreast of us when anybody expects me to hear him he has got to come within half a mile  it seemed to nasmyth that martial would not have a pleasant walk in the dark for most of the beach lay in the black shadow of the pines and beneath highwater mark was covered with the roughest kind of boulders above the tideline a ragged mass of driftwood interspersed with undergrowth separated the water from the tangled bush both george and nasmyth were aware that one could readily tear ones clothes to pieces in an attempt to struggle through such a labyrinth judging by the shouts he uttered at intervals martial appeared to be floundering along the beach and presently nasmyth laughed  he appears to be getting angry he said after all its only natural that he doesnt want to sleep in the woods all night  george filled his pipe apparently with quiet satisfaction but some time later he stood up suddenly with an exclamation  the blame contrary insect means swimming off he announced  nasmyth glancing shorewards saw a dim white object crawling on allfours towards the water where the moonlight streamed down upon a jutting point and it was then that the idea which had results that neither of them anticipated first dawned on the skipper who broke into a hoarse chuckle  i guess he wouldnt want miss hamilton to see him like that he said some folks look considerably smarter with their clothes on  hows she going to see him when she isnt here  george grinned again her dresses are sos her hat and her little mandolin if you were pulled in tight youd have quite a figure  it was clear to nasmyth that the scheme was workable though he was quite aware that the thing he was expected to do was a trifle discreditable still he had lived for some time in the bush where his comrades jests were not particularly delicate and martial once or twice had been aggressively unpleasant to him what was more to the purpose he felt reasonably sure that miss hamilton would be by no means sorry to be free of martial and it was probable that their victim would never relate his discomfiture if their scheme succeeded  as the result of these reflections he went down with george to the little saloon the skipper who left him there a few minutes came hack with an armful of feminine apparel they had no great difficulty in tying on the big hat with the veil but when nasmyth had stripped his jacket off there was some trouble over the next proceeding indeed derrick did not feel quite comfortable about appropriating miss hamiltons garments but he had committed himself and it was quite clear that his companion would not appreciate his reasons for drawing back  hold your breath while i get this blame hook in said the skipper  nasmyth did so but he could not continue to hold it indefinitely and in a few moments there was a suggestive crack and george desisted in evident dismay  come adrift from the stiffening quite a strip of it he said well i guess i can somehow fix the thing up so as nobody will notice it it should be easier than putting a new cloth in a topsail and ive a mending outfit in the locker  nasmyth was by no means sure of georges ability to make the damage good but he permitted the skipper to tie on the loose skirt and then to hang the beribboned mandolin round his neck when this was done george surveyed him with a grin of satisfaction  well said george i guess youll do now youll keep behind the skylights and only get up and bang that mandolin when martial wants to come on board guess when he sees you hell feel most like jumping right out of his skin miss hamiltons not going to mind ive seen her looking at him as if shed like to stick a big hatpin into him  they went up and nasmyth who felt guilty as he crouched in the shadow could see a black head and the flash of a white arm that swung out into the moonlight and disappeared again martial was swimming pluckily and the tide was with him for his head grew larger every minute and presently the gleam of his skin became visible through the pale shining of the brine his face dipped as his left arm came out at every stroke and the water frothed as his feet swung together like a flail he paddled easily while the tide swept him on until he reached the tillicum then his voice rose breathless and cautious  anchor watch he called anybody else on board  george who kept out of sight did not answer martial called again  dont let anybody out of the companion while i get up he commanded  the tillicum had a high sheer forward and he could not reach her rail but as the tide swept him along he raised himself to clutch at it where it was lower abreast of the skylights  now said george softly you can play the band  nasmyth rose and swept his knifehaft across the strings of the mandolin for a moment he saw something like horror in martials wet face and then the man who gasped went down headforemost into the water martial was nearly a dozen yards astern when his head came out again and he slid away with the tide with his white arm swinging furiously george sat down upon the deck and expressed his satisfaction by drumming his feet upon the planking while he laughed  hes off he said might have a highpower engine inside of him guess hes going to scare those schooner men most out of their lives its quite likely they wont keep anchor watch when theyre lying snug in a place of this kind  nasmyth managed to control his laughter and went down to divest himself of his draperies when he came up again george reported that he had just seen martial crawling up the schooners cable and in another few moments what appeared to be a howl of terror rose from the vessel it was not repeated and shortly afterwards nasmyth went to sleep  martial remained on board the schooner that night and nasmyth was not surprised when he failed to appear next morning acton had come back with his party when a man dropped into the boat astern of the schooner and pulled towards the tillicum leisurely everybody was on deck when he slid alongside and standing up in his boat laid hold of the rail  ive a message for mr acton he said holding up a strip of paper  acton who took the paper from him was a trifle perplexed when he glanced at it  it seems that martial didnt stay at that ranch last night as i thought he had done he remarked  mrs acton who sat next to miss hamilton looked up sharply she was a tall woman with an authoritative manner  where is he she inquired  gone back to victoria said her husband who handed her the note its kind of sudden and he doesnt worry about saying why he went theres a little remark at the bottom that i dont quite like  george naturally had been listening and nasmyth saw his subdued grin but he saw also mrs actons quick glance at miss hamilton which seemed to suggest that she surmised the girl could explain why martial had departed so unceremoniously there was however only astonishment and nasmyth fancied a trace of relief in violet hamiltons face mrs acton turned to her husband with a flush of resentment in her eyes  i should scarcely have believed mr martial would ever write such a note she said what does he mean when he says that he does not appreciate being left to sleep in the woods all night  that answered acton is what i dont quite understand if hed hailed anchor watch loud enough george would have gone off for him still were lying quite a way out from the beach  then he remembered the man from the schooner who still gripped the rail  how did you come to get this note he asked  the man who came off last night gave it to the skipper said the schooners deckhand with a very suggestive grin  howd he come off acton asked did you go ashore for him  we didnt said the man he must have swum off and crawled up the cable any way when he struck the skipper he hadnt any clothes on him  there was a little murmur of astonishment and mrs acton straightened herself suddenly while nasmyth saw a gleam of amusement creep into actons eyes the schooner man evidently felt that he had an interested audience for he leaned upon the rail as he began to tell all he knew about the incident  i was asleep forward when the skipper howled as if he was most scared out of his life he said i got up out of the scuttle just as quick as i could and there he was crawling round behind the sternhouse with an axe in his hand and the mate flat up against the rail  shut that slide quick says the skipper shut it hes crawling up the ladder  i guess you can shut it yourself if you want it shut he asked for whisky tell him where it is says the mate  there was no doubt that the listeners were interested and the man made an impressive gesture it was kind of scaring there was a soft flippetyflop going on in the sternhouse and i slipped out a handspike then the skipper sees me  theres a drowned man crawling round the cabin with water running off him he says  then a head came out of the scuttle and a wet arm and a voice that didnt sound quite like a drowned mans says oh you  acton raised his arm restrainingly and the narrator made a sign of comprehension  he called us fools the man explained and for most a minute the skipper was going to take the axe to him then he hove it at the mate for being scared instead and they all went down together and i heard them light the stove after that i went back and dropped off to sleep and the skipper sent me off at sunup to fetch the strangers clothes we set him ashore as soon as hed got some breakfast into him  the man rowed away in another minute or two and as he had evidently told his story with a relish nasmyth wondered whether martial had contrived to offend him by endeavouring to purchase his silence there are of course men one can offer a dollar to on that coast but such an act requires a certain amount of circumspection  actons eyes twinkled and the men who were his guests looked at one another meaningly  well answered one of them i guess there is an explanation though i didnt think martial was that kind of man  nasmyth said nothing but he saw mrs actons face flush with anger and disdain and surmised that it was most unlikely that she would forgive the unfortunate martial the women in the party evidently felt that it would not be advisable to say anything further about the matter and when george broke out the anchor the tillicum steamed away  it was after supper that night and there was nobody except the helmsman on deck when miss hamilton approached the forward scuttle where nasmyth sat with his pipe in his hand nasmyth rose and spread out an old sail for her and she sat down a little apart from him the tillicum was steaming northwards at a leisurely six knots with her mastheads swaying rhythmically through the soft darkness and a deeptoned gurgling at her bows byandby nasmyth became conscious that miss hamilton was looking at him and on the whole he was glad that it was too dark for her to see him very well  i wonder if you were very much astonished at what you heard about mr martial she asked  well said nasmyth reflectively in one way at least i certainly was you see i did not think martial was as our friend observed that kind of man in fact i may admit that i feel reasonably sure of it still  i suppose you felt you owed him that  i didnt want to leave you under a misapprehension  there was silence for half a minute and then nasmyth turned towards the girl again  you are still a little curious about the affair he suggested  i am i may mention that i found a certain dress of mine which i do not remember tearing had evidently been repaired by somebody quite unaccustomed to that kind of thing now there were of course only the skipper and yourself on board while we were away  nasmyth felt his face grow hot well he replied if its any consolation to you i am quite prepared in one respect at least to vindicate martials character in any case i think i shall have an interview with mrs acton tomorrow  his heart beat a little faster for the girl laughed  it really wouldnt be any consolation at all to me she admitted  ah said nasmyth then although you may have certain fancies you are not dreadfully vexed with me  violet hamilton appeared to reflect considering everything i almost think you can be forgiven  after that they talked about other matters for at least an hour while the tillicum with engines throbbing softly crept on through the darkness and acton who happened to notice them as he lounged under the companion scuttle with a cigar in his hand smiled significantly acton had a liking for nasmyth and though he was not sure that mrs acton would have been pleased had she known where miss hamilton was the matter was he reflected after all no concern of his     chapter xvi  actons warning   it was with somewhat natural misgivings the next afternoon that nasmyth strolled forward along the tillicums deck toward the place where mrs acton was sitting immaculately dressed as usual she reclined in a canvas chair with a book which she had been reading upon her knee as nasmyth approached her he became conscious that she was watching him with a curious expression in her keen dark eyes the steamer had dropped anchor in a little landlocked bay and nasmyth had just come back in the dinghy after rowing one or two of the party ashore mrs acton indicated with a movement of her hand that he might sit upon the steamers rail and then turning towards him looked at him steadily she was a woman of commanding personality and imperiously managed her husbands social affairs if he had permitted it she probably would have undertaken also to look after his commercial interests  i wonder why you decided not to visit the indian settlement with the others she inquired  nasmyth smiled i have been in many places of the kind he answered besides there is something i think i ought to tell you  i almost fancied that was the case  then i wonder if you have connected me with martials disappearance  i may admit that my husband evidently has  he told you then and nasmyth realized next moment that the faint astonishment he had displayed was not altogether tactful  no said mrs acton with a smile he did not that was i think what made me more sure of it james acton can maintain a judicious silence when it appears advisable and there are signs that he rather likes you  nasmyth bowed i should be very pleased to hear that you shared his views in this respect he observed  i am in the meanwhile somewhat naturally rather uncertain upon the point she returned  well confessed nasmyth humbly i believe i am largely responsible for your guests sudden disappearance it was of course almost inexcusable and i could not complain if you were very angry with me  i should at least like to know exactly what you did  that said nasmyth is a thing i would sooner you did not urge me to explain after all i feel i have done martial sufficient injury and i do not think he would like you to know there are he added somewhat diffidently one or two other reasons why i should prefer not to say anything further but i would like to assure you that the explanation one of your friends suggested is not the correct one i ventured to make this at least clear to miss hamilton  mrs acton regarded him with a suggestive smile mr martial was not effusively pleasant to you the affair was premeditated  my one excuse is that the thing was done on the spur of the moment i should never have undertaken it if i had reflected nasmyth made a gesture of submission i am in your hands  mrs acton sat silent for perhaps a minute gazing at the woods that swept round three sides of the little bay great cedars and pines and hemlocks rolled down to the waters edge and the stretch of smooth green brine between them and the steamer flashed like a mirror  well she said after a long pause i must admit that at first i was angry with you nowand her eyes grew a bit scornfuli am angry with martial instead in fact i think i shall wash my hands of him i have no sympathy with a man who allows himself to be placed in a ludicrously painful position that reflects upon his friends  especially when he has the privilege of your particular favour added nasmyth  mrs acton laughed that she returned was a daring observation it at least laid a certain obligation on martial to prove it warranted which he has signally failed to do i presume you know why he took some little pains to make himself unpleasant to you  nasmyth fancied that she was really angry with martial and that he understood her attitude she was a capable strongwilled woman and had constituted herself the ally of the unfortunate man who had brought discredit on her by permitting himself to be shamefully driven from the field it was also evident that she resented the fact that a guest from her husbands yacht should have been concerned in any proceedings of the nature that the schooners deckhand had described  i think i suspect why he was not cordial to me nasmyth admitted still the inference is so flattering that one would naturally feel a little diffident about believing that martials suppositions were correct  that replied mrs acton was tactfully expressed she looked at the young man fixedly and her next remark was characterized by the disconcerting frankness which is not unusual in the west mr nasmyth she said unless you have considerable means of your own it would be wiser of you to put any ideas of the kind you have hinted at right out of your head  i might perhaps ask you for one or two reasons why i should adopt the course you suggest  you shall have them violet hamilton is a lady with possessions and i look upon her as a ward of my own any way her father and mother are dead and they were my dearest friends  ah agreed nasmyth that naturally renders caution advisable well i am in possession of three or four hundred dollars and a project which i would like to believe may result to my advantage financially still that is a thing i cannot be very sure about  mrs acton gazed at him thoughtfully your uncle is a man of means  i believe he is he may put three or four thousand dollars into the venture i mention if he continues pleased with me that is i think the most i could expect from him  mrs acton sat silent a while and though nasmyth was not aware of it favoured him with one or two glances of careful scrutiny he was as she had naturally noticed a wellfavoured man and the flannels and straw hat he wore were becoming to him what was more to the purpose there was a certain graceful easiness in his voice and manner which were not characteristic of most of her husbands friends indeed wellbred poise was not a characteristic of her own though she recognized her lack the polish that she coveted suggested an acquaintance with a world that she had not as yet succeeded in persuading her husband to enter acton was from her point of view regrettably contented with his commercial status in the new and crudely vigorous west  well she remarked thoughtfully none of us knows what there is in the future and there are signs that you have intelligence and grit in you then she dismissed the subject i think you might take me for a row she said  nasmyth pulled the dinghy alongside and rowed her up and down the bay but his intelligence was after all not sufficient for him to recognize the cleverness with which she led him on to talk about his uncle and england he was not aware that he had been particularly communicative but when he rowed back to the yacht mrs acton was in possession of a great deal of information that was more or less satisfying  the tillicum steamed away again when the remainder of the party arrived and she was leisurely swinging over a little frothflecked sea that night with the spray flying at her bows when acton came upon nasmyth leaning on the rail  i wasnt quite certain what view mrs acton might take of martials disappearance said acton just now however i think that she is rather pleased with you  the fact replied nasmyth is naturally a cause for satisfaction  acton appeared amused well he said to some extent it depends upon what views she has for you mrs acton is a capable woman  acton strolled forward leaving nasmyth thoughtful the hint was reasonably plain but the younger man was not quite sure that he would be willing to fall in with the strongwilled womans views there was no doubt that violet hamilton attracted himhe admitted that without hesitationfor she had grace and wit and beauty but she had also large possessions which might prove a serious obstacle besides he was sensible of a tenderness for the woman who had given him shelter and a great deal more than that in the lonely bush laura however was still in the wilderness and miss hamilton whose society he found very pleasant was then on board the tillicum facts that had their significance in the case of a man liable to be swayed by the impulses of the moment byandby he started for while he thought about her miss hamilton came out of the little companionway and stood looking round her with her long light dress rustling in the breeze until she moved forward as her eyes rested on him  nasmyth fancied that there was a particular significance in the fact that she appeared just then he walked to meet her and drawing a low canvas chair into the shelter of the skylights sat down with his back against them close at her feet he did not remember what they talked about and it was in all probability nothing very material but they had already discovered that they had kindred views and likes and they sat close together in the shelter of the skylights with a bright halfmoon above them while the tillicum lurched on over a glittering sea both of them were surprised to discover that an hour had slipped by when their companions came up on deck and nasmyth was once more thoughtful before he went to sleep that night  next day the tillicum brought up off a little mining town and george who went ashore came back with several letters among the letters was a note for nasmyth from a man interested in land exploitation this man with whom nasmyth had been in communication was then in the mining town and he suggested that nasmyth should call upon him at his hotel nasmyth showed acton the letter  i understand these folks are straight the younger man remarked with inquiry in his tone  acton smiled dryly any way he said theyre as straight as most its not a business thats conducive to unswerving rectitude hutton has come up here to see you about the thing  he says he has some other business  well replied acton perhaps he has then he turned to wisbech who sat close by ill go ashore with nasmyth will you come along  no said wisbech i almost think ill stay where i am if derrick can hold out any reasonable prospect of making interest on the money its quite possible i may put three or four thousand dollars into the thing but i go no further its his affair he must handle it himself  acton nodded thats sensible in one way he declared and one could have fancied there was a certain suggestiveness in the qualification  wisbech appeared to notice it for he looked hard at acton then he made an abrupt gesture  its my nephews affair he said  oh yes returned acton significantly any way ill go ashore with him as soon as george has the gig ready  acton and nasmyth were rowed off together half an hour later and they walked up through the hot main street of the little colliery town it was not an attractive place with rickety plank sidewalks raised several feet above the street towering telegraphpoles wooden stores and square frame houses cracked by the weather and mostly destitute of any adornment or paint blazing sunshine beat down upon the rutted street and an unpleasant gritty dust blew along it  there was evidently very little going on in the town that afternoon here and there a man leaned heavyeyed as if unaccustomed to the brightness on the balustrade in front of a store and raucous voices rose from one or two secondrate saloons but there were few other signs of life and nasmyth was not sorry when they reached the wooden hotel acton stopped a moment in front of the building  huttons an acquaintance of mine and if you have to apply to men of his kind he is perhaps as reliable as most he said still you want to remember that in this country its every man for himself especially when you undertake a deal in land he smiled suggestively and now well go in and see him  they came upon a man who appeared a little older than nasmyth he was sitting on the veranda which was spacious and had one or two wooden pillars with crude scrollwork attached to them in front acton nodded to the stranger  this is mr nasmyth he said he came up with me doing much round here  the question was abrupt but the man smiled  oh he answered we endeavour to do a little everywhere  then ill leave you to it and look round again byandby i guess i may as well mention that mr nasmyth is coming back with me  acton looked hard at hutton who smiled again oh yes replied hutton i understand that its quite likely well have the thing fixed up in half an hour or so a cigar mr nasmyth  nasmyth took a cigar and went with hutton to the little table which had been set out on the inner side of the veranda with a carafe of icewater and a couple of bottles they sat down at it and hutton took out two letters and glanced at them  now he said well get to work i understand your proposition is to run the water out of the cedar valley whats the area  about four thousand acres available for ranching land though it has never been surveyed  and you want to take up as many acres beforehand as you can and cant quite raise the capital  nasmyth said that was very much the state of affairs and hutton drummed his fingers on the table he was a leanfaced man dressed quietly and precisely in city fashion but he wore a big stone in a ring on one hand which for no very evident reason prejudiced his companion against him  well he averred we might consider going into the thing and finding part of the capital its our business but naturally we would want to be remunerated for the risk its rather a big one you see you would have to take up the whole four thousand acres  then replied nasmyth whats your proposition  well put up what money you cant raise and our surveyor will locate land at present firstclass crown land figure well charge you bank rate until the lands made marketable when you have run the water out in a general way thats my idea of the thing  nasmyth laid down his cigar and looked at him isnt it a little exorbitant you get the land at cost value and a heavy charge on that while i do the work  hutton laughed well he said its money were out for and unless you take it all up your claims no good anybody else could jump right in and buy a few hundred acres then he could locate water rights and stop you running down the river unless you bought him out  the difficulty is that the crown authorities havent been selling land lately and would sooner lease they seem inclined to admit that this is a somewhat exceptional case in fact they have granted me one or two privileges  what you would call a first option  nasmyth remembered actons manner when he had mentioned his acquaintance with his companion and one or two things he had said  no he said not exactly that i merely mentioned certain privileges  then whats to stop me or anybody going right down to victoria and buying the whole thing up tomorrow  im inclined to fancy you would discover one or two things that would make it difficult answered nasmyth dryly for another thing i hardly think you would get any of the regular rockcutting or minesinking people to undertake the work about the fall at a figure that wouldnt make the risk too big its not a place that lends itself to modern methods or the use of machinery besides after approaching you to a certain extent in confidence it wouldnt be quite the thing  hutton waved the hand which bore the ring well he said well get back to our original offer if it isnt good enough how much more do you want  nasmyth explained his views and they discussed each proposition point by point gradually drawing nearer to an agreement nasmyth was quite aware that in a matter of this kind the man who provides the capital usually takes the lions share but after all the project was his and he naturally wanted something for himself at length hutton leaned forward with both elbows on the table and a certain intentness in his lean face  now he said ive gone just about as far as i can you have either got to close with my proposition or let it go  nasmyth said nothing and there was silence for almost a minute while he lay back in his chair gazing at the weathercracked front of the store across the street and thinking hard there was he was quite aware a very arduous task in front of himone that he shrank from at times for it could only be by strenuous toil that he could succeed in lowering the level of the river and it was clear that if he accepted muttons offer his share of the proceeds would not be a large one still he must have more capital than he could see the means of raising and once or twice he was on the point of signifying his concurrence his face grew grimmer and he straightened himself a trifle but he did not see that the man who could supply the money was watching him with a smile  then it seemed to nasmyth that he heard a footstep in the room behind him but it was not particularly noticeable and hutton touched his arm  well said the promoter ill just run over our terms again he did so rapidly and added if that doesnt take you well call it off  nasmyth made a gesture which was vaguely expressive of resignation and in another moment would have closed the bargain but the footsteps grew plainer and as he turned round acton appeared at the open window close behind them he stood still looking at them with amusement in his shrewd eyes and then stepping out dropped heavily into the nearest chair  not through yet i want a drink he said  it was probably not often that hutton was disconcerted but nasmyth saw his fingers close sharply on his cigar which crumpled under them and that appeared significant to him acton looked round again as he filled his glass  when youre ready well go along he suggested you can worry out anything hutton has put before you tonight when ive a matter of consequence on hand i generally like to sleep on it  nasmyth rose and turned to hutton i dont want to keep mr acton and im afraid i cant decide just yet he said ill let you know when i make up my mind  hutton made a sign of concurrence but there was a suggestive frown on his face when he leaned upon the balustrade as nasmyth and acton went down the stairway together when they were halfway down the street acton looked at nasmyth with a dry smile  well he commented you have still got most of the wool on you  nasmyth laughed but there was relief in his voice  i was very nearly doing what i think would have been an unwise thing he said it was fortunate you came along when you did  acton waved his hand im open to admit that hutton has a voice like a boring bit it would go through a door any way its a thing he ought to remember  there is still a point or two i am not very clear upon and nasmyth looked at him steadily  acton smiled again the fact is mrs acton gave me some instructions concerning you she said i was to see you through he made an expressive gesture she seemed to figure it might be advisable  well said nasmyth reflectively i fancy she was right  they said nothing further but nasmyth was unusually thoughtful as they proceeded towards the waterfront     chapter xvii  an eventful day   it was about eleven oclock on a cloudy unsettled morning when nasmyth stood kneedeep in a swirling riverpool holding a landingnet and watching miss hamilton who stood on a neighbouring bank of shingle with a light troutrod in her hand the rod was bent and the thin line which was drawn tense and rigid ripped through the surface of the pool while there was also a suggestion of tension in the pose of the girls figure she was gazing at the moving line with a fine crimson in her cheeks and a brightness in her eyes  oh she cried im afraid im going to lose it after all  nasmyth smiled reassuringly keep the butt well down and your thumb upon the reel he continued you have only to keep on a steady strain  a big silvery object broke the surface a dozen yards away and then while the reel clinked went down again but the line was moving towards nasmyth now and in another minute or two he flung a sharp warning at the girl as he made a sweep with the net then he floundered ashore dripping with the gleaming trout which he laid at her feet  you ran that fish very well he told her in fact there were one or two moments when i never expected you to hold it  the colour grew a little plainer in his companions face though whether this was due to his commendation or to elation at her own success was a question as she had just caught her first big fish it was perhaps the latter  oh she said complacently it isnt so very difficult after all but i wonder what can have become of the others of our party  it was at least an hour since nasmyth had last seen their companions considerably lower down the river he and miss hamilton had pushed on ahead of them into the bush which was a thing they had fallen into the habit of doing the girl sat down on a boulder and seemed to be listening but there was nothing to indicate the presence of any of the party except for the murmur of the river and the sighing among the pinesprays high overhead the bush was very still but it seemed to nasmyth that there was more wind than there had been  i suppose we had better go back to them observed the girl the manner in which she spoke conveyed the impression that she would have been more or less contented to stay where she was with him but next moment she added after all they have the lunch with them and it must have been seven oclock when we breakfasted  yes said nasmyth i think it was still until this minute i had quite forgotten it  i certainly hadnt said violet hamilton i dont think i ever had breakfast at seven oclock in my life until this morning  the fact had its significance to nasmyth it was one of the many little things that emphasized the difference between his life and hers but he brushed it out of his mind and they went back together down the waterside their progress was slow for there was no trail at all and while they laboriously plodded over the shingle or crept in and out among the thickets the wail of the breeze grew louder half an hour had passed when the faint hoot of the tillicums whistle reached them among the trees  what can the skipper be whistling for asked the girl  i fancy the wind is setting inshore moderately fresh and he wants us to come off before it roughens the water said nasmyth  they went on as fast as possible after that though it was remarkably rough travelling but they saw no sign of their companions and the whistle which had shrieked again was silent which evidently meant that the gig had already gone off when they reached the inlet the river fell into and found only the tillicums dinghy lying on the shingle nasmyth looking down the lane of smooth green water somewhat anxiously noticed that the sea was flecked with white the tillicum as he remembered was also lying well out from the beach  we had better get off at once he said the breeze is freshening and this dinghy isnt very big  he helped the girl into the boat and when he had thrust the little craft off sent her flying down the riband of sheltered water but he set his lips and braced himself for an effort when they slid out past a point of frothlapped shingle there was already a whitetopped sea running and the spray from the oarblades and the dinghys bows blew aft into his companions face in stinging wisps as he drove the plunging craft over it now and then an odd bucketful of brine came in and hit him on the back while miss hamilton who commenced to get very wet shivered and drew her feet up as the water gathered deeper in the bottom of the boat  im afraid i must ask you to throw some of that water out he said there is a can to scoop it up with  the girl made an attempt to do so but it was not surprising that in a few minutes when the dinghy lurched viciously she let the can slip from her fingers nasmyth set his lips tighter and his face was anxious as he glanced over his shoulder the sea was whiteflecked between him and the tillicum which lay rolling wildly farther down the beach at least half a mile away it already taxed all nasmyths strength to drive the dinghy off shore and every sea that broke a little more sharply than the rest splashed into the boat he held on for another few minutes glancing over his shoulder and pulling cautiously for it was evident that he might fill the dinghy up or roll her over if he failed to swing neatly over the crest of some tumbling comber in spite of his efforts a wave broke on board and sitting ankledeep in water he waited until there was a slightly smoother patch in front of him and then swung the dinghy round  im afraid well have to make for the beach he announced  he would have preferred to head for the inlet but that would have brought the little white seas which were rapidly getting steeper dangerously on her beam and the thrust of one beneath her side probably would have been sufficient to turn the diminutive craft over he accordingly pulled straight for the beach before the wind and the perspiration dripped from his set face as he strove to hold the dinghy straight when with the foam boiling white about her she swung up on the crest of a comber once or twice nasmyth glanced at violet hamilton reassuringly but she sat halfcrouching against the transom gazing forward white in face with her wet hair whipping about her nasmyth had not noticed it before but her hat had evidently gone over speech was out of the question he wanted all his breath and recognized that it was not advisable to divert his attention for a moment from his task for it depends very largely upon the man at the oars whether a diminutive dinghy keeps right side uppermost in any weight of breeze once or twice he risked a glance at the approaching land  sombre forest rolled down to the waters edge and he could see that there was already a broad ribbon of frothy whiteness beneath it while so far as he had noticed that beach consisted of rock ledges and very large boulders it was about the last place he would have chosen to make a landing on in a light and fragile dinghy  after that he looked resolutely astern over his companions shoulders as she swung up between him and the sea with the slategreen ridges and tumbling white tops of the combers behind her at length a hazarded glance showed him that they were close inshore and he wondered for a moment whether he could swing the dinghy round without rolling the boat over he did not think it could be done and set his lips as he let her go careering on a combers crest with at least half her length out of the water  then there was a white upheaval close alongside and for a moment a black mass of stone appeared amidst the leaping foam they swept by it and he gasped with relief as he looked at miss hamilton  get hold of me when she strikes he said  the dinghy swung round twisting broadsideon with the brine pouring into her in spite of all that he could do and while he tore at one oar another white sea that curled menacingly rose up astern it broke right into the boat and in another moment there was a crash and nasmyth who let the oars drop stretched out his arms to the girl he jumped when she clutched him and found himself standing amid the swirling froth on what seemed to be a ledge of very slippery stone with both arms about her while the crushedin dinghy swept up among the foamlapped boulders he sprang down from the stone as another sea came in and floundered ashore waistdeep with it after which he set his dripping companion down upon the beach  im afraid youre rather wet he said when he got his breath again still i really couldnt help it there was a good deal more sea than i had expected  miss hamilton who sat down on a boulder with the water dripping from her skirt looked ruefully at him and the dinghy which was rolling over in the surf  how are we going to get off she inquired  not in that dinghy any way answered nasmyth she has knocked all one bilge in theyll probably send the tillicums gig ashore for us byandby  but shes going away said the girl with a gasp of consternation  nasmyth who turned round saw that this was certainly the case a cloud of steam blew away from beside the yachts funnel and in another moment the shriek of a whistle reached him  i dont think we need worry about that he remarked they evidently watched us get ashore you see with the breeze freshening she couldnt very well lie where she was still if i remember theres an inlet a couple of leagues or so away along the coast where shed find shelter  but why didnt they send for us first  the trouble is that there is really a nasty sea and they couldnt very well take us off if they knocked a big hole in the gig i fancy the wisest thing would be to walk towards that inlet along the beach  they set off when nasmyth had pulled the dinghy out but the beach was strewn with driftwood which was difficult to flounder over as well as very rough they made no greater progress when they tried the bush fallen trees lay across one another and there were thorny thickets in between while here and there the undergrowth seemed as impenetrable as a wall byandby it commenced to rain and for an hour or two they plodded on dejectedly through the pitiless deluge it rains exceedingly hard in that country at last the girl sat down on a fallen tree she had already lost her hat and the water soaked out of nasmyths jacket which he had tied by the arms about her shoulders her drenched skirt clung about her rent to tatters and one of her little shoes was caked with mire the other gaped open  how far have we gone she asked  about a league answered nasmyth quietly i think we could make the inlet in another two hours that is if the beach isnt very much rougher  the girl leaned against a branch wearily im afraid i cant go a step further she replied with trembling lips  the rain beat upon them and nasmyth stood still a moment looking at her  well he said we really cant stay here since there seems no other way i think i could carry you  his diffidence was evident and violet smiled have you ever carried anybodya distancebefore she asked  no said nasmyth i certainly havent  then i dont think there would be much use in trying you couldnt carry me for more than four or five minutes that wouldnt be worth while would it  nasmyth said nothing for a minute or two for he felt compassionate as well as a trifle confused he had in fact already discovered that there are occasions when a young woman is apt to show greater selfpossession and look facts in the face more plainly than a man then he set to work furiously with a branch which he tore from the fallen tree ripping off rough slabs of bark and in the course of half an hour had constructed a shelter about the base of a cedar it at least kept the rain off when violet sat under it  it might be as well if i pushed on for the inlet and brought george or acton back with me he suggested we could make something to carry you in if there was too much sea for the gig  a flush crept into the girls face and she looked at him reproachfully  how could i stay here alone she asked dont say those foolish things come in out of the rain  the bark shelter would just hold the two of them and nasmyth dripping sat down close beside her she looked very forlorn  im sorry for you he said awkwardly  the girl showed faint signs of temper you have told me that before why dont you do something you said you had lived in the bush and now you have only been a few hours in it it was seven oclock when we had breakfast cant you even make a fire  im afraid i cant answered nasmyth deprecatingly you see one has usually an axe and some matches as well as a few other odds and ends when one lives in the bush a man is a wretchedly helpless being when he has only his hands  the fact was borne in upon violet forcibly as she glanced out at the wet beach tumbling sea and dreary dripping bush the bush rolled back a long succession of straggling pines that rose one behind the other in sombre ranks to the rugged hills that cut against the hazy sky there was no doubt all that man required to provide him with warmth and food and shelter in that forest but it was certain that it was only by continuous and arduous toil that he could render it available indeed since he could not make himself an axe or a saw or a rifle it was also evident that his efforts would be fruitless unless backed by the toil of others who played their part in the great scheme of human cooperation  it is however probable that violet did not concern herself with this aspect of the matter but she had led a sheltered life and it was curiously disconcerting to find herself brought suddenly face to face with primitive realities she was wet through and worn out and although evening was not far away she had eaten nothing since seven oclock that morning the momentary petulance deserted her  oh she cried they maynt be able to send off for us for perhaps a day or two  it is quite likely that the breeze will drop at sunset nasmyth replied cheerfully these westerly breezes often do anyway the rain seems to be stopping and i may be able to dry my matches in the meanwhile i might come across something to eat there are oysters on some of these beaches  violet glanced at the bush apprehensively and once more it was evident that she did not wish him to leave her this sent a little thrill of satisfaction through him and although he halfconsciously contrasted her with laura waynefleet it was not altogether to her disadvantage it is a curious fact that some men and probably women too feel more drawn to the persons upon whom they confer a benefit than to those from whom they receive one laura waynefleet he realized would have urged him to make some attempt to reach the tillicum and in all probability would have insisted on taking a share in it while his companion desired only to lean on him after all lauras attitude was more pleasant to the subconscious vanity that was in his nature and in this respect he probably differed but little from most of his fellows  you wont be very long away she said  nasmyth reassured her upon this point and floundered down to the beach where he carefully laid out to dry the little block of sulphur matches that he carried then he crawled among the boulders near lowwater mark and since oysters are tolerably plentiful along those beaches succeeded in collecting several dozen of them after that he sat down and gazed seaward for a minute or two there was no sign of the tillicum only a strip of dingy slategreen sea smeared with streaks of froth which shone white beneath a heavy lowering sky close in front of him the sea hove itself up in rows of foamcrested ridges which fell upon the boulders and swirled over them and among them a furious white seething he fancied that it was near sunset and it was clear that the breeze was a little lighter it seemed to him just possible that four capable seamen might keep the gig afloat close enough to the beach for one to wade out to her though there would be a certain peril in such a proceeding still there were not four capable seamen on board the tillicum  gathering up his matches which had dried nasmyth went back to the bark shelter he was pleasantly conscious of the relief in miss hamiltons eyes when he reached it and fancied that she was too overwrought and anxious to care whether he noticed it or not but he set about making a fire and she helped him to collect brittle undergrowth and fallen branches then they sat down and ate the oysters that he had laid among the embers he thought they were not in season and they were certainly burnt and shrivelled as well as somewhat gritty but one is glad to eat anything after a long day of exertion and nasmyth watched his companion with quiet appreciation as she handled the rough shells daintily with little delicate fingers her evident reliance upon him had its effect  he carried an armful of branches to the beach and started another fire where it could be seen from seawards after which he went back and sat outside the shelter near miss hamilton while darkness crept up from the eastwards across the bush it grew dim and solemn and the doleful wailing of the pines was curiously impressive the girl shivered  the wind is very chilly she said with a tremor in her voice you will stay here where i can see you you wont go away  only to keep up the fire on the beach nasmyth answered reassuringly  she crept into the shelter and he could see her dimly when the flickering light blazed up but he could never remember how many journeys he made to the fire upon the beach before his eyes grew heavy as he sat amid the whirling smoke he endeavoured to keep awake and resolutely straightened himself once or twice but at last his eyes closed altogether and he did not hear the shriek of the tillicums whistle ring far across the shadowy bush indeed he did not waken when acton and wisbech came floundering into the light of the fire and the two men looked at each other when they stopped beside it and saw him lying there and then discovered the girl inside the shelter acton raised his hand warningly while a faint twinkle crept into his eyes  i guess theres no reason why anybody else should hear of this he said it seems to me that miss hamilton would be just as well pleased if we were not around when she awakens  he stooped and shook nasmyths shoulder as wisbech disappeared among the shadows  get up said acton wait until i get away and then waken her  it was a minute before nasmyth who stood up stiffly quite understood him and then the blood rose to his face as he crept into the shelter and touched the girl she sprang to her feet with a little cry and clutched his arm then she suddenly let her hand fall back and her cheeks flushed crimson  the steamers close by said nasmyth reassuringly they have sent for us at last  they went out together and it was a minute or two later when they came upon wisbech and acton in the bush nasmyth entered into confused explanations as they proceeded towards the beach the sky was a little lighter when they reached it and standing near the sinking fire they could dimly see the gig plunging amidst the froth and spray then georges voice reached them  cant you let us have them mr acton its most all we can do to keep her off the beach he said  acton glanced at the strip of tumbling foamthrough which he had waded waistdeepbetween them and the boat and nasmyth turned towards miss hamilton who to his astonishment recoiled from him acton however made him a sign of command  i guess he said shed be safer with you  nasmyth said nothing but he picked the girl up as unconcernedly as he could for the second time that day and staggered down the rough beach with her he contrived to keep his footing when a frothing sea broke against him and floundering through the seething water reached the lurching boat george seized his burden and gently deposited it in one of the seats scrambling on board nasmyth groped for an oar and in another minute or two they laboriously drove the gig out towards the blinking lights of the tillicum     chapter xviii  tranquillity   the afternoon was very hot when nasmyth plodded down a steep hillside through the thick red dust of the waggon trail a fire had swept the undergrowth away and there was no shade among the trees which stripped of their branches towered about him great charred and blackened columns close ahead the primeval bush rose in an unbroken sombre mass and nasmyth who quickened his pace a trifle sat down with a gasp of satisfaction when he reached the first of the shadow it was fresh and cool there the bush was scented with the odours of pine and cedar and filled with the soft murmur of falling water while he knew that just beyond it bonavista stood above the sparkling sea  he was on his way from the railroad depôt it was just a fortnight since he had left the tillicum at the little mining town on the day after the one he and violet hamilton had spent on the beach and he had not seen her before he went now he fancied that a welcome awaited him and he felt sincerely pleased to be back again as he sat beneath a great cedar filling his pipe it seemed to him only appropriate that he should approach bonavista through that belt of cool sweetscented bush it made it easier to feel that he had left behind him all that associated him with the strife and bustle of the hot and noisy cities at bonavista were leisure comfort and tranquillity which were after all things that made a strong appeal to one side of his nature and he had made no progress in the city there was also no doubt that both mr and mrs acton were glad to entertain him for a time he sat still a few minutes and then went on slowly beneath the towering redwoods and cedars until he came out of the forest and saw the sunlight stream down on the shingled roof of bonavista close ahead  the house appeared to be empty and he had shed his dusty city clothes in his room and had dressed again before he came upon mrs acton sitting half asleep on a secluded strip of veranda she roused herself and smiled when she saw him  so you have come back at last we have been expecting you all the past week she said  that returned nasmyth was remarkably good of you in fact i have wondered now and then with some misgivings whether you have not seen too much of me already  mrs acton laughed you neednt worry yourself on that point we have all our little hobbies my husbands is the acquisition of dollars and the opening of mines and mills mine is the amusing of my friends or rather the permitting them to amuse themselves which is why i had bonavista built i make only one stipulationit is that when you stay with us you are amused  with a little sigh of content nasmyth settled himself in a canvas chair and glanced out between the slender pillars of the cool veranda at the wall of dusky forest and the flashing sea  ah he replied can you doubt it my dear lady after logging camp and mine and city this is an enchanted land i think it is always summer afternoon at bonavista  mrs acton smiled at him graciously that she observed was quite nice of you things havent gone just as you would have liked them to go in the city  they havent admitted nasmyth whimsically as a matter of fact they very seldom do still i wouldnt like you to think that was the only reason i am glad to get back  mrs actons eyes twinkled i imagine i am acquainted with the other you were rather tactful in going away  i went because mr acton handed me a letter which said that a business man in victoria would like a talk with me  in any case miss hamilton seems to be under the impression that it was nice of you  nice of me to go away and nasmyths tone was mildly reproachful  one would not resent a desire to save one any little embarrassment  still observed nasmyth with an air of reflection the trouble is that i couldnt contrive to keep out of her sight continually even if i wanted to andhe lowered his voice confidentiallyas it happens i dont  mrs acton laughed i dont know of any particular reason why you should do that violet has probably quite recovered her equanimity and decided on her attitude towards you then she changed the subject abruptly i wonder if i may point out that there has been a change in you since my husband brought you here for one thing you are much more amusing even your voice is different  nasmyth bowed but not my hands he said and as he held up one hand she noticed the scars on it and the coarseness of his nails that tells a tale i think my dear lady i scarcely think you quite realize all that you have given me you have never seen how we lived in the lonely logging campspacked like cattle in a reeking shedand you do not know the grim side of our life in the bush it would be no great use to tell you that i have now and then limped for days together over the ballast of a railroad track wondering where my next dollar was to come from these are the things one could not expect you to understand  mrs actons face softened a little still i think my husband does she replied then she smiled at him it almost seems to me that you need never go back to that life again unless you like it i mean of course that for one thing your uncle has his views concerning you he has to some extent taken mr acton into his confidence  nasmyth made no comment and mrs acton sank down a little further into her long chair the others are down on the beach she announced drowsily i really think i was going to sleep when you made your appearance  nasmyth could take a hint and he strolled away down the veranda stairway and around the edge of the wide clearing in the shadow of the bush until he stood looking down upon the sea from the crown of the bluff then he felt a little thrill for some twenty or thirty feet beneath him was a patch of something white in the shadow of the shrubbery he went down quietly until he stopped and stooping touched violet hamiltons shoulder she looked around with a start and a faint trace of embarrassment crept into her face at the sight of him  oh she said i thought you were in victoria  nasmyth stretched himself out upon a ledge of rock near her feet mrs acton was good enough to imply that she had been expecting me more or less anxiously for several days he rejoined in a tone of reproach in fact she used the plural pronoun which led me to believe that somebody else must have shared her anxiety she did not however point out who it was that she meant  her husband in all probability she could at least speak for him  nasmyth appeared to ponder over this though his heart was beating faster than usual for the suggestion of confusion which he had noticed in the girls manner had its significance for him  well he conceded it may have been acton but i almost ventured to believe she meant somebody else in any case i shouldnt like to think you were displeased at my reappearance if you are i can of course go away again  i am not the only person at bonavista wouldnt anybody elses wishes countmr actons for instance  no asserted nasmyth reflectively at least not to anything like the same extent  violet laughed the difficulty is that nobody can tell how much you really mean you are so seldom serious she cast a quick glance at him you were not like that when you first came here  then said nasmyth you can blame it on bonavista as i have been trying to explain to mrs acton who made a similar observation there is glamour in this air it gets hold of one i was no doubt a tediously solemn person when i left the bush but you will remember that soon after i arrived here you and i sailed out together into the realms of moonlight and mystery i sometimes feel that i must have brought a little of the latter back with me  violet said nothing for half a minute during which she lay resting on one elbow looking down upon the cool green flashing of the water a hundred feet below and again nasmyth felt a little thrill run through him she was so very dainty in speech and thought and person a woman of the world he had once belonged to and which it now seemed he might enter again her delicately chiselled halfaverted face matched the slight but finely moulded figure about which the thin white draperies clung she turned and looked at him  you certainly cant be serious now she declared  i assure you that when i mentioned the glamour and mystery i was never half so serious in my life they are after all very real things  he was as a matter of fact grimly serious for the moment as he wondered at the change that had come over him his life in the silent bush the struggle with the icy river and even laura waynefleet who had encouraged him in his work of rehabilitation had by degrees become no more than a dim blurred memory he knew that he could recall it all but he had no wish to make the effort for it was more pleasant to hear the sighing of the summer wind about the firs of bonavista and wonder languidly what his companion thought  i havent thanked you for taking care of me the day we were left behind on the beach said violet  nasmyth made a sign of protest i dont think you are under any very great obligation to me as a matter of fact my efforts on your behalf nearly resulted in my drowning you besides you see there was really not the slightest cause for uneasiness acton certainly would have sent for us when the wind dropped  but it might have blown for days  then said nasmyth with a twinkle in his eyes we would have lived on salmon and berries until it stopped one really can live on them for a considerable time though they are not remarkably palatable when one has anything else to eat in fact its a thing ive done  salmon is not esteemed in that country except for the purpose of sending east in cans and it is seldom that anybody eats it except the indians there is probably no diet that more rapidly grows satiating  ah exclaimed the girl with a shiver it would have been horrible  she was evidently not thinking of the salmon but of the dreary dripping bush and nasmyth looked at her with reproach in his eyes  i really dont think it would have been he said in fact i believe we could have lived there for a little while very contentedlythat is when i had fixed things up a bit after all there is a certain glamour in the bush when one gets used to it  he saw the faint colour creep into her face and though it cost him an effort laid a restraint upon himself  well he said i at least would not have felt that i had any cause to complain though no doubt it would have been different with you you seeand he made an expressive gesturei have had a long tough tussle since i came to canada and experiences of that sort have their effect on one in fact they set one apart from those who havent undergone them it seems to have struck you that i was prematurely solemn and serious when i came to bonavista  he thought he saw sympathy in violet hamiltons eyes and her next observation made it clear that her mind was busy with the suggestion that he had conveyed  after all she said softly you cannot be very much older than i am  four years perhaps returned nasmyth with a trace of grimness that is in one sense in another i think i am double your age you see you have never been brought into contact with the realities of life if you had been you would probably not be so ready to take me for what you think i am as i believe you have graciously done after all you know so very little about me  he felt that he was doing no more than discharging an obligation in giving her this warning he desired to afford her every opportunity of satisfying herself concerning him for he was not a fool and he had seen for a moment or two a suggestive softness in her face it is possible that she did not know it had been there but he felt that if he roused himself and made the effort he might sweep away the barriers between them  violet appeared troubled by his words she sat silent while nasmyth wondered what she would say he was aware that a good deal depended upon her next remark then there were footsteps on the slope behind them and turning suddenly he saw acton and another man approaching them he rose with a little start when he recognized the second man as gordon who was neatly attired in city clothes gordon looked down at nasmyth with a faint sardonic smile  mr gordon turned up half an hour ago acton said it appears that he was going into the city and got off the cars to talk over things with you i believe he had a notion of going on again tonight but mrs acton wont hear of it  gordon bowed in the direction of his host  id have put up a more vigorous protest against troubling mrs acton than i did if i had felt it would have been of any use he said  well replied acton smiling i guess theyll be getting supper ready and we were sent here to bring our friend and miss hamilton in  they went back to the house together where they found the long table spread it was characteristic of the owner of bonavista that he still called the evening meal supper there were besides nasmyth and wisbech five or six other guests from victoria and one of the rising cities on puget sound and gordon speedily made himself very much at home most of his new acquaintances found what he had to say entertaining but miss hamilton was as nasmyth noticed somewhat silent nasmyth on his part felt slightly restless for his old comrades presence had an unsettling effect on him it was however not until an hour or two later that he and gordon were able to discuss their own affairs they sat on the veranda looking down upon the sea while the dusk slowly crept up from the east  now said gordon i should like to hear what you have done  im afraid its not a great deal replied nasmyth the crown land authorities appear disposed to sell the land instead of leasing it which of late has been the more usual course but they insist on counting a certain proportion of the hillside and big timber in i may get one or two concessions and im still keeping the affair before them in the meanwhile ive been seeing what can be done to raise enough capital to take up all the land but havent met with any great success the folks ive been in communication with as usual want all the profit in fact i almost fancy it might be as well to raise what money we can around the settlement and content ourselves with locating a portion of the valley  gordon nodded you cant do much about the fall until after the autumn freshets anyway and theres a good deal you cant get at until the frost sets in he declared in the meanwhile the offers wheeler and i made you hold  they discussed the matter until mrs acton appeared on the veranda and shook her head at them  what are you two doing here when there are pretty girls in the house waiting for a dance she inquired  im afraid we have been very remiss apologized nasmyth when they joined her still we didnt know and we had some business to talk about  there will be plenty of time for that tomorrow  the trouble is that i shall be in the city then said gordon  mrs acton laughed oh no she contradicted we are all going for a sail on the straits tomorrow and we certainly expect you to join us in the meanwhile i believe there are two young women waiting for partners  she silenced gordons objections as they turned back towards the house they found the dancing had commenced and nasmyth failed to secure miss hamilton as a partner for any time in the evening he could not help a fancy that she had taken some little trouble to bring about this result     chapter xix  nasmyth hears the river   darkness had settled down on bonavista next evening when nasmyth lay in a canvas chair on the veranda while gordon leaned against the balustrade in front of him with a cigar in his hand a blaze of light streamed out from one of the long open windows a few yards away and somebody was singing in the room behind it while the splash of the gentle surf came up from the foot of the promontory in a deep monotone now and then a shadowy figure strolled into the veranda or crossed it to the terrace below but for the time being nobody disturbed the two men  i havent had a word with you since last night said nasmyth how are the boys at the settlement  hustling along as usual gordon laughed is there anybody else you feel inclined to ask about  yes said nasmyth there certainly is how is miss waynefleet  gordon looked down at his cigar well he said im a little worried on her account she was attempting to do a great deal more than was good for her when i last saw her they have no longer a hired man at the ranch waynefleet i understand is rather tightly fixed for money and as you know he isnt the kind of man who would deny himself he was talking of selling some stock  nasmyth suddenly straightened himself and closed one hand rather hard on the arm of his chair  what right have you and i to be lounging here when that girl is working late and early on the ranch he asked gordon you will have to buy two or three head of that stock at double value for me  its rather a big question and gordons tone was serious in fact i fancy its one that neither you nor i can throw much light upon anyway i may as well point out that i arrived here only yesterday and im going on again in the morning as to the other matter laura waynefleet has friends who will stand by her  dont you count me one of them nasmyth demanded that girl saved my life for me  gordon glanced round sharply for there were light footsteps on the veranda and he almost imagined that a white figure in filmy draperies stopped a moment it however went on again and vanished in the shadow  i believe she did he admitted well if theres anything that can be done you may rely on me he made an abrupt gesture and as he turned the light from the window fell upon his face showing the curious smile on it what are you doing here  he flung the question at his comrade and nasmyth who knew what he meant sat for a moment or two with wrinkled forehead there was no reason why he should not stay there so long as mr and mrs acton desired his company but it did not seem fitting that he should spend those summer days in luxurious idleness while laura waynefleet toiled late and early at the lonely ranch again he seemed to see her steady eyes with the quiet courage in them and the gleam of her redgold hair even then she was he reflected in all probability occupied with some severe drudgery it was a thing he did not like to contemplate and he almost resented the fact that gordon should have brought such thoughts into his mind his comrade had broken in upon his contentment like a frosty wind that stung him to action still he answered quietly  i am within easy reach of the city here he explained acton who has once or twice given me good advice is acquainted with most of the folks likely to be of any use to us and has laid the scheme before one or two of them that at least is one reason why i am staying at bonavista its perfectly evident that it wouldnt be any benefit to miss waynefleet if i went back to the bush  no agreed gordon grimly if you were likely to be of any use or consolation to her youd go if i had to drag you  nasmyth smiled he was too well acquainted with his comrades manner to take offence at this remark and the mans devotion to the girl who he knew would never regard him as more than a friend also had its effect  well he said since plain speaking seems admissible you are probably aware that laura waynefleet has nothing beyond a kindly interest in me she is i neednt point out a remarkably sensible young lady  he stopped somewhat abruptly for wisbech emerged from the shadows beneath the pillars and sat down in a chair close by  yes said wisbech i heard and it seems to me derricks right in one respect though i dont know how far it accounts for the other fact he has just impressed on you miss waynefleet certainly possesses a considerable amount of sense she is also a young lady i have a high opinion of still if he had gone back to the bush merely because you insisted on it i think i should have cast him off  gordon appeared to ponder over this and he then laughed softly its quite natural and i guess i sympathize with you he remarked in one way however your nephews acquitting himself creditably considering that there are apparently three people anxious to exert a beneficent influence upon him the effect of that kind of thing is apt to become a trifle bewildering especially as its evident their views cant invariably coincide  three said wisbech with a twinkle in his eyes if you count me in i almost fancy there are four  nasmyth said nothing though he felt his face grow hot gordon smiled  as a matter of fact he admitted i had a notion that miss hamilton resented my being here any way she didnt take any very noticeable trouble to be pleasant to me today no doubt she considers any influence she may choose to exert should be quite sufficient  it should be said nasmyth that is to any man who happened to be a judge of character and had eyes in his head  gordon waved one hand oh he averred shes very dainty and i think theres a little more than prettiness there which is a very liberal admission since im troubled with an impression that she isnt quite pleased with me still when the woods are full of pretty girls i guess its wisest of a man who has anything worth while to do in front of him to keep his eyes right on the trail and go steadily ahead he turned to wisbech deprecatingly we dont mind you sir we regard you as part of the concern  thanks said wisbech with a certain dryness i believe i am interested in itat least financially  well said gordon when i break loose as i do now and then i quite often say a little more than is strictly advisable without meaning to its a habit some folks have your observation however switches us off on to a different matter ive been telling your nephew we leave him to handle the thing and stand by our offers  that is precisely what i mean to do the affair is derricks he must take his own course declared wisbech  gordon grinned as he turned to nasmyth there will be no reinforcements you have to win your spurs then he looked at wisbech if you will not be offended sir i would like to say im pleased to notice that your ideas coincide with mine hell be the tougher afterwards if you let him put up his fight alone  the assurance is naturally satisfactory said wisbech with quiet amusement then he held up one hand it seems to me the person at the piano is playing exceptionally well  they sat silent while the crashing opening chords rang out from the lighted room and then nasmyth who was a lover of music found himself listening with a strained attention as the theme stole out of them for it chimed with his mood he had been restless and disturbed in mind before gordon had flung his veiled hints at him and the reality underlying his comrades badinage had a further unsettling effect he did not know what the music was but it seemed in keeping with the throb of the sea against the crag and the fitful wailing of the pines there was a suggestion of effort and struggle in it and it seemed to him something that spoke of a great dominant force steadily pressing on and as he listened the splash of the sea grew fainter and he heard instead the roar of the icy flood and the crash of mighty trees driving down upon his halfbuilt dam these were sounds which sometimes haunted him against his will and once or twice he had been a little surprised to find that now that they were past he could look back upon the months of tense effort with a curious halfregretful pleasure he was relieved when the music that swelled in a sonorous crescendo stopped and he saw gordon glance at wisbech  i think that man has understanding and the gift of expressing what he feels said wisbech the music suggested something to you  the fast freight confessed gordonwhen shes coming down the big cañon under a full head of steam i dont know if thats quite an elegant simile in one way still if you care to think how that track was built its not difficult to fancy theres triumph in the whistles and the roar of the freightcar wheels  wisbech made a sign of comprehension and gordon looked hard at nasmyth its your call  i heard the river said nasmyth in fact i often hear it and now and then wish i didnt its unsettling  gordon laughed in a suggestive fashion well he declared most of us hear something of that kind at times and no doubt its just as well we do its apt to have results if you listen you have been most of a month in the city one way or another you took to it kindly  i didnt nasmyth answered and it was evident that he was serious i came back here feeling that i had had quite enough of it  bonavista is a good deal more pleasant and there was a certain meaning in gordons tone you seemed to have achieved some social success here too  he saw the flush in nasmyths face and his gaze grew insistent well he said youre not going to let that content you now you can hear the river youll hear it more and more plainly frothing in the black cañon where the big trees come down you have lived with the exiles and the wilderness has got its grip on you whats more i guess when it does that it never quite lets go  he broke off abruptly and just then acton stepped out from the window mr gordon he said its my wifes wish that you should come in and sing  gordon said that he was in mrs actons hands and then turned to nasmyth  ive had my say he observed if theres any meaning in my remarks you can worry it out  he went away with acton and wisbech looked at his nephew over his cigar  mr gordon expresses himself in a rather extravagant fashion but im disposed to fancy there is something in what he says he commented  nasmyth did not answer him he was on the whole glad that gordon had gone but he still seemed to hear the river and the restlessness that had troubled him was becoming stronger he retired somewhat early but he did not sleep quite so soundly as usual that night as it happened gordon rose before him next morning gordon went out of doors and presently came upon miss hamilton who was strolling bareheaded where the early sunshine streamed in among the pines it struck him that he was not the person whom she would have been most pleased to see but she walked with him to the crown of the promontory where she stopped and looked up at him steadily  mr gordon she inquired what is laura waynefleet  gordon started and the girl smiled  i crossed the veranda last night she told him when he hesitated before answering her  the man looked down on her with an unusual gravity well he said simply laura waynefleet is quietness and sweetness and courage in fact i sometimes think it was to make these things evident that she was sent into this world  he thought he saw a gleam of comprehension in the girls eyes and made a gesture of protest no he assured her im not fit to brush her little shoes for that matter though he is my comrade nasmyth isnt either what is perhaps more to the purpose i guess he is quite aware of it  a delicate tinge of colour crept into violet hamiltons face and the man realized that in case his suppositions were correct what he had implied could hardly be considered as a compliment he could also fancy that there was a certain uneasiness in her eyes  ah she said perhaps it is a subject i should not have ventured to inquire into  gordon smiled reassuringly i dont know of any reason why you shouldnt have done so but i have scarcely told you anything about her yet miss waynefleet lives at a desolate ranch in the bush sometimes she drives oxen and i believe she invariably makes her own clothes i dont think nasmyth would feel any great diffidence in speaking about her  he believed this or at least he strove to convince himself that he did but he was relieved when the appearance of acton who strolled towards them rendered any further confidential conversation out of the question gordon set out for victoria that afternoon and nasmyth who went with him to the railroad returned to bonavista in a restless mood and almost disposed to be angry with his comrade for having rudely broken in upon his tranquillity in fact he felt disinclined to face his fellowguests which was one reason why he was sauntering towards the inlet when he came upon wisbech sitting with a book in the shadow of the pines wisbech looked up at his moody face  you are annoyed because gordon wouldnt stay he suggested  no said nasmyth in fact im a little relieved that he has gone away i naturally like gordon but just now he has an unsettling effect on me  wisbech made a gesture of comprehension that man he said is in some respects fortunate he has a simple programme and is evidently more or less content with it his work is plain in front of him you are not quite sure about yours yet to some extent you feel yourself adrift  i have felt something of the kind  wisbech thought for a moment i suppose he said it hasnt occurred to you that your classical featurestheyre nasmyth featuresmight be of some assistance to you in your career  nasmyth felt the blood rise into his face but he laughed they certainly havent proved of any great benefit to me hitherto it is scarcely likely that they will do so either in the cañon  then you are still determined on directing operations in person i was commencing to wonder if you had any reason for modifying your plans  the mans tone was dry but nasmyth met his gaze which was now inquisitive  if it is in my power to do it i shall certainly run the water out of the valley said nasmyth  then he swung round and strolled away while wisbech smiled in a fashion which suggested that he was pleased it was some little time later when nasmyth pacing moodily over the white shingle beside the winding inlet came upon violet hamilton sitting in the shadow of a great boulder the girls light dress matched the rocks pale tinting and he did not see her until he was within a yard or two of her he stopped abruptly with a deepened colour in his face violet made a sign which seemed to invite him to sit down and he stretched himself out upon the shingle close in front of her  it is very hot in the house this afternoon but it is cool and quiet here she observed  nasmyth glanced at the still water and the shadow that the pines which clung in the crevices flung athwart the dark rocks side  stillness sometimes means stagnation miss hamilton he said  the girl flashed a quick glance at him well she rejoined i suppose it does but after all that is a question we need not discuss what were you thinking of so hard as you came along you didnt see me until you almost stepped upon my dress  that said nasmyth with a laugh is proof that i was thinking very hard indeed its not a thing i often indulge in but i was thinking of the bush  you sometimes feel you would like to be back there  no answered nasmyth reflectively i suppose i ought to feel that but im not sure that i do  ah violet remarked you have told me a good deal at one time or another about your life and friends there but i almost fancied now and then that you were keeping something back after alland she smiled at himi suppose that would have been only natural  nasmyth raised himself on one elbow and looked hard at her well he admitted there was one thing i did not tell you though i had meant to do so sooner or later you see there was nothing to warrant it in the meanwhile  ah queried the girl it concerns miss waynefleet  nasmyths face grew suddenly grave he did not ask himself how she came to know indeed for the time being that did not seem to matter there was it seemed only one course open to him and he adopted it  yes he answered i will tell you about her  he had meant to be brief and matteroffact in his narrative but as he proceeded the subject carried him away indeed he was scarcely conscious that miss hamilton was intently watching him for once more he seemed to feel laura waynefleets eyes fixed upon his face and they were clear and brave and still he spoke with a certain dramatic force and it was a somewhat striking picture he drew of the girl violet could realize her personality and the selfdenying life that she led it is possible that nasmyth had told her more than he intended when he broke off for a moment with a startling abruptness  i believe she saved my life he added she certainly gave me back my courage and set me on my feet again  violet looked at him with a strained expression in her eyes and because of that she will have a hold upon you while you live  nasmyth seemed to consider this i think i shall always realize what i owe to her stilland how shall i say itthat recognition is the most i would venture to offer or that she would accept from me  he stopped for a moment and then went on a trifle hastily laura waynefleet could never have taken more than a halfcompassionate interest in me he asserted there could scarcely be any doubt upon that point  you said halfcompassionate  yes replied nasmyth i almost think that describes it you see i am naturally aware of my own disabilities  still persisted violet she nursed you when you were very ill and as you said set you on your feet again that would probably count for a good deal with her  nasmyth made a hasty gesture you dont understand she would no doubt have taken pity on any dumb creature she did it because she could not help it one could fancy that kind of thing was born in her  violet did not speak for a moment or two although it still remained uncertain whether the girl in the bush had any tenderness for the man she had set upon his feet again he had spoken of her in a manner which did not quite please violet  well she ventured with a little diffident glance at him some day you will go back into the bush  nasmyth nodded yes he said i think thats certain in fact its probable that i shall go back very soon as it happens i have undertaken a big and rather difficult thing which will give me a considerable lift up if i am successful  he lay silent for a minute before he turned to her again you see i have been some time in this country and never have done anything worth mentioning chopping trees and driving cattle are no doubt useful occupations but they dont lead to anything i feel that i am so to speak on my probation i have still to win my spurs  i wonder if that is one of the ideas miss waynefleet gave you  nasmyth smiled i really believe it originated with her but as a matter of fact it might have gone no further which is an admission still the desire to win those spurs has been growing so strong of late that i cant resist it in one way i scarcely think that is very astonishing  violet looked away from him for she saw the gleam in his eyes and fancied she understood what the new motive he had hinted at might be still he did not appear disposed to mention it  then you would have to go away she asked  a flush crept into nasmyths face she was a woman of his own caste and probably without intending it she had shown him in many ways that she was not averse from him he felt his heart beat fast when for a moment she met his gaze  the trouble is that if i do not go i shall never have the right to come back again he told her  then replied the girl very softly you wish to come back  that is why i am going there are those spurs to win i have to make my mark  but it is sometimes a little difficult to make ones mark isnt it you may be ever so long and it must be a little hazardous in that horrible cañon  if it gives me the right to come back i think it will be very well worth while  but suppose you dont succeed after all  that admitted nasmyth is a thing i darent contemplate because if it happened it is scarcely likely that any of my friends at bonavista would ever be troubled with me again  violet looked away from him ah she said dont you think that would be a little hard on them is it very easy for you to go away  the restraint nasmyth had imposed upon himself suddenly deserted him he moved a little nearer to her and seized one of her hands she sat still and made no effort to draw it away from him  i had never meant to say what i am going to say just now he declared i had meant to wait until there was something successfully accomplished to my credit i am you see a thriftless wandering adventurerone who has taken things as they came and never has been serious when i have shown that i can also be something else i shall ask you formally if you will marry me until then the thing is of course out of the question  he broke off for a moment and held her silent by a gesture until he went on again i have been swept away and even if you were willing to make it i would take no promise from you until i have won the right to come back you must be absolutely free now you know this it would be very much wiser if i went away as soon as possible  ah the girl answered with a thrill in her voice whenever you come back you will find me ready to listen to you  nasmyth let her hand go now he asserted i think i cannot fail still it must be remembered that you are absolutely free  he would have said something more but there was just then a laugh and a patter of feet on the path above and looking up he saw two of mrs actons guests descending the bluff     chapter xx  nasmyth goes away   mrs acton was sitting on the veranda next morning when nasmyth fresh from a swim in the deep cold water of the inlet came up across the clearing it had brought a clear glow into his bronzed skin and a brightness to his eyes and as he flung a word to a man who greeted him his laugh had a clean wholesome ring he walked straight toward the veranda and mrs acton sitting still favoured him with a very keen and careful scrutiny he was dressed in light flannels which she admitted became him rather well but it was the lithe gracefulness of his movements that she noticed most his easy halfwhimsical manner had their effect on her they won her favour he was the kind of guest she had pleasure in welcoming at bonavista  he went up the veranda stairway and stopping near where she was sitting looked down at her with a curious little glow in his eyes she started for she had not expected to see it there so soon  you seem unusually satisfied with everything this morning she observed there is probably some cause for it  nasmyth laughed i believe i am as i dare say you have noticed tranquil contentment is one of my virtues it is however one that is remarkably easy to exercise at bonavista  still contentment does not as a rule carry a young man very far in this country in fact it is now and then a little difficult to distinguish between it and something else that is less creditable to the man who possesses it  nasmyth smiled goodhumouredly well he replied i have discovered that if you worry fortune too much she resents it and flies away from you it seems to me there is something to be said for the quietly expectant attitude after all one is now and then given much more than one could by any effort possibly deserve  mrs acton noticed the faint ring in his voice ah she said then something of that kind has befallen you hadnt you better come to the point  nasmyth became grave madam he said i have a confession to make i am very much afraid i lost my head yesterday and i should not be astonished if you were very angry with me  he spoke with a certain diffidence and mrs acton who straightened herself in her chair watched him steadily while he made his confession he paused with a gesture of deprecation  in one sense it is a preposterous folly but i am not quite sure that folly is not now and then better than wisdom he added it has certainly proved to be so in my case  no doubt mrs actons tone was suggestive it is however miss hamilton i am most interested in  nasmyth spread one hand out forcibly i want you to understand that she is absolutely free i have only told you because you once mentioned that you considered her a ward of yours nothing will be said to anybody else and if she should change her mind i will not complain in fact i have decided that it would be most fitting for me to go away  i think asserted mrs acton you have been either too generous or not quite generous enough the trouble with men of your kind is that when for once they take the trouble to reflect they become too cautious  im afraid i dont quite grasp the point of that  you should either have said nothing which is the course you ought to have adopted or a little more i fancy violet would have been just as pleased if you had shown yourself determined to make sure of her  nasmyth stood silent and mrs acton who surveyed him again with thoughtful eyes was not surprised that he should have appealed to the girls imagination the man was of a fine lean symmetry and straight of limb the stamp of a clean life was on him showing itself in the brightness of his eyes and his clear bronzed skin while he had as wisbech had said the classical nasmyth features these things as mrs acton admitted counted for something while the faint lines upon his face and the suggestive hardness that now and then crept into it were she decided likely to excite a young womans curiosity  well she said i feel myself considerably to blame and i may admit that i had at first intended to make my husband get rid of you i really dont know why i didnt you can make what you like of that  nasmyth bowed with a deferential smile and she laughed  still she said you must go away violet must be free to change her mind and after all its consoling to reflect that she has not seen so very much of you yet in one way it would please me if she did it would free me of a rather heavy responsibility  she stopped a moment and looked at him with softening eyes go and run the water out of that valley or do anything else that will make a mark she advised  nasmyths face was set as he replied if the thing is in any way possible it shall be done i think i will go into victoria again today  he turned away and left her and it was an hour later when she came upon violet sitting alone in a shady walk beneath the pines she looked at the girl severely  if i had been quite sure of what was going on i should have sent that young man away she remarked as it is i am very glad that he is going to victoria  violet slipped an arm about mrs actons neck and kissed her shyly you would never have been so cruel and now you are going to be my friend she said i dont want him to go back to that horrible cañon  mrs acton smiled i almost feel that i could shake both of you but i suppose i shall have to marshal my forces on your behalf  she set about her plans that evening when she invaded actons smokingroom and her husband listened to her with a little dry smile  i guess this is about the first time i have ever known you to do a real foolish thing he observed  well said mrs acton it is perhaps to my credit that i have done one now anyway i like the man  acton nodded oh yes he agreed thats quite comprehensible theres a good deal of tone about him but except with women thats not a thing that counts in this country its the bulldog grip and grit that goes farthest hereanyway when a man has no money behind him  you wouldnt consider nasmyth a weak man  not in one way when hes right up against it hell stiffen himself and fight but when the strain slackens a little his kind are apt to let go too easily  this as a matter of fact was more or less correct but mrs actons intention was not to discuss nasmyths character and she smiled at her husband  well she announced i expect you to take a hand in the thing  actons gesture was expressive of resignation i guessed it however it seems to me that young man has quite enough friends to give him a shove here and there already to begin with theres wisbech  what would wisbech do  not much and acton smiled understandingly he means to let his nephew feel his own feet hes a sensible man then theres that man gordon from the bush and it seems im to do my share too guess if i was nasmyth id say thank you and go right ahead without listening to one among the crowd of us  that mrs acton said isnt quite the question i think i pointed out what i expect from you  actons eyes twinkled you did he assured her ill try to set things in train the first time i go down to the city  this was somewhat vague but mrs acton was satisfied nevertheless she said nothing to nasmyth on the subject and next afternoon he left bonavista for victoria a day or two later he called by appointment at the office of a certain land exploitation agency and found hutton waiting for him hutton who sat with his elbows on the table pointed to a chair  you have taken my view of the thing he said in a questioning tone if youll sit down a minute ill call my clerk in and hell get the papers ready  nasmyth smiled i dont think you need trouble to do that just yet you see i havent the least intention of closing with your offer  it is just possible that hutton had expected this but in any case he betrayed no astonishment he leaned forward regarding his visitor with an almost expressionless face  then he returned ill hear your proposition  what do you think of the one i had the pleasure of making you some time ago nasmyth inquired  quite out of the question  nasmyth smiled that he remarked is in one sense a pity as i couldnt repeat it today if we are to do business together i should have to ask you for a considerably larger share of the profit in fact i was wondering if you could see your way to offer half as much again  hutton gazed at him with sardonic amusement oh he replied has somebody left you a fortune or are they going to run a railroad through that valley  nasmyth sat silent a moment or two and it happened that his easy indifference served him tolerably well had he been a keener man the anxiety to get about his work in the cañon of which he was certainly sensible might have led to his undoing but he was not one who often erred through undue precipitancy the waiting fight was perhaps the one for which he was particularly adapted if anything he was rather too much addicted to holding out his hand and he realized that it behooves the man without capital to be particularly wary in his negotiations with the one in possession of money his recent interview with violet hamilton also had a stirring effect on him and now he sat quietly prepared to hold his own  no he declared there has been no particular change in my affairs i have only been thinking things over and it seems to me i ought to get the terms i mentioned  then you had better try it wont be from any of the accredited land agencies  nasmyth noticed the faint ring in his companions voice this it seemed to him was not bluff the man he believed meant what he said  you seem quite sure of it he observed  as a matter of fact hutton was but he felt annoyed with himself  well he said i naturally know what they would think of any proposition like the one you made me anyway as i suggested all you have to do is to try them  again nasmyth conscious that his companion was unobtrusively watching him sat silent a moment or two he knew that if he broke with hutton he might have considerable difficulty in raising the money he required from any corporation interested in such matters in that city but he had also another plan in his mind he was far from sure that the scheme would prove successful and it was at least certain that it would cost him a good deal of trouble to carry it out  then i dont think i need keep you any longer he told hutton after a long pause ill leave the thing over for a day or two and you can send across to my hotel if you wish to discuss it again  he rose and reached out for his hat and hutton who watched him cross the room was once or twice on the point of calling him back hutton did not speak however since he fancied that nasmyth would presently return of his own accordwhich was an expectation that proved unwarranted  the office was on the second floor of a big stone building and as he descended the stairway nasmyth fancied he caught sight of martial in the entrancehall before he could be quite sure the man turned down a corridor and nasmyth who did not trouble himself about the matter went out into the street he was not altogether satisfied that he had done wisely but he meant at least to wait until events should prove him wrong  a few minutes later martial strolled into the office where hutton sat and smiled at him suggestively he was also as acton had once told nasmyth interested in the land exploitation business and it was evident that hutton had expected him  nasmyth has been here martial observed i saw him on the stairway i suppose you got hold of him  huttons gesture was forcibly expressive of annoyance as a matter of fact i didnt he confessed the mans either considerably smarter than i gave him credit for being or a thickheaded obstinate fool the ones as hard to handle as the other i dont know which he is and it doesnt greatly matter the results the same  i guess its the latter and martial laughed well since you cant come to terms have you any notion what his programme is  its not a sure thing that he has one anyway he didnt mention it well let him wait a day or two its quite likely hell try the charters people  both of them smiled for it was then not an unusual thing for the men interested in such affairs to put their heads together and take a joint hand in any deal that seemed to warrant it and when they did so the results were not as a rule encouraging to the outsider  martial looked at his comrade suggestively  i had a talk with charters yesterday he said he told me that if there was anything in it he didnt expect us to let the thing go  hutton thought for a moment one could sell quite a few ranches in the valley but its going to cost considerable to run the water out and i cant quite put my hand on anybody id feel like trusting with the work in the cañon its going to be difficult besides nasmyth has what you might call a first option on the land nobody else seems to want it and the crown people have evidently given way on a point or two its a sure thing theyd make no concession if we show our hands he broke off for a moment and flung a quick glance at his visitor you dont like the man  i dont said martialthats a solid fact still its not going to count for much thisand he waved his handis a matter of business  he sat still for a moment or two with a curious look in his face for he had called at the hotel actons party had visited on the night that he had endeavoured to crawl unobserved on board the tillicum he had no difficulty in discovering that mrs acton and miss hamilton had spent the night there which made it evident that the girl could not have been on board the steamer he had however not made the inquiries until business took him to the hotel several weeks afterwards and actons manner when they met in the city convinced him that the schooner men had been communicative on thinking the matter over it became clear that nasmyth and the skipper had played a trick on him and since it had cost him mrs actons goodwill without which he could not approach miss hamilton he cherished a bitter grievance against nasmyth  well he inquired in case he tries to raise the money elsewhere what do you suggest  i guess well let him try answered hutton hes not going to raise much when things are humming and every man with capital is putting it into mines and mills besides the work in the cañons evidently a big undertaking and its going to run into a long bill for labour a thing of that kind usually costs four times as much as the man who starts it figures well well leave him to it and when his money runs out well chip in  martial laughed thats very much my notion let him do the work and then jump in and put up our dummies to locate all the land he cant take hold of once we get a ranch or two recorded there would be a dozen ways we could get a grip on him between us and charters we ought to break him  they smiled at each other but in a moment or two hutton looked thoughtful again  you want to understand he said its not my business to break nasmyth its the money im out for in fact if theres an easier way than the one i suggested im going to take it and with that in view ill send up a man or two i can rely on to investigate  if they get crawling round that cañon and up and down the valley it will set the blame settlers talking we want the thing run quietly martial cautioned  i guess it can be done replied hutton theyll go camping out for pleasure in fact to make the thing more like it ill send them fishing martial rose anyway he said ill leave it with you in the meanwhile     chapter xxi  the men of the bush   a cool shadow fell upon the descending trail that wound in among the towering firs and nasmyth checked his jaded horse as he entered on the last league of his long ride from the railroad the red dust had settled thick upon his city clothes and for the first time he found the restraint of them irksome the band of his new hat had tightened unpleasantly about his forehead and in scrambling up the side of the last high ridge which he had crossed one neatlyfitting boot had galled his foot while he smiled with somewhat sinister amusement as he felt the grip of the tight jacket on his shoulders these were as he recognized petty troubles and he was rather astonished that he should resent them as he certainly did he remembered that a little while before he had made no complaint against the restraints of civilization and had indeed begun to shrink from the prospect of going back to the untrammelled life of the wilderness  but as he straightened himself in his saddle and gazed down the deep valley through which the trail twisted he felt the shrinking melt away after all there was something in the wilderness that appealed to him there was vigour in the clean smell of it and the little breeze that fanned his face was laden with the scent of the firs the trees rolled away before him in sombre battalions that dwindled far up the rocky sides of the enfolding hills and here and there a flood of sunlight that struck in through the openings fell in streams of burning gold upon their tremendous trunks beyond them the rugged heights rose mass on mass against the western sky  he rode into the shadow and though he thought of her it was curious that violet hamilton seemed to become less real to him as he pushed on down the valley he vaguely felt that he could not carry her with him into the wilderness she was a part of the civilization upon which he had once more for a time at least turned his back and he could not fit her into the environment of that wild and rugged land indeed he remembered with a compassionate tenderness how she had shrunk from it and clung to hima forlorn bedraggled object in her tattered dressthe day they floundered through the dripping bush and he subconsciously braced himself for conflict as he thought of it the sooner his work was over the sooner he could go back to her but there was as he remembered a great deal to be accomplished first  wrapped in thought as he was he was surprised when he saw a faint blue cloud of woodsmoke trailing out athwart the sombre firs in the hollow beneath him then two figures became visible moving upwards along the strip of trail and he drove the jaded horse forward as he recognized them he lost sight of them for a few minutes as he turned aside to avoid a swampy spot but when he had left it behind they were close ahead in the middle of the trail and it was with a thrill of pleasure that he swung himself stiffly from the saddle  with a smile on his bronzed face gordon stood looking at him gordon was dressed in soilstained garments of old blue duck with a patch cut from a cotton flourbag on one of them laura waynefleet stood a little nearer and there was also a welcome in her eyes nasmyth noticed how curiously at home she seemed amidst that tremendous colonnade of towering trunks he shook hands with her but it was gordon who spoke first  you have come back to us we have been expecting you he said after all store clothes and three welllaid meals a day are apt to pall on one  nasmyth turned to laura i should like to point out that this is the man who urged me to go he said one cant count on him  oh yes admitted gordon i certainly did urge you but i guess i knew what the result would be it was the surest way of quieting you anyway you dont seem sorry to be back again  nasmyth glanced at laura  no he said in some respects im very glad  he became suddenly selfconscious as he saw gordons significant smile it suggested that he had perhaps made too great an admission and he wondered for the first time with a certain uneasiness whether gordon had mentioned miss hamilton to laura and if that was the case what miss waynefleet thought about the subject  laura talked to him in her old friendly fashion as they walked on towards the settlement until gordon broke in  ive called the boys together as you suggested and fixed up the meeting for tonight he said theyll be ready to give you a hearing after supper in the hotel  laura left them on the outskirts of the settlement and gordon stopping a moment looked hard at nasmyth  i suppose you pledged yourself to that girl at bonavista before you came away he said  i did nasmyth admitted  gordon was silent for a moment or two of course i partly expected it he observed in fact when i was talking to miss waynefleet about you i ventured to predict something of the kind  the two men looked at each other for a moment and then nasmyth smiled  you havent anything else to say he suggested  no answered gordonat least nothing thats very material anyway until were through with the business we have on hand youll have to put that girl right out of your mind  they went on towards the little wooden hotel and nasmyth felt unusually thoughtful as he walked beside his jaded horse he recognized that his comrades last observation was more or less warranted and it was to some extent a relief to him when they reached the veranda stairway and gordon led the horse away toward the stables  it was rather more than an hour later when a specially invited company of men who had as they said a stake in the district assembled in the big general room of the hotel there was about a dozen of them men of different birth and upbringing though all had the same quiet brown faces and steadiness of gaze for the most part they were dressed in duck though waynefleet and the hotelkeeper wore city clothes the room was barely furnished and panelled roughly with cedarboards but it had wide casements from which those who sat in it could look out upon a strip of frothing river and the sombre forest that rolled up the rocky hills the windows were wide open and the smell of woodsmoke and the resinous odours of the firs flowed in a look of expectancy crept into the mens faces and the murmur of their conversation suddenly fell away when nasmyth sat down at the head of the long table with gordon at one side of him  boys said nasmyth one or two of you know why gordon asked you here to meet me but i had better roughly explain my project before i go any further ill ask you to give me your close attention for the next three or four minutes  when he stopped speaking there was a very suggestive silence for a moment those who heard him had not the quick temperament of the men of the western cities they lived in the stillness of the bush and thought before they undertook anything though when they moved it was usually to some purpose one of the men stood up with a deprecatory gesture  well he declared its a great idea boys wouldnt you call us blame fools for not thinking of it before  he sat down suddenly before anybody answered him and the men were still again until another of them rose  nasmyths not quite through yet he said well ask him to go ahead  gordon leaned forward and touched his comrades arm  pitch it to them strong youre getting hold he whispered encouragingly  for another five minutes nasmyth spoke as he felt that he had never spoken before he was intent and strung up and he knew that a great deal depended upon the effect he could make he had failed with the men of the cities who wanted all the profit he felt sure that he would henceforward have one or two of them against him and it was clear that he must either abandon his project or win over these hardhanded men of the bush with them behind him there was he felt little that he need shrink from attempting a ring crept into his voice as he went on for he knew that he was getting hold as he saw their lips set and the resolute expression of their eyes they were men who by strenuous toil wrung a bare living out of the forest and now there was laid before them a scheme that in its sheer daring seized upon their attention  boys nasmyth concluded i am in your hands this thing is too big for me to go into alone still its due to you to say that while i meant to give you an option of standing in it seemed to me it would simplify the thing if i raised most of the money before i came to you money is usually scarce in the bush  thats a fact agreed the shrewdfaced hotelkeeper who also conducted the store anyway when you have to trade with folks who take twelve months to square up their bills in  nobody seemed to heed him and nasmyth added  well i found i couldnt do itthat is if i wanted to keep anything for myself i want you to come in and as soon as i hear youre ready to give it your attention ill lay a proposition before you  he sat looking at them in a state of tense anxiety until one of them rose to his feet  i guess you can count upon every one of us he announced  a reassuring murmur ran along the double row of men and nasmyth felt a thrill of exultation  thank you boys he said with evident gratitude now there are difficulties to be grappled with to begin with the crown authorities would sooner have leased the valley to me and it was some time before they decided that as a special concession they would sell it in six hundred and forty acre lots at the lowest figure for firstclass lands the lots are to be laid off in rectangular blocks and as the valley is narrow and winding that takes in a proportion of heavy timber on the hill bench and will not include quite a strip of natural prairie which remains with the crown the cost of the land alone runs close on twenty thousand dollars of which one way or another i can raise about eight thousand  he looked at wheeler who sat near the lower end of the table and he nodded  my offer stands he said  you want another twelve thousand dollars said the hotelkeeper dubiously its quite a pile of money  there was a little laughter from the men well said one of them i guess we can raise it somehow among us but its going to be a pull  then said nasmyth we have provided for the cost of the land but before we lower the fall and cut the drainage trenches in the valley we will run up a big billthat is if we hire hands my notion is that we undertake the work ourselves and credit every man with his share in it to count as a mortgage on the whole land that belongs to us  waynefleet stood up and waved his hand i want to point out that this is very vague he objected the question will arise where the labour is to be applied it would for instance be scarcely judicious to give a man a claim on everybody else for draining his own land  he would have said more but that tom of mattawa laid a hard hand on his shoulder and jerked him back into his chair  now tom admonished you just sit down when nasmyth takes this thing in hand hell put it through quite straight what youd do in a month wouldnt count for five dollars anyway  everybody laughed and wheeler spoke again well get over that trouble by cutting so many big trenches only for the general benefit in the meanwhile mr nasmyth said something about trustees  i did said nasmyth the crown will sell in rectangular six hundred and forty acre blocks my proposition is that we take them up in three separate names you have to understand that the man who registers in the crown deed is legal owner  then were sure of two of them declared the hotelkeeper nasmyth takes the first block and wheeler the other  wheeler laughed i guess i stand out as a united states citizen im not sure im eligible to record crown lands still since nasmyth and i are putting up a good many of the dollars ill nominate gordon  as one man they decided on that but there appeared to be a difficulty about the third trustee until nasmyth turned to them  as you dont seem sure about him i would like to suggest mr waynefleet boys he said he is a man who has an extensive acquaintance with business and legal affairs  there was dead silence for several moments and the men looked at one another uneasily it was evident that the suggestion was unwelcome to most of them and nasmyth was quite aware that he was doing an unpopular thing in the meanwhile dusk had crept up the valley and the room was growing dim perhaps waynefleet could not see his companions faces very well but it is also possible that had he been able to do so he would not have troubled himself about the hesitation in most of them there are men of his kind who appear incapable of recognizing the fact that they are not regarded with general favour  finally one of the men spoke seeing that the scheme is nasmyths i guess its only reasonable to fall in with his views as far as we can he said well fix on waynefleet  there was a murmur of very dubious agreement and waynefleet who stood up smiled on the assembly patronizingly his manner suggested that he was about to confer a favour  our friend was warranted in mentioning that i have been accustomed to handling affairs of a somewhat similar nature but of considerably greater magnitude he said i have pleasure in placing what abilities i possess at your disposal gentlemen  though it was growing dark nasmyth saw the amused light in gordons eyes im with you in this said gordon still i scarcely figured the boys would have stood him  they discussed the scheme at length and when the assembly broke up waynefleet approached the table where gordon nasmyth and wheeler sat under a big lamp  there is a point i did not mention at the time it seemed to me it was one that could perhaps be arranged said waynefleet it is of course usual for a director of any kind to hold a certain financial interest in the scheme  he looked at nasmyth and made a significant gesture unfortunately there are not at the moment more than a very few dollars at my disposal the fact you will recognize is likely to hamper my efforts in an administrative capacity  precisely said nasmyth it is a matter i have provided for you will be placed in possession of a holding of the size the others fixed upon as convenient when the blocks are divided off  no larger  no answered nasmyth i am afraid you will have to be content with that  waynefleet went out and gordon turned to nasmyth its going to cost you something he said you cant charge it on the scheme ill divide it with you  there was a slight restraint in nasmyths manner im afraid i cant permit it it will be charged against my claim considering everything it was a thing i felt i had to do  then wheeler who had been quietly watching them broke in  what did you put that image up for anyway he asked  gordon smiled in a significant fashion its our friends affair and i guess hes not going to tell you why he did it still in one sense i most think it was up to him  wheeler let the matter drop and in a few more minutes they went out and nasmyth and gordon turned into the trail that led to gordons ranch     chapter xxii  nasmyth sets to work   it was a scorching afternoon on the heights above where rocky slope and climbing firs ran far up towards the blue heavens under a blazing sun but it was dim and cool in the misty depths of the cañon there was eternal shadow in that tremendous rift and a savage desolation rolled away from it but on this afternoon the sounds of human activity rang along its dusky walls the dull thud of axes fell from a gully that rent the mountainside and now and then a mass of shattered rock came crashing down while the sharp clinking of the drills broke intermittently through the hoarse roar of the fall wet with the spray of the fall nasmyth stripped to blue shirt and old duck trousers stood swinging a heavy hammer which he brought down upon the head of the steel bar that his companion held so many times a minute with rhythmic precision though they changed round now and then he had done much the same thing since early morning and his back and arms ached almost intolerably but still the great hammer whirled about his head and while he gasped with the effort came down with a heavy jar upon the drill so intent was he that he did not notice the three figures scrambling along the narrow logwork staging pinned against the rocky side above the fall until his companion flung a word at him turning with a start he dropped his hammer  he saw gordon hold out a hand to laura waynefleet who sprang down from the staging upon the strip of smoothworn stone that stretched out from the wall of the cañon above the fall wheeler was a few paces behind them nasmyth looked around for his jacket and remembering that he had left it in the gully he moved forward to shake hands with his visitors  i scarcely expected to see any of you here you must have had a hard scramble he said  gordon waved his hand you dont say youre pleased though after the trouble weve taken its a sure thing that you ought to be he declared anyway im not going back up that gully until ive had supper wheelers held up because his folks havent sent him some machines and i came along to see if id forgotten how to hold a drill i dont quite know what miss waynefleet came for  laura laughed goodhumouredly oh she said i have my excuse my father is at victoria and i have been staying with mrs potter for a day or two she lent me a cayuse to ride over to fentons ranch and the trail there leads close by the head of the gully  mattawa looked up at gordon with a grin if you want to do some drilling you can start right now he remarked guess nasmyth doesnt know he has a back on him  gordon took up the hammer and when wheeler went back to the gully to inquire whether one of the men at work there would undertake some timbersquaring he wanted done at the mill laura waynefleet and nasmyth were left together it was wetter than was comfortable near the fall and scrambling back across the staging they sat down among the boulders near the foot of the rapid that swirled out of the pool nasmyth looked at laura who smiled  i am afraid i have taken you away from your work and i havent gordons excuse she said he at least is able to drill  nasmyth laughed i observe that tom seems very careful of his hands he returned as to the other matter i am very glad you did come after all drilling isnt exactly a luxurious occupation and while as tom remarked im a little uncertain about my back im quite sure im in possession of a pair of arms because they ache abominably besidesand his gaze was whimsically reproachfuldo you really think any excuse is needed for coming to see me  in any case i have one there is something i want to say you see i have not come across you since the meeting at the settlement  i suppose you object to your father taking any share in our crazy venture  a faint flicker of colour crept into lauras cheek you know i dont she replied it is the one thing i could have wished for him indeed i shall be thankful if he takes a sustaining interest in the scheme as he seems disposed to do it will be of benefit to him in many ways he grows moody and discontented at the ranch  she broke off for a moment and her voice had changed when she went on again there is one point that troubles meyou provided my father with the money to take his share in the venture  no explained nasmyth i think i can say that i didnt i have merely set apart for him so many acres of swamp and virgin forest he will have to earn his title to them by assisting in what we may call the administration as well as by physical labour  laura looked at nasmyth with quiet eyes would you or gordon consider it a good bargain to part with a single acre for all the advice he can offer you she asked  nasmyth sat silent a moment gravely regarding her there was a little more colour in her face but her composure and her fearless honesty appealed to him she was attired very plainly in a print dress made as he knew by her own fingers the gown had somehow escaped serious damage in the scramble down the gully it harmonized with the paletinted stone and it seemed to him that its wearer fitted curiously into her surroundings he had noticed this often before and it had occurred to him that she had acquired something of the strength and unchangeableness of the wilderness perhaps she had though it is also possible that the quiet steadfastness had been born in her and perfected slowly under stress and strain  well nasmyth broke out impulsively if it had been you to whom we made that block over i could have abdicated with confidence and have left it all to you  laura smiled and nasmyth became sensible that his face had grown a deeper red  whatever made you say that she asked  i dont quite know nasmyths manner was deprecatory after all its hardly fair to hold a man accountable for everything he may chance to say anyway i think i meant it  something in his voice suggested that he was of the same mind still but laura glanced at him again  arent we getting away from the subject she queried the land you made over to my father must have cost you something it is a thing i rather shrink from mentioning but have you any expectation of ever getting the money back  nasmyth did not exactly understand until a considerable time afterwards why he was so deeply stirred by what she had said and he was quite mistaken in fancying that it was merely her courage that touched his heart in the meanwhile he was clearly sensible of at least a great pity for her  well he told her we can look at things openly and not try to persuade ourselves that theyre something else i think that is one of the things that you have taught me now suppose i havent any expectation of the kind you mention how does that count didnt you take me in when you found me lying in the snow isnt it practically certain that i owe my life to you admitting all that is there any reason why you shouldnt permit me to offer you a trifling favour not for your own sake but your fathers  he broke off for a moment with a forceful gesture i might no doubt have suppressed all this and made some conventional answer but you see one has to be honest with you can you persuade yourself that i dont know what you have to bear at the ranch and how your fathers moody discontent must burden you isnt it clear that if he takes an interest in this project and forgets to worry about his little troubles it will make life easier for both of you  laura looked at him curiously after all it is my life why should you be so anxious to make it easier  the question troubled nasmyth it seemed to go beyond the reason he had offered her a moment or two earlier indeed it flashed upon him that the fact that he certainly owed a good deal to her was not in itself quite sufficient to account for the anxiety he felt  well he answered if the grounds i mentioned dont appear to warrant my doing what i did i cant at the moment think of anything more convincing its one consolation that you couldnt upset the little arrangement now if you wanted to your fathers going into the thing headlong  somewhat to his astonishment the girl appeared embarrassed as she glanced away from him it was a moment or two before she looked around again  ah she exclaimed i dont want to upset it he has not been so well and contented for several years it has lifted him out of his moodiness then she leaned a little toward him i dare not refuse this favour from you  nasmyth was puzzled by a vague something in her manner  i certainly cant see why you should want to but well talk of something else he replied as you have noticed i have set to work though i expect it will be winter before we make any very great impression  laura glanced up the gloomy cañon which was filled with the rivers clammy drifting mist winter she said will be terrible here then you are not going back to the coast or victoria for some time  certainly not if i can help it  nasmyth spoke without reflection but he felt what he said and it was a moment before he realized that he might have expressed himself less decisively he saw the smile on lauras lips  so you have heard he asked there was of course no reason why gordon shouldnt have told you it was a thing i had meant to do myself only as it happened i havent seen you after that last speech of mine i must explain that i feel there is a certain obligation on me to stay away miss hamilton as a matter of fact is not engaged to me nothing can be settled until i carry out this project successfully  laura waynefleets face was very quiet and he sat silent a moment or two wondering somewhat uneasily what she was thinking he was also slightly surprised at himself for he realized that after all he had found it considerably easier to stay away than he had expected indeed during the last few weeks when every moment of his time had been occupied he had thought of nothing except the work before him it occurred to him for the first time that it was curious that he had been able to do so  you see he made haste to explain in the meanwhile i must endeavour to put everything except this scheme out of my mind  again he was troubled by laura waynefleets little smile  yes she said in one way no doubt that would be the wisest course im not sure however that everybody would have sufficient strength of will  nasmyth said nothing further for a while butthough he was probably not aware of thishis face grew thoughtful as he gazed at the river until his companion spoke again  was it miss hamiltons wish that you should make your mark first she inquired  no answered nasmyth decisively i want you to understand that it was mine she merely concurred in it  he changed the subject abruptly tell me about yourself  there is so little to tell one day is so much like another with me only i have been rather busier than usual lately my father has had to cut down expenses we have no hired man  nasmyth set his lips and halfconsciously closed one hand it seemed to him an almost intolerable thing that this girl should waste her youth and sweetness dragging out a life of unremitting toil in the lone bush still while her father lived there was nothing else she could look forward to and he could imagine how the long colourless years would roll away with her while she lost her freshness and grew hard and worn with petty cares and labour that needed a stronger arm than hers she might grow discontented he fancied and perhaps a trifle bitter though he could not imagine her becoming querulous  as yet there was a great patience in her steady eyes then it became evident that she guessed what he was thinking  sometimes i feel the prospect in front of me is not a very attractive one she responded in answer to his thoughts still one can get over that by not regarding it as a prospect at all it simplifies the thing when one takes it day by day  she smiled at him derrick you have done wisely i think you need a sustaining purpose and a woman to work for  nasmyths face paled yes he agreed dryly it is perhaps rather a significant admission but i really think i do  it was a relief to both of them that wheeler came floundering along the shingle just then with a box and a coil of wire in his hand  ive brought you a little present nasmyth he announced firing by fuse is going to be uncertain when theres so much spray about and i sent down for this electric fixing we can charge it for you at any time at the mill have you put in any giantpowder yet  nasmyth said they had not fired a heavy charge about the fall but that there were several holes ready for filling and wheelers eyes twinkled  im quite anxious to try this little toy he said when i was young a rancher gave me an old playedout shotgun and i was out at sunup next morning to shoot something thats the kind of being a man is miss waynefleet put any kind of bottledup power in his hands and he feels he must get up and make a bang with it after all i guess its fortunate that he does  are all men like that laura asked with a strange undertone in her voice  most of them said wheeler with an air of reflection of course you do run across one here and there who would put the bottled power carefully away for fear that when it went off it might hurt him or somebody the trouble is that when a man of that kind at last makes up his mind to use it hes quite likely to find that the power has gradually leaked out of the bottle powers a very curious thing if you dont use it it has a way of evaporating  gordon had joined them in the meanwhile and laura looked at him  you agree with that she asked  gordons smile was suggestively grim oh yes he said i guess our friend now and then says some rather forceful things anyway he has hit it with this one for instance there was that little matter of the man who was sick at his mill a surgeon with nerve and hands could have fixed him up weand he made an expressive gesturepacked him out to victoria  he laughed harshly as he went on well thats partly why were going to set our mark on this cañon if its only to make it clear that were not quite played out yet youll ram that hole full of your strongest powder derrick  nasmyth turned and waved his hand to a man at the foot of the gully  bring me down the magazine he ordered were going to split that rock before supper  the man who disappeared came back again with an iron box and for the next few minutes nasmyth who scrambled about the rocks above the fall taking a coil of thin wire with him was busy when he rejoined his companions he led them a little further down the cañon until he pointed to a shelf of rock from which they had a clear view of the fall a handful of men had clambered down the gully and now they stood in a cluster upon the strip of shingle nasmyth indicated them with a wave of his hand before he held a little wooden box with brass pegs projecting from it up to laura  its the first big charge we have fired and they seem to feel its something of an event he said in one way its a declaration of war were making and there is a good deal against us you fit this plug into the socket when youre ready  you mean me to fire the charge inquired laura  yes answered nasmyth quietly its fitting that you should be the one to set us at our work if it hadnt been for you i should certainly not have taken this thing up and now i want to feel that you are anxious for our success  a faint flush of colour crept into laura waynefleets face for one thing nasmyths marriage to the darkeyed girl whom gordon had described to her depended on the success of this venture and that was a fact which had its effect on her still she felt the scheme would have greater results than that and turning gravely she glanced at the men who had gathered upon the shingle they looked very little and feeble as they clustered together in face of that almost overwhelming manifestation of the great primeval forces against which they had pitted themselves in the bottom of the tremendous rift it seemed curious that they did not shrink from the roar of the river which rang about them in sonorous tones and then as she looked across the mad rush of the rapid and the sprayshrouded fall to the stupendous walls of rock that shut them in the thing they had undertaken seemed almost impossible wheeler appeared to guess her thoughts for he smiled as he pointed to the duckclad figures  well he declared in one way theyre an insignificant crowd very little to look at and this cañons big still i guess theyre somehow going through with the thing it seems to meand he nodded to her with sudden recognition of her part in the projectit was a pretty idea of nasmyths when he asked you to start them at it  laura remembered that the leader of the men had once said that he belonged to her she smiled and raised the hand that held the firing key  boys she said its a big thing you have undertakennot the getting of the money but the beating of the river and the raising of tall oats and orchards where only the sour swampgrasses grew she turned and for a moment looked into nasmyths eyes as she added simply good luck to you  she dropped her hand upon the little box and in another moment or two a rent opened in the smoothworn stretch of rock above the fall out of it there shot a blaze of light that seemed to grow in brilliance with incredible swiftness until it spread itself apart in a dazzling corruscation then the roar of the river was drowned in the detonation and long clouds of smoke whirled up through the smoke rose showers of stones and masses of leaping rock that smote with a jarring crash upon the walls of the cañon after that came a great splashing that died away suddenly and there was only the hoarse roar of the river pouring through the newly opened gap laura turned and handed the box to nasmyth  now she said i have done my part and i am only sorry that it is such a trifling one  nasmyth looked at her with a gleam in his eyes  he answered softly you are behind it all it is due to you that i am making some attempt to use the little power in my possession instead of letting it melt away     chapter xxiii  the derrick   a bitter frost had crept down from the snowclad heights that shut the cañon in and the roar of the river had fallen to a lower tone when nasmyth stood one morning shivering close by the door of his rude log shanty at the foot of the gully the faint grey light was growing slightly clearer and he could see the clustering spruces in the hollow gleam spectrally where their dark masses were streaked with delicate silver filigree across the river there was a dull glimmer from the wall of rock which the freezing spray had covered with a glassy crust though it had not been long exposed to the nipping morning air nasmyth felt his damp deerhide jacket slowly stiffening and the edge of the sleeves which had been wet through the day before commenced to rasp his raw and swollen wrists  he stood still for a minute or two listening to the river and stretching himself wearily for his back and shoulders ached and there was a distressful stiffness in most of his joints that had resulted from exposure in spraydrenched clothing to the stinging frost this however did not greatly trouble him since he had long realized that physical discomfort must be disregarded if the work was to be carried on men for the most part toil strenuously in that wild land indeed it is only by the tensest effort of which flesh and blood are capable that the wilderness is broken to mans domination for throughout much of it costly mechanical appliances have not as yet displaced wellhardened muscle  in most cases the bushman who buys a forest ranch has scarcely any money left when he has made the purchase he finds the land covered with twohundredfeet firs which must be felled and sawn up and rolled into piles for burning by his own hand and only those who have handled trees of that kind can form any clear conception of the labour such work entails it is a long time before the strip of cleared land will yield a scanty sustenance and in the meanwhile the bushman must every now and then hire himself out trackgrading on the railroads or chopping trails to obtain the money that keeps him in tea and pork and flour as a rule he expects nothing else and there are times when he does not get quite enough work men reared in this fashion grow hard and tireless and nasmyth had been called upon to lead a band of them he had contrived to do it so far but it was not astonishing that the toil had left a mark on him  he heard the drifting icecake crackle as it leapt the fall and the sharp crash of it upon the boulders in the rapid it jarred on the duller roar of the river in intermittent detonations as each heavy mass swept down there was however no other sound and seizing a hammer he struck a suspended iron sheet until a voice fell across the pines from the shadowy gully  guess well be down soon as its light enough it said  then another voice rose from the shanty  the boys wont see to make a start for half an hour it said i dont know any reason why you shouldnt shut the door and come right in breakfasts ready  nasmyth turned and went into the shanty conscious that it would cost him an effort to get out of it again a stove snapped and crackled in the one room which was cosily warm gordon and waynefleet sat before the two big empty cases that served for table and mattawa was ladling pork on to their plates from a blackened fryingpan nasmyth sat down and ate hastily while the light from the lamp hanging beneath the roofbeams fell upon his face which was gaunt and roughened by the sting of bitter spray and frost his hands were raw and cracked  i want to get that rockdump hove out of the pool before its dark he said one cant see to crawl over those icecrusted rocks by firelight  gordon glanced at mattawa who grinned well said mattawa it was only yesterday when i fell in and i figured charly was going right under the fall the day before oh yes i guess wed better get the thing through while its light  i have felt inclined to wonder if it wouldnt be advisable to suspend operations if this frost continues said waynefleet reflectively  our charter lays it down that the work is to be carried on continuously answered gordon still on due notice being given it permits a stoppage of not exceeding one month owing to stress of weather or insuperable natural difficulties as a matter of fact even with the fire going its practically impossible to keep the frost out of the stone  nasmyth looked up sharply the work goes on there will be no stoppage of any kind we cant afford it the thing already has cost us two or three times as much as i had anticipated  gordon looked amused though he said nothing further nasmyth was up against it with his back to the wall but that fact had roused all the resolution there was in him and he had shown no sign of flinching it was evident that he must fight or fail ignominiously and he had grown grimmer and more determined as each fresh obstacle presented itself while the strenuous weeks rolled on there was silence for a few minutes and then mattawa grinned at waynefleet  i guess youve got to keep that rock from freezing and the fire was kind of low when i last looked out he remarked  with a frown of resignation waynefleet rose wearily and went out for it was his part to keep a great fire going day and night this was one of the few things he could do and though it entailed a good deal of sturdy labour with the axe he had somewhat to his comrades astonishment accomplished it reasonably well in another minute or two nasmyth followed him and when the rest of the men came clattering down from the shanty higher up the gully they set to work  there was just light enough to see by and no more for though the frost was bitter heavy snowclouds hung about the hills shingle and boulders were covered with frozen spray and long spears of ice stretched out into the pool below the fall now and then a block of ice drove athwart them with a detonating crackle the pool was lower than it had been in summer and the stream frothed in angry eddies in the midst of it where shattered masses of rock rent by the blasting charges lay as they had fallen it was essential that the rock should be cleared away and a great redwood log with a rounded foot let into a socket swung by wire rope guys above the pool another wire rope with a pair of iron claws at the end of it ran over a block at the head of the log to the winch below and the primitive derrick and its fittings had cost nasmyth a great deal of money as well as a weeks arduous labour  they swung the apparatus over the pile of submerged rock and when the claws fell with a splash they hove at the winch two of them at each handle until a mass of stone rose from the stream then one guy was slackened and another hauled upon until the rock swung over the shingle across the river where they let it fall part of the growing pile would be used to build the road by which they brought supplies down the gully  in itself the work was arduous enough since four men alone could toil at the winch and some of the masses they raised were ponderous indeed there was scarcely room for four persons on the shelf hewn out above the tail of the pool and the narrow strip of stone was slippery with ice fine spray that froze on all it touched whirled about the workers and every now and then a heavy fragment that slipped from the claws fell with a great splash nasmyths wrists grew raw from the rasp of the hide jacket and wide cracks opened in his fingers  i remember it as cold as this only once before he said it was during the few days i spent between the logging camp and waynefleets ranch  mattawa who hove on the same handle grinned well he said this is a tolerable sample of blame hard weather while it lasts but we get months of it back east still i guess we dont work then no sir unless were chopping we sit tight round the stove  mattawa was right in this excepting the loggers and the northwest police men do not work in the open at that temperature back east nor would they attempt it on the pacific slope were the cold continuous in the western half of british columbia however long periods of severe weather are rare it is a variable zone swept now and then by damp warm breezes and men tell of sheltered valleys where flowers blow the year round though very few of those who ramble up and down the mountain province ever chance upon them but there are times when the devastating cold of the polar regions descends upon the lonely ranges as it had done upon the frostbound cañon  those who toiled with nasmyth were hardened men and they held on with cracked hands clenched on the winchhandles or they splashed through the icy shallows with the water in their boots until a little before their dinnerhour when three of them stood straining by nasmyths side beneath the derrick as a mass of rock rose slowly to the surface of the pool mattawa glanced at this weight dubiously and then up at the wire guy that gleamed with frozen spray high above his head  i guess weve dropped on to a big one this time he said shes going to be heavier when we heave her clear of the river  this of course was correct and it was clear to nasmyth that it was only by a strenuous effort that his comrades were raising the stone then still it must be lifted and he tightened his grasp upon the handle  heave lift her out he said  the veins rose swollen on their foreheads and they gasped as they obeyed him but as the stone rose dripping there was an ominous creaking overhead  guess shes drawing the anchorbolts cried one well fetch the whole thing down shall i let her run  nasmyth flung a sharp glance at the big iron holdfast sunk in the rock above there would he knew be trouble if that or the wire guy gave way but it was only at some hazard that anything could be done in the cañon  hold on he said hoarsely slack that guy and let her swing  there was a clink and jar as the clutch took the weight off them a wire rope set up a harsh rasping and as gordon jerked a guidingline across the river the great boom swung trailing the heavy stone just above the water then the ominous creak grew sharper and one of them shouted  jump he said shes going  two of them sprang on the instant into the pool and washed out with the crackling icecake into the rapid at the tail of it it was precisely what most men who could swim would have done but nasmyth stayed and mattawa stayed with him nasmyth did not think very clearly but he remembered subconsciously what the construction of that derrick had cost him there was a lever which would release the load and let it run he had his hand on it when he turned to his companion  strip that handle tom he said  the iron crank that would have hurled him into the river as its span fell with a rattle and that was one peril gone but the lever he grasped was difficult to move and his hands were stiff and numb still he persisted and mattawa watched him because there was only room for one until there was a crash above them and the tilted top of the great boom came down mattawa flattened against the rock side held his breath as the mass of timber rushed towards the pool and next moment saw that nasmyth was no longer standing on the shelf nasmyth lay partly beneath the shattered winch and his face was grey except for a red scar down one side of it his eyes however were open and mattawa gasped with relief when he heard the injured man speak  it cleared my body im fast by the hand said nasmyth  three or four minutes had slipped by before the rest scrambled upon the ledge with handspikes and then it cost them a determined effort before they moved the redwood log an inch or two gordon kneeling by nasmyths side drew the crushed arm from under it nasmyth raised himself on one elbow and lifted a red and pulpy hand that hung from the wrist with an effort that set his face awry he straightened it  i can move it he said i dont know how it got under the thing or what hit me in the face  it doesnt matter either said gordon quietly can you get up  nasmyth blinked at him of course he answered as a general thing i walk with my legs theyre not hurt  nasmyth staggered to his feet and while gordon grasped his shoulder floundered over the log staging laid athwart the fall and back to the shanty gordon was busy with him there for some time after the crushed hand had been bound up gordon flung the door open and spoke to the men outside  its only his hand and theres nothing broken he announced you can get your dinner well see about heaving the derrick up when youve eaten  he went back and filled nasmyths pipe  i expect it hurts he said  nasmyth nodded yes he replied quite enough  well said gordon i dont know that its any consolation but if you expose it at this temperature its going to hurt you considerably more you cant do anything worth while with one hand and that the one you dont generally use either theres a rip upon your face that may give you trouble too im going to pack you out tomorrow  the difficulty is that im not disposed to go  your wishes are not going to be consulted if theres no other way ill appeal to the boys id let you stay if you were a reasonable man and would lie quiet beside the stove until that hand got better but since its quite clear that nobody could keep you there youre starting tomorrow for waynefleets ranch  gordon turned to waynefleet well lay you off for a week theres a little business waiting at the settlement anyway and you can see about getting the new tools and provisions in  waynefleets face was expressive of a vast relief the few bitter weeks spent in the cañon had taken a good deal of the keenness he had once displayed out of him  i certainly think the arrangement suggested is a very desirable one he agreed i am quite sure that miss waynefleet will have much pleasure in looking after nasmyth  gordon turned to nasmyth now he said you can protest just as much as you like but still as youll start tomorrow if we have to tie you on to the packhorse its not going to be very much use you can nurse your hand for a week and then go on to victoria and see if you can pick up a boringmachine of the kind we want cheap  nasmyth who was aware that the machine must be purchased before very long submitted with the best grace he could and though his hand was painful he contrived to sleep most of the afternoon now that he was disabled and could not work he began to feel the strain he set out with waynefleet at sunrise next morning and they passed the day scrambling over the divide and winding in and out among withered fern and thickets as they descended a rocky valley here and there they found an easier pathway on the snowsheeted reaches of a frozen stream and only left it to plunge once more into the undergrowth when the ice crackled under them they had a packhorse with them for now and then one of the men made a laborious journey to the settlement for provisions and in places a fallen tree had been chopped through or a thicket partly hewn away that however did little to relieve the difficulties of the march for the trail was rudimentary and the first two leagues of it would probably have severely taxed the strength of a vigorous man unaccustomed to the bush  but they pushed on waynefleet riding when it was possible while nasmyth plodded beside the horses head until a cloud of whirling snow broke upon them as they floundered through a belt of thinner bush the snow wrapped them in its filmy folds gathering thick upon their garments and filling their eyes and nasmyth grew anxious as the daylight suddenly died out they were in a valley out of which they could not very well wander without knowing it and they stumbled on smashing into thickets and swerving round fallen trees until they struck a clearer trail and it was with relief that nasmyth saw a tall splitrail fence close in front of him he threw a strip of it down and then turned to waynefleet when he dimly made out a blink of light in the whirling haze of snow  if you will go in and tell miss waynefleet ill try to put the horse up he said  waynefleet swung himself down stiffly and vanished into the snow he was half frozen and it did not occur to him that nasmyth had only one hand with which to loose the harness it is also possible that he would have made no protest if it had  nasmyth reached the stable and contrived to find and to light the lantern but he discovered that it would be difficult to do anything more his sound hand was numbed his fingers would not bend and the buckles of the harness held in spite of his efforts but he persisted the struggle he was waging in the cañon had stirred him curiously and each fresh obstacle roused him to a halfsavage determination though the action sent a thrill of pain through him he laid his boundup hand upon the headstall and set his lips as he tore at a buckle he felt that if the thing cost him hours of effort he would not be beaten  he had however let his hand fall back into the bandage that hung from his neck when the door opened and laura waynefleet came in she saw him leaning against the side of the stall with a greyness in his face which had an angry red scar down one side of it and her eyes shone with compassion  sit down she said i will do that  nasmyth who straightened himself shook his head i can manage it if you will loose the buckles he said one feels a little awkward with only one hand  they did it together and then nasmyth sat down with his face drawn and lined laura stood still a moment or two with the lantern in her hand  the snow must be deep on the divide and it is a very rough trail i suppose you walked all the way she said  nasmyth contrived to smile as it happens i am used to it  there was a flash of indignation in the girls eyes for she had after all a spice of temper and she was naturally acquainted with her fathers character her anger had however disappeared next moment  you are looking ill she remarked anxiously  nasmyth glanced down at the bandage ive been working rather hard of late and this hand is painful he made a deprecatory gesture i dont know what excuse to offer for troubling you gordon insisted on sending me  you fancy i require one from you  nasmyth looked at her with heavy eyes no he answered it is evident that you dont after all perhaps i shouldnt have wished to make any excuse it seems only natural that when i get hurt or find myself in any trouble i should come to you  he did not see the colour that crept into her face for his perceptions were not clear then but he rose with an effort and together they went back to the house through the snow there nasmyth changed his clothes for the dry garments he had brought in a valise strapped to the packsaddle and an hour after supper he fell quietly asleep in his chair then laura turned to her father  you let him walk all the way when he is wornout and hurt she said accusingly  waynefleet waved his hand he insisted on it and i would like to point out that there is nothing very much the matter with him we have all been working very hard at the cañon in fact i quite fail to understand why you should be so much more concerned about him than you evidently are about me i am however quite aware that there would be no use in my showing that i resented it  laura said nothing further she felt that silence was wiser for after all her patience now and then almost failed her     chapter xxiv  realities   though there was bitter frost in the ranges it had but lightly touched the sheltered forests that shut in bonavista the snow seldom lay long there and only a few wisps of it gleamed beneath the northern edge of the pines mrs acton as usual had gathered a number of guests about her and violet hamilton sat talking with one of them in the great drawingroom one evening the room was brilliantly lighted and the soft radiance gleamed upon the polished parquetry floor on which rugs of costly skins were scattered a fire of snapping pinelogs blazed in the big english hearth and a faint aromatic fragrance crept into the room  miss hamilton leaned back in a softly padded lounge that was obviously only made for two and a pleasantfaced browneyed young englishman who had no particular business in that country but had gone there merely for amusement sat at the other end of it regarding her with a smile  after all he said reflectively i really dont think im very sorry the snow drove us down from our shooting camp in the ranges  violet laughed she had met the man before he went into the mountains and he had been at bonavista for a week or two now  it was too cold for you up there she queried  it was answered the man at least it was certainly too cold for jardine who came out with me he got one of his feet nipped sitting out one night with the rifle on a high ledge in the snow and when i left him in vancouver the doctor told him it would be a month before he could wear a boot again  he laughed i have a shrewd suspicion that one has to get hardened to that kind of thing and surely this is considerably nicer  this repeated violet who fancied she understood what he meant is very much the same thing as you are accustomed to in london except that the houses are no doubt more luxuriously furnished and the company is more brilliant and entertaining  you would not expect me to make any admission of that kind and the man looked at her reproachfully in any case it wouldnt be warranted  then said violet i must have some very erroneous notions of your english mansions  the man smiled ah he said i was referring to the company  he had expressed himself in a similar fashion once or twice before but violet did not resent it she admitted that she rather liked him and she did not know that although he had been a week or two at bonavista he had only intended to stay there a few days it had naturally occurred to mrs acton that there might be a certain significance in this but she was misled by the open manner in which another young woman had annexed him  there were other guests in the room and among them was a little baldheaded man whom violet had heard had philanthropic tendencies and was connected with some emigration scheme this man was talking to acton he spoke in a didactic manner tapping one hand with his goldrimmed spectacles and appeared quite content that the rest should hear him  there is no doubt that this country offers us a great field he said in fact i have already made arrangements for settling a number of deserving families on the land what i am particularly pleased with is the manner in which the man who makes his home here is brought into close contact with nature the effect of this cannot fail to be what one might term recuperative there is a vitality to be drawn from the soil and i have of late been urging the manifold advantages of the simple life upon those who are interesting themselves in these subjects with me  violet glanced at her companion and saw the amusement in his eyes  do you all talk like that in england she inquired  the man raised his hand reproachfully im afraid some of us talk a good deal of rubbish now and then still as a matter of fact we dont round up our sentences in that precise fashion as he does just now were rather fragmentary of course hes right to some extent im fond of the simple lifethat is for a month or so when i know that a two days ride will land me in a civilized hotel the trouble is that most of the folks who recommend it would certainly go all to bits in a few weeks after they tried it personally can you fancy our friend yonder chopping tremendous trees or walking up to his knees in snow twelve hours with a flourbag on his back  violet certainly could not the man was fullfleshed plethoric and heavy of foot and he spoke with a throaty gasp  the tilling of the soil he went on apparently addressing anybody who cared to listen is mans natural task and i think natures beneficent influences are felt to their fullest extent in the primeval stillness of these wonderful western woods  violets companion looked up at her with a smile  the primeval stillness sounds rather nice only it isnt still except you go up into the snow upon the peaks he said in most of the other places my trail led through you can hear the rivers and they make noise enough for anything now theres a man yonder i havent seen before who i fancy could tell us something about it if he liked his face suggests that he knows i mean the one talking to mrs acton  violet followed his glance and saw a man standing beside mrs acton near the great english hearth but his face was turned away from her and it was a moment or two before he looked round then she started and the blood crept into her cheeks as she met nasmyths gaze  he had changed since she last saw himchanged she felt in an almost disconcerting fashion he wore plain city clothes and they hung about him with a suggestive slackness his face was darkened and roughened by exposure to the winter winds it had grown sharp and stern and there was a disfiguring red scar down one side of it his eyes were keen and intent and there was a look in them that she did not remember having noticed before while he seemed to have lost his careless gracefulness of manner even his step seemed different as he moved towards her it was though neither exactly understood why a difficult moment for both of them when he stopped close by her side and it was made no easier by the fact that they were not alone violet turned to her companion who rose  mr carshalton from the old country she said this is mr nasmyth  carshalton nodded glad to meet you wont you sit down he said as it happens i had just pointed you out to miss hamilton we were talking about the wildernessor to be more precise the great primeval stillness i ventured to suggest that you could tell us something about it  nasmyth smiled significantly well he replied i have certainly spent a few months in the wilderness that is one of the results  he meant to indicate the hand that hung by his side in a thick soft glove by the gesture he made but it was the other one that violet and carshalton glanced at it was scarred and battered and had opened in raw red cracks under the frost  ah said carshalton i think i was quite warranted in assuring miss hamilton that it was a good deal nicer here you see i was up in the ranges for a week or two i had to come down with my comrade who sat out one night in the snow the primeval stillness didnt agree with him  he met violets eyes and next moment glanced across the room  i dont think ive spoken to mr acton this evening he said well have a talk about the wilderness byandby mr nasmyth  he strolled away and nasmyth sat down by violets side  i fancied the man meant to stay he remarked  violet leaned back in the lounge and looked at him a moment or two silently her thoughts were confused and she was uneasy in the first place she almost wished it had not been so easy to make carshalton understand that she wished him to go away for the fact that she had been able to do so by merely looking at him suggested that there was at least a certain confidence between them and she was unwilling to admit that such was the case that however was only a minor point while carshalton had spoken of the simple life and admitted that a few weeks of it was quite enough for him she had thought with a certain tenderness of the man who had spent months of strenuous toil in the misty depths of the cañon she was glad of this and felt a slight compunction over the fact that she had seldom thought of him of late still when she saw him bearing the marks of those months of effort on his body and in his worn face she was sensible that she shrank from him as she had once done from the dreary dripping wilderness this was disconcerting but she could not drive out the feeling his worn face vaguely troubled her and she was sorry for him but she would not have liked to touch his scarred and roughened hands she glanced at the injured hand inquiringly  it is almost well again it was crushed beneath a mass of timber he told her briefly  conscious that the meeting so far left a good deal to be desired violet sat still a moment it certainly had not afforded her the pleasure she might reasonably have expected and she subconsciously resented the fact there was also as she noticed a suggestion of uneasiness in the mans scarred face  i have been in victoria a few days he explained there was a machine i had to buy and one or two other matters had to be attended to then i got a letter forwarded from waynefleets ranch from which it appeared that mr acton wished to see me  a faint sparkle crept into violet hamiltons eyes it is evident she observed that we both find it a little difficult to say the right thing  im afraid i am now and then a little remiss in that respect still how have i offended  violet contrived to smile im not sure it was particularly judicious of you to explain so fully what brought you here couldnt you have left me to suggest another reason that would have been a little more satisfactory  nasmyth laughed my dear you know i have been longing to see you  ah exclaimed violet i am not altogether sure indeed i could almost fancy that you have been thinking of nothing beyond what you are doing in that horrible cañon  nasmyth raised his hand in protest though violet was quick to notice the uneasiness in his face but now the worn look in it roused her pity  well she said you can show how anxious you were by staying here at least a week i want you to stay besides you must for another reasonyou are looking almost ill  there was for the first time a softness in her voice that stirred the man but the uneasiness that had troubled him did not disappear indeed it seemed to grow stronger as he glanced about the room which was furnished artistically and flooded with light mrs actons guests were of the station to which he had belonged and he would once have found the sound of their voices and their light laughter pleasant these however were things that no longer appealed to him and he was conscious of a feverish impatience to get back to his work again in the misty cañon  im afraid he replied gravely it will be out of the question for me to stay just now there is so much to do at the cañon and i think you know why i am so anxious to carry the work through  the girl looked at him in a curious fashion and though she was probably not aware of it there was doubt in her eyes for the moment she was troubled with a sense of comprehension and she could not be quite sure whether it was only on her account that he was so determined to carry out the project  well she told him i know that mr acton and your uncle are anxious to see you in fact i believe they have some suggestions to put before you and though i do not know exactly what it is i imagine that you need not go back to the bush if you will do what they wish she broke off and glanced at him wistfully derrick you wont decide rashly i dont want you to stay away from me  nasmyth smiled reassuringly but one of violets companions approached them just then and when she leaned upon the back of the lounge and spoke to the girl nasmyth rose he crossed the room and a few minutes later in the big cedar hall came upon a man connected with the crown land agency there was an open fire in the hall and the man who sat down by it offered nasmyth a cigar  mrs acton will excuse us for a few minutes the stranger remarked you are evidently fresh from the bush how are you getting on there  nasmyth told him and the man looked thoughtful  you dont hold all the valley the man said i wonder if you know that folks are taking an interest in the land thats still unrecorded  i dont said nasmyth its mostly heavy timber that would cost a deal to clear any way as we couldnt take up any more than we hold it doesnt appear to affect me at all  well returned his companion thats a point im not quite sure about you only hold a provisional charter to lower the river theres only one unworked holding near the valley and as you couldnt injure anybodys property we permitted you to go ahead still if any parties supplied us with a sufficient reason for withdrawing that permission we might have to listen to them he broke off for a moment and waved his hand of course im not speaking officially im merely giving you a hint that may be useful some persons might take up that land with the object of putting the screw on you you see it would be possible to get over any difficulty they might raise by buying them out  nasmyths lips closed firmly he was quite aware that in view of the state of his finances the course suggested was not one that he could adopt  what kind of people are they he inquired  his companion laughed in an ominous fashion small ranchers though its just possible that there may be some of the big men connected with the land business behind them the big promoters occasionally prefer to act through a dummy our object is of course to get men who will cultivate the land and keep it out of the hands of anyone who merely wants to hold it now while im far from sure my superiors would be pleased to hear id said so much to you theres one piece of advice i can offer he leaned forward and looked at nasmyth confidentially get that work through as soon as you can once you lower the level of the river nobody could compel you to put it back again any man who wanted land would have to buy it as it was  a man who wished to start a ranch would naturally prefer it with the water run out of it  precisely argued nasmyths informant that is why you got the charter still i wasnt contemplating the man who merely wished to ranch  his smile suggested that he intended to say no more upon that subject and when he turned and glanced through the doorway into the lighted room nasmyth saw that he was looking at violet hamilton nasmyth also noticed that carshalton was once more seated beside the girl  i rather like that englishman declared the stranger acton apparently gets on with him too he seems to have been here some time in fact while its nobody elses business ive been inclined to wonder what miss hamilton thinks of him  nasmyth made no reply but the observation slightly troubled him a little later acton crossed the hall  if you can give us a few minutes your uncle and i have something to put before you he said ill go along with you to my room     chapter xxv  nasmyth decides   a shaded lamp stood on the table of actons room and as nasmyth entered he saw wisbech whom he had not met since his arrival sitting just inside the light of it in a loungechair he strode forward and shook hands with his uncle  until i got your letter i almost fancied you were in japan he said  wisbech smiled at him i shall probably start very shortly in fact i never expected to stay here half so long as i have done but i found a good deal to interest me in this country and its twenty years since i have been away from business for more than a week or two the works were mine until very recently but there are times now when im not altogether sorry im merely a director of the company  acton laid a handful of cigars on the table and drew out a chair for nasmyth  well he replied reflectively there is a good deal in this country that would interest a sensible man but im not sure thats exactly what has kept mr wisbech so long in victoria ive a point or two to mention later but ill let him speak first its his affair  nasmyth sat down and he did not immediately notice that while acton had placed his chair where the light struck full upon his face wisbech sat a little farther back in the shadow cast by the shade of the lamp after a moment acton sought the dimmer part of the room wisbech turned to nasmyth  i understand that you expect to marry miss hamilton byandby he said no doubt you have thought over the question of what youre going to keep a wife on  i admit that its one that has caused me a good deal of anxiety and nasmyth leaned forward with his elbows on the table still it hasnt troubled me quite so much of late if i succeed with the scheme i have in hand it will bring me money enough to make a start with a larger venture of the kind or to enable me to undertake ranching on a reasonably extensive scale when the land is ready for cultivation and you havent to face the initial cost of getting rid of heavy timber the business is a profitable one  it is possible that miss hamilton would not care to live at even a tolerably extensive ranch she has been accustomed to comfort of every kind and cheerful society and there cant be very much of either in the bush while if you undertake any further work of the kind you suggest it would be a few years before you made your mark now im not sure it would be reasonable to expect a young woman like miss hamilton to wait indefinitely  nasmyth flushed a little i think he replied that is a question which concerns miss hamilton and me alone  acton leaned forward in his chair mrs acton seems to fancy it concerns her too in fact thats one reason why i wrote to you well im going to lay before you a business proposition you have probably heard of the hecla mineral exploitation concern its run by two friends of mine who have made a great deal of money out of their claims theyre getting elderly and are open to take in a younger mana man of education who has some acquaintance with the work thats done in the bush he must take hold now and hold stock in the concern heres the last letter they wrote me  he passed it across to nasmyth whose face grew eager and then suddenly hardened again the concern in question was as he had heard one of excellent repute and supposed to be carrying on a profitable mining business  its out of the question that i should raise the capital he said  the money can be raised wisbech broke in quietly ill buy that stock for you and if you insist on it you can treat it as a loan  nasmyth sat very still for a moment or two and slowly closed one hard hand he had never expected such an offer from wisbech and he recognized that it would free him of all his difficulties if he accepted it there was however an obstacle in the way  well asked wisbech very dryly isnt the hecla minerals good enough for you  nasmyth looked at acton i must go therenow  that is one of the conditions they want to fix the thing before kekewich who hasnt been well lately starts east on a trip to montreal i promised to wire if you were willing to go down and see them tomorrow  nasmyth turned to wisbech and his voice was strained  i am under many obligations to you already sir but im sorry i cant profit by your generosity in this case he said  why queried wisbech sharply  its a little difficult to explain you see the idea of lowering the river was mine some of the boys up yonder have mortgaged their ranches and put every dollar they could raise in that way into the scheme they look to me to put the thing through so that they may get their money back again  is there no one else who could do that acton asked it seems to me theres nothing wrong with that man gordon i guess you could leave it to him  nasmyth felt that wisbech was watching him with a curious intentness  gordon he answered slowly is at least as well fitted to lead the boys as i am in fact i might go farther than that after all however there is a little more to be said  he stopped abruptly and sat silent a moment or two leaning with one elbow on the table and the light full upon his face there was trouble in his expressive eyes but his mouth was tense and grimly resolute he remembered the pleasant summer days that he and violet hamilton had spent together but he also heard the roar of the river in the misty depths of the cañon and the crash of streamdriven pines the familiar sounds rang in his ears rousing him to action and something in his nature responded in the meanwhile there was a heavy silence in the room his companions watched him closely and acton who looked round for a moment noticed the suggestive glint in wisbechs eyes  nasmyth straightened himself suddenly i know what i am turning my back upon he added it is very probable that i shall never get another opportunity of this kind again still i owe the boys something and i feel i owe a little to myself this scheme in the cañon is the first big thing i have ever undertaken i cant quite make the way that i look at it clear to you butand he brought one hand down on the table in an emphatic fashioni feel that i must go on until it breaks me or i put it through  wisbech noisily thrust his chair back and acton laugheda laugh that had a faint ring in it  well i guess i partly expected this said acton mr nasmyth its a sure thing that rivers not going to break you  nasmyth looked embarrassed but next moment wisbech laid a hand upon his shoulder  derrick he said simply if you had closed with my offer i wouldnt have blamed you but id have felt i had done my duty then and id never have made you another as it is when things are going wrong all you have to do is to send a word to me  then to the relief of his companions acton whose expression changed suddenly broke in again well he commented im not quite sure that miss hamilton will look at the thing from nasmyths point of view i guess well leave him to explain it to her and mrs acton  nasmyth fancied that the explanation would not be an easy task in fact it was one he shrank from but it had to be undertaken and leaving the others he went back to the drawingroom violet hamilton was surrounded by several companions and he did not approach her until she glanced at him as she slipped out into the big cedar hall she sat down on a lounge near the fire and he leaned upon the arm of it looking down on her with grave misgivings he recognized that it was scarcely reasonable to expect that she would be satisfied with the decision he had made  you have seen your uncle and acton she asked  yes answered nasmyth i have something to tell you  the girl turned towards him quickly ah she said you are not going to do what they proposed  im sorry the thing they suggested was out of the question you will let me tell you what it was  violet made a sign of assent and nasmyth spoke quietly for a minute or two then a faint flush crept into the girls cheeks and a sparkle into her eyes  you said no she interrupted  i felt i had to there seemed no other course open to me  violet looked at him in evident bewilderment and nasmyth spoke again deprecatingly you see he explained i felt i had to keep faith with those ranchers  didnt it occur to you that you had also to keep faith with me she inquired sharply  i think that was the one thing i was trying to do  violet showed no sign of comprehension and it was borne in upon nasmyth then that in her place laura waynefleet would have understood the motives that had influenced him and applauded them  my dear he said cant you understand that you have laid an obligation on me to play a creditable part i couldnt turn my back on my comrades now that they have mortgaged their possessions and though i think gordon or one of the others could lead them as well as i could when i asked them to join me i tacitly pledged myself to hold on until we were crushed or had achieved success  he looked at her wistfully when he stopped speaking but she made a gesture of impatience  the one thing clear to me is that if you had done what mr acton suggested you could have lived in victoria and have seen me almost whenever you wished she declared some of those ranchers must know a good deal more about work of the kind you are doing than you do and if you had explained it all to them they would have released you  nasmyth sighed apart from the obligation to his comrades there were other motives which had influenced him he vaguely felt that it was incumbent on him to prove his manhood in this arduous grapple with nature and after a purposeless life to vindicate himself the wilderness as gordon had said had also gotten hold of him and that described what had befallen him reasonably well there are many men and among them men of education in those western forests who having once taken up the axe and drill can never wholly let them go again these men grow restless and morose in the cities which seldom hold them long the customs of civilization pall on them and content comes to them only when they toil kneedeep in some frothing rapid or hew the new waggonroad through a stupendous forest why this should be they do not exactly know and very few of them trouble themselves about the matter perhaps it is a subconscious recognition of the first great task that was laid on man to subdue the earth and to make it fruitful nasmyth at least heard the river its hoarse roar rang insistently in his ears and he braced himself for the conflict that must be fought out in the depths of the cañon these however were feelings that he could not well express and once more he doubted violets comprehension  my dear he told her humbly i am sorry but there was i think only one thing i could do  violet looking up saw that his face was stern and became sensible of a faint and perplexing repulsion from him his languid gracefulness had vanished and he was no longer gay or amusing a rugged elemental forcefulness had come uppermost in him and this was a thing she did not understand involuntarily she shrank from this grave serious man there was a disfiguring newly healed cut on one of his cheeks and his hand was raw and horribly scarred  you have changed since you were last here she said looking at him with disapproval perhaps you really are a little sorry to leave me but i think that is all at least you will not be sorry to get back to the cañon  nasmyth started a little it was a thing that he would at one time certainly not have expected but he realized now that he was driven by a fierce impatience to get back to the work he had undertaken  i think that is not astonishing in one respect he replied i told you why i feel that i must carry the project through the sooner i am successful the sooner i can come back to you  the girl laughed somewhat bitterly if you would only be sensible you need not go away are you quite sure it is not the project that comes first with you she questioned  nasmyth felt the blood creep into his face for it suddenly dawned on him that the suggestion she had made was to some extent warranted  my dear he answered quietly you must try to bear with me  violet rose well she said when do you go away  in the morning  there was resentment in the girls expression since you have made up your mind to go i will make no protest she declared then with a swift change of manner she turned and laid her hand upon his arm after all i suppose you must go derrick you wont stay away very long  they went into the drawingroom together and half an hour had passed when mrs acton beckoned to nasmyth and he followed her into an adjoining alcove she sat down and looked at him reproachfully  i am very angry with you she asserted in fact i feel distinctly hurt you have not come up to my expectations  im sorry replied nasmyth quietly still im not astonished your indignation is perfectly natural i felt at the time mr acton made me the offer that he had been prompted by you thatand he made a deprecatory gestureis one reason why im especially sorry i couldnt profit by it  mrs acton sat silent a moment or two regarding him thoughtfully well she declared from now i am afraid you must depend upon yourself i have tried to be your friend and it seems that i have failed will you be very long at the cañon  if all goes as i expect it six months if not i may be a year or longer i shall certainly not come back until i am successful  that is of course in one sense the kind of decision i should expect you to make it does you credit unfortunately im not sure that its wise  nasmyth looked at her with quick apprehension i wonder he said if you would tell me why it isnt  mrs acton appeared to weigh her words my views are naturally not always correct she answered even if they were i should scarcely expect you to be guided by them still i think it would not be wise of you to stay away very long  she rose and smiled at him it is advice that may be worth taking now i must go back to the others  nasmyth pushed aside the portieres for her and then sauntered into the hall where in a very thoughtful mood he sat down by the fire     chapter xxvi  one nights task   daylight was dying out in a flurry of whirling snow when nasmyth who led a jaded horse floundered down from the steep rock slopes of the divide into the shelter of the dark pines about the head of the gully it was a little warmer there and he was glad of it for he was chilled in spite of the toilsome climb the dark boughs wailed above him tossing athwart his path a haze of sliding snow but he caught a faint and reassuring clink of drills and straightened himself as he clambered down between the trees the sound had a bracing effect on him and he felt a curious little thrill as the clamour of the river came up to him in long pulsations the sound of the waters was growing louder when gordon with a big axe in his hand materialized out of the shadows and strode forward impulsively at the sight of him  hand better were glad to see you but you might have stayed another day or two he said  nasmyth laughed well replied he perhaps its a little curious considering everything but i was impatient to get back again in fact i feel more at home each time i scramble down from the divide  he glanced round through the sliding snow at the dim white range and ranks of towering pines and as he did so the roar of the river and the wail of trees that swayed beneath a fierce wind filled the rockwalled hollow then the persistent clink of drills and thud of axes broke out again while here and there the blurred white figure of a toiling man emerged from the snow it was a picture that a man unused to the wilderness might have shrunk from but gordon understood his comrade they were engaged in a great struggle with the powers of savage nature arrayed against them but it was with a curious quickening of all the strength that was in them mental and physical that they braced themselves for the conflict  i have a thing or two to tell you but well get into the shanty and have supper first the boys are just quitting work remarked gordon  they clambered down over a practicable trail though part of it was covered deep with snow crept in and out among the boulders by the light of a great fire that blazed above the fall and found mattawa laying a meal out when they reached the shanty neither nasmyth nor gordon said anything of consequence until after the meal and then nasmyth who had put on his deerhide jacket and duck trousers flung himself down in an empty packingcase that was stuffed with soft spruce twigs and looked about him with a smile of contentment a lamp hung above him and its light gleamed upon axes drills iron wedges and crosscut saws and made a chequered pattern of brightness and shadow on the rude log walls a glowing stove diffused a cosy warmth and the little room was filled with the odours of tobacco and drying boots and clothes  i suppose you saw wisbech observed gordon miss waynefleet told one of the boys who was through at the settlement that she had a note from him asking if shed get a letter he or acton had written into your hands as soon as possible he seems to be making quite a stay in this country  he has stayed several months longer than he intended replied nasmyth i believe he did it on my account but hes going on again in a week or two i saw him at bonavista wheres waynefleet  i guess hes in victoria  i didnt come across him what took him there  gordon laughed he said it was business wanted to see if we couldnt get our tools and powder cheaper as a matter of fact it would be a relief if that could be done any way he has been working quite hard and has hung on rather longer than i expected administrations his strong point he doesnt like chopping gordons face grew grave in one way its rather a pity hes fond of talking im most afraid somebody may start him discoursing on what were doing over a glass of wine and a cigar i like a man of that kind where i can put my hand on him hes one of our weak spots  nasmyth nodded im sorry i didnt know he was in the city he said how are you getting on  satisfactorily so far as the work goes we have pushed the blasting heading well under the fall but theres a thing that has been worrying me id gone across the range to see what the boys in the valley had done when a man came in it appears he resented our trying to lower the river mattawa saw him  mattawa looked up with a grin he said hed a claim up at the head of the valley and we had got to quit work right away if we didnt hed get the crown people or the court to stop us he liked plenty of water round his ranch some of the boys got a little riled with him and they took him up the gully and put him on his horse  i never heard of a claim up yonder declared nasmyth gravely  well said gordon i believe there is one somebody recorded it a long while ago and did nothing on it but as it was bought land his title stands potter says he understood the man was dead it may be an attempt to get some money out of us  nasmyth sat thoughtfully silent a moment or two  one of the crown people hinted at something of the kind he said now i scarcely think any of the boys would go back on us by selling out his land  not one any way i guess they could hardly do it without the consent of the trustees you and i are not likely to give ours he paused for a moment well he added i guess waynefleet could be depended on  nasmyth said nothing for almost a minute and both recognized that the silence was significant then he rose abruptly  in one shape or other the trouble you suggested is one we will have to face he commented thats why im going to fire a big charge in the blasting heading tonight you can bring the giantpowder along tom  mattawa appeared to be amazed and gordon stared at his comrade curiously  if you fire that charge now youll naturally make an end of the heading and i understood your notion was to drive right under the fall and blow the whole ledge out at one time objected gordon guess if you just rip the top of the rock off as far as we have gone it will take us quite a while to make another tunnel and money as i neednt remind you is running out  exactly agreed nasmyth that extra work will have to be faced but if i can get a big charge in tonight i can cut down the ridge a foot or two two feet less water will count for something in the valley and im going to make sure of it it seems certain that somebody will try to stop us byandby  gordon noticed the hard glint in nasmyths eyes and knew that now when he was being pushed back to the wall he meant to fight and would not shrink from a sacrifice they had driven that uncompleted heading at a heavy cost cutting at first an open gallery in the face of the rock drenched with the spray of the fall then they had crawled into the dripping tunnel hewn out by sheer force of muscle for it was seldom that powder could be used and they had only a wornout machine and had toiled crouching with scarcely room to bring a hammer down on wedge or to hold the drill while from odd fissures the icy river poured in on them now it seemed all that severe effort was to be practically thrown away but he recognized that his comrade was right it was wiser to make sure of two feet than to wait until somebody set the law in motion and stopped the work  yes he assented simply i guess it has to be done  mattawa entered with the magazine and nasmyth laid out several sticks of giantpowder near the stove there was a certain risk in this but giantpowder freezes and when that happens one must thaw it out it is a singularly erratic compound of nitroglycerine which requires to be fired by a powerful detonator and if merely ignited burns harmlessly one can warm it at a stove or even flatten it with a hammer without stirring it to undesired activitythat is as a rulebut now and then a chance tap with a pickhandle or a little jolt suffices to loose its tremendous potentialities in such cases the men nearest it are usually not shattered but dissolved into their component gases  nasmyth was quite aware of this as he sat by the stove kneading the detonators into the sticks that he held up to warm his lips were set but his scarred hands were steady for another risk more or less did not count for very much in the cañon once however mattawa ventured a protest  i guess that sticks quite hot enough he observed  nasmyth said nothing but went on with his work until at length he laid the sticks and fuses in the magazine and signalling to the others moved towards the door the snow beat into their faces when they went outside and the glare of the fire above the fall emphasized the obscurity now the flames flung an evanescent flash of radiance across the whirling pool and the dark rocks side and then sank again to a dim smear of yellow brightness while a haze of vapour whirled amidst the snow for a high wind swept through the cañon sometimes they could see the boulders among which they stumbled and the river frothing at their feet but for the most part they saw nothing and groped onward with dazzled eyes until at last nasmyth swung himself up on the narrow staging that overhung the pool beneath the fall and gordon heard the sticks of giantpowder jolt against the side of the magazine that alone would have sufficed to indicate the state of his comrades temper for so far as it is possible men handle giantpowder very tenderly  there was no rail to the narrow staging which was glazed with frozen spray and when gordon was halfway along it the fire flung out a gush of radiance and sank suddenly then thick smoke whirled about him and for a moment or two he stopped and gasped feeling for the rock with a cautious hand he was aware that the man who slipped from the staging would be whirled round with the eddy and drawn down beneath the fall a harsh voice came out of the darkness  am i to wait here half the night it asked  gordon went on circumspectly bruising his numbed fingers now and then upon the stone until once more a blaze broke out and he saw nasmyth floundering in haste over a pile of shattered rock the magazine was slung over his shoulder and now and then it struck his back or the side of the rock while gordon would have been relieved had his comrade acted more circumspectly he was not surprised there were he knew times when men under strain broke out into an unreasoning fury he had seen one hewing savagely on the perilous side of a tremendous tottering tree and another grimly driving the bolts that could not save it into the stringers of a collapsing wooden bridge it was as he recognized not exactly courage that they had displayed but the elemental savagery that in the newer countries at least now and then seizes on harddriven men ground down by mortgageholders or ruined by flood and frost with man and nature against them they would make their last grim protest before they were crushed gordon once or twice had been conscious of the same fierce desire he could sympathize with nasmyth but after all he wished he would not bang the giantpowder about in that unceremonious fashion  leave the magazine yonder and well bring it along he cried  nasmyth made no answer but he waited until gordon and mattawa joined him and they lowered themselves down from a rock shelf on to a pile of broken rock about which the eddy swirled the spray of the fall beat upon them and the roar of it was bewildering but the noise was softened when they crawled into the entrance of a narrow tunnel mattawa with considerable difficulty struck a match and a pale light streamed out from the little metal lamp he fastened in his hat the light showed the ragged roof of the tunnel and the rivulet of icy water that flowed in the bottom of it they crawled forward through the water for a few yards vainly trying to avoid the deluge which broke upon them from the fissures and finally sat down dripping on a pile of broken rock nasmyth took out his pipe and was lighting it when gordon drew the magazine away from him  you might just as well have done that before you opened the thing he remarked anyway if you merely want to sit down it would have been quite as comfortable in the shanty  nasmyth was silent for several moments then he turned to the other two men with a wry smile  i dont quite know how we drove this heading with the tools we had but i cant think of any means of saving it he said there are men with moneymartial and more of themin the cities waiting to take away from us what we expect to get and since we have to fight them it seems to me advisable to strike where its possible he laughed harshly therell be two feet less water in the valley before the morning  but no heading cried mattawa  well replied nasmyth simply well start another one i notice two holes yonder well drill a third one tom  nasmyth had been in the saddle since sunrise in bitter frost and whirling snow but he picked up a hammer and mattawa seized a drill there was no room to swing the hammer and nasmyth struck half crouching while chilly as the heading was the perspiration dripped from him and the veins rose swollen on his forehead he was up against it and a man strikes hardest when he is pressed back to the wall gordon sat and watched them butfor the rock rang with each jarring thudhe wrapped the magazine in his wet jacket and it was a relief to him when nasmyth finally dropped the hammer  now said nasmyth well fill every hole ram to the top  mattawa placed the giantpowder in the holes and they crawled back trailing a couple of thin wires after them until they reached the strip of shingle near the gully when nasmyth made the connection with the firingplug  a streak of vivid flame leapt out of the rock and the detonation was followed by the roar of the river pouring through the newly opened gap nasmyth turned without a word and plodded back to the shanty a group of men who had scrambled down the gully met him  you were a little astonished to see me boys he said with a question in his voice then he laughed  ive fired a big charge and i guess youll have to start another heading as soon as its sunup  it was evident that the men were disconcerted and an expostulatory murmur rose from them it ceased however when nasmyth waved his hand  i had to do it boys he declared  it had cost them strenuous toil to drive that heading but one could have fancied that they were satisfied with the terse assurance he offered them he had proved himself fit to lead them and they had a steadfast confidence in him  well commented one of the men in that case i guess all we have to do is to start right off at the other one  nasmyth opened the door of the shanty i felt youd look at it that way boys he said ill explain the thing later im a little played out tonight  the men plodded away up the gully and in another few minutes nasmyth was sound asleep     chapter xxvii  timber rights   they set to work on the new heading at sunrise next morning but it was a week or two before they had made much of an opening in the rock beneath the fall though nasmyth had lowered the level of the river a little the smoothworn stone still rose sheer from the depths of the whirling pool and the blasting had obliterated every trace of their previous operations they were compelled to make new approaches and they toiled drenched with the icy spray on frail slung stages cutting sockets for the logs to hold a heavier platform for the little boringmachine nasmyth had purchased in victoria when the platform was built the working face was narrow and the rock of a kind that yielded very slowly to the cuttingtool they had no power but that of wellhardened muscle and none of the workers had any particular knowledge of engineering  they pushed the new heading toilsomely beneath the fall working in rock fissured by the last explosion through which the water poured in on them while the river rose when the frost broke up and was succeeded by a week or two of torrential rain the water swirled high among the boulders and had crept almost to the mouth of the heading when one evening wheeler walked into the shanty he said nothing of any consequence until supper was over and he then took a newspaper out of his pocket  have you had any strangers round he asked  no answered nasmyth with a dry smile that is they didnt get any farther than the head of the gully two of them turned up one wet day and when they found they couldnt get down they explained rather forcibly what they thought of me  wheeler nodded and handed the paper across to him  i guess you did quite right he said this should make it clear that some of the city men with money are on our trail  nasmyth glanced at the paper and saw a notification that certain timber rights in the forest belt surrounding the valley had been applied for  the charters people he declared when i was in victoria i had a talk with them i partly expected something of the kind by the way i got a notification from the rancher i mentioned that if i continued operations proceedings would be begun against me  they mean business commented wheeler with a snap in his dark eyes it seems to me there are several of them in the thing and they evidently expect to get their hands on the valley one way or another in all probability their idea is to let you get most of the work in and then scare you into selling out for what they like to offer have you had any big trees coming along lately  yes answered mattawa one or two went over the fall this afternoon  drift logs  two had the branches chopped off them  wheeler made a sign of comprehension well he predicted youre going to see a good many more of that kind before very long he turned to nasmyth im going to stay over tomorrow the mills held up again we had an awkward break and i cant get the new fixings in you can tell me how youre getting on  they talked until late that night and on awakening next morning found the river higher and thick with shattered ice it had also crept into the heading and the men who worked in it were kneedeep in water they however went on as usual and it was in the afternoon that several great trees leapt the fall and driving down the rapid whirled away into the black depths of the cañon wheeler who stood watching attentively nodded as the trees drove by  hemlock thats not going to count for milling purposes he observed  nasmyth who came up dripping wet sat down on a boulder and took out his pipe  did you expect anything else he asked  wheeler laughed im not sure that i did it seems to me the men who want those timber rights dont figure on doing much milling he looked up sharply this ones red cedar  another great trunk leapt the fall swept round the pool and then brought up with a crash upon the pile of shattered rock which still lay athwart the head of the rapid nasmyth rose and straightened himself wearily  its a trifle unfortunate i hadnt hove that rock out with the derrick well have to take hold if the log wont swing clear he said  the tree swung a little and then the thinner head of it drove in among the boulders and stuck fast in another moment a shout rose from a man standing on the ledge above the fall  quite a batch of big logs coming along he called  nasmyth thrust his pipe into his pocket and wheeler who watched him nodded  theyll jam and pile up said wheeler i guess thats what the other folks wanted you have got to keep them clear  in another few moments nasmyth was beating a suspended iron sheet and while its clangour broke through the roar of the river the men floundered towards him over the shingle one or two of them had axes and the rest running into the shanty brought out saws and handspikes in the meanwhile a huge log crashed upon the one held fast and there was no need to tell any of the men that those which followed would rapidly pile up into an inextricable confusion of interlocked timber there was only one thing to be done and that was to cut away the first log which would hold them back as soon as possible  the men set to work two or three of them running recklessly along the rounded top of the slippery trunk which rolled a little as it hammered upon the rock mattawa with a big crosscut saw crouched on the halfsubmerged pile of stone and a comrade who seized its opposite handle held himself somehow on the second trunk by his knees it was difficult to understand how they could work at all but they were accustomed to toiling under embarrassing conditions the saw had hardly bitten through the bark when another log drove grinding against the rest and mattawas companion who let the handle go fell forward on his face he was up again in a moment and after that stuck fast while log after log drove smashing upon the growing mass sometimes the one he clung to rose up under him and sometimes it sank until he crouched in the water while another great butt crept up upon it and it seemed that he must be crushed between them still the saw rasped steadily through the heaving grinding timber it was perilous work but it was clear to all of them that it had to be done  in the meanwhile nasmyth and gordon stood kneedeep amidst the white foam of the rapid the water was icy cold and it was with difficulty they kept their feet while every now and then a shower of spray that leapt out from among the timber fell upon them the logs were already two deep at that spot and one great top ground steadily forward over the others as its presseddown butt was driven on by those behind one could almost have fancied it was bent on escaping from the horrible confusion of piledup trunks that moved on one another under the impact of the flood more were sweeping on and crash after crash rang through the hoarse clamour of the fall  nasmyth felt very feeble as he whirled the heavy axe about his head for that mass of timber was impressively big he had torn off his deerhide jacket and his soaked blue shirt gaped open to his waist at every heave of his shoulders he stood in icy water but the perspiration dripped from him as he swung with every blow though some men with good thews and sinews can never learn to use the axe to any purpose he could chop and the heavy blade he whirled rang with a rhythmic precision in the widening notch then flashed about his head and fell with a chunk that was sharp as a whipcrack into the gap again in between gordons axe swept down and the blades flashed athwart each others orbits without a check or clash it requires years to acquire that kind of proficiency with the axe but the result is a perfecting of the cooperation between will and hardened muscle  it was fortunate that both could chop for the men with the crosscut appeared in difficulties the tree bent on the pile of rock and in straining closed the cut upon the saw another man who had joined them was endeavouring to hammer a wedge in but with that crushing weight against him the attempt seemed futile he persisted however and stood above the white froth of the rapid a puny figure dwarfed by the tremendous rock wall whirling what appeared to be a wholly insignificant hammer his comrades were scattered about the grinding mass making ineffective efforts to heave a butt or top clear of the others with their handspikes but there was clearly only one vulnerable point of attack and that was the one nasmyth and gordon were hewing at wheeler who felt the tension watched them clutching hard upon an unlighted pipe he was aware that if the mass of timber which grew rapidly larger once wedged itself fast it might be a month or two before a flood broke it up but he had also sense enough to recognize that since most of the mens efforts were futile he might just as well sit still  the trunk was partly hewn through when the top of it bent outwards and gordon flashed an anxious glance at it it was evident that if none of the others wedged themselves in upon and reinforced it the weight behind would shortly rend the trunk apart then the position would become a particularly perilous one for the whole mass would break away in chaotic ruin and he and his comrade stood close in front of it but he could not tell how much further strain the tree would bear and he recognized that it was desirable to hew the notch as deep as possible before he relinquished chopping the axes rang for another two minutes and then there was a sudden crash and a cry from wheeler that was drowned in the tumult of sound that rose from the liberated timber  great logs reared their butts or tops out of the heaving mass some rolled round and disappeared beneath those that crept upon them but for a moment or two the shattered trunk jammed down by the weight upon it held them back from the plunge into the rapid it smashed among the rocks that ground and rent it as it slowly gave way and wheeler ran his hardest towards a strip of shingle that projected a little into the river he saw nasmyth who had evidently lost his footing driving downstream towards it and knew that in another moment or two the logs would be upon him  nasmyth was not exactly swimming in fact strictly speaking one cannot swim in a rapid nor when there is only three or four feet of water can one get upon ones feet he rolled over and over went down and came up again until wheeler floundering into the foaming water clutched him and held on desperately though he felt that his arm was being drawn out of its socket he would probably have been swept away too had not somebody grabbed his jacket and he heard a hoarse voice behind him  heave it saidheave  the strain on wheelers arm became intolerable but somehow he held fast and just then there was an appalling crash and roar he felt himself being dragged backwards and in another moment fell heavily upon the shingle with nasmyth across his feet blinking about him half dazed he saw the logs drive by rolling grinding smashing and falling on one another then as they whirled down the rapid and the roar they made began to die away he looked round and saw several gasping men standing close behind him  guess that was quite a near thing said one of them any way in this kind of contract you can sure figure on trouble  this as a matter of fact was perfectly correct for it is only at considerable peril to life and limb that sawlogs are driven down the rivers to a western mill they must be guided through each awkward pass and frothing rapid and the men who undertake it spring with pike and peevie from one to another while the rolling trunks tumultuously charge on  nobody however troubled himself any further about the matter and in a few more minutes the men had set to work again heaving the rocks that had held up the first log out of the river with the derrick it was not until supper was over and he sat with his companions in the shanty that wheeler referred to the affair again he looked at nasmyth with a smile  i guess its fortunate you got those logs away he said its probably a little more than the men who turned them loose on you figured you could do  that agreed nasmyth is very much my own opinion  wheeler filled his pipe now he said reflectively anybody can apply for timber rights and bid for them at public auction but the man who secures them must cut up so many thousand feet every month since thats the case its quite evident that nobody is likely to bid for timber rights round the valley except the charters people who have a little mill on the klatchquot inlet and theyd probably get the timber rights most for nothing though they might have to put in a new saw or two with the object of satisfying the legislature  its rather difficult to see how they expect to make a profit on hemlock in view of what it would cost them to get the logs there gordon broke in  they dont want to make a profit wheeler smiled seems to me its their programme to get hold of the rights cheap and then worry you because they cant run the logs through this cañon the legislature wont give you land or rights to do nothing with and its quite likely the charters people will file a notification that your workings are the obstacle still theyd probably make you an offer first if you let them in on the groundfloorhanded them a big slice of the valley or something of the kindtheyd let up on their timber rights im not sure they could run good milling fir to that mill at a profit  a grim look crept into nasmyths face difficulties were crowding thick upon him and though he was as determined as ever on proceeding with the work he almost felt that it would be only until they crushed him  it seems to me we are in the hands of the charters people unless i can keep the cañon clear he commented  wheelers eyes twinkled well he returned theyre smart i have however come across smart folks who missed a point or two occasionally now i saw a couple of red cedar logs among that hemlock  he glanced at mattawa tom youve been round the head of the valley did you strike any trees of that kind up yonder  a few answered mattawa its quite likely there are more  a sure thing you and i are going out timberright prospecting at sunup tomorrow just now they cant get red cedar shingles fast enough on to the eastern markets  nasmyth looked up and gordon laughed a soft laugh while wheeler waved his hand  anyone can bid for timber rights he declared now our folks are open for any business and we have got a mill its not going to cost much to put a shinglesplitting plant in we have easy watercarriage to the inlet where a schooner can load and the charters people would have to tow their raw material right along to their mill besides that inlets a blame awkward place to get a schooner in its quite clear to me we could cut shingles way cheaper than they could he paused for a moment yes he said if theres milling cedar near the valley our folks will make their bid if charters wants those rights hell have to put up the money and its quite likely well take them up in spite of him if im satisfied with my prospecting in that case were not going to worry you about the cañon in fact we would probably make you a proposition at so much the log for running the trees down for us  he filled his pipe again and nasmyth looked at him with relief in his eyes     chapter xxviii  a painful duty   three months had slipped away since the evening on which wheeler had discussed the subject of shinglesplitting with his companions nasmyth stood outside the shanty in the drenching rain he was very wet and miry and his face was lined and worn for the three months of unremitting effort had left their mark on him wheeler had secured the timber rights in question and that was one difficulty overcome but nasmyth had excellent reasons for believing that the men who had cast covetous eyes upon the valley had by no means abandoned the attempt to get possession of at least part of it  he had had flood and frost against him and his money was rapidly running out a wild flood swept through the cañon the heading was filled up so that no one could even see the mouth of it and half the rock he had piled upon the shingle had been swept into the rapid where it had formed a dam among the boulders that could be removed only at a heavy expenditure of time and powder when the water fell he was worn out in body and savage from being foiled by the swollen river at each attempt he made but while the odds against him were rapidly growing heavier he meant to fight  a siwash indian whom he had hired as messenger between the cañon and the settlement had just arrived and gordon who stood in the doorway of the shanty took a newspaper out of the wet packet he had brought gordon turned to nasmyth when he opened it  wheelers getting ahead he said heres his announcement that his concern is turning out a highgrade cedar shingle thats satisfactory so far as it goes i dont quite know how wed have held out if it hadnt been for the money we got from him for running the logs down then his voice grew suddenly eager try to get hold of the significance of this derrick we have got it on reliable authority that certain propositions for the exploitation of the virgin forestbelt beyond the butte divide will shortly be laid before the legislature it is expected that liberal support will be afforded to a project for the making of new waggonroads and we believe that if the scheme is adopted certain gentlemen in this city will endeavour to inaugurate a steamboat service with the western inlets he waved his hand when this particular paper makes an assertion of that kind theres something going on he added its a sure thing that if those roads are made it will put another thirty or forty cents on to every dollars worth of land were holding  exactly replied nasmyth whose tense face did not relax that is it would if we had run the water out of the valley but as it happens we havent cut down very much of the fall yet and this thing is going to make the men we have against us keener than ever theyre probably plotting how to strike us now get those letters open  there was anxiety in his voice and gordon started when he had ripped open one or two of the envelopes  this looks like business he remarked as he glanced at a letter from a lawyer who had once or twice handled nasmyths affairs in the city its from phelps he says he has been notified that unless an agreement can be arrived at proceedings will be taken by a man called hames who claims to hold one hundred acres on the western side of the valley to restrain you from altering the river level atterlyhes the man weve heard from alreadyit seems is taking action too  hames repeated nasmyth ive never heard of him any way he cant hold land on the western side we havent sold an acre he stopped a moment and looked hard at gordon that is i havent sanctioned it and i believe theres nobody holding a share in the project who would go back on us  gordon made a gesture indicating his doubt in the subject and they looked at each other for half a minute  im afraid i cant go quite as far as that he replied and laughed harshly as it stands recorded the land could be transferred to anyone by waynefleet any way it seems to be in his block phelps cites the boundaryposts  nasmyth closed one hand tight waynefleet who had found the constant wetting too much for him had left the cañon a week or two before this morning on which it was evident a crisis of some sort was near he had complained of severe pains in his back and joints and had sent them no word after his departure  is there anything from him asked nasmyth  gordon picked out an envelope and opened it heres a note from miss waynefleet she desires you to ride across at once  with a troubled face nasmyth stood still in the rain another minute  ill take the packhorse and start now he said after a brief silence when i have seen miss waynefleet ill go right on to victoria he turned and gazed at the river if one could get into the heading by any means id fire every stick of giantpowder in it first unfortunately the thing is out of the question  in a few moments he was scrambling up the gully and gordon who went into the shanty and lighted his pipe sat gazing at the letters very thoughtfully they had no money to spare for any legal expenses indeed he was far from sure they had enough to supply them with powder and provisions until their task was accomplished during the long grim fight in the cañon they had borne almost all that could be expected of flesh and blood and it was unthinkable that the city man who sat snug in his office and plotted should lay grasping hands upon the profit still that seemed possible now that somebody had betrayed them  meantime nasmyth had swung himself into the packsaddle and in the rain was scrambling up the rocky slopes of the divide he had not changed his clothing and it would have availed him little if he had since there was a long days ride before him the trail was a little easier than it had been for each man who led the packhorse along it had hewn through some obstacle but it was still sufficiently difficult and every here and there a frothing torrent swept across it there were slopes of wet rock to be scrambled over several leagues of dripping forest thick with undergrowth that clung about the narrow trail to be floundered through and all the time the great splashes from the boughs or torrential rain beat upon him in places he led the packhorse in places he rode and dusk was closing in when he saw a blink of light across waynefleets clearing in another few minutes he had led the jaded horse into the stable and then splashed with mire and with the water running from his clothes had limped to the homestead door  nasmyth opened the door and saw laura waynefleet sitting by the stove she started as he came in  i have been expecting you she said she gave him her hand and her eyes met his with a look of anxiety she noticed his appearance of weariness and the condition of his clothing i can get you something dry to put on she added  no said nasmyth you must not trouble i would be quite as wet again soon after i leave here if i can borrow a horse i must push on to the railroad in an hour  tonight asked laura after riding in from the cañon its out of the question besides you could never get through the willow ford listen to the rain  nasmyth sank wearily into the nearest chair and heard the deluge lash the shingled roof  im afraid it must be done he declared  laura laid supper upon the table and insisted that he should eat before she made any reference to the object she had in hand then while he sat beside the stove with his clothes steaming she looked at him steadily and a little colour crept into her face  i wonder if you can guess why i sent for you she said  where is your father nasmyth asked abruptly  in victoria he left six days ago i suppose he sent you no word that he was going  no answered nasmyth very dryly he certainly didnt i dont think i could have expected it from him  he sat silent for almost a minute looking at her with a troubled air and though laura was very quiet her manner was vaguely suggestive of tension it was nasmyth who broke the silence  i believe you have something to tell me miss waynefleet he said still i would sooner you didnt if it will hurt you after all its rather more than possible that i can arrive at the information by some other means  the tinge of colour grew plainer in lauras face but it was evident that she laid a firm restraint upon herself ah she cried it has hurt me horribly already i cant get over the shame of it but that isnt what i meant to speak of i feeland her voice grew tense and strainedi must try to save you and the others from a piece of wicked treachery  she straightened herself and there was a flash in her eyes but nasmyth raised one hand  no he protested almost sternly i cant let you do this you would remember it ever afterwards with regret  the girl seemed to nerve herself for an effort and when she spoke her voice was impressively quiet  you must listen and try to understand she said  it is not only because it would hurt me to see you and the others tricked out of what you have worked so hard for that i feel i must tell you if there was nothing more than that i might perhaps never have told you after all i want to save my father from a shameful thing her voice broke away and the crimson flush on her face deepened as she went on again he has been offering to sell land that cant belong to him she asserted accusingly  nasmyth felt sorry for her and he made an attempt to offer her a grain of consolation  a few acres are really his he said i made them over to him  to be his only if he did his share and when the scheme proved successful laura interrupted i know if he has sold them what an opportunity of harassing you it will give the men who are plotting against you still now you know you can perhaps break off the bargain i want you to do what you canand she glanced at him with a tense look in her eyesif it is only to save him  that replied nasmyth quietly is for quite another reason the object i have in view i would like you to understand that i have guessed that he had failed us already it may be some little consolation now perhaps you had better tell me exactly what you know  laura did so and it proved to be no more than nasmyth had suspected letters had passed between waynefleet and somebody in victoria and the day after he left for that city two men who had evidently crossed him on the way arrived at the ranch one said his name was hames and his conversation suggested that he supposed the girl was acquainted with her fathers affairs in any case what he said made it clear that he had either purchased or was about to purchase from waynefleet certain land in the valley after staying half an hour the men had laura understood set out again for victoria  when she had told him this nasmyth sat thoughtfully silent a minute or two her courage and hatred of injustice had stirred him deeply for he knew what it must have cost her to discuss the subject of her fathers wrongdoing with him he was also once more overwhelmingly sorry for her there was nobody she could turn to for support or sympathy and it was evident that if he succeeded in foiling hames it would alienate her from her father waynefleet he felt was not likely to forgive her for the efforts she had made to save him from being drawn into an act of profitable treachery  well he said after a moments thought i am going on to victoria to see what can be done but there is another matter that is troubling me i wonder if it has occurred to you that your father will find it very difficult to stay on at the ranch when the part he has played becomes apparent i am almost afraid the boys will be vindictive  i believe he has not expected to carry on the ranch much longer it is heavily mortgaged and he has been continually pressed for money  has he any plans  laura smiled wearily he has always plans i believe he intends to go to one of the towns on puget sound and start a land agency she made a dejected gesture i dont expect him to succeed in it but perhaps i could earn a little  nasmyth set his lips tight and there was concern in his face she looked very forlorn and he knew that she was friendless he could hardly bring himself to contemplate the probability of her being cast adrift saddled with a man who it was evident would only involve her in fresh disasters and he fancied reproach her as the cause of them a gleam of anger crept into his eyes  if your father had only held on with us i could have saved you this he observed  there was a great sadness in lauras smile  still she replied he didnt and perhaps you couldnt have expected it of him he sees only the difficulties and i am afraid never tries to face them  nasmyth felt his selfcontrol deserting him he was conscious of an almost overwhelming desire to save the girl from the results of her fathers dishonesty and folly and he could see no way in which it could be done then it was borne in upon him that in another moment or two he would probably say or do something that he would regret afterwards and she would resent and rising stiffly he held out his hand  i must push on to the railroad he said and he held the hand she gave him in a firm clasp miss waynefleet you saved my life and i believe i owe you quite as much in other ways its a fact that neither of us can attempt to disregard i want you to promise that you will at least not leave the ranch without telling me  laura flashed a quick glance at him and perhaps she saw more than he suspected in his insistent gaze for she strove to draw her hand away he held it fast however while his nerves thrilled and his heart beat furiously he remembered violet hamilton vaguely but there came upon him a compelling desire to draw this girl to whom he owed so much into his arms and comfort her they both stood very still a moment and nasmyth heard the snapping of the stove with a startling distinctness thenand it cost him a strenuous efforthe let her hand go  you will promise he insisted hoarsely  yes answered laura before i go away i will tell you  nasmyth went out into the blackness and the rain while laura sat trembling until she heard the beat of his horses hoofs then she sank lower a limp huddled figure in the canvas chair the stove snapped noisily and the pines outside set up a doleful wailing but except for that it was very still in the desolate ranch  nasmyth rode on until he borrowed a fresh horse from a man who lived a few miles along the trail there was a cheerful light from the windows as he rode into a little settlement and the trail to the railroad led through dripping forest and over a towering range but he did not draw bridle he was aching all over and the water ran from his garments but he scarcely seemed to feel his weariness then and he pushed on resolutely through the rain up the climbing trail  he remembered very little of that ride afterwards or what he thought about during it the strain of the last few minutes he had passed at waynefleets ranch had left him dazed and part of his numbness at least was due to weariness several times he was almost flung from the saddle as the horse scrambled down a slope of rock willowbranches lashed him as he pushed through the thickets and in one place it was only by a grim effort that he drove the frightened beast to ford a flooded creek then there was a strip of hillside to be skirted where the slope was almost sheer beneath the edge of the winding trail and the rain that drove up the valley beat into his eyes still he held on and two hours after sunrise rode half asleep into the little mining town there was a train in the station and turning the horse over to a man he met he climbed dripping as he was into a car     chapter xxix  a futile scheme   there was bright sunshine at bonavista when nasmyth who had been told at the station that acton had arrived from victoria the day before limped out from the shadow of the surrounding bush and stood still a moment or two glancing across the trim lawn and terrace towards the wooden house the spacious dwelling gay with its brightly painted lattice shutters dainty scrollwork and colonnades of wooden pillars rose against the sombre woods and he wondered with some anxiety whether mrs acton had many guests in it he had no desire to fall in with any strangers for he was worn out and aching and he still wore the old duck clothing in which he had left the cañon it might he fancied be possible to slip into the house and change before he presented himself to mrs acton though he was by no means sure that the garments in the valise he carried in his hand were dry he could see nobody on the terrace and moved forward hastily until he stopped in consternation as he crossed one of the verandas the sunlight streamed in and mrs acton and violet hamilton sat upon the seat which ran along the back of it the girl started when she saw him and nasmyth stood looking down on her worn in face and heavyeyed with his workmans garb clinging tight and mirestained about his limbs there was however a certain grimness in his smile he had seen the girls start and her momentary shrinking and it occurred to him that there was a significance in the fact that it had not greatly hurt him  i must make my excuses for turning up in this condition he apologized i had to start for the railroad at a moments notice and it rained all the way while when i reached it the train was in the depôt you see my business is rather urgent  mrs acton laughed evidently she said i think we were both a trifle startled when we saw you i should be sorry to hear that anything had gone seriously wrong but you remind one of the man who brought the news of flodden  nasmyth made a quick gesture of denial well he announced bravely our standard is flying yet and i almost think we can make another rally or two still i have come for reinforcements mr acton is in  he is as it happened he came up from victoria yesterday i believe he is discussing some repairs to the steamer with george just now ill send you out a plate of something and a glass of wine you cant have had any lunch  mrs acton rose and nasmyth who sat down looked at violet with a smile she was evidently not quite at ease  you really havent welcomed me very effusively he remarked  the girl flushed i dont think i could be blamed for that she returned i was startled  and perhaps just a little annoyed  the colour grew plainer in violets cheeks well she averred that isnt so very unnatural after all i dont mind admitting that i wish you hadnt come like this  nasmyth glanced down at his attire and nodded gravely its certainly not altogether becoming he admitted i made that hole drilling but i fancied i had mended the thing still you see i had to start on the moment and i rode most of twentyfour hours in the rain i supposeand he hesitated while he studied her facei might have tidied myself at the depôt but as it happened i didnt think of it which was no doubt very wrong of me  it was at least a little inconsiderate  nasmyth laughed goodhumouredly though he recognized that neither his weariness nor the fact that it must manifestly be business of some consequence that had brought him there in that guise had any weight with her he had after all a wide toleration and he acknowledged to himself that her resentment was not unreasonable  ive no doubt that i was inconsiderate he said still you see i was worried about our affairs in the cañon  the cañon repeated violet reproachfully it is always the cañon i wonder if you remember that it is at least a month since you have written a line to me  nasmyth was disconcerted for a moments reflection convinced him that the accusation was true  well he confessed i have certainly been shamefully remiss of course i was busy from dawn to sunset but after all im afraid that is really no excuse  the girl frowned no she said it isnt  it was a slight relief to nasmyth that a maid appeared just then and he took a glass of wine from the tray she laid upon a little table  to the brightest eyes in this province he said when the servant had gone and emptying the glass he fell upon the food voraciously  it was unfortunate that in such unattractive guise he had come upon violet and the fashion in which he ate also had its effect on her in the last thirty hours he had had only one hasty meal and he showed a voracity that offended her fastidious taste he was worn out and anxious and since all his thoughts were fixed upon the business that he had in hand he could not rouse himself to act according to the manner expected of a lover who returns after a long absence it was however once more borne in upon him that this was significant  violet on her part felt repelled by him he was gaunt and lean and the state of his garments had shocked her his hands were hard and battered she was very dainty and in some respects unduly sensitive and it did not occur to her that it would have been more natural if in place of shrinking she had been sensible only of a tender pity for him perhaps there were excuses for her attitude she had never been brought into contact with the grim realities of life and it is only from those whom that befalls that one can expect the wide sympathy which springs from comprehension nasmyth lounging at bonavista with amusing speeches on his lips and his air of easy deference had been a somewhat romantic figure and the glimpses of the struggle in the bush that he had given her had appealed to her imagination she could feel the thrill of it when she saw it through his eyes with all the unpleasantly realistic features carefully wiped out but it was different now that he had come back to her with the dust and stain of the conflict fresh upon him the evidences of his strife were only repulsive and she shrank from them she watched him with a growing impatience until he rose and laid his empty plate aside  well he observed you will excuse me i must see mr acton as soon as i can  it was not in any way a tactful speech and violet resented it the man it seemed had only deferred the business he had on hand for a meal she looked at him with her displeasure flashing in her eyes  in that case she said i should of course be sorry to keep you away from him  nasmyth gazed at her curiously but he did not reply he went away from her a few minutes later when he entered actons room he was attired in conventional fashion his host shook hands with him and then leaned back in a chair waiting for him to speak which he did with a trace of diffidence  my object is to borrow money he explained frankly i couldnt resent it in the least if you sent me on to somebody else  ill hear what you have to say in the first case replied acton you had better explain exactly how you stand  nasmyth did so as clearly as he could and acton looked at him thoughtfully for a moment or two  ive been partly expecting this he observed its quite clear that one or two of the big land exploitation people have a hand in the thing i guess i could put my finger right down on them you said the mans name was hames  nasmyth said it was and acton sat thinking for several minutes  it seems to me that the folks i have in my mind havent been quite smart enough he declared at length they should have put up a sounder man as it happens i know a little about the one they fixed upon mr hames is what you could call a professional claimjumper and its fortunate that theres a weak spot or two in his career  acton paused and nasmyth waited in tense expectancy until the older man turned to him again with a twinkle in his eyes  i almost think i can take a hand in this thing and to commence with well go down to victoria this afternoon and call on mr hames he added if he has bought that land it will probably be registered in his name the men you have against you are rather fond of working in the dark then we come to another pointwhat it would be wisest to do with waynefleet who went back on you you said he had a mortgage on his ranch you know who holds it  nasmyth said he did not know and acton nodded any way he rejoined we can ascertain it in the city now i guess you would like that man run right out of the neighbourhood it would be safest and it might perhaps be done  nasmyth was startled by this suggestion and with a thoughtful face he sat wondering what was most advisable he bore waynefleet very little goodwill but it was clear that laura must share any trouble that befell her father and he could not at any cost lay a heavier load upon her he was conscious that acton was watching him intently  no he objected i dont want him driven out in fact i should be satisfied with making it impossible for him to enter into any arrangement of the kind again  in that case i guess well try to buy up his mortgage remarked acton lands going to be dearer in that district presently  nasmyth looked at him with a little confusion it is very kind but after all i have no claim on you  no agreed acton with a smile you havent in one way this is however a kind of thing im more at home in than you seem to be and there was a little promise i made your uncle for another thingand he waved his handim going to take a reasonable profit out of you  nasmyth made no further objections and they set out for victoria that afternoon hames was however not readily traced and when on the following morning they sat in actons office waiting his appearance nasmyth was conscious of a painful uncertainty acton with a smile on his face leaned back in his chair until hames was shown in hames was a big bronzefaced man plainly dressed in city clothes but there was nasmyth noticed a trace of halffurtive uneasiness in his eyes acton looked up at him quietly and let him stand for several moments then he waved his hand toward a chair  wont you sit down we have got to have a talk said acton ill come right to the point you have have been buying land  hames sat down i cant quite figure how that concerns you he replied im not going to worry about it any way  i want that landthe block you bought from waynefleet  its not for sale asserted hames if you have nothing else to put before me ill get on im busy this morning  acton leaned forward in his chair when im in the city im usually busy too he said in fact ive just three or four minutes to spare for you and i expect to get through in that time to begin with you sent mr hutton a note from your hotel when my clerk came for you he never got it you can have it back unopened i can guess whats in the thing he handed hames an envelope now he went on you can make a fuss about it but i guess it wouldnt be wise hutton doesnt know quite as much about you as i do ive had a finger in most of what has been done in this province the last few years and its not often i forget a man well i guess i could mention one or two little affairs that were not altogether creditable which you had a share in  hames laughed its quite likely  still what you dont know is that im on the inside track of what was done when the hobson folks jumped the black crag claim there was considerable trouble over the matter  nasmyth saw hames start but he apparently braced himself with an effort  any way replied hames that was most four years ago and theres not a man who had a hand in it in this province now  acton shook his head theres one i can put my hand on your partner okanagon jim just when i want to  there was no doubt that hames was alarmed  jim was drowned crossing the river the night the water broke into the black crag shaft he declared  his horse was and the boys found his hat that however is quite a playedout trick if youre not satisfied i can fix it for you to meet him here any time you like  hames made a motion of acknowledgment i dont want to see himthats a sure thing i guess you know it was fortunate that jim and two or three of the other boys got out of the shaft that night well i guess that takes me if jims around ill put down my cards  its wisest advised acton now im going to buy that land waynefleet sold from youor rather hes going to give you your money back for it you can arrange the thing with huttonwho i believe supplied the moneyafterwards as best you can  nasmyth fancied hames was relieved that no more was expected from him  i guess im in your hands observed hames  then acton said you can wait in my clerks office until im ready to go over with you to waynefleets hotel  hames went out and acton turned to nasmyth he was hired with a few others to jump the claim he mentioned and there was trouble over it as usual just what happened never quite came out but that man left his partner to face the boys who scarcely managed to escape with their lives that night the man who holds waynefleets mortgage should be here at any moment  the man arrived in a few minutes after he had sat down and had taken the cigar acton offered him he was ready to talk business  you have a mortgage on rancher waynefleets holding in the bush said acton i understand youve had some trouble in getting what he owes you  the man nodded thats certainly the case he said i bought up quite a lot of land before i laid down the mill but after i did that i let most of it go in fact im quite willing to let up on waynefleets holding too i cant get a dollar out of him  have you offered to sell the mortgage to anybody  i saw martial and the charters people not long ago theyd give about eighty cents on the dollar hutton said hed make me a bid but he didnt  well said acton my friend here wants that ranch for a particular purpose hed bid you ninety  i cant do it if the new roads that have been suggested are made the ranch ought to bring me a little more still i dont mind letting you in at what i gave for it  acton looked at nasmyth  then said acton well call it a bargain you can write me a note to that effect and ill send my clerk across with the papers presently  the man went out a few minutes later and acton rose  ill charge you bank interest but if you care to put the mortgage up for sale youll get your money back most any time after they start those roads acton said to nasmyth now well go along and call on waynefleet  they went out with hames and a little while later came upon waynefleet sitting on the veranda of a secondrate hotel he was dressed immaculately and with a cigar in his hand lay in a big chair he started when he saw them hames grinned and sat down close in front of him  im going back on my bargain i want my money and you can keep your land he said the fact is mr acton has got on my trail and hes not the kind of man i have any use for fighting  there was consternation in waynefleets face but he straightened himself with an effort  i suppose you have brought this man mr nasmyth and i scarcely think it is quite what one would have expected from youat least until you had afforded me the opportunity of offering you an explanation he blustered  can you offer me one that any sensible man would listen to nasmyth asked sharply  he cant acton broke in were out on business you may as well make it clear that we understand the thing  waynefleet turned and looked at acton with lifted brows and had he been less angry nasmyth could have laughed at his attitude waynefleets air of supercilious resentment was inimitable  you have some interest in this affair he inquired  oh yes answered acton cheerfully still you neednt worry about me all you have to do is to hand this man over the money and record the new sale we dont want any unpleasantness but it has to be done  waynefleet appeared to recognize that there was no remedy  in that case there is the difficulty that i cant quite raise the amount paid he said travelling and my stay in the city have cost me something  how much are you short  about a hundred dollars  then replied acton ill take a bill for the money well go along and record the sale as soon as mr nasmyths ready i expect he has something to say to you  acton went into the hotel with hames and there was an awkward silence when they had disappeared nasmyth leaned against a wooden pillar and waynefleet sat still waiting for him to speak nasmyth turned to him  it would perhaps be preferable to regard this affair from a strictly business point of view said nasmyth you are of course in our hands but to save your credit and to protect miss waynefleet from any embarrassment we shall probably not insist upon your handing over the land to anybody else i think we are safe in doing that now that you have signally failed you will not have nerve enough to attempt to betray us again  waynefleet waved his hand i resent the attitude you have adopted it is not by any means what i am accustomed to or should have expected from you  nasmyth felt a faint contemptuous pity for the man who still endeavoured to retain his formality of manner  im afraid that hasnt any great effect on me and my attitude is at least a natural one he said i believe that gordon and i can arrange that the boys do not hear of your recent action and though you will take no further part in our affairs you will stay on at the ranch i may mention that i have just bought up your mortgage  a flush of anger showed in waynefleets cheeks  is it in any way your business where i live he asked  no answered nasmyth not in the leastthat is as far as it affects yourself still i am determined that miss waynefleet shall have no fresh cause for anxiety i dont mind admitting that i owe a great deal to her he paused for a moment and then turned to waynefleet with a forceful gesture when you have bought back the land from hames i dont suppose you will have a dollar in your possession and the ranch belongs to me as i said you will stayat least until you can satisfy me that you can maintain yourself and miss waynefleet in some degree of comfort if you go away now i believe the others are waiting we will go along and get the sale recorded     chapter xxx  second thoughts   it was getting dusk when wheeler swung himself from the saddle near the head of the gully and with the bridle of the jaded horse in his hand stood still a few moments looking about him a wonderful green transparency still shone high up above the peaks whose jagged edges cut into it sharply with the cold bluewhite gleam of snow but upon the lower slopes there was a balmy softness in the air which was heavy with the odours of fir and cedar summer was breaking suddenly upon the mountainland but wheeler who had crossed the divide in bright sunshine was sensible of a certain shrinking as he glanced down into the depths of the cañon a chilly mist streamed up out of it and the great rift looked black and grim and forbidding  wheeler noticed a dusky figure beneath the firs and moving towards it came upon a man with a pipe in his hand sitting upon a fallen tree in view of the strenuous activity that was the rule in the cañon such leisure was unusual  well he remarked you dont seem busy any way  the man grinned im looking out he replied guess ive had my eye on you for the last few minutes and a stranger wouldnt have got quite so far you havent got any papers from the courts on you  no said wheeler who noticed that there was a rifle lying near the man i havent still if id looked like a lawyer or a court officer  then asserted the man its a sure thing you wouldnt have got in the boys have enough giantpowder rammed into the heading to lift the bottom right out of the cañon two minutes after any suspicious stranger comes along  wheeler laughed for it was evident to him that nasmyth had been taking precautions and turning away he led his horse down the gully it grew colder as he proceeded and a chilly breeze swept the white mist about him the trees that shook big drops of moisture down on him were wailing but he could hear them only faintly through the clamour of the fall he left the horse with a man he came upon lower down and reaching the shingle at the waters edge saw the great derrick swing black athwart the glare of a big fire the smoke whirled about the dark rock wall and here and there dusky figures were toiling kneedeep amid the white froth of the rapid the figures emerged from the blackness and vanished into it again as the flickering radiance rose and fell scrambling to the ledge above the fall wheeler found two men standing near the mouth of the heading which was just level with the pool  wheres nasmyth boys he inquired  inside answered one of the men guess hes wedging up the heading if you want him youd better crawl right in  wheeler glanced down at the black mouth of the tunnel on which the streaming radiance fell he fancied that the river flowed into it and the mans suggestion did not appeal to him  wont you tell him that id like a talk with him he asked  the man laughed guess thats not going to bring him it will be daylight any way before he lets up youll have to go right in  wheeler dropped cautiously upon a slippery staging across which the water flowed and crawling into the heading with a blinking light in his eyes fell into a sled that was loaded with broken rock he crept round the obstruction and a few moments later found himself kneedeep in water before a little dam that had been thrown across the heading the heading dipped sharply beyond it which somewhat astonished him and when he had climbed over the barricade he descended cautiously groping towards another light big drops of water fell upon him and here and there a jet of it spurted out at last he stopped and saw nasmyth lying partly raised on one elbow in an inch or two of water while he painfully swung a heavy hammer the heading was lined with stout pillars made of sawnup firs and nasmyth appeared to be driving a wedge under one of them two or three other men were putting heavy masses of timber into place  the smoky flame of a little lamp flared upon the rock above which trickled with moisture and the light fell upon nasmyths wet face which was deeply flushed nasmyth gasped heavily and great splashes of sand and mire lay thick upon his torn drenched shirt he appeared to see wheeler for he looked up but he did not stop until he had driven the wedge in then he rose to his knees and stretched himself wearily  the rocks badly fissured weve got to get double timbers in as soon as we can he explained im going to do some boring well go along  wheeler crept after him down the inclined heading until they reached the spot where gordon sat crouched over a machine gordon did not move until nasmyth seized his shoulders  you can get back to the wedging and send two or three boys along to heave the water out ill keep this thing going he said  gordon who greeted wheeler floundered away and wheeler sat down in the dryest spot he could find while nasmyth grasped the handle of the machine  theres no reason why you shouldnt smoke he said  that replied wheeler is a point im not quite sure about how many sticks of giantpowder have you rammed into this heading as you know its apt to be a little uncertain  nasmyth laughed as he glanced at the flaring lamp above his head theres a hole with a stick in it just at your elbow ive been filling the holes as we made them in view of what i expect those folks in the city are arranging it seemed advisable  wheeler was sensible of a certain uneasiness as he listened to the crunch of the boring tool and the jarring thud of the hammers  what are you going so far down for he asked  to get into sounder rock its costing us considerable time that we can badly spare but once or twice i fancied the whole river was coming in on us now were getting almost through i want to make quite sure  wheeler nodded i guess thats wise so far we have come out ahead of hutton and the rest of them he asserted our people hold the timber rights and we have got the shinglesplitting plant in you headed him off in waynefleets case and there only remains the man with the old bush claim theres unfortunately no doubt about his title to the ranch and its a sure thing the folks in the city will put him up again have you heard from him lately  i have answered nasmyth with a smile as you know i made him half a dozen different offers to buy him out he naturally didnt close with them but he wrote trying to raise me and kept the thing up rather well of course it was evident that his friends were quite willing to let me get most of the work done before they showed their hand too visibly i scarcely fancy they know how near we are to getting through though that rancher mans lawyer said something about taking proceedings a little while ago  suppose they went to court and served you with a notice to quit what youre doing  nasmyth turning pointed with a wet scarred hand to several holes in the side of the heading from which a wire projected  well he said theyd have to serve it and while their man was trying to get down the gully id rip most of the bottom out of this strip of cañon im not sure we havent gone far enough already to split up the whole ridge thats holding back the river still im going on a little i mean to make sure he bent over the machine you have brought up some letters the man has perhaps been trying to worry me again  two or three replied wheeler i called at the settlement for them one is evidently from a lady  nasmyth swung round again and took the little dainty envelope from him he smeared it with his wet hands as he opened it and then his voice broke sharply through the thud of the hammers  cant you move im too far from that lamp he said  he scrambled by wheeler and crouched close beneath the smoky flickering flame dripping spattered with mire and very grim in face the note was from violet hamilton and it was brief  i should like to see you as soon as you can get away it read there is something i must say and since it might spare both of us pain i feel almost tempted to try to explain it now that however would perhaps be weak of me and i think you will after all not blame me very greatly  he flung the note down in the water and straightened himself wearily  i am invited to go down to bonavista and its tolerably clear that i have another trouble to face he announced in a dull tone in the meanwhile theres this heading to be pushed on and it seems to me that the thing that counts most is what i owe the boys  wheeler who had heard something from gordon looked at him with grave sympathy but nasmyth made an expressive gesture as he glanced down at his attire  well he remarked i probably look very much what i ama playedout borer of headings and builder of dams who has just now everything against him still i was fool enough to indulge in some very alluring fancies a little while ago he turned to wheeler with a sudden flash in his eyes you can take those letters to gordon and tell him to open them ive a little trouble to grapple with and i dont feel inclined for conversation  wheeler could take a hint and he crawled away along the heading while nasmyth toiled for the next halfhour strenuously at the machine the perspiration dripped from him he gasped as he ripped the handle around then he let it go suddenly and his face became softer as he picked up the letter again  well he told himself i dont think i can blame her after all and with what she has to say it would hurt if i kept her waiting  he sat down again at the machine and the boring tool crunched on steadily into the rock until after some time a man took his place and crouching in the narrow heading swung the heavy hammer as they wedged the extra timbers fast a faint grey light was creeping into the eastern sky when nasmyth crawled out of the heading and scrambled back to the shanty gordon who was getting up when he entered looked at him curiously  im going into bonavista after breakfast nasmyth said i dont want to leave the boys now but i cant help it  gordon asked no injudicious questions for wheeler had mentioned the letter and his comrades voice had its significance for him  then he said ill tell mattawa to have the horse ready  nasmyth slept soundly until the meal was laid out he rode into the settlement a little before dark that night it was the next afternoon when he reached bonavista and he found violet hamilton sitting upon the veranda alone she appeared embarrassed when she saw him and he leaned against one of the pillars quietly looking down on her for a moment or two neither of them said anything and it was nasmyth who broke the awkward silence  i felt very bitter when i got that note he said when i grappled with the thing however i commenced to realize that you might be right of course i quite realized all you wished to imply  ah answered the girl softly then you are not very angry with me she leaned forward and met his gaze i think we were both very nearly making a terrible mistake  i scarcely think that is a thing you could expect me to admitthat is at least as far as my part in it goes said nasmyth  still replied violet you admitted that you felt i might be right  she looked anxious and nasmyth realized that since she might have written what she had to say it must have cost her a good deal to break with him personally the courage which had prompted her to summon him appealed to him and in place of anger he was conscious of a certain sympathy for her  in one sense you were certainly right he said we belong to different worlds and i should never have spoken to you as i did that is a thing you must try to forgive me and you have no reason to blame yourself as i told you at the time you were free  ah cried violet you are very generous after all i expected that from you and i think it will not hurt you very much to give me up  i wonder why asked nasmyth gravely  violet sat silent a moment or two and then looked up at him quietly  oh she said you owe so much to that girl in the bush she would always have come between us i think you made me recognize it when you told me about her though it was only by degrees i came to understand it clearly  nasmyths face flushed that he queried is your reason for wishing to get rid of me  violet looked away from him and there was a telltale self consciousness in her manner when she turned to him again nasmyth who noticed it winced  well he hazarded it was perhaps not the only one  no confessed violet very softly there was another thing which influenced me rather more  nasmyth who understood her stood silent a moment or two with one hand tightly closed in that case there is nothing to be said and i must try to face it gracefully he told her reproaches are not exactly becoming in the case of a discarded man he took off his wide hat as he held out his hand miss hamilton the thing naturally hurts me but perhaps i cannot reasonably blame you im not sure you could expect me to go any further now  ah exclaimed violet you have made it easy i would like to assure you of my goodwill  he held her hand a moment and swung abruptly away he met mrs acton as he went down a corridor he stopped in front of her and she looked at him questioningly when she saw his face  i have not come up to expectations it is perhaps fortunate miss hamilton found it out when she did he said  oh mrs acton replied i told you it would not be well to stay away very long  i scarcely think the result would have been different in any case nasmyth declared  mrs acton was silent for a moment then she looked at him sharply  where are you going now she asked  back to the world i belong to answered nasmythto the railroad in the first case im not sure that miss hamilton would like to feel that i was in the house  mrs acton made no protest and ten minutes later he had crossed the clearing and plunged into the bush  mrs acton crossing the veranda laid her hand on the girls shoulder  i naturally dont know what he said to you but i cant help believing that he acquitted himself rather well she observed after all it must have been a little painful to him  perhaps it was replied violet still i dont think it hurt him dreadfully  she was more or less correct in this surmise for as nasmyth walked on through the bush he became conscious of a faint relief     chapter xxxi  the last shot   laura waynefleet was preparing breakfast and the door of the ranch stood open when she heard the sharp clatter of the flungdown sliprails in the fence across the clearing jar upon the stillness of the surrounding woods it was early in the morning and since it was evident that if the strangers who were approaching came from the settlement they must have set out as soon as it was light she decided that their business was probably urgent laying down the fryingpan in which she was making flapjacks she moved toward the door and stood watching two men ride across the clearing in the direction of the house they did not belong to the settlement for she had never seen either of them before a fact which made it clear that they had not ridden in from the cañon she had quick eyes and she noticed that although they could not have ridden very far that morning their horses appeared jaded which suggested that they had made a long journey the previous day the men appeared weary too and she imagined that they were not accustomed to the bush  as she watched them she wondered with a trace of uneasiness what their business could be and decided that it was perhaps as well that her father was busy in the stable where he could not hear them arrive since gordon usually called at the ranch when he went down to the settlement she was more or less acquainted with what was being done at the cañon and with nasmyths affairs and she was on her guard when one of the strangers pulled his horse up close in front of her  can we hire a couple of horses here he asked ours are played out  there was then a cayuse pony in waynefleets stable but it belonged to a neighbouring rancher and laura had no intention of handing it over to the strangers  im afraid not she answered the only horse on the ranch does not belong to us and i wouldnt care to hire it out unless i had permission besides i may want it myself you could have obtained horses at the settlement hotel  we didnt put up there  but you must have come through the settlement you have evidently ridden in from the railroad  the man laughed well he admitted we certainly did but we got off the trail last night and they took us in at bullens ranch soon after we started out a chopper told us we could save a league by riding up the valley instead of by the settlement does the man you said the horse belonged to live in the neighbourhood  laura did not answer immediately she was quickwitted and she recognized that while the mans explanation was plausible there were weak points in it for one thing the previous night had not been dark and it was difficult to understand how anyone could have wandered off the wide trail to the settlement into the one which led through thick undergrowth to bullens ranch she guessed that the strangers must have had an object in not visiting the settlement then there was it seemed to her something suggestive in the fact that bullen who had a share in nasmyths project and owned several horses had not seized upon the opportunity to aid the travellers for if he had not been willing to lend his horses it could only have been because he was a little dubious about the strangers  the man who owns the horse lives at least an hours ride away she informed the stranger you are going on into the bush  yes answered the man can you tell us the easiest way to reach the cañon  laura was glad that he had asked for the easiest route for soon after the snow had gone nasmyth had broken out a shorter and somewhat perilous trail over the steepest part of the divide only the packhorses now went round by the longer way she thought hard for a moment or two and then told the man how to find the old trail  he rode away with his companion and lauras face was thoughtful when she sat down again she made a hasty breakfast and went out to the stable waynefleet was still busy when she reached it and she took down the sidesaddle before she turned to him  i have left your breakfast ready but you must excuse me she announced i am going to the cañon  waynefleet raised his brows and looked at her with his most precise air but seeing that had no effect he made a gesture of resignation  very well he said i presume you do not as usual think it worth while to acquaint me with your object  laura laughed im not exactly sure of it myself i may tell you a little more when i come back  she led the horse out and crossing the clearing rode hard for a league or so and then made sure by the prints of their horses feet that the strangers had followed her instructions before she struck into the shorter trail it was scarcely wide enough to ride along and for a while dense thickets of fern and undergrowth closed in on it further on it skirted a quaggy swamp and led through several rapid creeks while here and there great fallen trees compelled her to turn aside and there were groves of willows to be painfully struggled through the cayuse she rode was however more or less accustomed to that kind of work and she made tolerable progress until she reached the foot of the big divide there she dismounted and led the cayuse up a steep gully through which a torrent poured they stumbled amidst big boulders and over slippery shingle until they reached the head of the gully and then there were almost precipitous slopes of rock to be faced they climbed for a couple of hours and laura gasped with relief when at last she stood upon the crest of the divide  the descent was perilous but already the sun hung low above the western hills and she went down in the saddle with the cayuse slipping and stumbling horribly until the roar of the river came faintly up to her then she drew bridle and glanced ruefully at her attire her skirt was rent in places and one little shoe had burst a branch that had torn her hat off had loosened a coil of gleaming hair and anxious as she was she stopped for several minutes to set these matters straight as far as it was possible there was she felt after all no reason why nasmyth should see her in that state then she rode on and a little later a man appeared among the pines at the head of the gully she was very weary when she got down beside him  have two strangers arrived here yet she asked  they havent answered the man  laura was glad she had undertaken the journey when she saw the sudden intentness of his face  two of them are on the trail he inquired sharply  yes said laura they have gone round by the packhorse trail i rode in by the new one  the man was astonished that she had accomplished the trip and she saw that he was troubled  well he advised you had better go right on and tell nasmyth as quick as you can its my business to see no strangers get in or id go with you  laura left the horse with him and descending the gully found an unusual number of men busy beside the river in fact she believed that all those who had been at work in the valley must have crossed the range to the cañon it was also evident from their faces that most of them were in a state of eager expectation something out of the usual course was clearly going on she asked for nasmyth and a few moments later he came scrambling towards her along the log staging there was she was quick to notice a strained look in his eyes but he shook hands with her and then remembering the state of her attire she coloured a little  do you expect two men from the city tonight she asked  nasmyth started i have at least been wondering when they would turn up he answered there are two men of that kind on the trail  his voice was sharp and insistent and laura told him hastily about the men who had called at the ranch  from what you say they cant well be here for another hour or two he said and there was a determined glint in his eyes i fancy well be through by then  he swung around and raised a hand to the men boys youll get the last holes filled with giantpowder as quick as you can and couple up the firing battery well lift that rock right out when youre ready  he turned again to laura im not sure you understand all that you have done he said for one thing i think you have saved us from being beaten when what we have fought for was almost in our hand  he paused for a moment and then his voice became hoarse as he indicated the clustering men with a little forceful gesture  they have come in to see the last shot fired we had arranged to put in a few more sticks of powder and then lower the river once for all in another hour or two some of the boys are now getting a big supper ready to celebrate the occasion but if you hadnt brought us the warning its scarcely likely that any of us would have felt much inclined for festivity in all probability those strangers are bringing an order to restrain me from going any further once it was in my hands i could not have fired the shot all we have done would have been thrown away  ah cried laura that would be intolerable  nasmyth laughed significantly  any way he declared until the papers are served on me my charter stands well have scattered the last strip of rock when those men ride in  he made her a grave little bow you set us to work he said it is only fitting that you should once more hold the firing battery  he moved away abruptly from her and crawled into the heading it was half an hour later when he came back and almost every man who had a share in the undertaking gathered upon the strip of shingle nobody spoke however and there was tense expectancy in the bronzed faces nasmyth beckoned to laura and moved forward with gordon and wheeler who carried the battery nasmyth swung his battered hat off as he held out his hand and laura clinging to him climbed to a shelf of rock where she stood still a moment or two looking about her  in front the white spray of the fall whirled beneath the tremendous wall of rock and about her stood groups of hardhanded men who had driven the heading with strenuous insistent toil she knew what the work had cost them and could understand the look in their steady eyes they had faced the river in the depths of the tremendous rift borne with the icy winter and patiently grappled with obstacle after obstacle their money had not sufficed to purchase them costly machines they had pitted steadfast courage and hardened muscle against the vast primeval forces of untrammelled nature laura felt deeply stirred as she glanced at them they were simple men but they had faced and beaten roaring flood and stinging frost caring little for the hazard to life or limb as they played their part in that tremendous struggle with axe and drill  suddenly laura became conscious that nasmyth who held up a little box from which trailed a couple of wires was speaking  our last dollars bought that powder wish us good luck he said  laura stretched out her hands for the box and standing upon the rock shelf with one shoe burst and her skirt badly rent raised her voice as she had done in that spot once before  boys she said you have stood fast against very heavy odds may all that you can wish fororchards oatfields wheat and cattlebe yours the prosperity of this country is founded on such efforts as you have made  with a little smile in her eyes she fitted in the firingplug and in another moment a streak of flame that seemed to expand into a bewildering brilliancy flashed through the spray of the fall the flash of light was lost in rolling smoke and a tremendous eruption of flying rock that rang with deafening detonations against the side of the cañon the smoke rolled higher and still great shattered fragments came whirling out of it striking boulder and shingle with a heavy crash until the roar of the liberated river rose in tumultuous clamour and drowned all other sound  a great foaming wave swept forward washing high along the bank and poured seething down the rapid shingle and boulder were lost in it it drove on tumultuously and a mad turgid flood came on behind then it slowly fell away again and a man clambering out in peril of being swept away beneath the dripping rock flung up a hand his voice rang harsh and exultant through the sinking roar of the beaten river  weve cut the last ledge clean away he said  a great shout went up and nasmyth held out his hand to laura  i owe it all to you he said with a curious gleam in his eyes  the men trooped about them both and though they were not as a rule effusive some of them thumped nasmyths shoulder and some wrung his hand half an hour had slipped by before he was free of them  he and laura went slowly back up the climbing gully it was growing dark but a light still streamed down between the pines and nasmyth who pointed to a tree that had fallen stood close by looking down upon the girl  i will ride back with you presently but you must rest first and i have something to say though if we had not beaten the river i think i should never have had courage enough he said when you found me lying in the snow you took me in you nursed me back to life gave me a purpose and set me on my feet again  he paused for a moment a flush dyed his worn face and his voice was strained when he went on again  one result was that i went back to the world i once belonged toit was really you who sent meand you know what befell me there he said i dont think i quite forgot what i owed to you but i was carried away still she recognized her folly and discarded me  he stopped again and laura looked at him steadily with a tinge of colour in her face  well he continued that was when i commenced to understand exactly what you had been all along to me i dont know what came upon me at bonavista but though the thing must seem preposterous i believe i was in love with you then now i have nothing to bring you you know all my weak points and i could not complain if you would not listen to me but i have come back to you again  ah answered laura very softly after all it was fortunate that you went away i think it was a relief to me when wisbech took you to the city  nasmyth looked at her in surprise and she smiled at him derrick she said once or twice when you were building the dam you fancied that you loved me i however didnt want you to fancy that was only going far enough to hurt me  nasmyth stooped toward her in the height of my folly i had an uneasy consciousness that i belonged to you afterwards i was sure it was a very real thing but i naturally shrank from coming to you i dont quite know how i have gathered the courage now  laura sat still and he laid a hand on her shoulder then she turned and looked up at him  well she confessed very simply i think i loved you in the days when you were building the dam  he bent down and kissed her and neither of them ever remembered exactly what they said  a few minutes later there was a clatter in the shadow above them and two men came scrambling down each leading a jaded horse nasmyth rose and turned toward them when they stopped close in front of him  you have some business with me he inquired  one of them handed him a sealed paper and he opened it with deliberation  i may as well tell you that i expected this he said he glanced at laura i am summoned to attend in victoria and show cause why i should not be restrained from injuring the holding of a rancher at the head of the valley in the meantime i am instructed to carry on the operations in the cañon no further  he turned to the men you should have come along an hour or two ago i dont propose to do anything further in the cañon in fact i have accomplished the purpose i had in hand  as his meaning dawned on them the men gazed at each other in evident consternation until one of them turned to laura  well he commented in that case i guess its quite a pity we didnt but i begin to understand the thing this is the young lady who told us the trail she must have taken a shorter way  laura smiled at him you she reminded him seemed anxious to go by the easiest one  the other man looked at nasmyth im acting for hutton and it seems you have got ahead of him he observed still were both out on business and i dont bear you any illwill in fact if youre open to make any arrangement i should be glad to talk to you  nasmyth smiled as he answered you can at least come and get some supper i expect the boys will fix you and your horses for the night  they went down the gully together and a few minutes later walked into the flickering light of a great fire near which a rudely bountiful supper had been laid out nasmyth pointed to the strangers  boys he said these are the men we expected but i dont think they mean to worry us now and theyve had a long ride he turned to the strangers wont you sit down  there was a great burst of laughter and one of the strangers smiled  were in your hands but i dont know any reason why you shouldnt be generous boys he said  he sat down but for a moment or two nasmyth and laura stood still in the glare of the fire and the eyes of everyone were fixed upon them lauras face was flushed but nasmyth was calm with a new dignity  we have a little more to do boys but we have left the toughest of our troubles behind nasmyth spoke in confident tones well have another supper when were through with it and ill expect every one of you at the biggest event in my life  there was a great shout that rang through the roar of the rapid and far across the climbing pines then the men sat down and it was a little while later when their leader and the girl quietly slipped away from them those who noticed this said nothing and the men still sat round the snapping fire when nasmyth and laura crossed the ridge of the divide  there was a moon above them and the night was soft and clear while the bush rolled away beneath shadowy and still only the turmoil of the river came faintly up to them the muffled sound sent a curious thrill through both of them but they were silent as they went down the long slope among the climbing pines laura sat in the saddle looking out on the silent forest with eyes that shone softly in the moonlight and nasmyth walked beside her with his hand on the packhorses bridle they had both borne the stress and strain but now as the packhorse plodded on they were conscious only of a deep contentment  the end
