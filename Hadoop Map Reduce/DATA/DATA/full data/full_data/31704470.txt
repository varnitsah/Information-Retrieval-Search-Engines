tree       and stood awhile in thought      and as in uffish thought he stood       the jabberwock with eyes of flame     came whiffling through the tulgey wood       and burbled as it came      one two one two and through and through       the vorpal blade went snickersnack     he left it dead and with its head       he went galumphing back      and hast thou slain the jabberwock       come to

spoiled his nice new rattle      just then flew down a monstrous crow     as black as a tar barrel     which frightened both the heroes so     they quite forgot their quarrel  illustration  illustration     illustration the walrus and the carpenter   music      the sun was shining on the sea       shining with all his might     he did his very best to make       the billows smooth and bright     and this was odd because it was       the middle of the night      the moon was shining sulkily       because she thought the sun     had got no busness to be there       after the day was done     its very rude of him she said       to come and spoil the fun      the sea was wet as wet could be       the sands were dry as dry     you could not see a cloud because       no cloud was in the sky     no birds were flying overhead       there were no birds to fly      the walrus and the carpenter       were walking close at hand     they wept like anything to see       such quantities of sand     if this were only cleared away       they said it would be grand      if seven maids with seven mops       swept it for half a year     do you suppose the walrus said       that they could get it clear     i doubt it said the carpenter       and shed a bitter tear      o oysters come and walk with us       the walrus did beseech     a pleasant walk a pleasant talk       along the briny beach     we cannot do with more than four       to give a hand to each      the eldest oyster looked at him       but never a word he said     the eldest oyster winked his eye       and shook his heavy head     meaning to say he did not choose       to leave the oysterbed      but four young oysters hurried up       all eager for the treat     their coats were brushed their faces washed       their shoes were clean and neat     and this was odd because you know       they hadnt any feet      four other oysters followed them       and yet another four     and thick and fast they came at last       and more and more and more     all hopping through the frothy waves      and scrambling to the shore  illustration      the walrus and the carpenter       walked on a mile or so     and then they rested on a rock       conveniently low     and all the little oysters stood       and waited in a row      the time has come the walrus said       to talk of many things     of shoesand shipsand sealingwax       of cabbagesand kings     and why the sea is boiling hot       and whether pigs have wings      but wait a bit the oysters cried       before we have our chat     for some of us are out of breath       and all of us are fat     no hurry said the carpenter       they thanked him much for that      a loaf of bread the walrus said       is chiefly what we need     pepper and vinegar besides       are very good indeed     now if youre ready oysters dear       we can begin to feed      but not on us the oysters cried       turning a little blue     after such kindness that would be       a dismal thing to do     the night is fine the walrus said       do you admire the view      it was so kind of you to come       and you are very nice     the carpenter said nothing but       cut us another slice     i wish you were not quite so deaf       ive had to ask you twice      it seems a shame the walrus said       to play them such a trick     after weve brought them out so far       and made them trot so quick     the carpenter said nothing but       the butters spread too thick      i weep for you the walrus said       i deeply sympathize     with sobs and tears he sorted out       those of the largest size     holding his pockethandkerchief       before his streaming eyes      oh oysters said the carpenter       youve had a pleasant run     shall we be trotting home again       but answer came there none     and this was scarcely odd because       theyd eaten every one  illustration     illustration humpty dumpty   music      humpty dumpty sat on a wall     humpty dumpty had a great fall     all the kings horses and all the kings men     couldnt put humpty dumpty in his place again  illustration  illustration     illustration the message to the fish   music      in winter when the fields are white     i sing this song for your delight      in spring when woods are getting green     ill try and tell you what i mean      in summer when the days are long     perhaps youll understand the song      in autumn when the leaves are brown     take pen and ink and write it down  illustration      i sent a message to the fish     i told them this is what i wish      the little fishes of the sea     they sent an answer back to me      the little fishes answer was     we cannot do it sir because      i sent to them again to say     it will be better to obey      the fishes answered with a grin     why what a temper you are in      i told them once i told them twice     they would not listen to advice      i took a kettle large and new     fit for the deed i had to do      my heart went hop my heart went thump     i filled the kettle at the pump      then some one came to me and said     the little fishes are in bed      i said to him i said it plain     then you must wake them up again      i said it very loud and clear     i went and shouted in his ear      but he was very stiff and proud     he said you neednt shout so loud      and he was very proud and stiff     he said id go and wake them if      i took a corkscrew from the shelf     i went to wake them up myself      and when i found the door was locked     i pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked      and when i found the door was shut     i tried to turn the handle but  illustration     illustration the lion and the unicorn   music      the lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown     the lion beat the unicorn all round the town     some gave them white bread some gave them brown     some gave them plum cake and drummed them out of town  illustration

theres little to relate     i saw an aged aged man       asitting on a gate     who are you aged man i said       and how is it you live     and his answer trickled through my head       like water through a sieve      he said i look for butterflies       that sleep among the wheat     i make them into mutton pies       and sell them in the street     i sell them unto men he said       who sail on stormy seas     and thats the way i get my bread       a trifle if you please      but i was thinking of a plan       to dye ones whiskers green     and always use so large a fan       that they should not be seen     so having no reply to give       to what the old man said     i cried come tell me how you live       and thumped him on the head      his accents mild took up the tale       he said i go my ways     and when i find a mountain rill       i set it in a blaze     and thence they make a stuff they call       rowlands macassar oil     yet twopencehalfpenny is all       they give me for my toil      but i was thinking of a way       to feed oneself on batter     and so go on from day to day       getting a little fatter     i shook him well from side to side       until his face was blue     come tell me how you live i cried       and what it is you do  illustration      he said i hunt for haddocks eyes       among the heather bright     and work them into waistcoatbuttons       in the silent night     and these i do not sell for gold       or coin of silvry shine     but for a copper halfpenny       and that will purchase nine      i sometimes dig for buttered rolls       or set limed twigs for crabs     i sometimes search the grassy knolls       for wheels of hansomcabs     and thats the way he gave a wink       by which i get my wealth     and very gladly will i drink       your honours noble health      i heard him then for i had just       completed my design     to keep the menai bridge from rust       by boiling it in wine     i thanked him much for telling me       the way he got his wealth     but chiefly for his wish that he       might drink my noble health  illustration  music      and now if eer by chance i put       my fingers into glue     or madly squeeze a righthand foot       into a lefthand shoe     or if i drop upon my toe       a very heavy weight     i weep for it reminds me so       of that old man i used to know     whose look was mild whose speech was slow     whose hair was whiter than the snow     whose face was very like a crow     with eyes like cinders all aglow     who seemd distracted with his woe     who rocked his body to and fro     and muttered mumblingly and low     as if his mouth were full of dough     who snorted like a buffalo     that summer evning long ago       asitting on a gate
