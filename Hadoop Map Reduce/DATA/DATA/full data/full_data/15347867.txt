15347867	the perils of certain english prisoners   chapter ithe island of silverstore   it was in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and fortyfour that i gill davis to command his mark having then the honour to be a private in the royal marines stood aleaning over the bulwarks of the armed sloop christopher columbus in the south american waters off the mosquito shore  my lady remarks to me before i go any further that there is no such christianname as gill and that her confident opinion is that the name given to me in the baptism wherein i was made c was gilbert  she is certain to be right but i never heard of it  i was a foundling child picked up somewhere or another and i always understood my christianname to be gill  it is true that i was called gills when employed at snorridge bottom betwixt chatham and maidstone to frighten birds but that had nothing to do with the baptism wherein i was made c and wherein a number of things were promised for me by somebody who let me alone ever afterwards as to performing any of them and who i consider must have been the beadle  such name of gills was entirely owing to my cheeks or gills which at that time of my life were of a raspy description  my lady stops me again before i go any further by laughing exactly in her old way and waving the feather of her pen at me  that action on her part calls to my mind as i look at her hand with the rings on itwell i wont  to be sure it will come in in its own place  but its always strange to me noticing the quiet hand and noticing it as i have done you know so many times afondling children and grandchildren asleep to think that when blood and honour were upthere  i wont not at presentscratch it out  she wont scratch it out and quite honourable because we have made an understanding that everything is to be taken down and that nothing that is once taken down shall be scratched out  i have the great misfortune not to be able to read and write and i am speaking my true and faithful account of those adventures and my lady is writing it word for word  i say there i was aleaning over the bulwarks of the sloop christopher columbus in the south american waters off the mosquito shore a subject of his gracious majesty king george of england and a private in the royal marines  in those climates you dont want to do much  i was doing nothing  i was thinking of the shepherd my father i wonder on the hillsides by snorridge bottom with a long staff and with a rough white coat in all weathers all the year round who used to let me lie in a corner of his hut by night and who used to let me go about with him and his sheep by day when i could get nothing else to do and who used to give me so little of his victuals and so much of his staff that i ran away from himwhich was what he wanted all along i expectto be knocked about the world in preference to snorridge bottom  i had been knocked about the world for nineandtwenty years in all when i stood looking along those bright blue south american waters  looking after the shepherd i may say  watching him in a halfwaking dream with my eyes halfshut as he and his flock of sheep and his two dogs seemed to move away from the ships side far away over the blue water and go right down into the sky  its rising out of the water steady a voice said close to me  i had been thinking on so that it like woke me with a start though it was no stranger voice than the voice of harry charker my own comrade  whats rising out of the water steady i asked my comrade  what says he  the island  o  the island says i turning my eyes towards it  true  i forgot the island  forgot the port youre going to  thats odd aint it  it is odd says i  and odd he said slowly considering with himself aint even  is it gill  he had always a remark just like that to make and seldom another  as soon as he had brought a thing round to what it was not he was satisfied  he was one of the best of men and in a certain sort of a way one with the least to say for himself  i qualify it because besides being able to read and write like a quartermaster he had always one most excellent idea in his mind  that was duty  upon my soul i dont believe though i admire learning beyond everything that he could have got a better idea out of all the books in the world if he had learnt them every word and been the cleverest of scholars  my comrade and i had been quartered in jamaica and from there we had been drafted off to the british settlement of belize lying away west and north of the mosquito coast  at belize there had been great alarm of one cruel gang of pirates there were always more pirates than enough in those caribbean seas and as they got the better of our english cruisers by running into outoftheway creeks and shallows and taking the land when they were hotly pressed the governor of belize had received orders from home to keep a sharp lookout for them along shore  now there was an armed sloop came once ayear from port royal jamaica to the island laden with all manner of necessaries to eat and to drink and to wear and to use in various ways and it was aboard of that sloop which had touched at belize that i was astanding leaning over the bulwarks  the island was occupied by a very small english colony  it had been given the name of silverstore  the reason of its being so called was that the english colony owned and worked a silvermine over on the mainland in honduras and used this island as a safe and convenient place to store their silver in until it was annually fetched away by the sloop  it was brought down from the mine to the coast on the backs of mules attended by friendly indians and guarded by white men from thence it was conveyed over to silverstore when the weather was fair in the canoes of that country from silverstore it was carried to jamaica by the armed sloop once ayear as i have already mentioned from jamaica it went of course all over the world  how i came to be aboard the armed sloop is easily told  fourandtwenty marines under command of a lieutenantthat officers name was linderwoodhad been told off at belize to proceed to silverstore in aid of boats and seamen stationed there for the chase of the pirates  the island was considered a good post of observation against the pirates both by land and sea neither the pirate ship nor yet her boats had been seen by any of us but they had been so much heard of that the reinforcement was sent  of that party i was one  it included a corporal and a sergeant  charker was corporal and the sergeants name was drooce  he was the most tyrannical noncommissioned officer in his majestys service  the night came on soon after i had had the foregoing words with charker all the wonderful bright colours went out of the sea and sky in a few minutes and all the stars in the heavens seemed to shine out together and to look down at themselves in the sea over one anothers shoulders millions deep  next morning we cast anchor off the island  there was a snug harbour within a little reef there was a sandy beach there were cocoanut trees with high straight stems quite bare and foliage at the top like plumes of magnificent green feathers there were all the objects that are usually seen in those parts and i am not going to describe them having something else to tell about  great rejoicings to be sure were made on our arrival  all the flags in the place were hoisted all the guns in the place were fired and all the people in the place came down to look at us  one of those sambo fellowsthey call those natives sambos when they are halfnegro and halfindianhad come off outside the reef to pilot us in and remained on board after we had let go our anchor  he was called christian george king and was fonder of all hands than anybody else was  now i confess for myself that on that first day if i had been captain of the christopher columbus instead of private in the royal marines i should have kicked christian george kingwho was no more a christian than he was a king or a georgeover the side without exactly knowing why except that it was the right thing to do  but i must likewise confess that i was not in a particularly pleasant humour when i stood under arms that morning aboard the christopher columbus in the harbour of the island of silverstore  i had had a hard life and the life of the english on the island seemed too easy and too gay to please me  here you are i thought to myself good scholars and good livers able to read what you like able to write what you like able to eat and drink what you like and spend what you like and do what you like and much you care for a poor ignorant private in the royal marines  yet its hard too i think that you should have all the half pence and i all the kicks you all the smooth and i all the rough you all the oil and i all the vinegar  it was as envious a thing to think as might be let alone its being nonsensical but i thought it  i took it so much amiss that when a very beautiful young english lady came aboard i grunted to myself ah you have got a lover ill be bound as if there was any new offence to me in that if she had  she was sister to the captain of our sloop who had been in a poor way for some time and who was so ill then that he was obliged to be carried ashore  she was the child of a military officer and had come out there with her sister who was married to one of the owners of the silvermine and who had three children with her  it was easy to see that she was the light and spirit of the island  after i had got a good look at her i grunted to myself again in an even worse state of mind than before ill be damned if i dont hate him whoever he is  my officer lieutenant linderwood was as ill as the captain of the sloop and was carried ashore too  they were both young men of about my age who had been delicate in the west india climate  i even took that in bad part  i thought i was much fitter for the work than they were and that if all of us had our deserts i should be both of them rolled into one  it may be imagined what sort of an officer of marines i should have made without the power of reading a written order  and as to any knowledge how to command the slooplord  i should have sunk her in a quarter of an hour  however such were my reflections and when we men were ashore and dismissed i strolled about the place along with charker making my observations in a similar spirit  it was a pretty place in all its arrangements partly south american and partly english and very agreeable to look at on that account being like a bit of home that had got chipped off and had floated away to that spot accommodating itself to circumstances as it drifted along  the huts of the sambos to the number of fiveandtwenty perhaps were down by the beach to the left of the anchorage  on the right was a sort of barrack with a south american flag and the union jack flying from the same staff where the little english colony could all come together if they saw occasion  it was a walled square of building with a sort of pleasureground inside and inside that again a sunken block like a powder magazine with a little square trench round it and steps down to the door  charker and i were looking in at the gate which was not guarded and i had said to charker in reference to the bit like a powder magazine thats where they keep the silver you see and charker had said to me after thinking it over and silver aint gold  is it gill when the beautiful young english lady i had been so bilious about looked out of a door or a windowat all events looked out from under a bright awning  she no sooner saw us two in uniform than she came out so quickly that she was still putting on her broad mexican hat of plaited straw when we saluted  would you like to come in she said and see the place  it is rather a curious place  we thanked the young lady and said we didnt wish to be troublesome but she said it could be no trouble to an english soldiers daughter to show english soldiers how their countrymen and countrywomen fared so far away from england and consequently we saluted again and went in then as we stood in the shade she showed us being as affable as beautiful how the different families lived in their separate houses and how there was a general house for stores and a general readingroom and a general room for music and dancing and a room for church and how there were other houses on the rising ground called the signal hill where they lived in the hotter weather  your officer has been carried up there she said and my brother too for the better air  at present our few residents are dispersed over both spots deducting that is to say such of our number as are always going to or coming from or staying at the mine  he is among one of those parties i thought and i wish somebody would knock his head off  some of our married ladies live here she said during at least half the year as lonely as widows with their children  many children here maam  seventeen  there are thirteen married ladies and there are eight like me  there were not eight like herthere was not one like herin the world she meant single  which with about thirty englishmen of various degrees said the young lady form the little colony now on the island  i dont count the sailors for they dont belong to us  nor the soldiers she gave us a gracious smile when she spoke of the soldiers for the same reason  nor the sambos maam said i  no  under your favour and with your leave maam said i are they trustworthy  perfectly  we are all very kind to them and they are very grateful to us  indeed maam  nowchristian george king  very much attached to us all  would die for us  she was as in my uneducated way i have observed very beautiful women almost always to be so composed that her composure gave great weight to what she said and i believed it  then she pointed out to us the building like a powder magazine and explained to us in what manner the silver was brought from the mine and was brought over from the mainland and was stored here  the christopher columbus would have a rich lading she said for there had been a great yield that year a much richer yield than usual and there was a chest of jewels besides the silver  when we had looked about us and were getting sheepish through fearing we were troublesome she turned us over to a young woman english born but west india bred who served her as her maid  this young woman was the widow of a noncommissioned officer in a regiment of the line  she had got married and widowed at st vincent with only a few months between the two events  she was a little saucy woman with a bright pair of eyes rather a neat little foot and figure and rather a neat little turnedup nose  the sort of young woman i considered at the time who appeared to invite you to give her a kiss and who would have slapped your face if you accepted the invitation  i couldnt make out her name at first for when she gave it in answer to my inquiry it sounded like beltot which didnt sound right  but when we became better acquaintedwhich was while charker and i were drinking sugarcane sangaree which she made in a most excellent manneri found that her christian name was isabella which they shortened into bell and that the name of the deceased noncommissioned officer was tott  being the kind of neat little woman it was natural to make a toy ofi never saw a woman so like a toy in my lifeshe had got the plaything name of belltott  in short she had no other name on the island  even mr commissioner pordage and he was a grave one formally addressed her as mrs belltott but i shall come to mr commissioner pordage presently  the name of the captain of the sloop was captain maryon and therefore it was no news to hear from mrs belltott that his sister the beautiful unmarried young english lady was miss maryon  the novelty was that her christianname was marion too  marion maryon  many a time i have run off those two names in my thoughts like a bit of verse  oh many and many and many a time  we saw out all the drink that was produced like good men and true and then took our leaves and went down to the beach  the weather was beautiful the wind steady low and gentle the island a picture the sea a picture the sky a picture  in that country there are two rainy seasons in the year  one sets in at about our english midsummer the other about a fortnight after our english michaelmas  it was the beginning of august at that time the first of these rainy seasons was well over and everything was in its most beautiful growth and had its loveliest look upon it  they enjoy themselves here i says to charker turning surly again this is better than privatesoldiering  we had come down to the beach to be friendly with the boatscrew who were camped and hutted there and we were approaching towards their quarters over the sand when christian george king comes up from the landingplace at a wolfstrot crying yup sojeerwhich was that sambo pilots barbarous way of saying hallo soldier  i have stated myself to be a man of no learning and if i entertain prejudices i hope allowance may be made  i will now confess to one  it may be a right one or it may be a wrong one but i never did like natives except in the form of oysters  so when christian george king who was individually unpleasant to me besides comes a trotting along the sand clucking yup sojeer  i had a thundering good mind to let fly at him with my right  i certainly should have done it but that it would have exposed me to reprimand  yup sojeer says he  bad job  what do you mean says i  yup sojeer says he ship leakee  ship leaky says i  iss says he with a nod that looked as if it was jerked out of him by a most violent hiccupwhich is the way with those savages  i cast my eyes at charker and we both heard the pumps going aboard the sloop and saw the signal run up come on board hands wanted from the shore  in no time some of the sloops libertymen were already running down to the waters edge and the party of seamen under orders against the pirates were putting off to the columbus in two boats  o christian george king sar berry sorry says that sambo vagabond then  christian george king cry english fashion  his english fashion of crying was to screw his black knuckles into his eyes howl like a dog and roll himself on his back on the sand  it was trying not to kick him but i gave charker the word doublequick harry and we got down to the waters edge and got on board the sloop  by some means or other she had sprung such a leak that no pumping would keep her free and what between the two fears that she would go down in the harbour and that even if she did not all the supplies she had brought for the little colony would be destroyed by the seawater as it rose in her there was great confusion  in the midst of it captain maryon was heard hailing from the beach  he had been carried down in his hammock and looked very bad but he insisted on being stood there on his feet and i saw him myself come off in the boat sitting upright in the sternsheets as if nothing was wrong with him  a quick sort of council was held and captain maryon soon resolved that we must all fall to work to get the cargo out and that when that was done the guns and heavy matters must be got out and that the sloop must be hauled ashore and careened and the leak stopped  we were all mustered the piratechace party volunteering and told off into parties with so many hours of spell and so many hours of relief and we all went at it with a will  christian george king was entered one of the party in which i worked at his own request and he went at it with as good a will as any of the rest  he went at it with so much heartiness to say the truth that he rose in my good opinion almost as fast as the water rose in the ship  which was fast enough and faster  mr commissioner pordage kept in a redandblack japanned box like a family lumpsugar box some document or other which some sambo chief or other had got drunk and spilt some ink over as well as i could understand the matter and by that means had given up lawful possession of the island  through having hold of this box mr pordage got his title of commissioner  he was styled consul too and spoke of himself as government  he was a stiffjointed highnosed old gentleman without an ounce of fat on him of a very angry temper and a very yellow complexion  mrs commissioner pordage making allowance for difference of sex was much the same  mr kitten a small youngish bald botanical and mineralogical gentleman also connected with the minebut everybody there was that more or lesswas sometimes called by mr commissioner pordage his vicecommissioner and sometimes his deputyconsul  or sometimes he spoke of mr kitten merely as being under government  the beach was beginning to be a lively scene with the preparations for careening the sloop and with cargo and spars and rigging and water casks dotted about it and with temporary quarters for the men rising up there out of such sails and odds and ends as could be best set on one side to make them when mr commissioner pordage comes down in a high fluster and asks for captain maryon  the captain ill as he was was slung in his hammock betwixt two trees that he might direct and he raised his head and answered for himself  captain maryon cries mr commissioner pordage this is not official this is not regular  sir says the captain it hath been arranged with the clerk and supercargo that you should be communicated with and requested to render any little assistance that may lie in your power  i am quite certain that hath been duly done  captain maryon replied mr commissioner pordage there hath been no written correspondence  no documents have passed no memoranda have been made no minutes have been made no entries and counterentries appear in the official muniments  this is indecent  i call upon you sir to desist until all is regular or government will take this up  sir says captain maryon chafing a little as he looked out of his hammock between the chances of government taking this up and my ship taking herself down i much prefer to trust myself to the former  you do sir cries mr commissioner pordage  i do sir says captain maryon lying down again  then mr kitten says the commissioner send up instantly for my diplomatic coat  he was dressed in a linen suit at that moment but mr kitten started off himself and brought down the diplomatic coat which was a blue cloth one goldlaced and with a crown on the button  now mr kitten says pordage i instruct you as vicecommissioner and deputyconsul of this place to demand of captain maryon of the sloop christopher columbus whether he drives me to the act of putting this coat on  mr pordage says captain maryon looking out of his hammock again as i can hear what you say i can answer it without troubling the gentleman i should be sorry that you should be at the pains of putting on too hot a coat on my account but otherwise you may put it on hindside before or insideout or with your legs in the sleeves or your head in the skirts for any objection that i have to offer to your thoroughly pleasing yourself  very good captain maryon says pordage in a tremendous passion  very good sir  be the consequences on your own head  mr kitten as it has come to this help me on with it  when he had given that order he walked off in the coat and all our names were taken and i was afterwards told that mr kitten wrote from his dictation more than a bushel of large paper on the subject which cost more before it was done with than ever could be calculated and which only got done with after all by being lost  our work went on merrily nevertheless and the christopher columbus hauled up lay helpless on her side like a great fish out of water  while she was in that state there was a feast or a ball or an entertainment or more properly all three together given us in honour of the ship and the ships company and the other visitors  at that assembly i believe i saw all the inhabitants then upon the island without any exception  i took no particular notice of more than a few but i found it very agreeable in that little corner of the world to see the children who were of all ages and mostly very prettyas they mostly are  there was one handsome elderly lady with very dark eyes and gray hair that i inquired about  i was told that her name was mrs venning and her married daughter a fair slight thing was pointed out to me by the name of fanny fisher  quite a child she looked with a little copy of herself holding to her dress and her husband just come back from the mine exceeding proud of her  they were a goodlooking set of people on the whole but i didnt like them  i was out of sorts in conversation with charker i found fault with all of them  i said of mrs venning she was proud of mrs fisher she was a delicate little babyfool  what did i think of this one  why he was a fine gentleman  what did i say to that one  why she was a fine lady  what could you expect them to be i asked charker nursed in that climate with the tropical night shining for them musical instruments playing to them great trees bending over them soft lamps lighting them fireflies sparkling in among them bright flowers and birds brought into existence to please their eyes delicious drinks to be had for the pouring out delicious fruits to be got for the picking and every one dancing and murmuring happily in the scented air with the sea breaking low on the reef for a pleasant chorus  fine gentlemen and fine ladies harry i says to charker  yes i think so  dolls  dolls  not the sort of stuff for wear that comes of poor private soldiering in the royal marines  however i could not gainsay that they were very hospitable people and that they treated us uncommonly well  every man of us was at the entertainment and mrs belltott had more partners than she could dance with though she danced all night too  as to jack whether of the christopher columbus or of the pirate pursuit party it made no difference he danced with his brother jack danced with himself danced with the moon the stars the trees the prospect anything  i didnt greatly take to the chiefofficer of that party with his bright eyes brown face and easy figure  i didnt much like his way when he first happened to come where we were with miss maryon on his arm  o captain carton she says here are two friends of mine  he says indeed these two marinesmeaning charker and self  yes says she i showed these two friends of mine when they first came all the wonders of silverstore  he gave us a laughing look and says he you are in luck men  i would be disrated and go before the mast tomorrow to be shown the way upward again by such a guide  you are in luck men  when we had saluted and he and the lady had waltzed away i said you are a pretty follow too to talk of luck  you may go to the devil  mr commissioner pordage and mrs commissioner showed among the company on that occasion like the king and queen of a much greater britain than great britain  only two other circumstances in that jovial night made much separate impression on me  one was this  a man in our draft of marines named tom packer a wild unsteady young fellow but the son of a respectable shipwright in portsmouth yard and a good scholar who had been well brought up comes to me after a spell of dancing and takes me aside by the elbow and says swearing angrily  gill davis i hope i may not be the death of sergeant drooce one day  now i knew drooce had always borne particularly hard on this man and i knew this man to be of a very hot temper so i said  tut nonsense dont talk so to me  if theres a man in the corps who scorns the name of an assassin that man and tom packer are one  tom wipes his head being in a mortal sweat and says he  i hope so but i cant answer for myself when he lords it over me as he has just now done before a woman  i tell you what gill  mark my words  it will go hard with sergeant drooce if ever we are in an engagement together and he has to look to me to save him  let him say a prayer then if he knows one for its all over with him and he is on his deathbed  mark my words  i did mark his words and very soon afterwards too as will shortly be taken down  the other circumstance that i noticed at that ball was the gaiety and attachment of christian george king  the innocent spirits that sambo pilot was in and the impossibility he found himself under of showing all the little colony but especially the ladies and children how fond he was of them how devoted to them and how faithful to them for life and death for present future and everlasting made a great impression on me  if ever a man sambo or no sambo was trustful and trusted to what may be called quite an infantine and sweetly beautiful extent surely i thought that morning when i did at last lie down to rest it was that sambo pilot christian george king  this may account for my dreaming of him  he stuck in my sleep cornerwise and i couldnt get him out  he was always flitting about me dancing round me and peeping in over my hammock though i woke and dozed off again fifty times  at last when i opened my eyes there he really was looking in at the open side of the little dark hut which was made of leaves and had charkers hammock slung in it as well as mine  sojeer says he in a sort of a low croak  yup  hallo says i starting up  what  you are there are you  iss says he  christian george king got news  what news has he got  pirates out  i was on my feet in a second  so was charker  we were both aware that captain carton in command of the boats constantly watched the mainland for a secret signal though of course it was not known to such as us what the signal was  christian george king had vanished before we touched the ground  but the word was already passing from hut to hut to turn out quietly and we knew that the nimble barbarian had got hold of the truth or something near it  in a space among the trees behind the encampment of us visitors naval and military was a snuglyscreened spot where we kept the stores that were in use and did our cookery  the word was passed to assemble here it was very quickly given and was given so far as we were concerned by sergeant drooce who was as good in a soldier point of view as he was bad in a tyrannical one  we were ordered to drop into this space quietly behind the trees one by one  as we assembled here the seamen assembled too  within ten minutes as i should estimate we were all here except the usual guard upon the beach  the beach we could see it through the wood looked as it always had done in the hottest time of the day  the guard were in the shadow of the sloops hull and nothing was moving but the seaand that moved very faintly  work had always been knocked off at that hour until the sun grew less fierce and the sea breeze rose so that its being holiday with us made no difference just then in the look of the place  but i may mention that it was a holiday and the first we had had since our hard work began  last nights ball had been given on the leaks being repaired and the careening done  the worst of the work was over and tomorrow we were to begin to get the sloop afloat again  we marines were now drawn up here under arms  the chaceparty were drawn up separate  the men of the columbus were drawn up separate  the officers stepped out into the midst of the three parties and spoke so as all might hear  captain carton was the officer in command and he had a spyglass in his hand  his coxswain stood by him with another spyglass and with a slate on which he seemed to have been taking down signals  now men says captain carton i have to let you know for your satisfaction firstly that there are ten pirateboats strongly manned and armed lying hidden up a creek yonder on the coast under the overhanging branches of the dense trees  secondly that they will certainly come out this night when the moon rises on a pillaging and murdering expedition of which some part of the mainland is the object thirdlydont cheer menthat we will give chace and if we can get at them rid the world of them please god  nobody spoke that i heard and nobody moved that i saw  yet there was a kind of ring as if every man answered and approved with the best blood that was inside of him  sir says captain maryon i beg to volunteer on this service with my boats  my people volunteer to the ships boys  in his majestys name and service the other answers touching his hat i accept your aid with pleasure  lieutenant linderwood how will you divide your men  i was ashamedi give it out to be written down as large and plain as possiblei was heart and soul ashamed of my thoughts of those two sick officers captain maryon and lieutenant linderwood when i saw them then and there  the spirit in those two gentlemen beat down their illness and very ill i knew them to be like saint george beating down the dragon  pain and weakness want of ease and want of rest had no more place in their minds than fear itself  meaning now to express for my lady to write down exactly what i felt then and there i felt this you two brave fellows that i had been so grudgeful of i know that if you were dying you would put it off to get up and do your best and then you would be so modest that in lying down again to die you would hardly say i did it  it did me good  it really did me good  but to go back to where i broke off  says captain carton to lieutenant linderwood sir how will you divide your men  there is not room for all and a few men should in any case be left here  there was some debate about it  at last it was resolved to leave eight marines and four seamen on the island besides the sloops two boys  and because it was considered that the friendly sambos would only want to be commanded in case of any danger though none at all was apprehended there the officers were in favour of leaving the two noncommissioned officers drooce and charker  it was a heavy disappointment to them just as my being one of the left was a heavy disappointment to methen but not soon afterwards  we men drew lots for it and i drew island so did tom packer  so of course did four more of our rank and file  when this was settled verbal instructions were given to all hands to keep the intended expedition secret in order that the women and children might not be alarmed or the expedition put in a difficulty by more volunteers  the assembly was to be on that same spot at sunset  every man was to keep up an appearance meanwhile of occupying himself in his usual way  that is to say every man excepting four old trusty seamen who were appointed with an officer to see to the arms and ammunition and to muffle the rullocks of the boats and to make everything as trim and swift and silent as it could be made  the sambo pilot had been present all the while in case of his being wanted and had said to the officer in command five hundred times over if he had said it once that christian george king would stay with the so jeers and take care of the booffer ladies and the booffer childsbooffer being that natives expression for beautiful  he was now asked a few questions concerning the putting off of the boats and in particular whether there was any way of embarking at the back of the island which captain carton would have half liked to do and then have dropped round in its shadow and slanted across to the main  but no says christian george king  no no no  told you so ten time  no no no  all reef all rock all swim all drown  striking out as he said it like a swimmer gone mad and turning over on his back on dry land and spluttering himself to death in a manner that made him quite an exhibition  the sun went down after appearing to be a long time about it and the assembly was called  every man answered to his name of course and was at his post  it was not yet black dark and the roll was only just gone through when up comes mr commissioner pordage with his diplomatic coat on  captain carton says he sir what is this  this mr commissioner he was very short with him is an expedition against the pirates  it is a secret expedition so please to keep it a secret  sir says commissioner pordage i trust there is going to be no unnecessary cruelty committed  sir returns the officer i trust not  that is not enough sir cries commissioner pordage getting wroth captain carton i give you notice  government requires you to treat the enemy with great delicacy consideration clemency and forbearance  sir says captain carton i am an english officer commanding english men and i hope i am not likely to disappoint the governments just expectations  but i presume you know that these villains under their black flag have despoiled our countrymen of their property burnt their homes barbarously murdered them and their little children and worse than murdered their wives and daughters  perhaps i do captain carton answers pordage waving his hand with dignity perhaps i do not  it is not customary sir for government to commit itself  it matters very little mr pordage whether or no  believing that i hold my commission by the allowance of god and not that i have received it direct from the devil i shall certainly use it with all avoidance of unnecessary suffering and with all merciful swiftness of execution to exterminate these people from the face of the earth  let me recommend you to go home sir and to keep out of the nightair  never another syllable did that officer say to the commissioner but turned away to his men  the commissioner buttoned his diplomatic coat to the chin said mr kitten attend me gasped half choked himself and took himself off  it now fell very dark indeed  i have seldom if ever seen it darker nor yet so dark  the moon was not due until one in the morning and it was but a little after nine when our men lay down where they were mustered  it was pretended that they were to take a nap but everybody knew that no nap was to be got under the circumstances  though all were very quiet there was a restlessness among the people much what i have seen among the people on a racecourse when the bell has rung for the saddling for a great race with large stakes on it  at ten they put off only one boat putting off at a time another following in five minutes both then lying on their oars until another followed  ahead of all paddling his own outlandish little canoe without a sound went the sambo pilot to take them safely outside the reef  no light was shown but once and that was in the commanding officers own hand  i lighted the dark lantern for him and he took it from me when he embarked  they had blue lights and such like with them but kept themselves as dark as murder  the expedition got away with wonderful quietness and christian george king soon came back dancing with joy  yup sojeer says he to myself in a very objectionable kind of convulsions christian george king sar berry glad  pirates all be blown apieces  yup  yup  my reply to that cannibal was however glad you may be hold your noise and dont dance jigs and slap your knees about it for i cant abear to see you do it  i was on duty then we twelve who were left being divided into four watches of three each three hours spell  i was relieved at twelve  a little before that time i had challenged and miss maryon and mrs belltott had come in  good davis says miss maryon what is the matter  where is my brother  i told her what was the matter and where her brother was  o heaven help him says she clasping her hands and looking upshe was close in front of me and she looked most lovely to be sure he is not sufficiently recovered not strong enough for such strife  if you had seen him miss i told her as i saw him when he volunteered you would have known that his spirit is strong enough for any strife  it will bear his body miss to wherever duty calls him  it will always bear him to an honourable life or a brave death  heaven bless you says she touching my arm  i know it  heaven bless you  mrs belltott surprised me by trembling and saying nothing  they were still standing looking towards the sea and listening after the relief had come round  it continuing very dark i asked to be allowed to take them back  miss maryon thanked me and she put her arm in mine and i did take them back  i have now got to make a confession that will appear singular  after i had left them i laid myself down on my face on the beach and cried for the first time since i had frightened birds as a boy at snorridge bottom to think what a poor ignorant lowplaced private soldier i was  it was only for half a minute or so  a man cant at all times be quite master of himself and it was only for half a minute or so  then i up and went to my hut and turned into my hammock and fell asleep with wet eyelashes and a sore sore heart  just as i had often done when i was a child and had been worse used than usual  i slept as a child under those circumstances might very sound and yet very sore at heart all through my sleep  i was awoke by the words he is a determined man  i had sprung out of my hammock and had seized my firelock and was standing on the ground saying the words myself  he is a determined man  but the curiosity of my state was that i seemed to be repeating them after somebody and to have been wonderfully startled by hearing them  as soon as i came to myself i went out of the hut and away to where the guard was  charker challenged  who goes there  a friend  not gill says he as he shouldered his piece  gill says i  why what the deuce do you do out of your hammock says he  too hot for sleep says i is all right  right says charker yes yes alls right enough here what should be wrong here  its the boats that we want to know of  except for fire flies twinkling about and the lonesome splashes of great creatures as they drop into the water theres nothing going on here to ease a mans mind from the boats  the moon was above the sea and had risen i should say some halfan hour  as charker spoke with his face towards the sea i looking landward suddenly laid my right hand on his breast and said dont move  dont turn  dont raise your voice  you never saw a maltese face here  no  what do you mean he asks staring at me  nor yet an english face with one eye and a patch across the nose  no  what ails you  what do you mean  i had seen both looking at us round the stem of a cocoanut tree where the moon struck them  i had seen that sambo pilot with one hand laid on the stem of the tree drawing them back into the heavy shadow  i had seen their naked cutlasses twinkle and shine like bits of the moonshine in the water that had got blown ashore among the trees by the light wind i had seen it all in a moment  and i saw in a moment as any man would that the signalled move of the pirates on the mainland was a plot and a feint that the leak had been made to disable the sloop that the boats had been tempted away to leave the island unprotected that the pirates had landed by some secreted way at the back and that christian george king was a doubledyed traitor and a most infernal villain  i considered still all in one and the same moment that charker was a brave man but not quick with his head and that sergeant drooce with a much better head was close by  all i said to charker was i am afraid we are betrayed  turn your back full to the moonlight on the sea and cover the stem of the cocoanut tree which will then be right before you at the height of a mans heart  are you right  i am right says charker turning instantly and falling into the position with a nerve of iron and right aint left  is it gill  a few seconds brought me to sergeant drooces hut  he was fast asleep and being a heavy sleeper i had to lay my hand upon him to rouse him the instant i touched him he came rolling out of his hammock and upon me like a tiger  and a tiger he was except that he knew what he was up to in his utmost heat as well as any man  i had to struggle with him pretty hard to bring him to his senses panting all the while for he gave me a breather sergeant i am gill davis  treachery  pirates on the island  the last words brought him round and he took his hands of  i have seen two of them within this minute said i  and so i told him what i had told harry charker  his soldierly though tyrannical head was clear in an instant  he didnt waste one word even of surprise  order the guard says he to draw off quietly into the fort  they called the enclosure i have before mentioned the fort though it was not much of that  then get you to the fort as quick as you can rouse up every soul there and fasten the gate  i will bring in all those who are at the signal hill if we are surrounded before we can join you you must make a sally and cut us out if you can  the word among our men is women and children  he burst away like fire going before the wind over dry reeds  he roused up the seven men who were off duty and had them bursting away with him before they know they were not asleep  i reported orders to charker and ran to the fort as i have never run at any other time in all my life no not even in a dream  the gate was not fast and had no good fastening only a double wooden bar a poor chain and a bad lock  those i secured as well as they could be secured in a few seconds by one pair of hands and so ran to that part of the building where miss maryon lived  i called to her loudly by her name until she answered  i then called loudly all the names i knewmrs macey miss maryons married sister mr macey mrs venning mr and mrs fisher even mr and mrs pordage  then i called out all you gentlemen here get up and defend the place  we are caught in a trap  pirates have landed  we are attacked  at the terrible word piratesfor those villains had done such deeds in those seas as never can be told in writing and can scarcely be so much as thought ofcries and screams rose up from every part of the place  quickly lights moved about from window to window and the cries moved about with them and men women and children came flying down into the square  i remarked to myself even then what a number of things i seemed to see at once  i noticed mrs macey coming towards me carrying all her three children together  i noticed mr pordage in the greatest terror in vain trying to get on his diplomatic coat and mr kitten respectfully tying his pockethandkerchief over mrs pordages nightcap i noticed mrs belltott run out screaming and shrink upon the ground near me and cover her face in her hands and lie all of a bundle shivering  but what i noticed with the greatest pleasure was the determined eyes with which those men of the mine that i had thought fine gentlemen came round me with what arms they had to the full as cool and resolute as i could be for my lifeay and for my soul too into the bargain  the chief person being mr macey i told him how the three men of the guard would be at the gate directly if they were not already there and how sergeant drooce and the other seven were gone to bring in the outlying part of the people of silverstore  i next urged him for the love of all who were dear to him to trust no sambo and above all if he could got any good chance at christian george king not to lose it but to put him out of the world  i will follow your advice to the letter davis says he what next  my answer was i think sir i would recommend you next to order down such heavy furniture and lumber as can be moved and make a barricade within the gate  thats good again says he will you see it done  ill willingly help to do it says i unless or until my superior sergeant drooce gives me other orders  he shook me by the hand and having told off some of his companions to help me bestirred himself to look to the arms and ammunition  a proper quick brave steady ready gentleman  one of their three little children was deaf and dumb miss maryon had been from the first with all the children soothing them and dressing them poor little things they had been brought out of their beds and making them believe that it was a game of play so that some of them were now even laughing  i had been working hard with the others at the barricade and had got up a pretty good breastwork within the gate drooce and the seven men had come back bringing in the people from the signal hill and had worked along with us but i had not so much as spoken a word to drooce nor had drooce so much as spoken a word to me for we were both too busy  the breastwork was now finished and i found miss maryon at my side with a child in her arms  her dark hair was fastened round her head with a band  she had a quantity of it and it looked even richer and more precious put up hastily out of her way than i had seen it look when it was carefully arranged  she was very pale but extraordinarily quiet and still  dear good davis said she i have been waiting to speak one word to you  i turned to her directly  if i had received a musketball in the heart and she had stood there i almost believe i should have turned to her before i dropped  this pretty little creature said she kissing the child in her arms who was playing with her hair and trying to pull it down cannot hear what we saycan hear nothing  i trust you so much and have such great confidence in you that i want you to make me a promise  what is it miss  that if we are defeated and you are absolutely sure of my being taken you will kill me  i shall not be alive to do it miss  i shall have died in your defence before it comes to that  they must step across my body to lay a hand on you  but if you are alive you brave soldier  how she looked at me  and if you cannot save me from the pirates living you will save me dead tell me so  well  i told her i would do that at the last if all else failed  she took my handmy rough coarse handand put it to her lips  she put it to the childs lips and the child kissed it  i believe i had the strength of half a dozen men in me from that moment until the fight was over  all this time mr commissioner pordage had been wanting to make a proclamation to the pirates to lay down their arms and go away and everybody had been hustling him about and tumbling over him while he was calling for pen and ink to write it with  mrs pordage too had some curious ideas about the british respectability of her nightcap which had as many frills to it growing in layers one inside another as if it was a white vegetable of the artichoke sort and she wouldnt take the nightcap off and would be angry when it got crushed by the other ladies who were handing things about and in short she gave as much trouble as her husband did  but as we were now forming for the defence of the place they were both poked out of the way with no ceremony  the children and ladies were got into the little trench which surrounded the silverhouse we were afraid of leaving them in any of the light buildings lest they should be set on fire and we made the best disposition we could  there was a pretty good store in point of amount of tolerable swords and cutlasses  those were issued  there were also perhaps a score or so of spare muskets  those were brought out  to my astonishment little mrs fisher that i had taken for a doll and a baby was not only very active in that service but volunteered to load the spare arms  for i understand it well says she cheerfully without a shake in her voice  i am a soldiers daughter and a sailors sister and i understand it too says miss maryon just in the same way  steady and busy behind where i stood those two beautiful and delicate young women fell to handling the guns hammering the flints looking to the locks and quietly directing others to pass up powder and bullets from hand to hand as unflinching as the best of tried soldiers  sergeant drooce had brought in word that the pirates were very strong in numbersover a hundred was his estimateand that they were not even then all landed for he had seen them in a very good position on the further side of the signal hill evidently waiting for the rest of their men to come up  in the present pause the first we had had since the alarm he was telling this over again to mr macey when mr macey suddenly cried our the signal  nobody has thought of the signal  we knew of no signal so we could not have thought of it  what signal may you mean sir says sergeant drooce looking sharp at him  there is a pile of wood upon the signal hill  if it could be lightedwhich never has been done yetit would be a signal of distress to the mainland  charker cries directly sergeant drooce dispatch me on that duty  give me the two men who were on guard with me tonight and ill light the fire if it can be done  and if it cant corporal mr macey strikes in  look at these ladies and children sir says charker  id sooner light myself than not try any chance to save them  we gave him a hurrahit burst from us come of it what mightand he got his two men and was let out at the gate and crept away  i had no sooner come back to my place from being one of the party to handle the gate than miss maryon said in a low voice behind me  davis will you look at this powder  this is not right  i turned my head  christian george king again and treachery again  sea water had been conveyed into the magazine and every grain of powder was spoiled  stay a moment said sergeant drooce when i had told him without causing a movement in a muscle of his face look to your pouch my lad you tom packer look to your pouch confound you  look to your pouches all you marines  the same artful savage had got at them somehow or another and the cartridges were all unserviceable  hum says the sergeant  look to your loading men  you are right so far  yes we were right so far  well my lads and gentlemen all says the sergeant this will be a handtohand affair and so much the better  he treated himself to a pinch of snuff and stood up squareshouldered and broadchested in the light of the moonwhich was now very brightas cool as if he was waiting for a play to begin  he stood quiet and we all stood quiet for a matter of something like halfanhour  i took notice from such whispered talk as there was how little we that the silver did not belong to thought about it and how much the people that it did belong to thought about it  at the end of the halfhour it was reported from the gate that charker and the two were falling back on us pursued by about a dozen  sally  gateparty under gill davis says the sergeant and bring em in  like men now  we were not long about it and we brought them in  dont take me says charker holding me round the neck and stumbling down at my feet when the gate was fast dont take me near the ladies or the children gill they had better not see death till it cant be helped  theyll see it soon enough  harry i answered holding up his head  comrade  he was cut to pieces  the signal had been secured by the first pirate party that landed his hair was all singed off and his face was blackened with the running pitch from a torch  he made no complaint of pain or of anything  goodbye old chap was all he said with a smile  ive got my death  and death aint life  is it gill  having helped to lay his poor body on one side i went back to my post sergeant drooce looked at me with his eyebrows a little lifted  i nodded  close up here men and gentlemen all said the sergeant  a place too many in the line  the pirates were so close upon us at this time that the foremost of them were already before the gate  more and more came up with a great noise and shouting loudly  when we believed from the sound that they were all there we gave three english cheers  the poor little children joined and were so fully convinced of our being at play that they enjoyed the noise and were heard clapping their hands in the silence that followed  our disposition was this beginning with the rear  mrs venning holding her daughters child in her arms sat on the steps of the little square trench surrounding the silverhouse encouraging and directing those women and children as she might have done in the happiest and easiest time of her life  then there was an armed line under mr macey across the width of the enclosure facing that way and having their backs towards the gate in order that they might watch the walls and prevent our being taken by surprise  then there was a space of eight or ten feet deep in which the spare arms were and in which miss maryon and mrs fisher their hands and dresses blackened with the spoilt gunpowder worked on their knees tying such things as knives old bayonets and spearheads to the muzzles of the useless muskets  then there was a second armed line under sergeant drooce also across the width of the enclosure but facing to the gate  then came the breastwork we had made with a zigzag way through it for me and my little party to hold good in retreating as long as we could when we were driven from the gate  we all knew that it was impossible to hold the place long and that our only hope was in the timely discovery of the plot by the boats and in their coming back  i and my men were now thrown forward to the gate  from a spyhole i could see the whole crowd of pirates  there were malays among them dutch maltese greeks sambos negroes and convict englishmen from the west india islands among the last him with the one eye and the patch across the nose  there were some portuguese too and a few spaniards the captain was a portuguese a little man with very large earrings under a very broad hat and a great bright shawl twisted about his shoulders  they were all strongly armed but like a boarding party with pikes swords cutlasses and axes  i noticed a good many pistols but not a gun of any kind among them  this gave me to understand that they had considered that a continued roll of musketry might perhaps have been heard on the mainland also that for the reason that fire would be seen from the mainland they would not set the fort in flames and roast us alive which was one of their favourite ways of carrying on  i looked about for christian george king and if i had seen him i am much mistaken if he would not have received my one round of ballcartridge in his head but no christian george king was visible  a sort of a wild portuguese demon who seemed either fiercemad or fierce drunkbut they all seemed one or the othercame forward with the black flag and gave it a wave or two  after that the portuguese captain called out in shrill english i say you  english fools  open the gate surrender  as we kept close and quiet he said something to his men which i didnt understand and when he had said it the oneeyed english rascal with the patch who had stepped out when he began said it again in english  it was only this  boys of the black flag this is to be quickly done  take all the prisoners you can  if they dont yield kill the children to make them  forward  then they all came on at the gate and in another halfminute were smashing and splitting it in  we struck at them through the gaps and shivers and we dropped many of them too but their very weight would have carried such a gate if they had been unarmed  i soon found sergeant drooce at my side forming us six remaining marines in linetom packer next to meand ordering us to fall back three paces and as they broke in to give them our one little volley at short distance  then says he receive them behind your breastwork on the bayonet and at least let every man of you pin one of the cursed cockchafers through the body  we checked them by our fire slight as it was and we checked them at the breastwork  however they broke over it like swarms of devilsthey were really and truly more devils than menand then it was hand to hand indeed  we clubbed our muskets and laid about us even then those two ladiesalways behind mewere steady and ready with the arms  i had a lot of maltese and malays upon me and but for a broadsword that miss maryons own hand put in mine should have got my end from them  but was that all  no  i saw a heap of banded dark hair and a white dress come thrice between me and them under my own raised right arm which each time might have destroyed the wearer of the white dress and each time one of the lot went down struck dead  drooce was armed with a broadsword too and did such things with it that there was a cry in halfadozen languages of kill that sergeant as i knew by the cry being raised in english and taken up in other tongues  i had received a severe cut across the left arm a few moments before and should have known nothing of it except supposing that somebody had struck me a smart blow if i had not felt weak and seen myself covered with spouting blood and at the same instant of time seen miss maryon tearing her dress and binding it with mrs fishers help round the wound  they called to tom packer who was scouring by to stop and guard me for one minute while i was bound or i should bleed to death in trying to defend myself  tom stopped directly with a good sabre in his hand  in that same momentall things seem to happen in that same moment at such a timehalfadozen had rushed howling at sergeant drooce  the sergeant stepping back against the wall stopped one howl for ever with such a terrible blow and waited for the rest to come on with such a wonderfully unmoved face that they stopped and looked at him  see him now cried tom packer  now when i could cut him out  gill did i tell you to mark my words  i implored tom packer in the lords name as well as i could in my faintness to go to the sergeants aid  i hate and detest him says tom moodily wavering  still he is a brave man  then he calls out sergeant drooce sergeant drooce  tell me you have driven me too hard and are sorry for it  the sergeant without turning his eyes from his assailants which would have been instant death to him answers  no  i wont  sergeant drooce cries tom in a kind of an agony  i have passed my word that i would never save you from death if i could but would leave you to die  tell me you have driven me too hard and are sorry for it and that shall go for nothing  one of the group laid the sergeants bald bare head open  the sergeant laid him dead  i tell you says the sergeant breathing a little short and waiting for the next attack no  i wont  if you are not man enough to strike for a fellowsoldier because he wants help and because of nothing else ill go into the other world and look for a better man  tom swept upon them and cut him out  tom and he fought their way through another knot of them and sent them flying and came over to where i was beginning again to feel with inexpressible joy that i had got a sword in my hand  they had hardly come to us when i heard above all the other noises a tremendous cry of womens voices  i also saw miss maryon with quite a new face suddenly clap her two hands over mrs fishers eyes  i looked towards the silverhouse and saw mrs venningstanding upright on the top of the steps of the trench with her gray hair and her dark eyeshide her daughters child behind her among the folds of her dress strike a pirate with her other hand and fall shot by his pistol  the cry arose again and there was a terrible and confusing rush of the women into the midst of the struggle  in another moment something came tumbling down upon me that i thought was the wall  it was a heap of sambos who had come over the wall and of four men who clung to my legs like serpents one who clung to my right leg was christian george king  yup sojeer says he christian george king sar berry glad sojeer a prisoner  christian george king been waiting for sojeer sech long time yup yup  what could i do with fiveandtwenty of them on me but be tied hand and foot  so i was tied hand and foot  it was all over nowboats not come backall lost  when i was fast bound and was put up against the wall the oneeyed english convict came up with the portuguese captain to have a look at me  see says he  heres the determined man  if you had slept sounder last night youd have slept your soundest last night my determined man  the portuguese captain laughed in a cool way and with the flat of his cutlass hit me crosswise as if i was the bough of a tree that he played with first on the face and then across the chest and the wounded arm  i looked him steady in the face without tumbling while he looked at me i am happy to say but when they went away i fell and lay there  the sun was up when i was roused and told to come down to the beach and be embarked  i was full of aches and pains and could not at first remember but i remembered quite soon enough  the killed were lying about all over the place and the pirates were burying their dead and taking away their wounded on hastilymade litters to the back of the island  as for us prisoners some of their boats had come round to the usual harbour to carry us off  we looked a wretched few i thought when i got down there still it was another sign that we had fought well and made the enemy suffer  the portuguese captain had all the women already embarked in the boat he himself commanded which was just putting off when i got down  miss maryon sat on one side of him and gave me a moments look as full of quiet courage and pity and confidence as if it had been an hour long on the other side of him was poor little mrs fisher weeping for her child and her mother  i was shoved into the same boat with drooce and packer and the remainder of our party of marines of whom we had lost two privates besides charker my poor brave comrade  we all made a melancholy passage under the hot sun over to the mainland  there we landed in a solitary place and were mustered on the sea sand  mr and mrs macey and their children were amongst us mr and mrs pordage mr kitten mr fisher and mrs belltott  we mustered only fourteen men fifteen women and seven children  those were all that remained of the english who had lain down to sleep last night unsuspecting and happy on the island of silverstore     chapter iii 1the rafts on the river   we contrived to keep afloat all that night and the stream running strong with us to glide a long way down the river  but we found the night to be a dangerous time for such navigation on account of the eddies and rapids and it was therefore settled next day that in future we would bringto at sunset and encamp on the shore  as we knew of no boats that the pirates possessed up at the prison in the woods we settled always to encamp on the opposite side of the stream so as to have the breadth of the river between our sleep and them  our opinion was that if they were acquainted with any near way by land to the mouth of this river they would come up it in force and retake us or kill us according as they could but that if that was not the case and if the river ran by none of their secret stations we might escape  when i say we settled this or that i do not mean that we planned anything with any confidence as to what might happen an hour hence  so much had happened in one night and such great changes had been violently and suddenly made in the fortunes of many among us that we had got better used to uncertainty in a little while than i dare say most people do in the course of their lives  the difficulties we soon got into through the offsettings and point currents of the stream made the likelihood of our being drowned aloneto say nothing of our being retakenas broad and plain as the sun at noonday to all of us  but we all worked hard at managing the rafts under the direction of the seamen of our own skill i think we never could have prevented them from oversetting and we also worked hard at making good the defects in their first hasty constructionwhich the water soon found out  while we humbly resigned ourselves to going down if it was the will of our father that was in heaven we humbly made up our minds that we would all do the best that was in us  and so we held on gliding with the stream  it drove us to this bank and it drove us to that bank and it turned us and whirled us but yet it carried us on  sometimes much too slowly sometimes much too fast but yet it carried us on  my little deaf and dumb boy slumbered a good deal now and that was the case with all the children  they caused very little trouble to any one they seemed in my eyes to get more like one another not only in quiet manner but in the face too  the motion of the raft was usually so much the same the scene was usually so much the same the sound of the soft wash and ripple of the water was usually so much the same that they were made drowsy as they might have been by the constant playing of one tune even on the grown people who worked hard and felt anxiety the same things produced something of the same effect  every day was so like the other that i soon lost count of the days myself and had to ask miss maryon for instance whether this was the third or fourth  miss maryon had a pocketbook and pencil and she kept the log that is to say she entered up a clear little journal of the time and of the distances our seamen thought we had made each night  so as i say we kept afloat and glided on  all day long and every day the water and the woods and sky all day long and every day the constant watching of both sides of the river and far ahead at every bold turn and sweep it made for any signs of pirateboats or piratedwellings  so as i say we kept afloat and glided on  the days melting themselves together to that degree that i could hardly believe my ears when i asked how many now miss and she answered seven  to be sure poor mr pordage had by about now got his diplomatic coat into such a state as never was seen  what with the mud of the river what with the water of the river what with the sun and the dews and the tearing boughs and the thickets it hung about him in discoloured shreds like a mop  the sun had touched him a bit  he had taken to always polishing one particular button which just held on to his left wrist and to always calling for stationery  i suppose that man called for pens ink and paper tape and scalingwax upwards of one thousand times in fourandtwenty hours  he had an idea that we should never get out of that river unless we were written out of it in a formal memorandum and the more we laboured at navigating the rafts the more he ordered us not to touch them at our peril and the more he sat and roared for stationery  mrs pordage similarly persisted in wearing her nightcap  i doubt if any one but ourselves who had seen the progress of that article of dress could by this time have told what it was meant for  it had got so limp and ragged that she couldnt see out of her eyes for it  it was so dirty that whether it was vegetable matter out of a swamp or weeds out of the river or an old portersknot from england i dont think any new spectator could have said  yet this unfortunate old woman had a notion that it was not only vastly genteel but that it was the correct thing as to propriety  and she really did carry herself over the other ladies who had no nightcaps and who were forced to tie up their hair how they could in a superior manner that was perfectly amazing  i dont know what she looked like sitting in that blessed nightcap on a log of wood outside the hut or cabin upon our raft  she would have rather resembled a fortuneteller in one of the picturebooks that used to be in the shop windows in my boyhood except for her stateliness  but lord bless my heart the dignity with which she sat and moped with her head in that bundle of tatters was like nothing else in the world  she was not on speaking terms with more than three of the ladies  some of them had what she called taken precedence of herin getting into or out of that miserable little shelterand others had not called to pay their respects or something of that kind  so there she sat in her own state and ceremony while her husband sat on the same log of wood ordering us one and all to let the raft go to the bottom and to bring him stationery  what with this noise on the part of mr commissioner pordage and what with the cries of sergeant drooce on the raft astern which were sometimes more than tom packer could silence we often made our slow way down the river anything but quietly  yet that it was of great importance that no ears should be able to hear us from the woods on the banks could not be doubted  we were looked for to a certainty and we might be retaken at any moment  it was an anxious time it was indeed indeed an anxious time  on the seventh night of our voyage on the rafts we made fast as usual on the opposite side of the river to that from which we had started in as dark a place as we could pick out  our little encampment was soon made and supper was eaten and the children fell asleep  the watch was set and everything made orderly for the night  such a starlight night with such blue in the sky and such black in the places of heavy shade on the banks of the great stream  those two ladies miss maryon and mrs fisher had always kept near me since the night of the attack  mr fisher who was untiring in the work of our raft had said to me  my dear little childless wife has grown so attached to you davis and you are such a gentle fellow as well as such a determined one our party had adopted that last expression from the oneeyed english pirate and i repeat what mr fisher said only because he said it that it takes a load off my mind to leave her in your charge  i said to him your lady is in far better charge than mine sir having miss maryon to take care of her but you may rely upon it that i will guard them bothfaithful and true  says he i do rely upon it davis and i heartily wish all the silver on our old island was yours  that seventh starlight night as i have said we made our camp and got our supper and set our watch and the children fell asleep  it was solemn and beautiful in those wild and solitary parts to see them every night before they lay down kneeling under the bright sky saying their little prayers at womens laps  at that time we men all uncovered and mostly kept at a distance  when the innocent creatures rose up we murmured amen all together  for though we had not heard what they said we know it must be good for us  at that time too as was only natural those poor mothers in our company whose children had been killed shed many tears  i thought the sight seemed to console them while it made them cry but whether i was right or wrong in that they wept very much  on this seventh night mrs fisher had cried for her lost darling until she cried herself asleep  she was lying on a little couch of leaves and suchlike i made the best little couch i could for them every night and miss maryon had covered her and sat by her holding her hand  the stars looked down upon them as for me i guarded them  davis says miss maryon  i am not going to say what a voice she had i couldnt if i tried  i am here miss  the river sounds as if it were swollen tonight  we all think miss that we are coming near the sea  do you believe now we shall escape  i do now miss really believe it  i had always said i did but i had in my own mind been doubtful  how glad you will be my good davis to see england again  i have another confession to make that will appear singular  when she said these words something rose in my throat and the stars i looked away at seemed to break into sparkles that fell down my face and burnt it  england is not much to me miss except as a name  o so true an englishman should not say thatare you not well tonight davis  very kindly and with a quick change  quite well miss  are you sure  your voice sounds altered in my hearing  no miss i am a stronger man than ever  but england is nothing to me  miss maryon sat silent for so long a while that i believed she had done speaking to me for one time  however she had not for byandby she said in a distinct clear tone  no good friend you must not say that england is nothing to you  it is to be much to you yeteverything to you  you have to take back to england the good name you have earned here and the gratitude and attachment and respect you have won here and you have to make some good english girl very happy and proud by marrying her and i shall one day see her i hope and make her happier and prouder still by telling her what noble services her husbands were in south america and what a noble friend he was to me there  though she spoke these kind words in a cheering manner she spoke them compassionately  i said nothing  it will appear to be another strange confession that i paced to and fro within call all that night a most unhappy man reproaching myself all the night long  you are as ignorant as any man alive you are as obscure as any man alive you are as poor as any man alive you are no better than the mud under your foot  that was the way in which i went on against myself until the morning  with the day came the days labour  what i should have donewithout the labour i dont know  we were afloat again at the usual hour and were again making our way down the river  it was broader and clearer of obstructions than it had been and it seemed to flow faster  this was one of drooces quiet days mr pordage besides being sulky had almost lost his voice and we made good way and with little noise  there was always a seaman forward on the raft keeping a bright lookout suddenly in the full heat of the day when the children were slumbering and the very trees and reeds appeared to be slumbering this manit was shortholds up his hand and cries with great caution avast  voices ahead  we held on against the stream as soon as we could bring her up and the other raft followed suit  at first mr macey mr fisher and myself could hear nothing though both the seamen aboard of us agreed that they could hear voices and oars  after a little pause however we united in thinking that we could hear the sound of voices and the dip of oars but you can hear a long way in those countries and there was a bend of the river before us and nothing was to be seen except such waters and such banks as we were now in the eighth day and might for the matter of our feelings have been in the eightieth of having seen with anxious eyes  it was soon decided to put a man ashore who should creep through the wood see what was coming and warn the rafts  the rafts in the meantime to keep the middle of the stream  the man to be put ashore and not to swim ashore as the first thing could be more quickly done than the second  the raft conveying him to get back into midstream and to hold on along with the other as well is it could until signalled by the man in case of danger the man to shift for himself until it should be safe to take him on board again  i volunteered to be the man  we knew that the voices and oars must come up slowly against the stream and our seamen knew by the set of the stream under which bank they would come  i was put ashore accordingly  the raft got off well and i broke into the wood  steaming hot it was and a tearing place to get through  so much the better for me since it was something to contend against and do  i cut off the bend of the river at a great saving of space came to the waters edge again and hid myself and waited  i could now hear the dip of the oars very distinctly the voices had ceased  the sound came on in a regular tune and as i lay hidden i fancied the tune so played to be chrisengeorgeking  chrisengeorgeking chrisengeorgeking over and over again always the same with the pauses always at the same places  i had likewise time to make up my mind that if these were the pirates i could and would barring my being shot swim off to my raft in spite of my wound the moment i had given the alarm and hold my old post by miss maryon  chrisengeorgeking  chrisengeorgeking  chrisengeorgeking coming up now very near  i took a look at the branches about me to see where a shower of bullets would be most likely to do me least hurt and i took a look back at the track i had made in forcing my way in and now i was wholly prepared and fully ready for them  chrisengeorgeking  chrisengeorgeking  chrisengeorgeking here they are  who were they  the barbarous pirates scum of all nations headed by such men as the hideous little portuguese monkey and the oneeyed english convict with the gash across his face that ought to have gashed his wicked head off  the worst men in the world picked out from the worst to do the cruellest and most atrocious deeds that ever stained it the howling murdering blackflag waving mad and drunken crowd of devils that had overcome us by numbers and by treachery  no  these were english men in english boatsgood bluejackets and redcoatsmarines that i knew myself and sailors that knew our seamen  at the helm of the first boat captain carton eager and steady  at the helm of the second boat captain maryon brave and bold  at the helm of the third boat an old seaman with determination carved into his watchful face like the figurehead of a ship  every man doubly and trebly armed from head to foot  every man lyingto at his work with a will that had all his heart and soul in it  every man looking out for any trace of friend or enemy and burning to be the first to do good or avenge evil  every man with his face on fire when he saw me his countryman who had been taken prisoner and hailed me with a cheer as captain cartons boat ran in and took me on board  i reported all escaped sir  all well all safe all here  god bless meand god bless themwhat a cheer  it turned me weak as i was passed on from hand to hand to the stern of the boat every hand patting me or grasping me in some way or other in the moment of my going by  hold up my brave fellow says captain carton clapping me on the shoulder like a friend and giving me a flask  put your lips to that and theyll be red again  now boys give way  the banks flew by us as if the mightiest stream that ever ran was with us and so it was i am sure meaning the stream to those mens ardour and spirit  the banks flew by us and we came in sight of the raftsthe banks flew by us and we came alongside of the raftsthe banks stopped and there was a tumult of laughing and crying and kissing and shaking of hands and catching up of children and setting of them down again and a wild hurry of thankfulness and joy that melted every one and softened all hearts  i had taken notice in captain cartons boat that there was a curious and quite new sort of fitting on board  it was a kind of a little bower made of flowers and it was set up behind the captain and betwixt him and the rudder  not only was this arbour so to call it neatly made of flowers but it was ornamented in a singular way  some of the men had taken the ribbons and buckles off their hats and hung them among the flowers others had made festoons and streamers of their handkerchiefs and hung them there others had intermixed such trifles as bits of glass and shining fragments of lockets and tobaccoboxes with the flowers so that altogether it was a very bright and lively object in the sunshine but why there or what for i did not understand  now as soon as the first bewilderment was over captain carton gave the order to land for the present  but this boat of his with two hands left in her immediately put off again when the men were out of her and kept off some yards from the shore  as she floated there with the two hands gently backing water to keep her from going down the stream this pretty little arbour attracted many eyes  none of the boats crew however had anything to say about it except that it was the captains fancy  the captainwith the women and children clustering round him and the men of all ranks grouped outside them and all listeningstood telling how the expedition deceived by its bad intelligence had chased the light pirate boats all that fatal night and had still followed in their wake next day and had never suspected until many hours too late that the great pirate body had drawn off in the darkness when the chase began and shot over to the island  he stood telling how the expedition supposing the whole array of armed boats to be ahead of it got tempted into shallows and went aground but not without having its revenge upon the two decoyboats both of which it had come up with overhand and sent to the bottom with all on board  he stood telling how the expedition fearing then that the case stood as it did got afloat again by great exertion after the loss of four more tides and returned to the island where they found the sloop scuttled and the treasure gone  he stood telling how my officer lieutenant linderwood was left upon the island with as strong a force as could be got together hurriedly from the mainland and how the three boats we saw before us were manned and armed and had come away exploring the coast and inlets in search of any tidings of us  he stood telling all this with his face to the river and as he stood telling it the little arbour of flowers floated in the sunshine before all the faces there  leaning on captain cartons shoulder between him and miss maryon was mrs fisher her head drooping on her arm  she asked him without raising it when he had told so much whether he had found her mother  be comforted  she lies said the captain gently under the cocoanut trees on the beach  and my child captain carton did you find my child too  does my darling rest with my mother  no  your pretty child sleeps said the captain under a shade of flowers  his voice shook but there was something in it that struck all the hearers  at that moment there sprung from the arbour in his boat a little creature clapping her hands and stretching out her arms and crying dear papa  dear mamma  i am not killed  i am saved  i am coming to kiss you  take me to them take me to them good kind sailors  nobody who saw that scene has ever forgotten it i am sure or ever will forget it  the child had kept quite still where her brave grandmamma had put her first whispering in her ear whatever happens to me do not stir my dear and had remained quiet until the fort was deserted she had then crept out of the trench and gone into her mothers house and there alone on the solitary island in her mothers room and asleep on her mothers bed the captain had found her  nothing could induce her to be parted from him after he took her up in his arms and he had brought her away with him and the men had made the bower for her  to see those men now was a sight  the joy of the women was beautiful the joy of those women who had lost their own children was quite sacred and divine but the ecstasies of captain cartons boats crew when their pet was restored to her parents were wonderful for the tenderness they showed in the midst of roughness  as the captain stood with the child in his arms and the childs own little arms now clinging round his neck now round her fathers now round her mothers now round some one who pressed up to kiss her the boats crew shook hands with one another waved their hats over their heads laughed sang cried dancedand all among themselves without wanting to interfere with anybodyin a manner never to be represented  at last i saw the coxswain and another two very hardfaced men with grizzled heads who had been the heartiest of the hearty all along close with one another get each of them the others head under his arm and pommel away at it with his fist as hard as he could in his excess of joy  when we had well rested and refreshed ourselvesand very glad we were to have some of the heartening things to eat and drink that had come up in the boatswe recommenced our voyage down the river rafts and boats and all  i said to myself it was a very different kind of voyage now from what it had been and i fell into my proper place and station among my fellowsoldiers  but when we halted for the night i found that miss maryon had spoken to captain carton concerning me  for the captain came straight up to me and says he my brave fellow you have been miss maryons bodyguard all along and you shall remain so  nobody shall supersede you in the distinction and pleasure of protecting that young lady  i thanked his honour in the fittest words i could find and that night i was placed on my old post of watching the place where she slept  more than once in the night i saw captain carton come out into the air and stroll about there to see that all was well  i have now this other singular confession to make that i saw him with a heavy heart  yes i saw him with a heavy heavy heart  in the daytime i had the like post in captain cartons boat  i had a special station of my own behind miss maryon and no hands but hers ever touched my wound  it has been healed these many long years but no other hands have ever touched it  mr pordage was kept tolerably quiet now with pen and ink and began to pick up his senses a little  seated in the second boat he made documents with mr kitten pretty well all day and he generally handed in a protest about something whenever we stopped  the captain however made so very light of these papers that it grew into a saying among the men when one of them wanted a match for his pipe hand us over a protest jack  as to mrs pordage she still wore the nightcap and she now had cut all the ladies on account of her not having been formally and separately rescued by captain carton before anybody else  the end of mr pordage to bring to an end all i know about him was that he got great compliments at home for his conduct on these trying occasions and that he died of yellow jaundice a governor and a kcb  sergeant drooce had fallen from a high fever into a low one  tom packerthe only man who could have pulled the sergeant through itkept hospital aboard the old raft and mrs belltott as brisk as ever again but the spirit of that little woman when things tried it was not equal to appearances was headnurse under his directions  before we got down to the mosquito coast the joke had been made by one of our men that we should see her gazetted mrs tom packer vice belltott exchanged  when we reached the coast we got native boats as substitutes for the rafts and we rowed along under the land and in that beautiful climate and upon that beautiful water the blooming days were like enchantment ah  they were running away faster than any sea or river and there was no tide to bring them back  we were coming very near the settlement where the people of silverstore were to be left and from which we marines were under orders to return to belize  captain carton had in the boat by him a curious longbarrelled spanish gun and he had said to miss maryon one day that it was the best of guns and had turned his head to me and said  gill davis load her fresh with a couple of slugs against a chance of showing how good she is  so i had discharged the gun over the sea and had loaded her according to orders and there it had lain at the captains feet convenient to the captains hand  the last day but one of our journey was an uncommonly hot day  we started very early but there was no cool air on the sea as the day got on and by noon the heat was really hard to bear considering that there were women and children to bear it  now we happened to open just at that time a very pleasant little cove or bay where there was a deep shade from a great growth of trees  now the captain therefore made the signal to the other boats to follow him in and lie by a while  the men who were off duty went ashore and lay down but were ordered for cautions sake not to stray and to keep within view  the others rested on their oars and dozed  awnings had been made of one thing and another in all the boats and the passengers found it cooler to be under them in the shade when there was room enough than to be in the thick woods  so the passengers were all afloat and mostly sleeping  i kept my post behind miss maryon and she was on captain cartons right in the boat and mrs fisher sat on her right again  the captain had mrs fishers daughter on his knee  he and the two ladies were talking about the pirates and were talking softly partly because people do talk softly under such indolent circumstances and partly because the little girl had gone off asleep  i think i have before given it out for my lady to write down that captain carton had a fine bright eye of his own  all at once he darted me a side look as much as to say steadydont take oni see somethingand gave the child into her mothers arms  that eye of his was so easy to understand that i obeyed it by not so much as looking either to the right or to the left out of a corner of my own or changing my attitude the least trifle  the captain went on talking in the same mild and easy way but beganwith his arms resting across his knees and his head a little hanging forward as if the heat were rather too much for himbegan to play with the spanish gun  they had laid their plans you see says the captain taking up the spanish gun across his knees and looking lazily at the inlaying on the stock with a great deal of art and the corrupt or blundering local authorities were so easily deceived he ran his left hand idly along the barrel but i saw with my breath held that he covered the action of cocking the gun with his rightso easily deceived that they summoned us out to come into the trap  but my intention as to future operations in a flash the spanish gun was at his bright eye and he fired  all started up innumerable echoes repeated the sound of the discharge a cloud of brightcoloured birds flew out of the woods screaming a handful of leaves were scattered in the place where the shot had struck a crackling of branches was heard and some lithe but heavy creature sprang into the air and fell forward head down over the muddy bank  what is it cries captain maryon from his boat  all silent then but the echoes rolling away  it is a traitor and a spy said captain carton handing me the gun to load again  and i think the other name of the animal is christian george king  shot through the heart  some of the people ran round to the spot and drew him out with the slime and wet trickling down his face but his face itself would never stir any more to the end of time  leave him hanging to that tree cried captain carton his boats crew giving way and he leaping ashore  but first into this wood every man in his place  and boats  out of gunshot  it was a quick change well meant and well made though it ended in disappointment  no pirates were there no one but the spy was found  it was supposed that the pirates unable to retake us and expecting a great attack upon them to be the consequence of our escape had made from the ruins in the forest taken to their ship along with the treasure and left the spy to pick up what intelligence he could  in the evening we went away and he was left hanging to the tree all alone with the red sun making a kind of a dead sunset on his black face  next day we gained the settlement on the mosquito coast for which we were bound  having stayed there to refresh seven days and having been much commended and highly spoken of and finely entertained we marines stood under orders to march from the towngate it was neither much of a town nor much of a gate at five in the morning  my officer had joined us before then  when we turned out at the gate all the people were there in the front of them all those who had been our fellowprisoners and all the seamen  davis says lieutenant linderwood  stand out my friend  i stood out from the ranks and miss maryon and captain carton came up to me  dear davis says miss maryon while the tears fell fast down her face your grateful friends in most unwillingly taking leave of you ask the favour that while you bear away with you their affectionate remembrance which nothing can ever impair you will also take this purse of moneyfar more valuable to you we all know for the deep attachment and thankfulness with which it is offered than for its own contents though we hope those may prove useful to you too in after life  i got out in answer that i thankfully accepted the attachment and affection but not the money  captain carton looked at me very attentively and stepped back and moved away  i made him my bow as he stepped back to thank him for being so delicate  no miss said i i think it would break my heart to accept of money but if you could condescend to give to a man so ignorant and common as myself any little thing you have wornsuch as a bit of ribbon  she took a ring from her finger and put it in my hand  and she rested her hand in mine while she said these words  the brave gentlemen of oldbut not one of them was braver or had a nobler nature than youtook such gifts from ladies and did all their good actions for the givers sakes  if you will do yours for mine i shall think with pride that i continue to have some share in the life of a gallant and generous man  for the second time in my life she kissed my hand  i made so bold for the first time as to kiss hers and i tied the ring at my breast and i fell back to my place  then the horselitter went out at the gate with sergeant drooce in it and the horselitter went out at the gate with mrs belltott in it and lieutenant linderwood gave the word of command quick march and cheered and cried for we went out of the gate too marching along the level plain towards the serene blue sky as if we were marching straight to heaven  when i have added here that the pirate scheme was blown to shivers by the pirateship which had the treasure on board being so vigorously attacked by one of his majestys cruisers among the west india keys and being so swiftly boarded and carried that nobody suspected anything about the scheme until threefourths of the pirates were killed and the other fourth were in irons and the treasure was recovered i come to the last singular confession i have got to make  it is this  i well knew what an immense and hopeless distance there was between me and miss maryon i well knew that i was no fitter company for her than i was for the angels i well knew that she was as high above my reach as the sky over my head and yet i loved her  what put it in my low heart to be so daring or whether such a thing ever happened before or since as that a man so uninstructed and obscure as myself got his unhappy thoughts lifted up to such a height while knowing very well how presumptuous and impossible to be realised they were i am unable to say still the suffering to me was just as great as if i had been a gentleman  i suffered agonyagony  i suffered hard and i suffered long  i thought of her last words to me however and i never disgraced them  if it had not been for those dear words i think i should have lost myself in despair and recklessness  the ring will be found lying on my heart of course and will be laid with me wherever i am laid  i am getting on in years now though i am able and hearty  i was recommended for promotion and everything was done to reward me that could be done but my total want of all learning stood in my way and i found myself so completely out of the road to it that i could not conquer any learning though i tried  i was long in the service and i respected it and was respected in it and the service is dear to me at this present hour  at this present hour when i give this out to my lady to be written down all my old pain has softened away and i am as happy as a man can be at this present fine old countryhouse of admiral sir george carton baronet  it was my lady carton who herself sought me out over a great many miles of the wide world and found me in hospital wounded and brought me here  it is my lady carton who writes down my words  my lady was miss maryon  and now that i conclude what i had to tell i see my ladys honoured gray hair droop over her face as she leans a little lower at her desk and i fervently thank her for being so tender as i see she is towards the past pain and trouble of her poor old faithful humble soldier     footnotes   1   dickens didnt write the second chapter and it is omitted in this edition  in it the prisoners are firstly made a ransom of for the treasure left on the island and then manage to escape from the pirates
