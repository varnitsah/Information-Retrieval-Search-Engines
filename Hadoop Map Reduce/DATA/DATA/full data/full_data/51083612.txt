boys series for young americans  as mentioned in several of the other volumes of the first series this line was started a number of years ago with the publication of the rover boys at school in which my readers were introduced to dick tom and sam rover three wideawake american lads in that volume and in those which followed i gave the particulars of their adventures while attending putnam hall military academy brill college and while on numerous outings both in our own country and abroad  the rover boys were of course growing older and having met three young ladies very much to their liking each married and settled down as related in detail in the several volumes immediately preceding this they were well established in business and in due course of time dick rover was blessed with a son as was also sam while the funloving tom became the proud possessor of a pair of twins who were as full of life as their father had ever been  in this volume the younger rover boys are old enough to go to boarding school they are sent to colby hall military academy presided over by an old friend and schoolmate of their fathers and there they make both friends and enemies and have numerous adventures  in the beginning this chronicle of the younger rovers i wish to thank my numerous readers for all the kind things they have said about the other volumes in these series and i trust that they will make just as good friends of jack andy and randy and fred as they did of dick tom and sam rover  affectionately and sincerely yours  edward stratemeyer     contents

the newspaper he was reading and leaped to his feet  sounds to me as if there was a battle royal going on returned his younger brother sam who was at a desk in the library of the old farmhouse writing a letter  its those boys exclaimed tom rover as he tossed aside a copy of a comic paper which he had been looking over ill wager theyre up to some mischief again  well if they are your boys tom you mustnt find fault with them answered sam rover with a twinkle in his eye if ever there were chips of the old block your twins are it with a capital i  humph snorted tom rover i dont think andy and randy are much ahead of your fred when it comes to playing tricks and i think dicks jack can hold up his end too  never mind about that just now broke in dick rover hastily lets go out and see what those kids are up to  all right but dont be too severe with em pleaded tom rover remember boys will be boys  thats true tom but weve got to take em in hand sooner or later remonstrated his brother sam if we dont theyll grow up the wildest bunch ever known  a number of cries of alarm and protest mingled with fierce cheering had reached the house from the garden just beyond the broad veranda as the three rover brothers hurried through the hallway and outside the yelling and cheering were renewed then just as tom rover stepped out on the veranda there was a sudden swish and a stream of water from a garden hose caught him directly in the left ear  hi hi stop that cried tom rover doing his best to dodge the stream of water which suddenly seemed to play all over the piazza what do you mean by wetting me this way  it wasnt my fault dad came from a boy standing on the lawn both hands clutching a rubber hose held also by another boy of about the same age it was fred who turned the hose that way  nothing of the sort it was randy twisted it that way trying to get it away from me cried fred rover and he isnt going to do it and thereupon ensued a struggle between the two boys which caused the stream of water to fly over the garden first in one direction and then another  in the meanwhile not far away another stream of water was issuing from a hose held by two other lads this as well as the water from hose number one had been directed towards the back of the garden where an elderly white man and an equally elderly colored man were trying to shelter themselves behind a low hedge to keep from becoming drenched  fo de lans sake massa dick wont you make dem boys stop cried out the old colored man when he caught sight of dick rover hurrying out on the lawn dem boys is jest nacherly tryin to drown old aleck pop dats what dey is  they didnt have no call to touch them hoses came from the elderly white man i tol em they mustnt muss with the water but they wont mind nohow and thus speaking old jack ness held up his hands in comic despair  why we didnt know you were behind the hedge came from one of the boys holding the second hose we thought you were both down at the barn  you cant make believe like that andy rover returned the old man of all work shaking his head vigorously you knowed i was goin to trim up this hedge a bit and that aleck was goin to help me  you boys let up with this nonsense came sternly from tom rover he turned to face one of his twins randy i ought to give you a thrashing for wetting me like this  dont fred get half the thrashing questioned randy rover quizzically for he could readily see that his parent was not as angry as his words seemed to imply i dont like to be selfish you know he can have more than his share if he wants it  youll take your own thrashingsi dont want em broke in his cousin fred quickly  jack cried dick rover turning to his son turn that water off at once  i dont know where to turn it off i didnt turn it on answered jack rover the oldest of the four boys who had been fooling  ill turn it off and fix it so they cant turn it on agin came from old jack ness and away hobbled the man of all work  i think its a shame for you boys to drench old ness and aleck was sam rovers sober comment both of them might catch cold or get rheumatism  we didnt start to do anything like that dad answered fred rover we were going to have a little fight between ourselves playing rival firemen we aimed the water at the hedge and we didnt see ness and aleck until they let out a yell  but i saw two of you playing the water in that direction cried dick rover you were one of them jack  oh well dad what was the harm after they were all wet pleaded his son theyd have to change their clothing anyway  thats just it added andy rover quickly with his eyes twinkling from merriment a little more water wont hurt a person when hes already soaked its just like spoiling a rotten eggit cant be done and at this reply both dick rover and his brother the funloving tom had to turn away their faces to hide their amusement nevertheless dick sobered his face almost instantly as he answered  well these pranks around the farm have got to stop youll have your grandfather and uncle randolph and aunt martha all upset not to say anything about your sisters and your mothers its a fortunate thing that they went down to the town to do some shopping otherwise i think all of you would be in for quite some punishment  oh then youre not going to punish us are you broke in randy rover quickly thats fine i knew you wouldnt mind our having a little fun  dont be so fast young man returned his father your uncle dick may be too lenient i am rather of the opinion that you and your brother if not your cousins have got to be taken in hand  oh please massa tom don go fo to punish em burst out old aleck pop ii dont spose dey meant any great ham even do dey did trow dat stream of wattah right in dis yere coons mouf and he smiled broadly showing a row of ivories rather the worse for wear  i think all of you boys had better go into the house and get some dry clothing on before your mothers put in an appearance suggested dick rover if they see you like this all dripping wet theyll certainly be worried  all right dad ill do it answered jack quickly and then he motioned to his cousins come on lets see how fast we can make the change and off into the big farmhouse rushed the boys clattering up the back stairs one after the other to the two big rooms which they occupied  some boys was sam rovers comment as he shook his head doubtfully  they are certainly growing olderand wilder returned dick rover  weve got to take them in handthat is dead certain said tom rover with conviction why if i dont do something with andy and randy pretty soon theyll be asas  as bad as you were tom at their age finished dick rover with a smile  now youve said something dick affirmed sam rover andy isnt quite so bad when it comes to playing tricks although he certainly says some awfully funny things but when it comes to doing things randy continually puts me in mind of tom  oh say to hear you fellows talk youd think that i was the worst boy that ever lived grumbled tom rover what did i ever do to raise such a rumpus as this  phew what did he ever do to raise such a rumpus as this mocked sam rover well what didnt he do when father went to africa and disappeared and we came down here to good old valley brook farm wasnt he the constant torment of uncle randolph and aunt martha and the hired girl and all the rest of the community until in sheer despair uncle had to send us off to putnam hall and when we went to the hall who was the first one to get into troubleexploding a giant firecracker on the campus answer me that will you  ancient history murmured tom rover dryly but then of a sudden his eyes began to twinkle no use talking though we certainly did have some good times in those days didnt we he continued do you remember how we got the best of old josiah crabtree  yes and how we got the best of a whole lot of our enemies added sam rover  yes and what gloriously good times we did have at putnam hall and at brill college came from dick rover with a sigh sometimes i wish all those happy days could be lived over again  when you think of those days dick just think of what great times are in store for our boys said sam i only trust they have as good times as we had  i guess theyll know how to take care of themselves all right enough was tom rovers comment but just the same we cant permit them to become too wild sending them to that private school in new york city doesnt seem to have done them so very much good although of course i admit they are well educated for their age  i know where im going to send jack when the proper time comes answered dick rover  where came from his brothers  im going to send him to colby hall the military academy which our old school chum larry colby has opened larry sent me some of his literature some time ago and i have heard from several people that its already a firstclass institution of learningevery bit as good as putnam hall  well if its half as good as dear old putnam hall it must be some school said tom rover and theres no reason why larry colby shouldnt be able to run a firstclass military academy he was a good scholar and a firstclass cadet when he was at putnam hall  after larry left putnam hall he went to travel in europe continued dick then he went through college and immediately after that he joined the militia of new york state and there worked his way up until he now sports the title of colonel  colonel colby eh thats going some was toms comment  his school is patterned after west point as was putnam hall and i understand he has a west point officer there to instruct the cadets in military tactics  well thats the sort of school our boys will need answered tom rover the stricter it is the better it will be for them  i think it would be a good scheme to send them to larry colbys school was sams comment as larry knows us so well he would probably take an especial interest in our boys  yes but i wouldnt want him to show our lads any special favors broke in tom quickly if the boys went there i should want them to stand on their own feet just as we did when we went to putnam hall  thats the talk tom no favoritism cried dick the only way to make a boy thoroughly selfreliant is to make him take his own part  if we are going to send them off to boarding school they might as well go this fall as any other time remarked sam rover have you any idea when the term at colby hall begins dick  about the middle of september  its the middle of august now that would give us a full month in which to make arrangements and for them in which to get ready  have you ever said anything to the twins about going to boarding school tom questioned sam  oh yes they understand that they are to go to some place sooner or later fred understands it too doesnt he  yes  and i told jack only a short while ago that he must get ready to think of leaving home put in dick rover of course it will be rather hard on the boys at first they have never been away from us at all except the two weeks when they were out in that boys camp  theyll have to get used to it just as we got used to it when father went off to africa and uncle randy sent us to putnam hall perhaps we had better tell them  sam rover broke off short as a series of shrieks in a highpitched feminine voice issued from the pantry of the big farmhouse an instant later a hired girl followed by a middleaged cook came flying forth from the kitchen doorway  oh save me save me cried the hired girl clutching her skirts tightly around her ankles save me  oh mr rover mr rover its those dreadful boys i wont stay here another minute screamed the cook flourishing a big spoon in one hand and a dishcloth in the other its outrageous thats what it is im going to pack my trunk and leave this house right away  whats the matter demanded tom rover quickly  are you hurt came anxiously from dick  what have the boys done now questioned sam  what have they done wailed the hired girl i just went into the pantry and opened the closet door and out jumped about a thousand mice at me  yes and they are running all over the house broke in the cook savagely one of em ran right over my foot and tried to bite me im going to pack my trunk and leave i wont stay here another minute     chapter ii  something of the past   at the announcement of the hired girl that their sons had let loose in the farmhouse a thousand micemore or lessthe three rover brothers looked at each other enquiringly  another jokeand so soon gasped sam rover  that certainly is the limit broke out dick rover as he started for the house  if i find andy and randy have been up to another trick right on top of this waterhose nonsense ill give them a tanning they wont forget in a hurry added tom rover and then he and sam followed dick up the back porch and into the kitchen  to the readers of the former volumes in these two rover boys series dick tom and sam rover will need no special introduction for the benefit of others however let me state that the soberminded and determined dick was the oldest of the three with the funloving tom coming next and sturdy sam being the youngest they were the sons of one anderson rover who when not traveling made his home at valley brook farm in new york state living there with his brother randolph rover and wife martha  while dick tom and sam were quite young and while their father was off exploring in the interior of africa the three rovers had been sent to putnam hall military academy where they had made a few enemies and likewise a host of friends including a manly and straightforward cadet named lawrence colby after many adventures both at school and in various portions of the globe they had graduated from putnam hall with honor and then entered brill college  at that time mr anderson rover who had long since returned from africa was not in the best of health he had numerous business interests both in wall street new york city and in the west to take care of and presently it was found necessary that dick leave college and take charge of business matters for his parent in this task dick was soon aided by tom leaving sam the only member of the family to graduate from brill  while at putnam hall the three rovers had become acquainted with three charming girls dora stanhope and her cousins nellie and grace laning this acquaintance had ripened into loving intimacy and when dick went into business he took dora stanhope for his lifelong partner a little later tom was married to nellie laning and after he had left brill and joined his brothers in conducting their fathers various business enterprises sam married grace laning  with the aid of mr anderson rover and some others the rover company was organized with offices on wall street new york city the company dealt in stocks bonds real estate and other investments and dick was now president with tom secretary and sam treasurer the company had been prosperous from the start although on several occasions enemies had done their best to give the concern a black eye  when they were first married dick and his beautiful wife dora had begun housekeeping in a cosy apartment in the metropolis and they had presently been followed by tom and sam but two years later the three brothers had a chance to buy a beautiful plot of ground on riverside drive facing the noble hudson river and on this they built three fine houses adjoining each other dick living in the middle house with tom on one side and sam on the other  before the happy young folks moved into the new homes dick and dora were blessed with a little son who later on was named john after mr john laning later still this couple had a daughter whom they named martha after aunt martha of valley brook farm little jack as he was called in those days was a wonderfully bright and clever lad with many of the clearminded qualities which had made his father so successful in life  about the time young jack was presented with a baby sister tom and nellie rover came forward with twin boys one of whom was named anderson after his grandfather and the other randolph after his uncle andy and randy as they were always called for short were exceedingly bright each taking after his father andy always saying things that were more or less funny and randy playing tricks whenever he got the chance they were truly chips off the old block and tom knew it although outwardly he professed to be ignorant of the fact  those twins will be some boys when they grow up was old anderson rovers comment when the lads were less than five years old theyre just as full of fun now as tom ever dared to be  so they are answered his brother randolph my my what will they ever do with them when they get a little older  i shant mind said aunt martha her eyes beaming brightly that is if they are really and truly as goodhearted as tom has always been he certainly was the worst of the lot when it came to playing jokes but no lad ever had a better heart than tomnot one  about the time that tom began to boast about his twins sam and grace came along with a beautiful little girl whom they named mary after mrs laning about a year later the girl was followed by a boy and this sturdy little chap was named fred after sams old school chum fred garrison  living so close together the four boys and the two girls were brought up almost like one big family the girls were all but inseparable and the boys could generally be found together either studying playing or having a good time  when the time came to set the children to studying martha and mary were placed in a private school for girls located but a short distance from their homes it was thought best however at the start to send the boys to a public school and this was done for three years matters went along very well and during that time the rover company prospered far beyond the expectations of those in charge but then andy and randy becoming a little older began to exhibit their talent for playing tricks and usually they were seconded in these efforts by jack and fred once or twice all of the boys were reported by the school principal for this and each time the lads were remonstrated with by their fathers in such a manner that as young andy expressed it it was far more comfortable to sit down standing up than it was any other way  i think ill have to do something with those twins said tom rover to his wife after the boys had been reported for more tricks the school they go to doesnt seem to be strict enough and thereupon he had sent the boys to a private establishment further uptown  jack and fred had begged their parents that they might be allowed to do likewise and at this private school the four cousins had been kept until the close of the spring term the preceding june to the credit of this school it must be said that the boys advanced rapidly in their studies their deportment however was apparently no better than it had been before and as a consequence tom rover was more worried than ever while dick and sam began to wonder secretly whether it would not be advisable to separate their sons from the mischievous twins  one day dick broached this subject to his offspring at once young jack set up a wild remonstrance  oh dad dont take me away from andy and randy and fred he pleaded why we are just like brothers i wouldnt know how to get along without em  but im afraid andy and randy are leading you into bad habits returned dick rover  i dont think so dad anyway ive heard folks say that andy and randy are no worse than their father used to beand you never wanted to be separated from uncle tom did you  at this question dick rovers face took on a sudden sober look no i never wanted to be separated from your uncle thats true he said but i tell you what we did used to do when his pranks got too wild i and your uncle sam used to hold him in  all right then dad ill tell fred about this and well see what we can do towards holding in andy and randy and there after some more talk along the same line the matter was allowed to rest  young jack was as good as his word and during the remainder of that spring term at the private school in new york city andy and randy were as well behaved as could possibly be expected from two redblooded lads  it had been planned by the rovers that the summer should be spent by all the young folks and their mothers at valley brook farm the fathers to come down from time to time and especially over the week ends since dick tom and sam had become married the farm had been enlarged by the purchase of two hundred additional acres the farmhouse too had been made larger with the old portion remodeled and a water system from the rapidlygrowing town of dexters corners as well as electric lighting had been installed a telephone had been put in some years previous  at first after their arrival at their grandfathers home the four boys had been content to take it easy spending their time roaming the fields helping to gather the fruit of which there was great abundance and in going fishing and swimming but then andy and randy had found time growing a little heavy on their hands and one prank had been followed by another some of the tricks had been played on jack and fred and they of course had done their best to retaliate and this had on more than one occasion brought forth a forceful but goodnatured pitched battle and the fathers and the others present had had all they could do to hold the boys in check  i never saw such boys was mary rovers comment to her brother fred why cant you behave yourselves just as martha and i do  oh girls never have any good times answered fred they just sit around and primp up and read and do things like that  indeed and mary tossed her curly head i think we have just as good times as you boys every bit but we dont have to be rough about it and then she ran off to play a game of lawn tennis with her cousin martha  the time was the middle of august and as the summer was proving to be an unusually warm one all the older rovers were glad enough to take it easy on the farm they having earlier in the season been down to the seashore for a couple of weeks dick tom and sam had each taken a week off at various times and all managed to get down to the farm early every saturday afternoon to remain until sunday night or monday morning  and it was late on a saturday afternoon when the ladies and the girls had gone to dexters corners to do some shopping and while the fathers were busy reading and writing that the events occurred with which the present story opens  as dick rover ran into the farmhouse he heard a slight scream coming from the sittingroom the scream was followed by exclamations from two men and then a wild thumping as if someone was hitting the floor with a cane  its a mouseseveral of em came in the voice of grandfather rover  oh my oh my wherever did they come from exclaimed old aunt martha  never mind where they came from ill fix em asserted old randolph rover and then followed another thumping as he rushed around between the chairs and behind the sofa trying to slaughter some of the scampering mice with his heavy walking stick  where are they where are those mice demanded tom rover giving a hasty glance around the kitchen  there is oneunder the sink ejaculated his brother sam and catching up a stove lifter he let fly with such accurate aim that the unhappy rodent was despatched on the spot  i see another one back of the pantry door said tom rover a moment later and then made a dive into the pantry here in a side closet the door of which was partly open he saw a broom and grabbed it quickly then he made a wild pass at the mouse but the rodent eluded him and scrambled over the kitchen floor and into the sittingroom  oh dear oh dear did you ever see so many mice came in a wailing voice from aunt martha she had clambered up on a chair and stood there holding her dress tightly around her feet  its another of those boys tricks thats what it is asserted grandfather rover they ought to be punished for it  yes but weve got to get rid of these mice first answered his brother  then randolph rover seeing a mouse scampering across the side of the room threw his walking stick at it with all his force but his aim was poor and the walking stick striking the edge of the table glanced off and hit a fishglobe smashing it to pieces and sending the water and the goldfish flying in every direction     chapter iii  what followed another trick   when the hubbub downstairs started the four rover boys were up in their adjoining bedrooms partly undressed and in the midst of a couple of impromptu boxing matches one taking place between andy and jack and the other between randy and fred  there my boy how do you like that cried andy as dancing around he managed to land a slapping blow on jacks bare shoulder  fine child fine retorted young jack but not half as good as this he continued and with a sudden spring he landed one blow on andys chest and another on his shoulder which sent toms son staggering halfway across the bed  hurrah one man down now for the next cried fred and managed to land several blows in quick succession on randys shoulder  but then the funloving twin came at him with a rush sending him into a corner and on to a little table containing a number of books as fred went down the table did likewise and the books fell all over him  whoop roared randy in his delight down and buried  but not dead retorted fred promptly and catching up several of the books he hurled them in quick succession at his opponent one in particular caught randy in the stomach and down he sat with a suddenness that jarred the floor  say exclaimed jack suddenly and held up his hand this wont do at all the folks downstairs will think were pulling the house down over their ears well have to slow up a bit you know what our fathers said a little while ago  all right returned andy promptly as he arose to his feet after this well be as quiet as a thunder storm in a moving picture drama  thats the talk silence it is cried his twin and then to let off a little extra steam he silently turned a cartwheel across the floor after which he proceeded with his toilet making  the boys were still minus their collars and ties when they suddenly realized that something unusual was taking place downstairs they had closed the bedroom doors but now all of them rushed out into the hallway  great watermelons groaned randy and turned slightly pale i forgot all about em  about what chimed in jack  you dont mean the mice demanded andy  yes i do  what mice questioned fred  the mice i caught under the flooring of the old wagon house yesterday answered randy  i thought you put them in a cage and drowned them in the brook  i was going to do that but then i changed my mind and put em in a couple of boxes i thought maybe i might have a chance to train emjust like those mice we once saw in a show  where did you put those boxes demanded andy quickly  iididnt know exactly what to do with em soiiput em on the shelf in the pantry downstairs faltered the twin  great catfish randy youve got us into a fine mess broke in fred  coming right on top of that trouble with the waterhose added jack ruefully  after that there was a moment of silence the four cousins gazing at each other uncertainly then randy drew a long breath  well im going downstairs to see whats doing he declared if ive got to suffer for this i might as well see the fun  im going down too responded his twin and side by side they ran down the stairs with jack and fred close at their heels  perhaps it was poetic justice that randy who had been the cause of this commotion should suffer the worst for it hardly had he put his foot in the lower hallway of the farmhouse when a mouse scampering from a nearby doorway made directly for him the boy made a wild jump to step on the rodent missed his footing and came down flat on his back he landed directly at the foot of the stairs and his brother being unable to stop fell on top of him  hi get off of me gasped the unfortunate youth what do you want to docrack my head open  next time you go down give a fellow warning retorted his brother scrambling to his feet and then the two boys with jack and fred entered the sittingroom doing this just as their fathers came in from the direction of the kitchen and just when old uncle randolph made his unfortunate attack on the fishglobe  hello look at the fish on the floor exclaimed jack whats the matter grandfather did the mice upset the globe  no i did that trying to hit one of the pesky creatures explained old uncle randolph we must kill them some way or theyll get all over the house and then none of us will have any peace  i wouldnt care for a piece of mouse anyway remarked andy but in such a low tone that none of the older folks heard him  everybody get a stick and go at those mice commanded dick rover and looked at the boys so sternly they all began to feel uncomfortable weve got either to kill them or drive them out of the house otherwise the lady folks wont be able to sleep tonight  ill get a poker and kill as many of em as i can cried randy and ran out into the kitchen to do as he had mentioned  the other boys as well as their fathers armed themselves with canes umbrellas and brooms and for the next fifteen minutes there was a rapid and thorough search for all of the rodents several were driven outside through the open doors while others were caught and slaughtered in various parts of the kitchen the pantry and the rooms adjoining then the goldfish were gathered up and put into another bowl of water and the bits of broken glass were removed  im awfully sorry uncle randy you broke the fishglobe said randy contritely but im glad you saved the fish  look here young man i want to talk to youand to you too cried tom sharply and without more ado caught each twin by the arm and marched them into the library  wow im afraid andy and randy are in for it now whispered fred to jack  well randy certainly had no right to put those mice in the pantry answered his cousin just the same i hope uncle tom isnt too severe with em  i dont see why andy should be punished for this  oh they always stick together you know that as well as i do  so i do isnt it wonderful how each is willing to share the blame with the other added fred with deep admiration  once in the library tom rover shut the doors tightly and then faced his twin sons  now then i want the truth about this he commenced sternly where did those mice come from  they came from under the flooring of the old wagon house answered randy i caught them there when the carpenters tore up the floor to put down the new one  and where did you put them  i put em in aera couple of boxes  randy was going to keep the mice and try to teach em to do tricks just the same as those mice we once saw in a vaudeville show put in andy quickly to do what he could to shield his brother  more tricks eh was toms dry comment it seems to me that it is nothing but tricks lately i suppose you placed the boxes in the pantry just so the mice wouldnt catch cold didnt you he went on quizzically  no sir iiplaced em there just for safekeeping was the hesitating answer i didnt know that lulu would disturb them  thats it dad im sure randy didnt want em disturbed  and what did you have to do with this andy demanded the father  at this the boy addressed had nothing to say  he had nothing to do with it dad answered randy i got the mice and put em in the two boxes i spose it wasnt just the right thing to put em in the pantry but i give you my word i didnt think theyd be upset the way they were and be sent running all over the house if lulu hadnt touched the boxes the mice would be there yet  perhaps answered tom rover dryly just the same i think you placed the boxes there hoping that lulu or the cook would have curiosity enough to see what they contained as it is your actions have upset the whole house brought on the destruction of the fishglobe and the cook is so upset that she has threatened to leave  oh she wont leave dad she likes her big wages too well remarked andy quickly  i dont know about that son nobody is going to stand for your tricks much longer they are getting altogether too numerous tom continued to look as stern as possible ive got to take both of you in hand and that is all there is to it you are growing wilder every day something has got to be done now you go right upstairs and finish dressing and dont dare to let me hear of any more tricks being played for the rest of this day otherwise ill not only give you a sound thrashing but ill cut off your spending money and do several other things that you wont like and thus speaking the father of the twins opened the door to the hall and shoved them both out towards the stairs with more force than they had felt for some time the two lads lost no time in retiring to their bedroom  say randy i think you got off rather easily remarked andy when they were alone  i think so myself was the quick response i thought dad would be so mad that he would give me one everlasting licking  say how did you make out questioned fred eagerly as he came sneaking in followed by jack  you dont look as if you had suffered very much was jacks comment i thought youd come out looking as if youd been through a threshing machine  what randy and andy had to tell was quickly related at the conclusion jack who being somewhat older than any of the others was looked upon as something of a leader shook his head thoughtfully  i guess we had better pull in our horns a little for a while at least was his conclusion my father was mighty mad too and so was freds if we dont look out well all get in wrong they didnt like that wetting business to start with  while the boys were finishing their toilet and discussing the matter their fathers were doing what they could to set matters to rights downstairs and to pacify their aunt martha and also the cook and the hired girl the cook was particularly wrought up  it aint the first time nor the second time nor the third time that them boys have played tricks on us she declared its been nothin but one thing or nother ever since they came hereand last summer it was the same way the first thing you know theyll be doin somethin awful and some of usll get hurt i think i had better leave  if she leaves ill leave too declared the hired girl  dont think of leaving said tom rover ill take those boys in hand and see to it that they dont bother you any more if they do the least thing ill pack them back to our house in new york and after a little more talk he succeeded in mollifying the cook and the hired girl to such an extent that they went back to their work then the fathers of the boys withdrew once more to the library  i dont know how you feel about it began tom after he had picked up his comic paper once more and then thrown it aside in disgust i begin to think that the best thing i can do is to pack those twins off to colby hall  i dont know but what i agree with you tom answered sam and if you do send them i think fred might as well go along  yes and jack also added dick those boys will never want to be separated and i dont know that we could do better than to place them under larry colbys care especially if we let larry know just how wild they are apt to be and tell him to take them in hand  yes id want larry to know all about them answered tom and id want him to give me his word that hed keep a sharp eye on andy and randy and punish them severely every time they broke any of the rules its the only way to bring them up properly  all right then tom if you think that way and dick thinks the same lets get right down to business and send a letter to larry colby tonight said sam  but what of the boys mothers questioned dick rover he knew that his wife dora would grieve considerably over having young jack leave home  well have to explain the situation to them and get them to agree answered tom firmly     chapter iv  jack in wall street   just to think jack a week from today well be on our way to colby hall military academy  yes fred doesnt it seem wonderful i do hope well find the school to our liking returned jack with a serious look on his face it would be too bad to go to some punk school  oh you can be sure that the school is all right otherwise our fathers wouldnt have picked it out for us broke in andy they know what a good military academy is didnt they go to that famous old putnam hall  i wish we could have gone to putnam hall added randy from what dad has told me it must have been one dandy school  well we cant go to something that aint answered his twin with a grin putnam hall doesnt exist any more when it burnt to the ground captain putnam felt too old to have it rebuilt and so he settled with the insurance companies and retired  gee but wont we have dandy times if that school is what we hope for cried andy well make things hum wont we  right you are came in a chorus from the others and then in sudden high spirits the boys began to wrestle with each other ending up with something of a pillow fight in which not only pillows but also bolsters and numerous other articles were used as missiles  after a nevertobeforgotten vacation at valley brook farm the boys along with their sisters and their parents had returned to their homes in new york city the summer was almost at an end and schools all over were opening for the fall and winter term  it had been no easy task for dick tom and sam rover to convince their wives that it would be best to send the boys to some strict boarding school instead of to the private school which they had been attending in the metropolis gentle dora rover had cried a little at the thought of having her only son jack leave home and grace rover had been affected the same way at the thought of parting from her only boy fred  but both of you will be better off than i shall be had been nellie rovers comment each of you will have a daughter still at home while both of my twins will be gone and ill have nobody and her eyes too had filled with tears  but with it all the mothers were sensible women and they agreed with their husbands that the boys needed to be placed under strict discipline and that this was not possible at the school which they had been attending  that school is altogether too fashionable had been dick rovers comment they make regular dudes of the pupils and they think more of high collars and neckties and patentleather shoes than they do of reading writing and arithmetic now i want jack to get a good education and i want him to learn how to behave himself while he is getting it and so after several communications had passed between the rovers and colonel lawrence colby it was settled that the boys should be enlisted as cadets at colby hall  cease firing cried jack when there came a lull in the pillow fight the first thing you know somebody will come in here and well be in hot water again the boys were up in jacks bedroom and all of their mothers were downstairs talking over the question of the wardrobes the lads were to take along to school  all right commodore answered andy gaily out of the trenches boys the war is over  suits me panted randy who was all out of wind from his exertions melt the cannons into telephones and send messages to the girls that the soldier boys are coming home and at this remark there was a short laugh then all the boys proceeded to make themselves comfortable in various attitudes around the bedroom  say im glad of one thing remarked fred and that is we wont be utter strangers at colby hall spouter powell will be there and so will gif garrison  it may be as well to explain here that spouter powell whose real first name was richard was the son of the rovers old friend john powell commonly called songbird richard powell did not seem to have much of his fathers ability to write verse but he did have a great fondness for making speeches whence had come his nickname of spouter  gifford garrison always called gif for short was the son of the rovers old schoolmate fred garrison after whom fred rover had been named gif was a big strong youth who doted on athletic sports of all kinds both gif and spouter had visited the rover boys on a number of occasions and consequently all of the lads were well acquainted  yes ill be glad to meet gif and spouter returned jack i like them both even though spouter gets pretty talky sometimes  just then there sounded downstairs a postmans whistle and a minute later martha rover came upstairs  heres a letter for you jack said his sister holding it out  thanks he returned as he took the communication and glanced at it why what do you know about this here we were just talking about gif and spouter and here is a letter from gif now he cried  wonder what hes got to say remarked fred and then as he saw his cousin lingering at the doorway he added dont you want to come in martha and join us  no thank you she returned im going out with mary were going to buy some things for you boys to take along when you go to that boarding school  oh i know what those will be burst out andy gaily pink neckties with yellow dots or nice red socks with blue rings around em  oh the idea burst out the girl what an eye for color you have  well maybe it was blue socks with red rings around em went on andy innocently and maybe the pink neckties will be plain yellow  oh cousin andy i think youre just the worst ever shrieked martha and then ran downstairs to join those below  in the meantime jack had torn open the letter and was scanning it hastily  dont be selfish burst out fred curiously if gif has anything to say about that school let us hear it  sure ill read it out loud answered his cousin  the communication which was a rather long one was of the usual boyish type and much of it was of no particular interest several paragraphs however may be quoted here                                                 you will be interested to know that besides spouter powell there will be another boy here who may or may not join our set the fellows name is walter baxter and he is the son of dan baxter the man who years ago caused your father and your uncles so much trouble at putnam hall and other places baxter is very hottempered and willing to fight almost any time  when i get back to school i am going in for athletics particularly football this fall and i hope some of you fellows will want to go into athletics too for it will make it more interesting to have some friends on the eleven spouter dont go in for that sort of thing he likes to save his wind for talk                                                 hum thats rather interesting was randys comment i wonder if this walt baxter will try to make trouble for us like his father did for our fathers  well if he does i guess we can take care of him just as our folks took care of his father returned his twin  no use borrowing trouble came from fred ive heard from my dad that mr dan baxter has reformed and is now a firstclass business man and is quite prosperous it may be that while his son walt is somewhat hottempered he may still be a thoroughly good fellow i wouldnt give a rap for a boy that didnt show some spirit once in a while  on the following morning jack was on the point of going over to freds house to return some books he had borrowed when his father called to him  i want you to go down to our offices with me this morning jack said dick rover ive got a package there that i meant to bring up for your mother you can come right back with it  all right dad ill be with you in a minute answered the son and ran off to deliver the books and to let fred as well as randy and andy know where he was going  jacks temperament was a good deal like that of his father and young as he was he already took an interest in what was being done in the offices of the rover company on more than one occasion he had begged his parents permission to visit the place on wall street and once had been granted a lookin at the stock exchange during one of its busiest sessions that sight was one he had never forgotten  when the rovers had first opened up in wall street they had taken possession of a set of rather shabby offices formerly occupied by another firm with which they had had various difficulties the particulars of which were related in the rover boys in new york and the rover boys in business now however they occupied the entire fourth floor of another building in a much better location there was a large general office and a counting room and a private office for each of the three brothers their office help numbered about twenty and when business was brisk the place consequently was a decidedly busy one  when the offices of the rover company were reached dick rover brought out the package intended for his wife it was quite a bundle and not wrapped as well as it might have been  youd better let the office boy put an extra string around that jack said the father  oh thats all right dad i can get it home just as it is there wont be much of a crowd on the subway train going uptown this time of day  jack spent a few minutes in the offices speaking to the office boy and to several of the clerks with whom he was acquainted and then started off for home the bundle under his arm he came down by one of the several elevators to the lower corridor of the building and there stood in the wideopen doorway contemplating the bustle in the narrow street beyond wall street is the financial heart of our nation and the activity there during business hours is something tremendous  as jack stood with his bundle under his arm his attention was suddenly attracted to what was going on close by beyond several columns which formed a part of the entrance to the building in a niche of the wall stood a peddler a short sallowfaced and holloweyed man evidently of foreign birth trying to sell some cheap wares displayed on a little threelegged stand which he had set up in front of the peddler stood a tall slim overbearing boy loudly dressed and wearing lightcolored spats and gloves to match  youve got no right to plank yourself here cried the overbearing boy savagely you get out of here or ill dump that trash of yours into the street  please mister i am a poor man pleaded the peddler in very broken english please mister you buy sometin  you get out i tell you went on the tall youth with a very lordly air get out i tell you you foreigners are all thieves get out of here and without further warning he caught the thin little peddler by the shoulder and gave him such a shove that the man had all he could do to keep from falling and from upsetting his little stock in trade     chapter v  getting ready to leave   the mean fellow  such was jacks exclamation as he witnessed the scene between the holloweyed little street peddler and the dudish overbearing youth who had attacked him  get out i tell you repeated the overbearing boy as the peddler straightened up and caught hold of his little stand to keep it from tumbling over ive a big mind to kick your stuff into the street for you  let up there you big boob cried jack and without stopping to think twice he leaped towards the other youth and caught him firmly by the arm  the boy who had attacked the peddler had not expected such interference and he whirled around greatly surprised especially when he saw a boy smaller than himself confronting him  whatwhat do you mean by catching hold of me this way he stammered  why cant you leave that poor peddler alone retorted jack  what business is this of yours  that chap wasnt doing any harm here so far as i can see hes only trying to earn his living  see here kid this is none of your affair and i want you to keep out of it stormed the dudishlooking youth we dont allow those fellows around this building  then you tell him to move on in a decent kind of way returned jack  ill do as i please the big boy turned again towards the peddler and made a motion as if to push both the man and his stand down but instantly jack caught hold of him again and pulled him back shoving him in between two pillars of the buildings entrance  you had better go on said jack to the peddler and evidently much frightened by what was occurring the little man took up his stand and disappeared as if by magic in the crowd on the street  say youve got gall to interfere with me burst out the big youth glaring at jack ill teach you a lesson and with a sudden move he pulled jacks bundle from under his arm and threw it out into the street now you go about your business and dont you interfere with me again  to have the bundle belonging to his mother treated in that fashion made the young rovers blood boil he jumped at the big youth and as the other aimed a blow at him he dodged and then caught his opponent by the ear  ouch let go screamed the big youth in sudden pain and then he landed a blow on jacks shoulder and received a crack on the chin in return  how far this encounter might have gone it is hard to say but at that moment while a crowd was beginning to gather there came a sudden interruption in the appearance of jacks uncle tom followed by his uncle sam  hello what does this mean demanded tom rover as he stepped between the two boys  it means that ive got an account to settle with that young snip mr rover cried the big youth savagely and giving jack a look full of hatred  uncle tom that fellow is nothing but a brute declared jack  a brute what do you mean  he just attacked a poor little peddler who was trying to sell a few things from a stand here in the corner he tried to knock the peddler down and upset his stand i told him to stop and then he attacked me  humph are you this boys uncle mr rover asked the big youth in surprise  i am martell  then i want to tell you that he has no right to interfere with me went on napoleon martell uglily those peddlers are always hanging around here and my opinion is they are all thieves  that fellow was no more a thief than you are broke in jack sturdily  ha do you mean to call me a thief  come jack such talk wont do down here in wall street remonstrated his uncle sam who had listened closely to what had been said sam rover from a distance had seen the bundle flung into the gutter and had picked it up both the wrapping and the string were broken but the contents of the package seemed to be uninjured  if that kid is your nephew you had better take him in hand grumbled napoleon martell and then not wishing to have any more words with the two older rovers he broke through the crowd which had gathered and hurried up the street  come into the building ordered tom rover to jack for the crowd was getting denser every instant boys and men who had been hurrying by stopped to find out what was the matter  i guess ill have to go back to get that bundle tied up again answered jack the encounter had excited him not a little uncle tom that fellow seemed to know you  yes i know that boy his name is napoleon martell although they call him nappy for short he is the son of nelson martell one of our rivals in business a man who occupies the floor above us in this building  i didnt know nappy was much of a scrapper was sam rovers comment i thought he was too much of a dude to fight  he certainly is a dude as far as appearances go answered jack but he has the manner of a brute i wish now id had the chance to give him a good licking he went on heartily  you had better go slow when it comes to fighting returned his uncle a fight seldom settles anything  didnt you ever have any fights uncle sam  at this direct question sam rovers face became a study while his brother tom looked at him rather quizzically  yes i had my share of fights when i was a boy admitted the uncle but looking back i think a good many of them might have been avoided of course i expect a boy to take his own part and not be a coward but a fight isnt always the best way to settle a difficulty  once back in the offices jack did not hesitate to tell his father about what had happened in the meantime an office boy rewrapped the bundle securing it this time with a stout cord  i am sorry to hear about this trouble jack said his father seriously i dont want you to grow up into a scrapper  but dad i couldnt stand by and see that fellow abuse a poor little peddler like that answered the son it wasnt fair at all what right had that nappy martell to order the man away  no right that i know of jack except that mr martell owns some stock in the company that owns this building but that would be a very farfetched right at the best  i guess those martells are all tarred from the same stick was tom rovers comment the father is just as overbearing as the son  do you know what im inclined to think remarked sam rover as he walked over and closed the door to the outer office so that the clerks might not hear what was said im inclined to think that nelson martell is a good deal of a crook  and thats just my idea of the man too added tom rover what do you think dick  at this direct question the oldest of the three brothers pursed up his lips in concentrated thought  to tell the truth i dont know exactly what to think he answered slowly some of the things that nelson martell is trying to put through are certainly rather shady still they may be within the strict letter of the law and if that is so it would hardly be fair to call the man a crook  when jack returned home he of course told his cousins of his encounter at the entrance to the office building  its a pity you didnt have a chance to give martell one in the eye or in the nose was randys comment such a brute deserves to be hauled down a peg or two  well i rather think i gave his ear a pretty good twist answered jack grinning  you ought to have made him pick up that bundle he flung into the gutter added fred  i couldnt do much of anything with the crowd gathering around my how the people do flock together when the least thing happens if we had stayed there another minute or two we might have had a thousand people around us  with so many things to be thought of and done previous to the departure for colby hall the subject of nappy martell was soon dismissed all the boys were wondering what they had better put in their trunks and suitcases  gee ive got enough stuff planned out to fill five trunks declared randy i want to take all my clothing and my fishing outfit and my football and baseball togs and my gym suit and id like to take along my dumbbells and my physical culture exerciser and maybe a shotgun and that favorite paddle of mine and  and about five thousand other things finished his twin im in the same boat but weve simply got to cut down and take only the things that are actually necessary  we wont need any baseball things during this term declared jack the fall is the time for footballnot baseball and say we dont want to forget our skates theres a river up there and also a lake so if the winter gets cold enough there ought to be some dandy skating  yes and if the lake is large enough there ought to be a chance for some iceboating added fred  at last with the aid of their parents the four boys got their trunks and suitcases packed they were to leave home for colby hall on wednesday morning and on tuesday evening their folks gave them a little sendoff in the shape of a party given at dick rovers residence at this gathering many of their boy friends were present as well as a number of girls along with mary and martha all of the young folks had an exceedingly pleasant time which was kept up until midnight  and now for colby hall exclaimed jack after the party had come to an end  thats it returned fred colby hall and the best times ever  so say we all of us came from the twins     chapter vi  on the train   ready  ive been ready for the last half hour  so have i come on if were going to catch that train  yes boys you dont want to miss the train came from mrs dick rover she gazed at jack fondly oh dear how i hate to have you go  and how i do hate to see fred leave sighed mrs sam rover  and my twins murmured toms wife i suppose theyll be getting into all sorts of mischief at that boarding school  oh ma were going to be regular little lambs there declared andy  just you wait and see what fine records we send home added his twin  the automobiles are waiting boys broke in dick rover come the train is due to leave in twenty minutes and you know how crowded traffic is around the grand central terminal  there were hasty goodbyes a number of kisses and words of cheer and then the four boys left their mothers and the girls and ran down to where two automobiles were standing at the curb the twins and their father leaped into one and jack and fred and their fathers into the other and in a moment more the two machines were gliding down riverside drive on the way to the grand central terminal at fortysecond street  it was a perfect autumn day and all four of the lads were in the best of spirits to be sure the fact that they were leaving home to be gone for several months sobered them a trifle but all were eager to find out what was in store for them rather than to give thought to what had been left behind  as might have been expected there was a perfect jam of automobiles and carriages in the vicinity of the terminal and as a consequence the lads had barely time to get aboard the train which was to carry them to haven point the town on the outskirts of which colby hall was located  take care of yourselves cried dick rover  learn all you can added his brother sam  and go slow on mischief warned tom  well remember everything came in a chorus from the four boys and then as they waved their hands to their parents the long train pulled out of the big gloomy station and the trip to the boarding school was begun  haven point was located in the heart of new england so that the boys had a ride of several hours ahead of them they had seats in a parlor car two on one side and two on the other and they proceeded without delay to make themselves comfortable the porter aiding them in disposing of their handbaggage  goodbye to old new york cried jack wont we have a lot of things to talk about when we get back  im just crazy to see colby hall to find out what it really looks like said andy  that picture we had of it looked pretty good was freds comment but of course you cant always tell by a picture  not much vouchsafed randy a building may look all right enough in a picture and still be about ready to tumble down  the boys had left home in the middle of the forenoon and expected to have their lunch on the train before reaching haven point  when lunch time comes im going to fill up declared andy no telling what sort of grub well get at the hall  father said they used to have firstclass eats at putnam hall declared fred  not always cried jack at one time while captain putnam was away the food got so bad there that the cadets rebelled and left the school  oh that was before our fathers went to putnam hall answered randy i heard about that too but while our fathers were there the food was very good indeed  after about half an hours ride the train halted at a station and among the passengers to get aboard were two youths with suitcases  hello what do you know about this cried jack surprised if there isnt spouter powell i wonder what he is doing down here he doesnt live in this town  and look at the fellow who is with him burst out fred did you ever see such a fat chap in your life  oh say ill bet i know who that fellow is declared randy it must be spouters friend will hendry spouter told me about him they call him fatty  and he fits his name declared randy here they come now they must have seats in this car  spouter powell a tall thin youth with a mass of wavy black hair overhanging his forehead and wearing a small cap well back on his head strode forward towards them behind him came the fat youth struggling with a suitcase and puffing audibly  hello you rover boys sang out the son of songbird powell cheerfully i thought you might be on this train  glad to see you spouter how are you returned jack grasping his hand cordially got a little friend with you i see  exactly my chum will hendry fatty these are the rover boys this is jack this is fred and these two little innocent lambs are the twins andy and randy  glad to know you came from all and a general handshaking followed  it was found that the new arrivals had two seats at the other end of the parlor car but there were other seats vacant near the rover boys and an exchange for these was quickly made through the pullman conductor  say they dont make you pay extra fare do they queried andy as he looked at fatty hendry doing his best to squeeze into one of the chairs  not yet but i dont know what im coming to puffed the stout youth seems to me im taking on about a pound a day he added dolefully  maybe you eat too much suggested randy why dont you cut down on your victuals  eat too much puffed will hendry i dont eat half as much as some of you slim fellows why spouter here eats twice as much as i do  yes but see the exercise i take answered dick powell i walk at least five miles to your one and i spend lots of time in the gym toosomething that you cut out entirely  well what would i be doing in the gym demanded the fat youth if i got up on the rings or the bars id pull the whole blamed business down to the ground and at this remark there was a general snicker  spouter powell explained that he had been visiting will hendry who lived in the town where the two had boarded the train he had been at colby hall ever since its opening and he had much to tell about the school and those who attended it  oh im sure youll like it declared spouter growing eloquent its so delightfully situated on a hill overlooking the river and is surrounded by stately trees and a wellkept campus the scene from the front is exceedingly picturesque while to the back the woods stretch out for many miles soon when the frost touches the leaves the hues and colors will be magnificent the sparkle of the sunlight glinting across the water  wow spouter is off again puffed fatty hendry i told you to be careful he pleaded  i was only acquainting them with the beauties of colby hall remonstrated spouter when one comes to contemplate nature its necessary to understand what real harmony  exactly exactly just so burst out andy we understand what you mean spouter but please remember the scenery is thereit wont moveand well have lots of time to look at it  tell us about the boys who go thereand the teachers broke in randy  yes the teachers especially added fred  is there any hardhearted fellowlike that josiah crabtree our folks tell about  weve got one fellow thereprofessor asa lemmthat nobody likes answered spouter hes a language teacher they say he was once quite well off and he constantly laments the loss of his wealth  and being poor now he tries to take it out on every pupil who comes under him finished fatty hendry oh asa is a lemon believe me  well you know what lemons grow for commented andy mischievously they are raised to be squeezed  and maybe well have to squeeze mr asa lemmthe lemon added his twin  then all the other profs are perfectly good fellows questioned jack  oh yes captain dale our military instructor is one of the nicest men i ever met and so are professors grawson and brice the others dont seem to cut much ice one way or the other  tell us something about the cadets  any bullies there queried fred  yes weve got one bully all right enough answered spouter slogwell brown is his name but everybody calls him slugger hes from the country but he thinks he knows it all and is very overbearing youve got to keep your eye open for slugger or youll get into trouble sure  thanks i suppose wed better give mr slugger brown a wide berth remarked fred dryly  i dont think ill let him ride over me answered jack determinedly  then there is walter baxter he isnt a half bad sort although hes pretty hottempered he had a room directly opposite ned lowe who plays the mandolin and is quite a singer about sixty of the old scholars are coming back and then there will be quite a bunch of new fellowsnot less than twenty ive been told  gif garrison wrote to us and spoke about football went on jack i suppose they have some pretty good games up there  sure we always have our regular eleven and a scrub eleven and besides that we have two or three games with rival schools gif was at the head of the football eleven last season and i suppose hell be at the head this year although slugger brown would like that place  so the talk ran on the rover boys gaining quite a little information concerning the school to which they were bound then the porter came through the car announcing the first call for lunch  say lets go and have something to eat cried will hendry struggling to his feet  i thought you were going on a diet remarked andy mischievously  sure but im going to have something just the same answered the fat boy come on if you are going to the dining car if you wait too long you wont be able to get a seat  my i shouldnt think hed want anything to eat for a month whispered fred to spouter  dont you believe a word of what fatty says about cutting down on his food returned the other in a low voice he eats just as much as anyone thats what makes him so fat  possessed of the full appetites of growing boys the rovers were not loth to follow the fat youth and spouter into the dining car which to their surprise was almost full  well have to have a table for four and another table for two remarked jack to the head waiter do you think you can find that many places  come this way was the reply and the party of six started for the other end of the dining car they were about to take the seats assigned to them by the head waiter when a very fussy man accompanied by another man pushed forward to crowd in at one of the vacant tables  say thats pretty cheeky declared randy now i dont know where we are going to sit  ill fix you up on the other side of the car said the head waiter the appearance of the boys had rather pleased him while he did not like the actions of the fussy man and his companion at all  spouter and his fat chum were behind the rovers so they did not see the face of the fussy individual who had deprived the lads of one of the seats they sat down on the other side of the aisle and the rover boys spread themselves around as best they could  fred and jack had just sat down and randy was doing likewise when one of the waiters came through the swaying car carrying a tray filled with eatables suddenly the car gave an extra lurch and andy was thrown up against the waiter in such a manner that the tray tilted from the colored mans hand and an instant later the contents of a large platter containing a broiled steak with some frenchfried potatoes was deposited over the neck and shoulders of the fussy man in the seat near by  illustration the tray tilted from the colored mans hand page 64  oh roared the man starting up in great anger what do you mean by this what do you mean i say he shrilled  at the sound of this voice spouter powell and fatty hendry looked up in sudden wonder then as some of the rover boys commenced to laugh over the mishap spouter clutched jack by the arm  that man is professor asa lemm he whispered     chapter vii  a scene in the dining car   you dont mean it gasped jack the lemon of a professor we were just talking about  thats it  then im afraid andy has gotten himself into trouble right at the start  it wasnt his fault it was the lurching of the train did it put in fred  just the same id hate to be in your cousins shoes was fatty hendrys comment  in the meanwhile the waiter by a lightninglike move had managed to save the broiled steak from slipping to the floor of the dining car he now had it on the platter but the frenchfried potatoes were scattered in all directions  what do you mean i say repeated professor asa lemm in a loud harsh voice  scuse it boss answered the waiter humbly twas the swingin o de car what done it besides one o dem passengers knocked agin my arm  i think it was that boys fault quite as much as the waiters came from the man who was accompanying professor lemm  i couldnt help it answered andy the car gave such a sudden lurch that i was almost thrown off my feet  well fix this all up sir broke in the head waiter coming to the front take that steak back to the kitchen and bring some more potatoes he added to the waiter i am glad to say it hasnt mussed you up very much and he handed the professor a fingerbowl full of water and an extra napkin  a number of passengers had witnessed the accident and were smiling broadly spouter and fatty hendry were also on a broad grin but their faces took on a sudden sober look when they found asa lemms gaze directed toward them  ha so you are here was the teachers comment what business have you to laugh  excuse me professor lemm iididntermean anything stammered spouter  sorry it happened very sorry puffed fatty  is this young man traveling with you demanded asa lemm suddenly as he looked from spouter and fatty to andy  yyessir answered the son of songbird powell  hum is he bound for the hall  yyessir  indeed then perhaps ill see all of you later muttered asa lemm and after that did what he could with the aid of some water and a napkin to remove the traces of the accident from his person in this he was aided by the head waiter who was profuse in his apologies over what had occurred  im afraid youve got yourself into a pickle andy whispered his twin when the latter had taken his seat at the table  i dont care i didnt mean to do it it was an accident besides that i think the waiter was as much to blame as i was  youll never make old lemon believe that returned spouter  spouters right about that puffed out fatty once asa lemm gets down on a boygood night  i wonder who the man with him is questioned spouter  maybe its a new teacher vouchsafed jack  i dont think so returned randy i heard both of them talking about some lawsuit and about money matters maybe the other fellow is a lawyer  i guess youre right said spouter as i told you before old lemon used to be worth a lot of money since he lost it he has been having one lawsuit after another trying to get some of it back most likely the other fellow is his lawyer and in this surmise spouter was correct  the accident had sobered all the boys consequently the lunch was not near so lively as it might otherwise have been still the irrepressible randy could not hold back altogether and he got what little sport he could out of it by putting some red pepper on fattys last mouthful of pie he used a liberal dose and the pie had scarcely disappeared within the stout youths mouth when the boy began to splutter  ugugugh came from fatty as he made a wry face what pie that last mouthful was like firefull of pepper  i thought the pie was rather hot answered randy coolly  hot its nothing but pep all the way through roared the fat boy wow let me have some water and he gulped this down so hastily that he almost strangled the tears running down his cheeks the other boys set up a laugh  the boys had had some celery served with their lunch and several stalks which were not particularly good still remained in the dish on the table when the boys were ready to leave professor asa lemm and his companion were still at their table discussing the particulars of a coming lawsuit  ill give em something to remember us by anyhow whispered andy to the chums when the party had arisen to leave the dining car and before any of the others could stop him he took up the stalks of celery and on passing asa lemm dropped them in the professors side pocket leaving the tops dangling outside  gee but youre some funny boy chuckled fatty gazing at andy in admiration i wish i could think of things like that to do  youll think of em some daywhen you get thin returned andy encouragingly you see i wanted to give him a bouquet to remember me by and at this remark there was a general snicker two or three of the passengers in the car had noticed andys action and all were smiling broadly over the incident  if he ever finds out who did that hell be down on you worse than ever declared jack when the boys were once more in the chair car  oh well whats the difference returned the lighthearted andy id just as lief be shot for a mule as for a hoptoad  i suppose hes going on to the hall remarked spouter if he is i hope he doesnt get into the autostage with us  if he gets in the autostage we might hire a jitney suggested fatty there are six of us and we could get one of the jitneys to take us over to the hall baggage and all for half a dollar  a little later the train made a stop of several minutes at quite a large city the boys were tired of sitting still and were glad enough to go out on the platform to stretch their legs here they saw professor lemm and his friend leave the train and walk up the main street of the place  hurrah we wont be bothered with him any more on this trip declared spouter  look cried randy suddenly pointing to the two men and as the boys gazed in that direction they were just in time to see asa lemm pull the stalks of celery from his pocket and throw them in the street his whole manner showed that he was much disgusted  and to think he has thrown away your beautiful bouquet andy lamented fred  never mind fred we have to get used to keen disappointments in this life groaned andy  wont he be coming back questioned fatty  i dont think sohe wont have time answered jack here comes the conductor now  all aboard shouted the conductor at that moment and the boys had to hurry in order not to be left behind then the train pulled out of the station and the journey was continued  we certainly ought to have some dandy times said jack to spouter as the train sped along i suppose your father has told you of all the good times our folks had when they went to putnam hall and brill college  yes jack that is he has told me about a good many things of course i dont suppose he told me about some of the tricks they played  well ive heard from father and from my uncle sam that my uncle tom was playing tricks almost continually  then andy and randy come by their funmaking naturally  they sure do and what do you suppose the folks at home expect me to do went on jack seriously they expect me to hold those twins in why a fellow could no more do that than hold in a pair of wild horses youve seen a little of what andy can do well his jokes arent a patch to those randy occasionally gets off  you dont say well im not sorry the last term at colby hall was rather slow now maybe well have some life and spouters face lightened  while the boys had been at lunch the sky had darkened and now the train rushed into a sudden heavy shower the rain driving against the windows of the car in sheets  i dont like this much said fred dolefully maybe well get out at haven point in a regular downpour  oh this looks more like a local shower than anything else answered jack we may run out of it in a few minutes  some rain all right remarked randy as the water continued to dash against the windows  just look there cried andy pointing out before it began to rain i noticed the automobiles on yonder road kicking up quite a dust now just look at the water and mud  well be at haven point in twenty minutesthat is if the train is on time announced spouter consulting his watch too bad because i wanted you to see the beautiful scenery with which the school is surrounded oh the woods are perfectly beautiful and after a heavy rain the torrent of water coming down the river makes the outlook one of marvelous beauty i have stood there contemplating the scene  turn it off spouter turn it off broke in fatty you promised me on your bare knees that you would stop spouting about nature this termand here you start in the first thing  oh you havent any more eye for beauty than a cow retorted spouter ruefully  why abuse the cow questioned andy gaily a cow has an eye for beauty just you hold out a beautiful red apple to her and see if she hasnt and at this the others grinned  haven point was still five miles away when the boys saw that the rain was letting up but the ditches along the track and the highways wherever they passed them were filled with running water showing that the downpour in that vicinity had been a severe one  next station haven point called out one of the trainmen as he came through the car  better get your bags ready cried spouter there may be other fellows going to the hall and we want to get good seats on the autostage if we can  all right you lead on spouter answered jack well follow you  in a few minutes more haven point was reached and the long train rolled into the little station one after another the boys alighted the porter helping them with their suitcases and gladly accepting the tips they offered  spouter headed for a large autostage drawn up on the opposite side of an open plot behind the station as the rovers and their friends started for the turnout belonging to colby hall they noticed that several other boys had also left another coach of the train and were headed in the same direction  new fellows like ourselves i suppose remarked fred lets get ahead of em  thats the talk exclaimed randy come on and he set off on a run beside spouter with the others at their heels  the rain had been falling heavily at haven point just previous to the arrival of the train and consequently the open place behind the depot contained numerous hollows of water and mud around which the boys had to make their way as best they could they were rushing along as fast as their handbaggage would permit when they came up side by side with three other lads also bound for the stage  look out there cried jack as one of the strangers leaped into a puddle of water splashing the mud right and left  look out yourself cried the other youth a big lad much larger than any of the others  thats slugger brownthe bully i was telling you about explained spouter as he continued to run  directly behind slugger brown came another youth loudly dressed in a checkered suit and a soft checkered hat to match he was rather fastidious as to where he stepped and with his eyes on the ground ran directly into fred  hi look where you are going cried the youngest of the rover boys and then to keep himself from slipping down made a clutch at randys arm this brought randy around and both he and fred bumped into the elegantly attired youth  stop that cried the stranger and then seeing a puddle directly in front of him attempted to leap over it but his foot slipped in the mud and down he went flat on his back with a loud splash     chapter viii  at colby hall   my look at that  some tumble that eh  why he sent some of that water and mud over me  such were some of the exclamations as the loudlydressed youth went down in the puddle of water and mud  he was flat on his back and it took several seconds for him to turn over and get to his feet the fall had attracted the attention of everybody making for the autostage excepting spouter and jack  oh my eye youre certainly a sight to see came from the biggest boy in the crowd slugger brown  it wasnt my fault that i fell retorted the unfortunate one those fellows bumped into me and made me lose my footing and he pointed to fred and randy  no such thing burst out fred indignantly you bumped into us first and you only fell when you tried to jump across the puddle and your feet slipped  i say its your fault spluttered the boy who had gone down his hands were covered with mud and water and he stood there helpless filled with rage  take your handkerchief and wipe your hands off advised slugger brown he looked coldly at fred and randy if they tripped you up they ought to have a licking for doing it  thats the fellow whos responsible answered the boy who had fallen and he strode up to confront fred for two pins id smash you on the nose he continued hotly  you leave him alone broke in randy and doubled up his fists  the boy who had gone down had expected fred to back away but the youngest rover bravely stood his ground  say whats up back there queried spouter suddenly looking around to see why the other boys had not followed him to the autostage  looks to me as if somebody was going to get into a fight returned jack see one of those fellows just made a pass at fred come on this wont do and he ran back towards the crowd that was gathering  the boy who had fallen had indeed made a pass with one of his dirty fists at fred but the latter had dodged the blow with ease and now he had the loudly dressed youth by the arm  you behave yourself he said sharply i didnt knock you down and you know it im sorry you got yourself all dirty but it wasnt my fault  you fight him and youll fight me too broke in randy if there is any blame in this it belongs to me as much as to my cousin  by this time jack had reached the group and pushed his way to the front as he caught sight of the face of the boy who had fallen he gave a quick exclamation  well i never nappy martell  do you know this fellow questioned andy quickly  ive met him before was the reply hes nappy martellthe fellow i had trouble with in front of the office in wall streetthe fellow who so mistreated that poor street peddler  oh so this is the same chap eh broke out randy no wonder he wants to fight with fred hes a regular scrapper in spite of his fine clothes  what are you doing here asked nappy martell curiously as he looked at jack then his gaze suddenly shifted to fred and randy are you rovers too  we are was the quick response  humph no wonder you knocked me down i suppose that fellow told you all about me and nappy pointed to jack  whats the use of quarreling about a little thing like a tumble in the dirt panted fatty who was almost out of breath because of his run towards the autostage come on lets get to the hall and see who is there  im not anxious to fight answered fred readily but i dont like this fellows talk  ill talk as i please blustered martell and ill fight too if i want to  thats the talk nappy came from slugger brown dont let any new boys lord it over you if you want to fight go ahead  i owe these rovers one muttered the loudly dressed youth i had a runin with this one in new york and he pointed to jack they are all of a kindtoo fresh to live  there is no use of your talking that way martell broke in jack we didnt come here to scrap but everyone of us can take his own part if it is necessary  a perfect war of words followed and the argument proved so hot that it looked as if there would certainly be a fight with fred and randy and possibly some of the others on one side and nappy martell slugger brown and one or two of their cronies who had come up on the other but then came a sudden diversion as a heavily built and military looking man came from the main street of the town and walked towards them  cheese it boys came from one of the lads present here comes captain dale hell report us all if he knows theres anything like a fight going on  at the announcement that captain mapes dale who was the military instructor at colby hall was approaching the boys who had attended the academy the term previous fell back in alarm they knew the captain to be a strict disciplinarian who abhorred fighting except in a military way  well boys are you going up to the hall said the captain pleasantly as he came closer the old pupils present saluted him and were saluted in return  yes sir answered spouter and then before any of the others could speak he added captain dale will you permit me to introduce some new scholars and thereupon he mentioned the rover boys names  glad to know you said captain dale and shook hands all around  in the meanwhile nappy martell had dropped somewhat in the background so that the military instructor might not notice the soiled condition of his clothing then one or two other new pupils were introduced and the whole crowd made for the autostage  the stage was a large affair and slugger brown nappy martell and some of their friends kept to the front end leaving the rovers and their friends together at the rear the captain and a professor connected with the hall seating themselves between the two factions  this row is only stopped for the time being whispered randy to jack i think that fellow martell is too ugly to let it drop  hes rather a big fellow to tackle fred returned jack why he is even bigger than i am  thats the way with most bullies put in fatty they dont feel like tackling a fellow of their size they like to pick out little chaps  oh dont misunderstand me returned the oldest of the rover boys fred may be small but he is very strong and wiry and he knows how to take care of himself but i shouldnt like to see any out and out fightingat least not so soon we dont want to get a black eye before we get settled down  thats the talk came from andy id rather have some fun than have any fighting i hope well find the other fellows at the hall more pleasant than this martell and that great big slugger brown  its queer you didnt mention martell to us on the train remarked fred  i thought he had left school answered spouter you see he went home before the term closed last spring and i didnt know that he was coming back  he and brown seem to be pretty thick was randys comment  yes they were always together last term they and a fellow named henry stowell stowell is a regular little sneak and most of the boys call him codfish on account of the awfully broad mouth hes got  well theres one thing sure remarked jack well all have to keep our eyes open for martell brown and company  while on the train the rover boys had learned that haven point was a clean and compactly built town containing about two thousand inhabitants it was located at the head of clearwater lake a beautiful sheet of water about two miles long and half a mile wide and containing a number of picturesque islands at the head of the lake was the rick rack river running down from the hills and woods beyond up in the hills it was a wild and rocky watercourse containing a number of dangerous rapids but where it passed colby hall it was a broad and fairly deep stream joining the lake at a point where there were two rocky islands the distance from the railroad station to the military academy was a little over half a mile along a road branching off through the main street into a country highway bordered on one side by the river and on the other by a number of wellkept farms with here and there a small patch of timber  theres the hall exclaimed spouter presently after the autostage made a turn through a number of trees and came out on a broad highway running in a semicircle around a large campus what do you think of the place looks rather fine doesnt it  all of the rover boys gazed eagerly at what was before them they saw a large stone building shaped almost in the form of a cross the upper portion facing the river it was three stories in height and contained not only the classrooms and mess hall of the institution but also the dormitories for the boys to one side was a small brick building which at one time had evidently been a private dwelling this was now occupied by colonel colby and his family and the various professors on the opposite side was a long low wooden building  thats our gym explained fatty you can go in there any time you want to do a turn on the bars and break your neck  down at the waters edge were several small buildings which spouter explained were used for storing the boats belonging to the hall and also as bathhouses behind the hall were a stable and a barn and also a garage and still farther back were a vegetable garden and some farm fields for colonel colby believed in raising as much stuff for the hall table as possible  thats the rick rack river explained spouter as they passed the stream weve some dandy times there swimming and boating  dont you have skating in the winter queried andy  sure and we have some great races too  in another moment the autostage drew up to the front door of colby hall and one after another the boys and captain dale and the other teacher alighted  you new pupils may as well follow me right to the office said the captain you can leave your suitcases in the hallway until you have been assigned to your rooms  he led the way and they followed through a large reception room and into an elegantly appointed office where colonel colby sat at a mahogany desk writing  some new pupils colonel colby announced the captain and at once the colonel arose  so you are the rover boys eh he said his face lighting up with pleasure i am certainly very glad to meet you of course you know that your fathers and myself were schoolmates for many years  yes colonel colby we know that replied jack that is one reason why they sent us here  so i understand i am proud to know that my old friends think so much of me and the master of colby hall smiled broadly i am sure we are going to get along famously  it certainly looks like a nice school remarked andy frankly i like it first rate  and so do i added his twin  we hope to have some great times here came from fred  then one after another the boys were required to sign the register and answer a number of questions regarding their age and previous instruction and the state of their health  ill have professor brice assign you to your rooms said colonel colby after the questioning had come to an end he has charge of that matter so far as it concerns the older boys the younger boys are under the charge of mrs crews the matron  the master of the hall touched a bell and when a servant appeared requested that professor brice be summoned the latter soon appeared a young man evidently just from college he was introduced to the boys and then took them off to assign them their rooms  hadnt we better get our suitcases suggested jack  yes you might as well bring them along answered professor paul brice that will save another trip downstairs you can give your trunk checks to me and i will see that the trunks are brought up from the station and placed in your rooms to be unpacked after youve unpacked them they will be marked with your names and placed in the trunk room  it took the boys but a minute to reach the end of the hallway where their suitcases had been left those of the twins were still there and also that belonging to jack but freds was missing  hello whats become of my suitcase questioned the youngest rover anxiously  maybe somebody carried it upstairs for you suggested jack  all looked around the hallway and in the nearby rooms but the suitcase could not be found  well i dont think you need to worry said professor brice lightly there is no danger of thieves around here probably some boy picked up the suitcase by mistake  maybe returned fred but then he looked at his cousins and shook his head slowly  i guess you suspect nappy martell and his cronies whispered randy on the way upstairs  i do answered fred i think they took that suitcase to play a trick on me     chapter ix  the missing suitcase   in the letters sent to colby hall the rover boys had requested that they be placed in rooms close to those occupied by spouter powell gif garrison and their chums and colonel colby had replied that he would do what he could for them in the matter although many of the choicest rooms at the hall had already been assigned to the old cadets  i can give you a choice of several rooms said professor brice as he led the way to the second floor of the school come this way please  he took them down a long corridor and into a wing of the building  this is our hallway whispered spouter to jack i guess youll get pretty close to gif and me after all  spouter and gif had rooms numbered 19 and 21 across the hall fatty had number 16 18 20 and 22 were as yet unassigned  i can give you these three rooms announced paul brice  but what about the fourth queried jack there are four of us you see and all these are single rooms  for a fourth room you might take the one next to that occupied by powell on the other side of the hallway answered the teacher  that might do returned fred but we would prefer to be togetherespecially as these rooms all connect  i think i can help you out if you want me to came from fatty goodnaturedly if professor brice is willing ill move over to number twentythree and that will give you four fellows numbers sixteen eighteen twenty and twentytwo  oh we dont want to disturb you although its very kind of you to make the offer remonstrated jack  thats all right answered fatty id just as lief be next to spouter the room is just as good and i know you four cousins would like to keep together and so after a little more talk the matter was arranged  now the question is how are we going to assign these rooms came from randy  ive got an idea returned his twin  all right out with it came from fred id like to get settled so that i can make another hunt for my missing suitcase  why not live here just as we live on riverside drive answered andy jack can take one of the middle rooms with fred on one side of him and randy and myself on the other  youve solved it andy exclaimed jack and so without further ado the matter was settled  now ill institute a hunt for that missing suitcase said professor brice after he had made a note of the room assignments most likely some boy picked it up by mistake  if he did that why didnt he leave his own suitcase behind queried fred  ill look it up dont worry said the professor and then hurried away for there were many other matters demanding his attention  the boys found the rooms small but pleasant each contained a single bed a desk and a chiffonier and also a small clothing closet in one corner was a bowl with running water and each room contained two electric lights all of the rooms had connecting doors but these for the most part were kept closed some of the pupils having their beds or chiffoniers in front of them  you see you are permitted to arrange your room to suit yourselves explained spouter so some of the boys have them one way and some another some of the boys are even permitted to double upthat is put two of the beds in one room and use the other room exclusively for dressing and studying  thats an idea answered randy maybe andy and i will do that this plan was followed out by the twins who used the last room of the four for a sleeping apartment and made of the other room a sort of general meeting place for all of the rovers  where does that nappy martell hold forth questioned fred of fatty while he was helping the stout youth transfer his belongings across the hallway  he and slugger brown and codfish and that gang are all around the corner on the main corridor was the reply that is nappy was there last season i dont know whether somebody else used his room after he left or not  it was room sixty put in spouter slugger has sixtytwo i dont believe anyone went into sixty after nappy left you see it was almost the end of the term and all the cadets were settled  im going to take a look around answered fred i cant do anything here anyway with no suitcase and no trunk  i guess id better go with you came from jack he did not wish to allow his cousin to interview the big overdressed youth alone  leaving the others to settle down in the rooms as best they could fred and jack hurried through the hallway to the main corridor of the second floor of the hall old cadets and new pupils were coming and going in all directions and many were the glances of curiosity directed towards the rovers  gee some of those fellows certainly look nifty in their uniforms was freds comment  they look like the uniforms our folks brought home from putnam hall answered jack my fathers old uniform is up in our storeroom now i tried it on one day just for fun they tell me they are patterned after the uniforms worn at west point  there goes an officer whispered fred as a tall youth went by with a sword dangling from his belt look at the gold braid will you isnt it swell he added in deep admiration  i can see your finish fred laughed his cousin if you stay here youll want to be an officer with a sword and with lots of gold lace  i dont know about that answered the youngest rover seriously i guess all the officers have to be big boys  nonsense size has nothing to do with it why some of the greatest military men in the world have been very small look at napoleon for instance  well ill see about that later jack just now id rather get on the track of that suitcase  it did not take the two rovers long to reach that part of the corridor where was located the room formerly occupied by nappy martell the door was open several inches and fred and jack saw that three boys were presentnappy slugger and a small roundfaced youth with a particularly broad mouth  that little chap must be the sneak spouter mentionedthe boy they call codfish whispered jack  that was a good joke all right nappy piped out the small cadet as the rovers came closer a fine joke all right all right  you keep your mouth shut about it codfish retorted nappy martell quickly  oh i wont say a word believe me returned the other quickly  just then slugger brown peered out into the hallway and saw the two rover boys he looked somewhat startled and immediately placed his hand over nappy martells mouth  i want to see you martell cried fred without hesitation i want to know what you did with my suitcase  i dont know anything about your suitcase growled the loudly dressed youth in surly tones  yes you do you took it and i want you to return it answered fred boldly  see here do you want a licking burst out the new york boy as he doubled up his fists you deserve one for the way you tripped me up in that mud puddle you say another word and ill give you whats coming to you and his manner was very threatening  no use of fighting here nappy remonstrated slugger brown keep it until some time when you can meet him outside  i didnt come here to fight answered fred but i want my suitcase  i dont know anything about your suitcase who says i took it added nappy martell with sudden suspicion  i say you took it there wouldnt be anyone else here to play such a trick on me now you must hand it over  you go on about your business roared the new york boy and as fred followed by jack attempted to enter the room he slammed the door in their faces and shot the bolt into place  fred was thoroughly angry and if it had not been for his cousin he would have tried then and there to batter the door down but jack caught him by the arm and pulled him back  no use of creating a disturbance so soon said jack wed only get into hot water and maybe colonel colby would become so disgusted he would send us right home if martell took that suitcase he wont dare to keep it for that would be stealing more than likely hell sneak it back to you by tomorrow  he ought to have his head knocked off of him muttered the youngest rover jack i feel in my bones that that fellow is going to cause us a lot of trouble  i shouldnt wonder was the answer remember fred he is as angry at me for the row we had down in wall street as he is at you over that mudpuddle affair  oh dear and i thought everything was going to be lovely when we got here sighed fred  there seemed nothing else to do and so the two boys returned to where they had left the others a little while later their trunks came in and all spent an hour or more in unpacking these and stowing away the various articles brought along  youll be measured for your uniforms tomorrow announced spouter and then if the school has the right sizes on hand youll get them at once otherwise theyll be made to order and youll have to wait at least ten days for them  oh i hope theyve got my size in stock cried andy id like to see how it feels being a cadet  dont worry answered his twin i guess well get enough of that before we leave colby hall remember youve got to learn how to drill and march and shoot at a target and all that  i think itll be lots of fun broke in jack my father told me he liked that part of the life at putnam hall very much  were pretty well filled up here it seems to me came from fred as he sat on his empty trunk surveying his surroundings  the men will come to take the trunks away in a little while answered fatty and this proved to be so with the trunks gone the boys had more room in which to move about for which they were thankful  how about supper questioned andy presently as a bell rang out sharply  we have supper at six oclock sharp returned fatty quickly  last year we were at a table with professor grawson put in spouter hes a pretty nice man i hope i get at his table again  excuse me from getting at a table with a man like professor lemm burst out andy gee what will i do if they put me with him he continued dolefully  well youll have to sit wherever you are placed answered spouter  and what do you care so long as you get enough to eat questioned fatty  but andy shook his head he thought if he were placed at the same table with professor asa lemm it would be an actual hardship     chapter x  getting acquainted   i dont see him anywhere remarked andy as he and his cousins approached the mess hall of the school  the cadets were entering in little groups of twos and threes for as yet the regular term at colby hall had not begun with the real opening of the school the cadets would have a dress parade previous to dining and would then stack their arms outside and march in in regular order  who are you talking about questioned fred  professor asa lemm i dont see him at any of the tables  maybe he didnt come to the hall tonight he might have had quite some business to transact with that man who left the train with him  as there were more tables than professors some of the boards were presided over by the senior cadets there was a little confusion due to the entrance of so many new pupils and then the rovers were assigned to a table presided over by a senior named ralph mason who was the major of the school battalion  i am glad to meet you said major mason as he shook hands cordially i hope you will make yourselves at home and he smiled in a manner that won the confidence of all the boys at once  the meal was a good substantial onefor colonel colby believed in setting a homelike tableand soon the clatter of knives and forks and the rattle of dishes filled the air most of the boys had come in from long journeys and were consequently hungry so but little was said while the meal progressed spouter and fatty and several other boys they had met sat at a table next to that occupied by the rovers but nappy martell and his cronies were on the opposite side of the mess hall for which our friends were thankful  i think if i had to look at the face of codfish while i was eating it would spoil my appetite was andys comment during the meal they ought to photograph his mouth and put it in the comic supplements  yes or else they ought to get him to act in some of the funny movies returned his twin  as soon as the repast was at an end fred sought out professor brice and asked him if anything had been learned concerning the missing suitcase  i am sorry to say i havent learned anything answered the professor a troubled look coming over his face i really must say rover i dont know what to make of it do you suspect anyone in particular of having taken it  fred was on the point of mentioning nappy martells name but suddenly held himself in check  i wouldnt like to say anything about that professor he answered slowly i might be accusing a fellow cadet unfairly if the suitcase isnt returned by tomorrow i may have something to say about it  very well i think i understand how you feel about it and the young professor looked knowingly at the boy did you have much in the suitcase  yes sir it was well packed you see i wasnt sure whether my trunk would come right along so i carried all i could in my handbaggage  when fred joined the others all of the crowd led by spouter walked down to the gymnasium here the rovers were introduced to a number of other pupils including ned lowe who was quite a mandolin player and also a good singer and a tall studious youth named dan soppinger  ned is our great singer announced spouter we expect some day that hell be singing in grand opera on the metropolitan stage  did you say grand opera or grand uproar questioned andy slyly  opera my boy opera repeated spouter i expect some day that he will thrill great audiences with exquisite renderings of the famous solos by wagner beethoven mozart donizetti  great mackerel spouter what are you giving usa musical directory interrupted randy  no i was only giving you a list of the things i expect to hear ned sing sooner or later now as for dan herehe is the human encyclopedia  if there is anything you dont want to know ask dan and hell be sure to tell you all about it put in fatty with a grin how about it dan  say thats a fine way to introduce a fellow cried dan soppinger with a doubtful grin on his studious face of course im trying to learn as much as possible but there are a whole lot of things that i dont know and im not ashamed to acknowledge it but say by the way can any of you tell me what the date was when jefferson was inaugurated president  at this question there came a sudden groan not only from fatty but also from spouter and ned lowe then with one voice the three shouted  down with him hes at it again  i dont believe any of you know the date retorted dan soppinger if you did youd tell me i am writing an article about the presidents and ive got to put that in and then heres another thing can any of you tell me who crossed the pacific ocean to  but whatever the question was it was never finished for at that moment spouter fatty ned and several others piled on dan soppinger and brought him to the gymnasium floor  hi you let up cried the victim squirming from under the others as best he could cant a fellow ask a question or two without you starting such a roughhouse as this  no questions to be asked dan until the regular school term begins answered spouter then all youve got to do is to go to the rover boys  not much came simultaneously from andy and randy  do you take us for a school library questioned fred gaily  ill answer all the easy ones dan said jack goodnaturedly the hard ones ill turn over to spouter if the question is a real sensible one hell give you a nice little answerone about twelve hundred words long  hurrah spouter is discovered at last cried fatty twelve hundred words long just fits itthat is if spouter is in a hurry to cut it short  the rover boys were much interested in what was taking place in the gymnasium and they even tried out some of the bars and swinging rings as well as one of the exercising machines  this is certainly an uptodate institution remarked jack this gym couldnt be better  how about the boats questioned randy he and his brother had owned a rowboat on the hudson river and had often gone out in the craft  oh weve got half a dozen good rowboats as well as several racing shells answered spouter youll probably get a chance to look them over later  while the rover boys were taking in the sights to be seen in and around the gymnasium their attention was attracted to a tall wellformed cadet who was doing some clever work on one of the bars  hes doing that almost as well as a circus performer was freds comment  yes hes certainly very graceful returned jack i wonder who he is  that is walt baxter announced a cadet who had heard the talk  walt baxter exclaimed randy i wonder if he can be the son of dan baxter the man who made so much trouble for our fathers while at putnam hall  ill soon find out returned jack but please rememberdan baxter reformed and more than likely his son is a firstrate fellow  as soon as walter baxter had gotten through with his exercise and had dropped to the floor jack followed by his cousins went up to him  are you walt baxterthe son of mr daniel baxter he questioned  yes returned the other and looked at jack and the others with him curiously  i am jack roverthe son of mr richard rover these are my cousins and jack introduced them  oh is that so answered walt baxter and shook hands rather doubtfully iiam glad to know you he stammered  and we are real glad to know you baxter answered randy readily we heard you were at this school we hope that well all be good friends  if we are not it wont be my fault and now there was a ring of relief in walter baxters voice he lowered his tone a trifle i know your fathers did a lot for my father and i am very thankful for it if i can do anything for you fellows here ill certainly do it  and well do what we can for you baxter answered jack quickly  after that the talk became general and walt baxter told much about himself and the doings of the cadets at colby hall when nappy martells name was mentioned he drew down the corners of his mouth  i never had any use for that chap he declared once or twice my hot temper got the better of me and we came pretty near having a fight but after that martell gave me a wide berth  i think ive got martell to thank for something that is missing said fred and thereupon related the particulars regarding the lost suitcase  say i think i know something about that cried walter baxter quickly yes im sure i do  did you see martell take the suitcase demanded the youngest rover quickly  i cant say as to that exactly but i did see martell sneaking off through the backyard past the stable with something under his arma big package wrapped up in a couple of newspapers  when was this questioned jack quickly  about four oclock this afternoon  just after we arrived at the hall burst out randy  what did he do with what package asked jack  i dont know exactly excepting that he went down past the stable on to the roadway that leads to the farm fields  maybe he took the suitcase and threw it down in one of the fields ventured andy  you didnt see him come back asked fred  yes come to think of it i didabout a quarter of an hour after that answered walt baxter  and did he have the package then  no  then ill wager it was the suitcase and he left it somewhere down on the farm cried randy let us go and take a look we are permitted to go out in the farm fields arent we he asked of walt  oh yes you can go anywhere you please during off hours so long as you dont go out of bounds was the reply if you want to go out of bounds you have to report at the office and get permission  the matter was talked over for a few minutes more and walt baxter said he would gladly go along with the rovers to show them just where he had seen nappy martell with the bundle the five boys were soon in the neighborhood of the hall stable and then they passed beyond this to a roadway which ran between the fields attached to the school farm  its a pity its so dark declared jack i doubt if well be able to locate that suitcase even if we get quite close to it  ill tell you what ill do declared randy ill run back to my room and get my pocket flashlight that will be just the thing  it took him but a few minutes to obtain the article he had mentioned and with the flashlight to guide them the five boys started along the roadway behind the school the light was flashed first on one side and then on the other  looks like a wild goose chase declared andy after they had passed two farm fields i dont think he would come this far with that heavy suitcase  here is a cornfield full of stacks said walt baxter the stacks would afford a dandy hiding place for almost anything  they approached the first of the stacks and fred kicked some of the corn stalks aside but without result then they passed on to the next stack  hello here is something exclaimed jack as the rays of the flashlight fell upon the object fred i guess weve found it all right enough  so we have cried the youngest rover and in a moment more he thrust his hand in between the cornstalks and pulled out the missing suitcase     chapter xi  down in the cornfield   the other boys gathered around in curiosity as fred brought forth from the stack of cornstalks his missing suitcase beside the bag were several newspapers crumpled up into a wad  those must be the newspapers he had the suitcase wrapped in remarked walt baxter  more than likely answered jack he picked up the wad of papers and glanced at them new york newspapers too he cried nappy must have brought them with him from home  was the suitcase locked fred questioned randy  no i didnt bother to lock it because you see i had it with me i only lock a suitcase when i check it  then youd better take a look inside and see if your duds are all right advised andy  the youngest rover quickly unstrapped the suitcase and threw back the catch then as randy sent the rays of the flashlight into the bag he as well as the others uttered various exclamations  the mean fellow  fred you ought to get after him for this  for a quick look inside the suitcase had revealed the fact that nappy martell had opened the bag and thrown handfuls of dirt amid the pieces of clothing and the various other articles fred had packed therein  youll have to have all that laundered stuff done over again before you can wear it declared jack and youll have to have those neckties cleaned too i am afraid say this is a shame  just wait i think ill be able to get square with nappy martell muttered the youngest rover  he ought to be reported for this broke in walt baxter this isnt a joke its a lowdown dirty trick  at this remark all of the other rover boys looked at fred and he looked at his cousins in return  i dont know about reporting this he answered slowly i rather think i prefer to settle with martell myself  thats the talk cried andy if you reported this some of the fellows might put you down for a softy and a sneak id rather watch my chance and give martell as good as he sent  and with interest added his twin  if you fellows are anything like your fathers were before you i reckon youll know how to get square with nappy remarked walt baxter ive heard that the rovers never took a back seat for anybody  ill figure out what im going to do after i get settled here returned fred he suddenly began to smile say things have been happening since we left home havent they  i should say yes answered andy  with jack assisting his cousin in carrying the suitcase the whole crowd returned to colby hall and here the rovers started to separate from walt baxter first requesting him to remain silent regarding the finding of the handbaggage  if we dont say a word about it maybe nappy will get worried said fred and that is what i want him to do  he may go down to the cornfield to see if the bag is still there  hold on burst out randy suddenly ive got an idea and then in a few words he explained what had occurred to him the others listened with interest and even walt baxter had to laugh outright over what he proposed  ill do it declared the son of dan baxter readily ill do it the first chance i get and believe me ill fix it so nappy martell gets into hot water  id like to see what effect the story has on martell said andy grinning broadly cant you fix it so we can be around at the time  sure when i get the chance ill drop you a hint  and now i must get this bag to my room without anyone seeing me said fred  better let spouter or fatty carry it up advised jack then if martell sees it he wont know that it is your suitcase  it was an easy matter to get spouter to do what was required although he insisted upon knowing what was in the wind when he was told he too laughed heartily  it will serve martell right he said i hope it worries him to death  as soon as the suitcase was safe in freds room he sought out professor brice who was busy arranging the order of some classes  i wish to report that ive got my suitcase back professor said the youth  ah indeed was the teachers reply and his face showed his relief im glad to know it did youerhave any trouble  nothing that i care to mentionat least at this time answered fred if you dont mind professor well drop the matter  oh very well rover just as you please the young professor looked at fred rather knowingly of course if there is anything wrong you can report it later he added hesitatingly  yes sir thank you sir answered the youth and then bowed himself out of the office in the hallway he was joined by andy  did he make you squeal questioned the cousin quickly  not much was the reply hes a good sport i guess hes been through the mill himself  fred spent some time over the contents of the suitcase brushing the dirt from some of the articles and sorting the rest out to be cleaned or laundered  its going to cost two or three dollars to fix this up he declared to randy i really ought to send the bill to martell  well just wait first and see if we get any fun out of this answered the jokeloving cousin  as was to be expected there was far from a full nights sleep coming to the rover boys that night the quarters were strange to them and there was more or less noise throughout the school building a bunch of scholars coming in on a late train and not getting settled down until after midnight there was also something of horseplay although the majority of the cadets were too tired from their journeys to be very active  i suppose well have to stand some hazing and all that sort of thing later on remarked jack before retiring  about one oclock the school seemed to settle down and then one after another the rover boys fell asleep not to awaken until the autumn sun was showing well above the hills beyond clearwater lake  this certainly is a splendid location remarked jack as he went to the open window stretched himself and filled his lungs with the fresh morning air  i dont wonder colonel colby picked this place out for a school answered andy who had come in he couldnt have done better  not being accustomed to their surroundings it took the rovers a little longer than usual to get washed and dressed they were just finishing their toilets when there came a light knock on randys door he opened it to find walt baxter standing there  nappy martell just went downstairs and ive fixed that matter up with ned lowe said walt come on down if you want to see what takes place  he led the way and all of the rover boys followed at a safe distance they saw walt enter one of the big livingrooms of the hall to one end of which was attached the school library nappy martell was at one of the library tables glancing carelessly over a magazine in the livingroom walt was joined by ned lowe and the pair walked up behind nappy  why yes it was the strangest thing i ever saw said walt to ned in a loud voice so that nappy martell could not help but hear the fellow seemed to come from a stack of cornstalks down in the cornfield  it wasnt one of the cadets was it questioned ned innocently  oh no i think this fellow was some kind of a trampmaybe some fellow who had been sleeping under the stack all night but what he was doing with such a fine suitcase gets me  thats right tramps dont generally have suitcases returned the other boy did he come toward the school  no he dug out the other way just as fast as he could go  poor fellow maybe he was afraid if he came towards the school he would be arrested if he had a suitcase he couldnt have been just an ordinary tramp maybe he was some working man looking for a job and without the price of a nights lodging  perhaps ned at the same time i dont think colonel colby wants his cornstalks used for a hotel returned walt and then he and ned walked through the library and went outside on the campus  during this conversation the rover boys hidden behind some open doors had watched nappy martell closely they had seen that he had caught what was being said and had immediately lost all interest in the magazine he was perusing his face took on a worried look and he glanced inquiringly after walt and ned then he threw down his magazine and started to leave the room  come on let us watch him whispered jack  yes but keep out of his sight returned randy we dont want this joke spoiled  keeping well in the background they saw nappy martell ascend the stairs to his room a moment later he came forth with his hat in his hand  i bet an oyster against a soda cracker hes going down to that cornfield cried andy  right you are answered fred come on lets follow him and rushing up to their own rooms the rover boys donned their caps and sweaters for the day was unusually cool  nappy martell left the hall by a rear door and the rovers followed they saw the loudly dressed youth hurry toward the stable and then disappear to the rear soon he was on the highway leading to the cornfield  there is no use of our following him for he might see us and that would spoil everything said randy lets wait here at the stable until he comes back  it did not take nappy martell long to reach the cornfield and from a distance the rovers saw him rush around first to one stack of cornstalks and then to another he was gone fully a quarter of an hour and came back looking decidedly worried  he thinks some tramp got that suitcase and went off with it said fred grinning randy that certainly was one great joke  dont say a word answered randy just let him keep on worrying for a while maybe it will do him good  as martell passed the stable the rover boys stepped out of sight in the building they saw him reenter the hall and then they took a roundabout course which soon brought them to the campus where they joined fatty and ned  its certainly a good joke was fattys comment and any fellow who would be mean enough to dirty a fellows clothing like that ought to suffer for it gee ill bet hes worried  of course such a joke could not be kept entirely secret and before long it was spread among a good many of the cadets but great care was taken to keep it from slugger brown codfish and all the others belonging to the martell crowd  and now to pay martell back for his meanness said fred a little later this joke of randys is all right as far as it goes but i think im going to go him one betterthat is if i can get into martells room  all right fred anything you say goes added andy quickly isnt that so randy  sure thing  look here you dont want to get into trouble warned jack  there wont be much trouble about this answered fred i am only going to give nappy martell something to think about     chapter xii  learning to drill   while the rover boys were talking matters over among themselves nappy martell had returned to his room which was connected by a door with that occupied by slugger brown  what in thunder made you run off in such a hurry nappy demanded the other cadet somewhat surlily you didnt answer that question i put to you at all  i had something else to think about was the reply it looks to me as if im in hot water  hows that  do you remember i told you that i placed that fred rovers suitcase down under a stack in the cornfield  yes  well i heard walt baxter telling ned lowe that he had seen a tramp down in the cornfield running away from one of the stacks with a suitcase in his hand so i went down to the cornfield to find out if the suitcase was still where i had hidden it it was gone  whew slugger brown gave a prolonged whistle that certainly does look bad did baxter say where the tramp went  he told lowe that he had not come towards the hall but had gone off in the opposite direction  then that looks as if the suitcase was gone for good  so it does and i dont know what im going to do about it answered nappy martell gloomily of course i didnt think the suitcase would be stolen  and the worst part of it is the rovers suspect you of having taken it was the comment of slugger  yes but they cant prove it cried nappy quickly that is they wont be able to do it unless you or codfish give me away  you know me well enough to know i wont say a word nappy and as for codfish just give him to understand if he opens his trap youll fix him for it  a little while later martell and brown went below in the lower hallway they met fred and some of the others  well martell when are you going to return that suitcase demanded the youngest rover  i told you i havent got your suitcase and dont know anything about it cried the loudly dressed youth but at the same time his face grew flushed and he could not look fred in the eyes  you took that suitcase and if you dont return it pretty quick youll see what will happen warned fred and then he walked away with his cousins leaving nappy martell gazing at slugger brown questioningly the pair conversed in a low tone and passed on out of the hall on to the campus  nows your time fred if youre going to do as you said whispered randy  right you are was the quick reply come on and fred led the way upstairs again his cousins following  when they reached nappy martells room they found the door locked but the door to slugger browns apartment was unfastened and they quickly entered this and passed into the room beyond  say jack wont you stand on guard questioned fred they might come back while were at work  all right boys but be careful what you do you dont want to spoil anything a joke is a joke but it loses its flavor if it is carried too far  with jack standing in the hallway on guard fred and the twins took possession of nappy martells room the boy who loved to dress so loudly was rather methodical in his habits and had arranged all of his clothing and other articles with great nicety in his chiffonier and his closet  the bed first whispered fred and in a trice the boys had taken off the bed clothing and turned up the mattress on the springs they placed one of the bedsheets and on the top of this they distributed all of nappys choice neckties and also his fancycolored socks then to this they added his cuffs his fancy underwear and all of his loose jewelry the articles were spread over the bed with care so that they rested as flat as possible  now well put the mattress back and then make up the bed as nicely as possible said randy who of course in a joke of this sort directed operations  gee i dont believe hell find those articles in a hurry chuckled fred  theyll never find them until they come to turn the mattress over vouchsafed andy some joke believe me  i was thinking about that clothing in the closet i wonder if we cant fix that up some way mused randy then he began to grin just the thing he continued and walked to the chiffonier from a drawer in which he brought out a package of safety pins  what are you going to do with those questioned fred  well pin up all the ends of the sleeves and the trouser legs from the inside was the quick reply come hurry up and then the three boys lost no time in doing as randy had suggested this done they left the room leaving it so far as looks in general went just as when they had entered it  therell be some fun when nappy wants one of those neckties or a pair of those fancy socks laughed andy i wish i could be on hand to see him  dont you worrywell hear about it returned fred hell suspect me on account of that suitcase affair  while it was true that the regular school term had not yet opened the new arrivals had been informed that they must be on hand to be measured for their uniforms and also to be instructed by some of the seniors who were present in drilling the measurements of the boys were taken down in the gymnasium under the directions of mr silas crews who was the gymnasium instructor and also the husband of mrs crews the matron for the younger cadets  i hope theyve got a suit on hand that fits me was jacks comment as he and his cousins walked to the gymnasium id like to see how it feels to be in a uniform  his wish was gratified for a little later he was given an entire outfit which consisted of both a fulldress uniform and a fatigue suit as well as belt shoulder straps cap and hat and several other things uniforms were also found for the others and the entire crowd lost no time in hurrying back to their rooms to dress up in this they were aided by spouter who had donned his uniform immediately upon his arrival  some brass buttons believe me was andys comment as he strode around the rooms  say you put me in mind of a peacock said the twin my just see how he swells up and randy himself raised his chest as high as possible  what are you going to be jackfifth corporal or first admiral of the rear guard questioned fred  im going to be head soupcarrier for the bayonet squad returned his cousin gaily  as soon as they had donned their uniforms the boys returned to the gymnasium where they were placed in what was called an awkward squad and which was under the direction of dan soppinger here they quickly learned how to stand erect with their toes on a chalk mark and how to hold their hands properly then they were given directions how to cast their eyes to the right to the left and front then they learned the meaning of right face left face and about face  illustration they were placed in what was called an awkward squad page 125  all of you are doing pretty well remarked dan soppinger to the squad of eight under him now then well see what you can do when it comes to marching when i give the order forward you balance on your right foot and when the word comes march you step out with your left foot and when you step out do it like this and he gave an illustration by marching up and down in front of the squad  to the rover boys all this was very interesting and they learned with comparative ease only one of the awkward squad seemed to have difficulty in marching just right a lad named white  dont lag behind white cried dan soppinger sharply step right out as if you meant it and after that white did a little better  while the drilling was in progress colonel colby came down to the gymnasium to look on he was pleased with the general results  i think you are doing very well boys he said of course you cant learn to become firstclass soldiers in a day it takes hard practising to do anything just right  when do we get guns questioned andy after the drilling had come to an end  you wont get guns until you have learned how to march and how to turn properly answered dan then when you do get guns youll have to go in for the manual of arms  and how about learning how to shoot questioned jack  that will come still laterafter you have had experience in marching and in handling your guns  whoop me for a real soldier boy cried andy his eyes sparkling and then he began to hum a bit of doggerel he had made up on the spur of the moment      johnny get your musket     you must get your musket     johnny get your musket     you must get it now  wow thats some song was freds comment better have it copyrighted andy  oh ive already got a doublebarreled patent on it was the light answer anybody who steals it will get ten years in a bathing suit at the north pole and at this there was a general laugh  the boys were awaiting the arrival of gif garrison who came in about noon of that day gif was a big boy and as mentioned before was at the head of a great many of the athletic doings of the school  glad to see you fellows here said gif as he shook hands all around my but were going to have some good times now arent we  if we dont it wont be our fault responded jack  weve just been learning how to become soldiers explained randy my head is full of eyes right left face forward march and all that sort of thing  oh youll get used to that randy before youve been here very long returned gif  did you have a nice time getting here questioned fred  i might have had a nice time if it hadnt been for one thing was the answer i came in on the same train with a professor that none of us like  oh do you mean asa lemm questioned andy quickly  thats it what do you know of him  we know quite a little answered jack and related some of the particulars of what had happened on the train  oh i can see your finish said gif with a serious look on his face old lemon will never forget that happening hell be down on you for it all the term     chapter xiii  fred is followed   it took the rover boys several days to settle down at colby hall everything of course was new to them and they took great delight in roaming around the place in company with spouter gif and the various new friends they had made during that time they continued to drill both in the morning and the afternoon and it was surprising how quickly they learned the manual of arms and also the other tactics which go to make up the discipline of a cadet  this life is all to the merry was andys comment one day while he and the others were down at the shore of the river inspecting the boathouse with its numerous craft  it certainly is one fine place answered jack if putnam hall was anything like this no wonder our fathers thought so much of it  since fred had asked nappy martell for the suitcase the boy who was addicted to loud clothing had avoided the rovers but through the cadet named white they had learned much of what had happened in nappys room when he came in after it had been rearranged by the rovers  nappy martell was the maddest fellow you ever saw bart white had declared he stormed all around the corridor accusing nearly everybody in that vicinity of having taken his neckties and his underwear and a lot of jewelry he even came to my room and threatened to tell colonel colby if i didnt tell him where the things were  and of course you couldnt do that had been randys reply with a side wink at the others  no i told him i didnt know where the things werebecause you see i really didnt know went on bart white innocently  and after that queried jack  oh he stormed around accusing this one and that one until some of the boys got sick of listening and told him to shut up then he went back to his room and slammed the door hard enough to burst it off its hinges  do you suppose he reported the matter to colonel colby had been freds question  i dont know about that you see when a fellow gets as mad as martell was hes liable to do almost anything and that was all bart white had had to relate concerning the affair  so far the rover boys had not had anything to do with asa lemm they had met the sharpfaced professor once in the hallway and he had stared at them in a fashion which made andy shiver  hes got it in for me all right had been the declaration of the funloving youth  i guess gif was right had been jacks comment hell have it in for us the whole term too bad id rather be friendly with every one than have any enemies  the rover boys were just leaving the boathouse after having admired the beautiful four and eightoared shells stored there when they saw fatty hendry coming towards them as rapidly as his stoutness permitted  say ive got something to tell you fellows puffed the fat boy as he came closer i just saw that sneak of a codfish coming from freds room he looked awful sneakish and im sure he was up to no good  ill go up to my room at once and see answered the youngest rover and lost no time in speeding back to the hall  he bounded up the stairs two steps at a time but when he reached the room he occupied a surprise awaited him everything was exactly as he had left it it may be as well to state here that every cadet at colby hall was required to keep his room in absolute order and a monitor came around twice a day to see that this regulation was carried out if a pupil was lax in any particular regarding his room he was given a demerit in consequence thereof  well thank goodness he didnt upset anything even if he was here murmured fred to himself i wonder what the little imp was up to then a sudden thought struck him and he walked to the clothes closet in the bottom of which he had deposited his suitcase he found the bag in the closet but it was placed there in such a way that he was sure it had been handled  well what have you found questioned andy who had followed his cousin to the room  i think i know why he came here declared fred more than likely martell sent him here to find out whether i really had the suitcase or not the bag i know has been handled when i placed it in the closet i put the open end of the straps against the wall now the open ends are on this side  say youre some detective fred  i know how i left the bag and he certainly had it out of the closet and put it back  see if he did anything to it went on andy quickly and thereupon fred brought the bag forth and examined it it was empty just as he had left it  well that will take the worry of the missing bag from martells mind was freds comment as he and andy left the room this time locking the door  martell must have had some kind of a clue to the truth or he wouldnt have sent codfish here was andys comment maybe he got on to what part walt baxter and ned lowe played in the trick and in this surmise andy was correct by the merest accident codfish had overheard walt and ned speaking about the joke and at once he had gone to nappy with the news and the upshot had been that nappy had sent the sneak to freds room to learn if the suitcase with freds initials upon it was there  late that afternoon both the old and the new cadets were assigned to their places in the various classrooms and also given the textbooks which they were to study during the term  this begins to look like work sighed randy  well we didnt come here just for the fun of it declared jack we came here if youll remember to get an education  oh im not going to complain returned his cousin quickly im willing to do my share of studying but after the splendid vacation we had this summer it will be a little tough at the beginning to get down to the grind  thats just what i was thinking declared andy i wish a fellow didnt have to study why cant some of our great inventors invent some kind of knowledge pill so a fellow can just go and buy a few boxes and then take them regularly  great idea andy exclaimed his twin merrily  by the next morning all of the cadets had arrived and also all of the teachers and the other persons connected with colby hall then the cadets were assembled on the parade ground and made to march into the general assembly room of the institution where colonel colby addressed them he spoke about the good work done by the cadets during the former term at the school and said he trusted that the present term would turn out still better  at present all of our old officers of the battalion will hold over he announced but in the near futurejust as soon as we have got settled in our classesi will announce the time for a new election the major and the two captains to be elected must be in their senior year at this institution the other officers may be either sophomores or juniors  that lets us out whispered andy to jack evidently no freshmen can be officers  well why should we be officers answered his cousin we hardly know a thing about soldiering yet i think colonel colbys rule is a very good one  during the meeting in the assembly room all of the professors were called on to say a few words to the cadets the addresses delivered by professors grawson and brice and one or two of the other teachers were well received but it was plainly evident that when asa lemm came forward to speak to the boys there was a distinctly cold feeling towards him  i want to speak about attention to work he said in a severe tone of voice during the last term at this school there was not that attention in classes that i desire from now on i expect every one who comes to me to pay strict attention at all times any laxity will be severely punished  gosh hes a cheerful customer was freds comment  hed make a fellow down on him almost before the term began was another cadets comment  i dont wonder they call him old lemon added another youth  and now were all ready to go to work said jack after the cadets had been dismissed on the following day the classes were to begin  there had been so much bustle and confusion throughout the school that day that fred who was not feeling extra well got quite a headache  you had better lie down for a while and rest said jack kindly you dont want to get sick  oh its only a headache and ill soon be over it declared fred i think ill go out for a quiet walk along the river  do you want me to go along  no id just as lief go alone jack i think the quietness will do me more good than anything  this mood was not a new one with the youngest rover so jack said no more and a few minutes later fred slipped on his heavy sweater and donned his cap and set out for his walk his steps took him towards the boathouse and the bathing houses and then he continued on along a path running close to the shore of the river  although the youngest rover did not know it his departure had been watched by codfish the small boy lost no time in hurrying to nappy martell and slugger brown with his information  youre sure hes alone asked nappy quickly  yes nobody went out with him  then thats our chance slugger went on the boy from new york come ahead if you want to help me  all right nap but i thought you said you could polish him off alone  so i can but i thought youd like to see the fun  cant i go along too put in codfish  yes if youll promise to keep your mouth shut about it  oh i wont say a word returned the little cadet quickly  putting on their hats and coats the three cadets lost no time in following fred it was quite dark on the campus and parade ground but they soon caught sight of the figure ahead as the youngest rover moved past the bathhouses to the river path beyond  hes alone all right enough was slugger browns comment  i thought id catch him sooner or later after i set codfish to watching him answered nappy martell now i guess ill be able to teach him to play tricks on me he added sourly  the three cadets quickened their pace and in a moment more caught up to fred just as he reached a point on the river shore almost out of sight of the hall fred had dipped his handkerchief in the water and used the same for wiping off his aching brow  see here rover i want to talk to you cried nappy martell and striding forward he caught fred roughly by the arm  of course the youngest rover was startled not dreaming that anyone was following him yet he showed no signs of fear  what do you want of me martell he asked quietly  ill show you what i want of you cried nappy martell in sudden wrath ill teach you to play tricks on me try to make me believe your suitcase was stolen will you and then come to my room and roughhouse things eh just wait till i get through with you and youll wish youd never been born     chapter xiv  the fight   fred rover realized that he was in an unenviable situation nappy martell was thoroughly angry and evidently slugger brown and codfish were present to aid him in anything he might undertake to do  many another boy might have thought discretion the better part of valor and taken to his heels but the youngest rover was not built that way he had been taught to stick up for his rights and defend himself whenever the cause was a just one  what do you propose to do martell he questioned as quietly as he could  ill show you what ill do blustered the other you thought it was a fine joke to put most of my things under the mattress of my bed didnt you  who told you i did that  never mind i found it out and thats enough do you dare to deny it  i dont suppose there will be any use in denying it was freds reply it was done as a joke to square accounts over the missing suitcase  bah you neednt talk to me rover i know the kind you and your cousins are im going to fix you how do you like that and as he uttered the last word nappy martell hauled back and slapped fred on the cheek  it was a comparatively light blow but it aroused all the fighting blood in the youngest rover boys nature and without stopping to think twice he doubled up his fists and hit the larger youth a stinging blow in the jaw  gee look at that murmured codfish who had not expected such an onslaught from the smaller cadet  say nappy hes coming back at you burst out slugger brown in surprise  coming back at me nothing roared martell and leaping forward he rained a succession of blows on fredhitting him in the shoulder the chest and then the left ear  in another moment the two cadets were at it hammer and tongs as they circled around codfish put out his foot trying to trip fred up he failed in this but a moment later slugger brown tried the trick with success and the youngest rover came down heavily and an instant later nappy martell landed on top of him  get off of me that wasnt fair exclaimed fred those other fellows tripped me up  aw shut up retorted martell and while he held fred down with his body he continued to pommel the smaller youth with his fists  dont go too far said slugger brown presently in alarm if you do that he may squeal and get you into trouble  somebody is coming screamed codfish suddenly as he saw a number of forms running across the parade ground in the direction of the river road four or five of em  its jack rover and his chums muttered slugger brown  he was right jack was approaching followed by spouter fatty walt baxter and gif garrison  i was sure they were up to no goodfollowing fred that way walt baxter was saying  im glad you told me about this walt answered jack three against one is no fair deal  as the five cadets came rushing up codfish viewed their approach with alarm and then retreated several paces slugger brown however stood his ground  hi you let my cousin alone cried jack and leaping forward he caught nappy martell by the collar and hurled him into some bushes  say this isnt any of your fight put in slugger brown uglily while he spoke fred lost no time in leaping to his feet and there he stood once more on the defensive  no one asked you to butt in jack rover stormed nappy martell you keep out of this  why did he attack you fred  huh you know the reason as well as he does burst out martell you played a trick on me about that suitcase and then you came and roughhoused my room  one trick was only played to square up for the other martell answered jack calmly you ought to be man enough to cry quits and let it go at that  i wont cry quitsnot until ive given this fellow a good licking roared nappy martell and then before anyone could stop him he lunged another blow at fred who however was quick enough to dodge it  stop jacks voice was now unusually stern and stepping up to nappy martell he caught the fellow by the arm and swung him around so that the pair faced each other if you want to fight martell take somebody nearer your size  oh jack im not afraid of him burst out fred strange to say the excitement of the occasion seemed to have chased his headache completely away  maybe you want me to fight you sneered nappy martell  youll have to fight me if you dont leave my cousin fred alone  see here rover youve no right to butt in like this interposed slugger brown why dont you let the pair finish it  those two fellows cried fred pointing to slugger brown and codfish tripped me up it wasnt fairthree against one  we didnt trip him up at all came from the two accused ones simultaneously  they did jack first codfish tried it and then brown put out his foot and i went down and martell at once pounced on me  thats no way to fight broke out spouter  it was certainly a mean trick was gifs comment  if there is any fighting to be done i guess were on hand to see that its done fairly came from walt baxter  a perfect war of words followed in the midst of which nappy martell seemed to lose complete control of his temper he rushed at jack and hit the youth two quick blows one in the chest and the other on the chin the oldest rover was not looking for this attack and he staggered backward into some bushes all but losing his balance  thats the way to do it nappy cried slugger brown excitedly give it to him  jack was as much surprised as fred had been when first hit but he was able to recover much more quickly than his cousin he leaped forward from the bushes doubled up his fists and the next instant sent in a crashing blow that landed straight on martells nose he followed up this blow with another on the other youths chin which sent martell sprawling flat on his back  hurrah thats the way to do it jack cried spouter  say has he got to fight two of you rovers questioned slugger brown  no hes got to fight me only answered jack quickly he turned to his cousin fred you keep out of this  but he started on me pleaded the youngest rover and now that you are here to see fair play im not afraid of him  never mind its my fight anyway went on jack i owe him one for the way he treated me down in wall street that day  while this talk was going on nappy martell had scrambled to his feet his nose was swollen and bleeding profusely  you imp he howled and lunged another attack at jack  he was able to land two blows on jacks chest but they were not powerful enough to do harm then as martell circled around the oldest rover boy managed to get in another blow this time on his opponents mouth loosening two of nappys teeth  thats the way to do it jack  give him a few more like that and hell soon quit  go for him nappy you can do him up if youll only try bellowed slugger brown in excitement  you keep back slugger warned walt baxter dont you interfere  i didnt interfere  well youre too close anyway keep back like the rest of us  thats just what i say broke out spouter  realizing that the others were in the majority slugger brown kept his distance from the pair who were fighting codfish was trembling like a leaf and cowered well in the background  around and around circled the two contestants and for a few minutes neither of them seemed to have the advantage jack was hit in the arm and returned by landing another blow this time on nappys chest then the big youth aimed a kick at the rover boys stomach  hi thats no way to fight cried gif indignantly  jack had managed to escape the kick and he had put down one hand so quickly that nappy martell had been in great danger of being caught and thrown on his back  in the midst of the contest several forms could be seen hurrying across the campus and the parade ground and in a moment more andy and randy came into view followed by bart white and some other cadets  its a fight  why what do you know about this jack is fighting nappy martell  martell tackled me first but jack took the fight out of my hands explained fred to his cousins  who has got the best of it questioned bart white excitedly  i think jack has the best of it so far answered gif but the fight isnt finished yet he added a bit anxiously  youre right it isnt finished yet retorted slugger brown just you wait until nappy gets his second wind and then youll see what hell do to rover  once more the two contestants were circling around each trying to get in some kind of telling blow various passes were made and in the excitement the pair left the roadway and began to circle around on the grassy bank of the river  look out there or youll both go overboard sang out spouter in alarm  the cadets who were fighting were too engrossed to pay attention to this warning they kept on circling about and then nappy martell made a wild and vicious pass for jacks head the latter dodged like lightning came up under his opponents arm and the next instant landed a swinging blow on martells ear which sent him staggering backward several paces to fall with a splash into the river     chapter xv  in the town   hello nappys overboard  wow that was some crack on the ear  can he swim  sure he can swim if he cant we can haul him in easy enough  i dont believe the river is very deep here  such were some of the words uttered immediately after the welldelivered blow from jack rover had sent his opponent spinning into the swiftly flowing waters of the rick rack river fortunately the moon and the stars were shining brightly so it was not as dark as it otherwise might have been indeed had it not been for the brightness of the night it is doubtful if the fight could have been carried on as already described  all of the cadets present lined up along the river bank and an instant later saw nappy martell come to the surface he was striking out wildly and spluttering at the same time showing that he had gone overboard with his mouth open and had swallowed some of the water one hand and shoulder were covered with mud from the river bottom for at that particular point the stream was less than five feet deep  oh hell be drowned i know hell be drowned screamed codfish in terror  you shut up you little imp burst out gif youll arouse the whole school and there is no need of doing that  by this time nappy martell was close to the river bank and he reached up his hand appealingly to those above him  here give me your hand nappy cried slugger brown and reached down to aid his crony but the bank was a slippery and treacherous one and he was in danger of going overboard himself  wait a minute sluggerlet me help you cried spouter and he took hold of the big youths left hand  then the others also came forward to do what they could and in a few seconds more nappy martell was hauled up on the grass he was pretty well exhausted and panted painfully  im sorry you went overboard martell said jack promptly i didnt expect to knock you into the river  you did it on purpose you know you did returned the other youth wrathfully yoyoudddont know how to fffight fair he added his teeth suddenly beginning to chatter for the unexpected bath at this season had proved awfully cold  say hes shivering like a leaf cried fred  you had better get back to the hall and change your clothing advised jack  i wont change anything until ive given you a licking roared nappy martell  oh say nappy you had better call it off for tonight interposed slugger brown you cant fight in those wet clothes finish it some other time  i wont came the ejaculation and then the dripping boy hurled himself once more at jack  but he was blinded by water and mud as well as by rage and the oldest rover boy easily evaded the new onslaught then of a sudden he reached out and caught martell by both wrists and held him in a viselike grasp  now see here martell dont be foolish he said sternly i dont want to fight a fellow who has been overboard and is wringing wet youll catch your death of cold hanging around here in this night air go on back to the hall and change your clothing if you want to finish this some other time ill be ready for you  thats the talk added spouter  it would be foolish to go on in this condition remarked gif call it off by all means  you might as well do it came from slugger brown you wouldnt have any kind of a fair show nappyafter having been in the river and after having had to lick the other rover first  he didnt lick me burst out fred indignantly  more words followed but in the end nappy martell consented to return to the hall and went off in company with slugger brown codfish and one or two more friends who had chanced to come up  youll have to slip in on the sly or else somebody may ask some unpleasant questions remarked slugger brown on the way to the school  you lend me your coat and ill take mine off and make a bundle of it answered martell and so it was arranged the others clustered around the dripping youth and thus they managed to get him to his room without being detected  hell never forgive you jack for knocking him into the river said randy while the rovers and their friends walked slowly back to the hall  i guess youre right was the answer  and what is more hell probably try to play some underhanded trick on you added andy  i wish i had had the chancei think i could have knocked him out myself broke in fred im not afraid of him even if he is bigger than i am  all those who had witnessed the contest were cautioned to keep quiet about it yet in a school like colby hall it was next to impossible to keep the particulars of the affair from circulating and before long many of the cadets knew the truth the majority were of the opinion that jack could readily have defeated martell had the contest been fought to a finish  hell undoubtedly lay for you jack remarked fred that night in talking the matter over in their rooms  maybe hell lay for you fred smiled his big cousin you had better keep your eyes peeled  i guess we had better all watch out was randys comment  but for the next few days nappy martell as well as his particular crony slugger brown kept to themselves while codfish was so timid that he hardly dared to show himself  about a week including sunday went by and the school began to settle down to its regular routine of studies the rover boys had had all their classes mapped out for them and had also been assigned to a class in gymnasium work gymnastics especially suited the agile andy who nearly always preferred action to sitting still the rover boys on leaving home had promised their parents that they would pay strict attention to their studies and now they did their best in that direction of course some of the lessons were rather hard and fred being the youngest often found he needed assistance from the others  during those days they quickly discovered why dan soppinger had been referred to by one of their friends as the human question mark dan always wanted to know something and he did not hesitate to ask for information on any and all occasions no matter what else might happen to be under discussion at the time  hell die asking questions remarked andy i never knew a fellow who could fire questions at a person so rapidly  it was now ideal weather for football and as soon as the school became settled football talk filled the air gif garrison had been at the head of the football eleven the fall previous and now he was looked upon to whip the new team into shape  we generally play three games with outside schools explained gif to the rovers one day first we play hixley high then we play the clearwater country club and after that we wind up usually with our big game with columbus academy  it must be great sport answered jack  did you ever get a chance to play football in new york  oh yes we occasionally played a game  jack would make a firstrate football player if he had the chance put in randy ive seen him play and i know  yes and fred makes a pretty good player too added andy of course hes small and light in weight but hes as quick on his feet as they make em  how about you and randy questioned gif  oh we never cared very much to play football wed rather have some fun in the crowd looking on was the answer of the twin  at this the football leader smiled well weve got to have some kind of an audienceotherwise there wouldnt be any fun in pulling off a game he looked at jack and fred thoughtfully im going to keep you two fellows in mind and if i can put one or both of you on the team ill do it of course youll have your tryouts on the scrub first  well you can put me on the scrub as soon as you please answered jack promptly  ill be glad of the chance added fred  as was to be expected no sooner had the boys attempted to settle down at colby hall than they began to want for a number of things which they had failed to bring from home these articles were for the most part of small consequence yet the boys could not get along very well without them and so resolved on the following saturday which was a holiday to walk down to haven point and do some shopping  id like first rate to take a look around the town too said randy it looked like a pretty good sort of place  maybe we can go to the moving picture show there put in his brother well have time enough  perhapsif the films look worth while answered jack  they had already learned that the moving picture show in the town was of the better class and that the pupils of the school were allowed to attend a performance whenever they had time to do so  it did not take the four cousins long to walk the distance to haven point they left the school directly after lunch and inside of an hour had purchased the various small articles which they desired then all headed for the moving picture theater which was located on the main street in the busiest portion of that thoroughfare  as the boys walked up to the booth to purchase their admission tickets they saw a bevy of girls just entering the door they were all well dressed and chatting gaily  nice bunch all right was randys comment i wonder where they are from  i think i know answered jack spouter was telling me there is a girls school on the other side of this town called clearwater hall its about as large as colby hall more than likely those girls come from that school  i wish we knew them said andy i wonder if some of the cadets from our school dont know them  more than likely some of our fellows know some of the girls said jack we may be able to become acquainted with them some day     chapter xvi  at the moving picture theater   the moving picture theater was large enough to hold several hundred people and when the boys entered they found the place almost full  there are some seatsover on the left remarked jack as he pointed them out two in one row and two directly behind  why not two in one row and two directly in front returned andy gaily and then headed for the seats  you and fred had better sit in front and randy and i can take the back seats went on jack and so it was arranged  they had come in between pictures and while some doors had been open for ventilation so that the place was fairly light as jack took his seat he noticed that the girls who had come in just ahead of the boys were sitting close by  they certainly do look like nice girls was jacks mental comment and he could not help but cast a second glance at the girl sitting directly next to him she was attired in a dark blue suit trimmed in fur and held a hat to match in her lap jack noted that she was fair of complexion with dark wavy hair  im thinking this is going to be a pretty interesting picture for us andy remarked randy as the name of the production was flashed upon the screen the gold hunters secreta drama of the yukon he read that must have been taken in alaska  thats right randy returned his twin gee i hope this alaskan play doesnt affect us like that other alaskan play once affected dad he went on referring to a most remarkable happening the details of which were given in the rover boys in alaska  it isnt likely to answered randy promptly poor dad was in no mental condition to attend that show uncle dick once told me he had been knocked on the head with a footstool and that had affected his mind  the four rovers were soon absorbed in the stirring drama of the alaskan gold fields and for the time being almost forgot their surroundings in the midst of the last reel however jack felt the girl beside him stirring  its my hatpin she whispered it just fell to the floor  ill get it he returned promptly and started to hunt in the dark he had to get up and push up his seat before the hatpin was recovered  oh thank you very much said the girl sweetly when he presented the article to her  you are welcome im sure returned the rover boy and then he added with a smile accidents will happen in the best of families you know and at this both the girl and two of her companions giggled  the photodrama was presently finished and was followed by a mirthprovoking comedy at which the entire audience laughed heartily then came a reel of current events from various portions of the globe  say theres something worth looking at cried fred as a boat race was flashed on the screen  right you are responded jack just see those fellows pull isnt it grand he added enthusiastically id like to be in that shell myself and he turned suddenly to catch the girl beside him casting her eyes in his direction she dropped them quickly but her whole manner showed that she too was interested not only in the race but in what jack had said the cadets of course were in uniform so the girl knew they were from colby hall  the reel of current events had almost come to a finish and there was intense silence as the picture showed the funeral of some wellknown man of the east when there came a sudden splutter from the operators booth in the back gallery this was followed by several flashes of light and then a small explosion  whats that  some explosion  the theaters on fire  lets get out of this  thats right i dont want to be burnt to death  such were some of the exclamations which arose on the air a panic had seized the audience and like one person they leaped to their feet and began to fight to get out of the theater in a twinkling there was a crush in the aisles and several people came close to being knocked down and trampled upon  wheres my hat  get back theredont crush these children  see the smoke pouring in  open the side door somebody  keep cool keep cool yelled somebody from the gallery there is no fire keep cool but there was such a tumult below that scarcely anybody paid attention to these words  while many fought to get out the way they had come in others stormed towards the side doors of the playhouse meanwhile an illsmelling cloud of smoke drifted through the auditorium  with the first alarm the rover boys had leaped to their feet and almost by instinct the others looked to jack to see what he would do  oh oh is the place on fire cried the girl who had been sitting next to the oldest rover and she caught him by the arm  i dont know he answered something exploded in the operating room  oh let us get out came from one of the other girls  yes yes i dont want to be burnt up wailed a third  dont get excited warned jack i dont believe there is any great danger there is no fire down here and there seem to be plenty of doors  the fellow upstairs said to keep cool put in randy maybe it wont amount to much after all  most of the lights had gone out leaving the theater in almost total darkness  come on for the side door said jack thats the nearest way out  the smoke from above was now settling and this caused many to cough while it made seeing more difficult than ever jack pushed fred ahead of him holding one hand on his cousins shoulder while with the other hand he reached out and grasped the wrist of the girl who had been sitting beside him  you had better come this way he said and bring your friends along  all right but do hurry she pleaded i am so afraid that something will happen  oh ruth can we get out questioned the girl next to her  i dont know i hope so answered the girl addressed and then began to cough slightly for the smoke was steadily growing thicker  it was no easy matter to reach the side entrance for already half a hundred people were striving to get through a doorway not much over two feet wide the air was filled with screams and exclamations of protest and for the time being in the theater it was as if bedlam had broken loose  are we all here came from andy as with smarting eyes he tried to pierce the gloom  im here answered his twin  so am i came simultaneously from jack and fred  then jack turned to the girl who was now beside him  are all your friends with you  ii think so she faltered and then she added annie are alice and jennie with you  yes were all here came from somebody in the rear but oh do let us get out i can scarcely breathe  ive lost my hat wailed another  oh never mind your hat alice as long as we get out came from the girl who was next to jack  at last the crowd at the doorway thinned out and a moment later the four rovers pushing the girls ahead of them managed to get outside they found themselves in a narrow alleyway and from this hurried to the street beyond  oh how glad i am that we are out of there exclaimed the girl who had been sitting beside jack  im glad myself he added wiping away the tears which the smoke had started from his eyes  if only they all get out safely said one of the other girls  i dont know about that answered randy seriously it was a bad enough crush at that side door but i think it was worse at the front doors  by this time everybody seemed to be out of the theater an alarm of fire had been sounded and now a local chemical engine followed by a hook and ladder company came rushing to the scene there was for fully ten minutes a good deal of excitement but this presently died down when it was learned positively that there was no fire outside the metallic booth from which the pictures had been shown and where the small explosion had occurred  it wasnt much of an explosion explained the manager of the theater it was more smoke than anything else  yes and i yelled to the crowd that there was no fire and that they must keep cool added the man who had been operating the moving picture machine  in the excitement several people had been knocked down but fortunately nobody had been hurt a number of articles of wearing apparel had been left in the theater  i wish i could get my hat said the girl named alice wistfully i dont want to go back to school bareheaded  what kind of a hat was it questioned randy who stood beside her maybe i can get it for you and then after the girl had given him a description of the head covering he went off to question one of the theater men about it in a few minutes more he came back with the missing property  after randy returned the boys introduced themselves to the girls and learned that all of the latter were scholars at clearwater hall the leader of the party was ruth stevenson who had sat next to jack while her friends were annie larkins alice strobell jennie mason and may powell  i know a fellow named powell quite well remarked jack as the lastnamed girl was introduced he goes to our school his name is dick but we all call him spouter  dick powell is my cousin answered may and then she added smilingly ive heard of you rover boys before  yes and ive heard of you too broke in ruth stevenson  and who told you about us questioned jack  why a big boy at your schoolthe head of the football team  oh do you know gif garrison  yes i suppose you know him quite well  well i should say so declared jack why my cousin fred here is named after gif garrisons father his father and my father were school chums  oh why then we know a lot of the same people dont we how nice returned ruth stevenson and smiled frankly at jack  after that the talk between the boys and the girls became general and each crowd told the other of how matters were going at their own particular school  yes ive been up to colby hall several times to see the baseball and the football games said ruth to jack in answer to his question its certainly a splendid place  some day if you dont mind ill come over and take a look at clearwater hall he answered  clearwater hall say that must be a fine place to get a drink piped in andy and at this little joke all of the girls giggled     chapter xvii  the girls from clearwater hall   the rover boys remained with the girls from clearwater hall for the best part of half an hour after the scare at the moving picture theater and during that time the young folks became quite well acquainted  well have to be getting back to our school now said ruth stevenson presently  oh whats your hurry pleaded jack werent you going to stay to the pictures  no we were going to leave immediately after that reel they were showing when the explosion occurred the girl replied  well weve got to get back to colby hall in time for supper but we can make that easily enoughwe are all good walkers  i should think you would ride in your autostage put in alice strobell id ride if we had a stage handy  the stage isnt down here now answered randy it only comes on order  the four boys walked with the girls to the end of a side street of the town and there the pupils from clearwater hall stopped to say goodbye  we are very thankful for what you did for us at the theater said ruth stevenson you were very kind indeed  you are regular heroes burst out may powell who by her merry eyes showed that she was almost as full of fun as were the rover twins im going to write to spouter and let him know all about it  and dont forget to mention the rescue of my hat added alice strobell with a giggle  i hope i have the pleasure of meeting you again miss stevenson said jack in an aside to the oldest girl of the party  well maybe she returned looking at him frankly  ive enjoyed this afternoon very muchin spite of that excitement  oh so have i and now she cast down her eyes while a faint flush stole into her cheeks  we wont dare say much about that trouble in the theater when we get back to school remarked jennie mason  thats right burst out annie larkins if we did maybe miss garwood would refuse to let us attend any more performances  is miss garwood the head of your school questioned randy  yes and let me tell you she is a very particular and precise woman  i guess she isnt as precise and particular as one of our professors was andys comment  oh do you mean that teacher they call old lemon cried may powell  yes  weve met him a number of times what a ridiculous man he is i dont understand why colonel colby keeps him  i saw you look at me when i spoke about that boat race said jack to ruth stevenson maybe you like to be out on the water  oh i dovery much you know we have boats at the school and i often go out with my friends  i like to row myself perhaps some day youd like to go out with me went on the oldest rover boldly  id have to ask permission first answered the girl and then dropped her eyes evidently however the tentative invitation pleased her  as was to be expected the parting between the boys and the girls was a rather prolonged affair and it looked as if everybody was highly pleased with everybody else but at last annie larkins looked at a wrist watch she wore and gave a little shriek  oh girls we must be going we ought to be at the school this minute  then here is where we start the walking act declared may powell goodbye everybody and away she hurried leaving the others to trail behind her  dont forget about the row said jack in a low tone to ruth stevenson  ill rememberif i get the chance she returned and in a moment more all of the girls were gone and the boys retraced their steps to the center of the town  pretty nice bunch was randys comment  its funny that spouter powell never told us he had such a nice cousin came from fred  hello freds already smitten cried jack gaily  huh you neednt talk retorted the youngest rover how about yourself didnt i catch you trying to make a date with that ruth stevenson  oh say fred your ears are too big for your head retorted jack growing red while andy and randy looked at each other suggestively  by this time the excitement around the moving picture theater had died away completely and the crowd had disappeared the front doors were closed but the manager was just hanging out a sign to the effect that the evening performances would be given as usual  i guess it was a big scare for nothing was randys comment  the audience can be thankful that they got out without anybody being hurt returned jack  the boys made a few more purchases in haven point and then started back for colby hall  i wonder if those girls go to church in haven point on sundays remarked jack just before the hall was reached  i dont know answered andy more than likely his eyes began to twinkle thinking of going to church yourself jack  didnt we go to church when we were at home andy  sure was the prompt reply  i think we can find out from spouter or from some of the other cadets answered fred i know the boys are allowed to go to whatever church they please on sundays it may be as well to add here that on week days regular chapel exercises were held at colby hall before the ordinary classes were in session  from spouter jack received the information he desired which was to the effect that his cousin may and a number of her chums generally attended a church on the outskirts of haven point in the direction of clearwater hall  if you say so ill go with you there tomorrow morning continued spouter and so the matter was arranged at the church the cadets heard a very good sermon and after the services had the pleasure of strolling with the girls as far as the entrance to their school grounds  monday morning found the rovers once more down to the grind of lessons so far they had gotten along very well but on tuesday the unfortunate andy had another runin with asa lemm  this wont do at all rover stormed the professor after andy had given the wrong answer to a question you must pay more attention to your studies  im doing the best i can professor pleaded the youth  nonsense i dont believe a word of it they tell me you spend most of your time in horseplay now that wont do at all you must buckle down to your studies or i shall have to take you in hand and professor lemm glared at the lad as if ready to devour him  say andy youll have to toe the chalk mark after this whispered his twin if you  silence there i will have silence cried asa lemm pounding on his desk with a paper weight  ill have one grand smashup with that man some day was andys comment in speaking of the affair after the school session had closed i cant stand his arbitrary ways  oh hes a lemonand worse returned his brother  during that week there was an election of officers for the school battalion composed of company a and company b the rover boys being freshmen could not compete for any position even had they so desired but there was a good deal of electioneering among the cadets and the lads got quite a lot of fun out of it the announcement of who was elected was followed by a parade around the grounds and an unusually good supper in the mess hall then the boys were allowed to gather at one end of the parade ground near the river where they soon had several large bonfires burning around which they danced sang and cut up to their hearts content  the election had been a bitter disappointment to slugger brown and nappy martell each had wanted to be an officer of the battalion and each had failed to get the required number of votes  its that gif garrisonspouter powell crowd that did it muttered slugger brown i saw em working like troopers to defeat us  yes and those rover boys worked against both of you too piped in codfish who was present i watched em do it they went all around among the fellows they know electioneering for the others who were running  it would be just like them to do it muttered nappy martell gloomily  i thought you were going to fight that jack rover to a finish some day questioned the sneak of the school  so i amwhen i get the chance returned martell  as soon as the election of officers was settled the minds of a certain number of cadets turned to football gif garrison was busy arranging his teams and placing the names of the players up on a big board in the gymnasium  hurrah shouted fred bursting in on jack one afternoon while the latter was busy in his room studying the next days lessons our names are up on the board jack gif has put us up for a tryout on the scrub eleven  is that so exclaimed his cousin his face showing his satisfaction are you sure  i am i just came from the gymnasium we are to report for practice tomorrow afternoon at four oclock  is andy or randy up  no you remember they told gif they didnt want to play football this season  the rover boys soon learned that not only gif but also spouter ned lowe walt baxter and slugger brown were on the regular eleven the scrub team was made up largely from the freshmen class although dan soppinger and a few others of the older cadets who had never played on the first team were also included  now i want all of you to do your very best said gif at the close of a long talk to the boys on what was required of them well have nothing but squad work first and then a game or two just to find out how matters are shaping themselves  as an aid gif had mr crews the gymnasium instructor who in his younger days had been quite a football player between the pair matters took shape rapidly and by the end of the week the scrub was in shape to play a game against the regulars  as was to be expected this opening contest was a decidedly ragged one even the regular team making many plays which caused hearty laughter  you fellows have all got to do better if we want to win any matches declared gif now then go at it as if you meant it and see that you mind the rules and after that the playing showed gradual improvement  colonel colby had not forgotten his own football days and one afternoon he came down to the field to see what progress his pupils were making  be on the alert when the signals are given he said the signals he added count for a good deal  with the master of the school present the cadets put forth renewed efforts and the playing became actually snappy there were several wellearned runs and once jack managed to kick a goal from the field which brought forth considerable applause  keep it up jack youre doing fine were gifs encouraging words  thanks ill do the best i know how was the rejoinder  fred was also working hard and a little later he made a run which netted the scrub team fifteen yards  fine fine cried his cousin encouragingly  that was well played announced gif but i want every man on the field to do better than he has been doing he added stiffening up for he knew that a captain can only get out of his men the best that is in them by thus urging them on  during several of the plays jack had come into contact with slugger brown and the big fellow showed that he had no friendly feeling for the rover boy  you be careful warned jack when brown started once to tackle him unfairly but the big fellow merely grinned in a sarcastic fashion then less than two minutes later and while there was a wild rush on slugger brown by a sidelong and unexpected leap hurled jack to the ground and spiked him in the leg with his shoe     chapter xviii  slugger brown is exposed   to be thrown down so violently was bad enough but to be spiked in the leg hurt so much that jack could not repress a gasp of pain  get off of me brown he panted when he could speak what do you mean by spiking me that way  didnt spike you retorted slugger brown scowling viciously  the whistle blew and gif came running towards the pair whats the matter he demanded  brown tackled me unfairly and then spiked me answered jack  its false roared the accused one i threw him down according to the rules and i didnt spike him at all  the pain in jacks leg was so intense that he could hardly stand fred and some others came rushing to his assistance and between them he managed to hobble to a bench at the side of the football field a crowd began to collect and all wanted to know what had gone wrong  let us take a look at your leg rover said mr crews that will show whether you were spiked or not the limb was exposed and then a cry of dismay went up  why look thereits all bloody slugger brown must have spiked him for keeps  thats a shameif he did it on purpose he has no right to have spikes in his shoes  i didnt do it on purpose it was an accident cried the accused player i didnt know i had spiked him or that i had spikes maybe he cut himself on a stone or something like that  no he has been spiked announced the gymnasium instructor after examining the wound come rover well go to the gymnasium and ill attend to that and bind it up for you  you ought to be ashamed of yourself brown for doing such a thing to my cousin said fred  thats right broke in randy who had come up  you stop your talking answered slugger brown uneasily it was an accident i tell you anybody on the team might have done it  colonel colby had been on the other side of the field but now he came hurrying forward to see what was amiss he told mr crews to do everything that was necessary for jack and then turned to gif  i think it would be as well for you to retire brown for the present he said in a low voice  just what i was going to do answered the football captain quickly well have to investigate this matter after the game is over  i dont see why i should be put off the team cried slugger brown when notified that a substitute would take his place it was an accident and nothing else  well see about that later brown answered gif briefly anyway you had no right to have spikes on your shoes  with one substitute in place of brown and another playing jacks position the game went on and came to a finish in favor of the regular team by a score of 22 to 16  not such a very good showing for the regulars was gifs comment  maybe if jack had been in shape to play we might have beaten you remarked fred grimly  oh im not willing to admit that answered the football captain just the same some of you fellows on the scrub did very well indeed im going to continue to keep my eyes on all of you  down in the gymnasium the wound inflicted by the spikes in slugger browns shoe had been carefully washed and dressed by mr crews and then bandaged  i dont think youll have any great trouble from it rover remarked the gymnasium instructor but just the same you had better favor that leg for a few days  then you wouldnt advise me to play football questioned jack in dismay  not for the next few days after that i think youll be all right  as soon as the game was over gif aided by mr crews began an investigation closely questioning all of the players and those looking on who had seen the encounter between brown and jack of course there were various versions of the affair but the consensus of opinions seemed to be that the tackle had been an unfair one and that brown could have avoided spiking jack had he been more careful it was likewise considered unfair to use spiked shoes even in a practice game  i guess he did it just to be nasty said gif to mr crews you see he and nappy martell and that crowd are all down on the rovers  i know nothing about the quarrels between the cadets was mr crews reply but i do know that spiking anyone on purpose cannot be permitted in this institution i recommend garrison that brown be suspended from the team  this was going a little further than gif had anticipated he knew that brown was a fairly good player carrying considerable weight and that the cadets heart would be almost broken if he was taken out of the games entirely  dont you think mr crews it would be going far enough if i put him on the bench with the substitutes he pleaded to be thrown out of the team entirely is a terrible blow for any one  but we expect our cadets to act like young gentlemen and not like brutes garrison returned the gymnastic instructor warmly however if you wish to place brown among the substitutes i will not oppose you his weight might help you to win some game if it was running very close and some of your best players dropped out and so it was arranged  slugger brown had been very anxious to know what the outcome of the matter would be he was far from appeased when he received the notification that while he would be retained on the regular team it would be only as a substitute  a substitute eh he said sarcastically to gif so that is the way you are going to punish me for something that couldnt be helped  mr crews and i went into the details of the affair brown answered the football captain mr crews wanted to put you off the team entirely it was only through my efforts that you are to remain as a substitute  ive been the mainstay of our football eleven ever since it was organized stormed slugger brown i helped to win every victory that came our way  im not denying that you play well but just the same if youll remember youve been warned of your brutal attacks before in that game with hixley high last fall the left tackle said if you will remember that you ought to be handed over to the police now mr crews saysand i agree with himthat weve got to play in a cleancut fashion free from all needless brutality  bah i wont listen to you howled slugger brown youre in with those rovers and that whole crowd is down on me just because i am chummy with nappy martell i wont stand for it if i cant play on the regular team i wont play at all  very well then you can suit yourself about that answered gif and to avoid further argument he walked away leaving the big youth in anything but a pleasant frame of mind  the interview had taken place in the gymnasium and presently slugger brown was joined by nappy martell and three or four other cronies including codfish  its an outrage was martells comment when slugger had told of what had occurred i wouldnt stand for it no wonder you told him you wouldnt play on the eleven any more  a team that has got a captain like that doesnt deserve to win was the comment of one of the other cadets  say slugger why dont you get to work and see if you cant boost gif garrison out of his place he has no more right to be captain of the eleven than you have  easy enough to say growled brown but garrison has too many of the fellows under his thumb oh i dont carethey can go to grass with their old football games and then slugger brown stalked off by himself to nurse his wrath as best he could he was very bitter against jack  its all that rover boys fault he muttered to himself i dont wonder nappy is down on that crowd  the recent cold snap had given way to weather that was quite balmy and being unable to put in his off time in football practice jack remembered what he had said to ruth stevenson about a row on the river he consulted with fred and then the pair managed to get a message to both ruth and may powell and in return received word that the two girls would be pleased to go out the following afternoon about four oclock  gee you fellows will have a dandy time remarked randy when he heard of this why didnt you let us know  four in one of those rowboats is about enough answered jack but if you and andy want to go out why dont you get another boat and send word to a couple of the other girls  all right lets do it answered andy quickly and the upshot of the matter was that they telephoned over to clearwater hall and made an arrangement with alice strobell and annie larkins  its a shame we cant ask jennie mason too said randy who remembered the fifth girl who had been in the crowd at the moving picture theater  you wont have to worry about jennie answered alice strobell over the telephone she has a date with somebody else  the rover boys had already arranged about the boats and promptly on time they set off down the river in the direction of the lake they had to row past the several docks of the town and then drew up at a small wharf leading up to the clearwater hall grounds  when the girls appeared they were accompanied by one of the teachers who had been sent down evidently for the purpose of looking the cadets over  now remember do not stay out any later than six oclock said the teacher as the girls were entering the two rowboats assisted by the boys  oh well have to come back a little before that time answered jack you see we are due at colby hall at that hour  very well then said the teacher i trust you all have a pleasant time and she smiled  oh well have a good timedont worry sang out andy gaily  to be sure we will echoed may powell  and then with the girls safely seated in the two rowboats the boys took up the oars and the little outing on clearwater lake was begun     chapter xix  a squall on the lake   its too bad we dont happen to have a motor boat up here remarked jack as he and fred bent to the oars of their rowboat  you mustnt work too hard came from ruth  i wasnt thinking of that answered the oldest rover boy quickly i was only thinking if we had a motor boat we could go farther  they are going to have a motor boat or two at colby hall next springi heard colonel colby speaking about it put in fred  that will be very fine remarked may i suppose youll give us a ride once in a while she added her eyes twinkling  sure responded the youngest rover quickly  hiover there came from andy as he and his twin bent to the oars want to race  of courseif youd like to responded jack  oh a race exclaimed alice strobell wont that be fine  there wont be any danger will there questioned annie larkins anxiously  no danger whatever so long as we keep far enough apart answered randy and well do that because we expect to leave them far behind  not much you wont leave us behind retorted fred and then he added are you ready  wait a minute until we have the young ladies seated just right answered andy and then turning to the two girls in the boat with him he continued gaily now sit right in the center of the boat please and be sure to have your hair parted exactly in the middle and at this both girls shrieked with laughter  with their passengers seated to their satisfaction the four rovers prepared for the race  where are we going to race to questioned jack  i dont know answered randy can any of you tell me he went on appealing to the pupils from clearwater hall  you might race to the near end of foxtail island suggested ruth and pointed to an island some distance down the lake  that suits cried jack  the first one to reach the dock at the end of the island wins the race announced may  and whats the prize questioned fred  oh the prize will be the pleasure of rowing back answered may and at this little joke there was a general laugh  now please dont tip us overboard pleaded alice  nary a tip answered randy  were not looking for tips broke in andy quickly we are going to do this free gratis for nothing and at this pun there was another laugh then jack gave the signal and away the two rowboats started on the race  of course it was only a friendly affair and none of the boys rowed as hard as he would have done in a regular contest nevertheless each craft made good progress over the sparkling waters of the lake  oh my you certainly can row remarked ruth to jack and fred as their craft drew ahead  oh were not warmed up yet was jacks reply  we could do much better if we were in regular rowing togs explained fred  hi you what do you mean by going ahead piped out randy come on andy or theyll beat us  maybe they can beat a drum but they cant beat us cried andy  and then he and his twin increased their strokes so that presently their boat was once more beside the other  the girls were as much interested as the boys in the impromptu race and they soon began to shout words of encouragement  pull pull were going to win cried may  not a bit of it our boat will get there first sang out alice  you cant beat us came from annie  he crows best who crows last cried ruth  right you are came pantingly from jack and then as he saw the look of encouragement in ruths face he redoubled his efforts fred did the same and when they came into plain view of the tiny dock at the end of foxtail island their boat was two full lengths ahead of the other  hi you what kind of a race is this anyhow shouted out andy gaily why dont you keep side by side and be sociable  sour grapes roared fred here is where we win and in a moment more he and jack sent their boat up to the side of the little dock almost immediately the second craft followed  i think all of you did very well remarked ruth consolingly  anyway we came in a close second remarked randy  we would have won if it hadnt been for one thingjust one thing remarked andy solemnly  why what was that questioned several of the others quickly  that was the fact that the other boatandy drew a deep breathcame in first at this the girls shrieked with laughter and the other boys set up a howl  pitch him into the lake  thats right give him a bath  a ducking will do him goodhe needs to be cooled off  not much no bath for me cried andy quickly and lost no time in leaping to the dock where in the exuberance of his spirits he turned several handsprings much to the amusement of the girls  is there anything worth seeing on this island questioned jack when the excitement of the race was over  there isnt anything here that i know of answered ruth in the summer time people come here to picnic there is a nice spring of water in the center of the island  lets go and get a drink said fred that race made me thirsty and off the whole party trooped to the spring  the young folks had a good time at the spring and in exploring the little island which had a hill at one end covered with trees they found some chestnuts and also a few hickory nuts and these the boys opened for the girls benefit  i suppose we had better go on and finish the row remarked jack to ruth presently that is unless you girls would rather wander through the woods  oh its nice enough here on the island she answered remember youll have quite a row back to the school and then to colby hall  oh lets stay here for a while put in alice maybe well be able to find more nuts  they hunted around and presently discovered another large chestnut tree which was fairly loaded the boys threw up sticks and stones and brought down a big shower  if i had known this we might have brought along a pillowcase for the nuts said fred  we can come back some day if we want to returned randy  before leaving the island the young folks decided to go back to where the spring was located so as to get another drink and also to wash their hands on this trip in speaking about the excitement at the moving picture theater randy chanced to mention jennie masons name  jennie is a nice girl answered annie larkins to whom he was speaking but she does some things that i do not approve of do you know a cadet at your hall named napoleon martelli think they call him nappy for short  do we know him exclaimed randy i should say we did  oh is that so annie looked at him searchingly is he a friend of yours  no i cant say that he is to tell you the truth he doesnt like us at all  if thats the case i dont mind speaking to you about jennie went on the girl you know jennie comes from new york city and down there she met nappy martell quite a few times and they became well acquainted but jennies folks dont approve of him at all and they dont want her to go with him and here annie paused  and do you mean to say she does go with him anyhow queried the rover boy  yes she goes out to meet him whenever she can get the chance was the reply you are sure you dont approve of him  not in the least in fact to tell the truth we have no use for him or the bunch he trains with  i see well all of us think it is perfectly dreadful the way jennie accepts martells invitations of course we dont want to tell on her either in school or to her folks and yet none of us think it is right  does he take her out much  oh as much as they dare to go he takes her out sailing on the lake and to the moving picture shows and once they went off together on a picnic to the clearwater country club the places were all right in themselves but i know jennies folks dont want her to be seen in the company of nappy martell he is so loud and forward  you cant tell us anything about martell being loud and forward answered randy readily we all know him to be a regular bully besides that when he isnt in uniform he wears the loudest kind of clothesjust as if he wanted to make an exhibition of himself  jennie went out with him this afternoon continued annie where they went to i do not know but i think they hired a motor boat and went across the lake  does martell know how to run a motor boat  oh yes he told jennie that he owned a motor boat on the hudson rivera boat his father gave him for a birthday present  randy and the girl had dropped a little behind the others who now waited for them to come up  i think we had better be getting back said jack it isnt as clear as it was before and it is beginning to blow  yes well get back returned randy with a look at the sky he knew that a blow on the lake might be no trifling matter  on the way over to the island the sun had been clear and warm now however it was hidden under a dark bank of clouds which were coming up quickly from the west the wind was already blowing freely and out on the bosom of the lake the water was roughing up in tiny ripples  all aboard everybody sang out jack and then turning to his cousins he added in a low voice we mustnt lose a minute of time in getting back this blow is going to be a heavy one  the girls were soon seated in the rowboats and then the four rovers lost no time in casting off from the little dock and in starting to row towards clearwater hall as they proceeded the sky kept growing darker and darker while the wind grew stronger and stronger  were in for a squall all right enough murmured randy as he and andy bent to their oars with vigor  gee i only hope we can reach the shore before it strikes us was the response  row for all youre worth boys sang out jack from the other boat bend to it just as if you were in a race  and then he and fred as well as the twins settled down to the task of trying to outrace the oncoming squall     chapter xx  in great peril   as those who have had any experience know a squall on a lake encircled by hills sometimes comes up very quickly and this is what happened in the present case hardly had the two rowboats covered a quarter of the distance to the shore when the wind came whistling across the bosom of the lake sending the whitecaps tumbling in all directions  oh dear just look how rough the water is getting remarked ruth in alarm  and how the wind is blowing added may  in the other boat the girls were even more fearful and andy and randy had all they could do to make them sit still  dont shift pleaded randy we dont want to ship any water  oh dear if only we were safe on shore wailed alice  i didnt think it looked like a storm when we left the school added annie in dismay  this is only a squall it may blow itself out in a few minutes returned randy although to himself he admitted that the squall looked as though it might last for some time  battling as best they could against the wind and the whitecaps the rover boys strove to reach the shore in the vicinity of the girls school but the wind was blowing directly down clearwater lake and threatened more than once to capsize them  gee jack this is getting serious panted fred as he looked questioningly at his cousin  the same thought had come into the minds of each of the boys could the girls swim they wished they knew but did not dare to ask any questions for fear of further alarming their passengers  i guess we had better head up into the wind its the safest thing to do cried jack and then raising his voice to be heard above the whistling of the elements he added head up dont take those waves sideways head up  the others understood and in a minute more both of the boats were heading directly into the wind this prevented either of the craft from swamping but caused the spray to hit the bow more than once sending a shower of water over everybody  oh dear im getting wet wailed may  do you think you can reach shore questioned ruth of jack and her wideopen eyes showed her terror  we cant head for the school just now he answered well have to keep pulling up against the wind until it lets up a little  oh but we shant upset shall we came from spouter powells cousin  i dont think so anyway we are going to do our best to prevent it answered fred  keeping as close together as they dared the two rowboats continued to head up into the wind which still blew as hard as ever in the sky the clouds were shifting and jack and his cousins had great hopes that ere long the sudden squall would blow itself out  here comes a motor boat up behind us cried ruth presently  all looked in that direction and saw a fairsized craft coming up the lake she was making good speed in spite of the whitecaps and was sending the spray flying in all directions  i think that is the boat jennie mason was going out in remarked annie to randy yes i am sure it is she added a minute later as the motor boat came closer there is mr martell at the wheel now  the discovery that nappy martell was running the oncoming motor boat had also been made by those occupying the other rowboat  its martell and there is slugger brown with him cried fred  isnt one of those girls miss mason questioned jack  yes and ida brierley one of our girls is with her answered ruth her manner indicated that the discovery did not altogether please her  maybe we can get that motor boat to pull us in suggested may they could do it easily enough  so they could answered fred but i doubt if those two fellows who are running it would like to undertake the job they go to colby hall but they are no friends of ours  yes but they ought not to let their enmity stand between us in a time like this said jack if they were in the rowboats and i was in the motor boat id give them help quick enough  as the motor boat drew nearer it prepared to pass close to the craft manned by jack and fred as it came closer jennie mason gave a cry of surprise  oh look look there are those rover boys and some of our girls are with them  im glad i am not out in a rowboat said ida brierley id be afraid of getting a good ducking  ahoy there on the motor boat sang out fred as the craft came alongside cant you fellows give us a tow we have plenty of rope  this motor boat wasnt built for towing answered nappy martell roughly  were having a terrible time of it against this wind put in jack he would not have asked for assistance on his own account but he was thinking of the girls he knew that all of them were badly frightened  oh yes please tow us in came from may  yes please do added ruth  its so far to the shore came from annie  and were afraid well get wet through and through cried alice  you ought to do something for them declared jennie mason who had herself become frightened over the roughness of the lake  im not going to tow those rovers in muttered nappy martell you wouldnt do it would you slugger  not much let em take care of themselves was the heartless answer  oh but they may be drowned gasped jennie  nothing of the sort this is only a little wind and it will soon die down if those rovers have to break their backs rowing it will do em good  if you dont tow us in youll be the meanest fellow on earth sang out andy  i wouldnt have your disposition for a million dollars added his twin  aw go chase yourselves retorted slugger brown heartlessly  were not helping fellows like you came from nappy martell then the motor boat passed on and was soon all but lost in the distance  of all the mean people cried ruth  i shouldnt think jennie mason would stand for such meanness declared may nor ida brierley either  the motor boat having gone on and left them to their fate the rover boys continued pulling on the oars it was hard laborious work and soon andy and fred were all but exhausted jack and randy however had now gotten their second wind so to speak and they continued their efforts with unabated vigor  it was as mean as dirt for them to leave us out here when they could have towed us in with ease panted fred just you waitill let the whole school know of this  dont talk save your wind we can talk afterwards returned his cousin  the next quarter of an hour was one which none of the girls or boys ever forgot the rovers continued to battle with the wind and the waves with all the energy left to them while the girls crouched down on the seats almost speechless with fear occasionally the waves would hit the bow of one rowboat or the other sending a shower of water over the occupants  ithinkitsletting upabit panted jack presently and glanced up at the sky  oh if only it would breathed ruth  the boat containing the others had dropped slightly behind but now jack and fred held back until it was once more alongside  oh did you ever see such a storm wailed alice  i dont think ill ever want to go out in a rowboat again was annies bitter comment  i think the wind is beginning to die down said ruth encouragingly  letushopeso came in jerks from jack he was still rowing but his arms felt as if they were being torn from their sockets  they had now covered nearly half the distance to the upper end of the lake but they were just as far from the western shore as ever now however as the wind began to die down they turned slightly in the direction of haven point  it wont matter where we land declared ruth we can easily walk back to the school  the sun was still under a cloud but now the wind went down more than ever the surface of the lake however was still much troubled and the boys had all they could do to make any progress towards the shore  oh you must be very tired said ruth to jack  nevermindwellreachshoresomehow he answered then she said no more because she knew it was painful for him to speak  the four boys continued to row on and in about a quarter of an hour came within plain view of the shore at a point some distance beyond clearwater hall and the town  oh look something is the matter down by the lumber yards remarked alice presently see the men running she pointed and those in both rowboats looked in that direction  i dont see anything wrong said ruth  i do cried may and gave a little shriek look look a whole lot of lumber is drifting this way  somethingbrokenlose gasped jack maybealumberraft  and that was just what had happened in a manner to be explained later a lumber raft being towed up the lake by a steam tug had not only broken away but likewise had broken apart and the timbers which had composed it were now floating around over a large area of clearwater lake  in another minute the two rowboats were in the very midst of the drifting timbers and in great danger of being upset     chapter xxi  assistance refused   my gracious look at the lumber floating around  be careful boys dont get hit if you can help it  one of those timbers is heavy enough to send us to the bottom  oh dear do you think well be smashed up  such were some of the cries which rent the air as the rover boys and the girls with them found themselves in the midst of the wreckage from the brokenapart lumber raft  on all sides of them heavy sticks of timber were bobbing up and down on the whitecaps and presently one of these bumped into the craft occupied by jack and fred and two of the girls the rowboat careened so much that quite a large quantity of water was shipped which made ruth and may scream in fright  stand up in the bow fred and see if youcanwardthemoff gasped jack as well as his semiexhausted condition would permit ill stick totheoars  he knew he must keep the rowboat headed up into the wind for the squall had not yet subsided sufficiently to allow of their taking it sidewise  a moment later came a cry from the other rowboat as the craft slipped up and over several large sticks of timber  illustration the craft slipped up and over several large sticks of timber page 207  gosh that was a narrow escape was andys comment as the craft finally righted itself  oh dear if only we were on shore once more wailed annie for at least the tenth time  i never dreamed that we would have such a dreadful experience as this came from alice  randy said nothing but continued to row while andy did the same as fred was doing both trying their best to ward off the heavy sticks which came floating towards them every minute or two  not far away was a steam tug and presently two other boats came from the shore both bent upon saving all that was possible of the brokenapart lumber raft  well pick you up if you have much trouble cried the captain of the steam tug as he ran a course between the two rowboats but dont ask us to do it unless its necessary for we want to round up this floating lumber before it gets away from us if it can be done  thank you gasped out jack in return maybe we canmaketheshore the wind seemstobegoingdown  sure well make it put in randy the fright of the girls in his boat had somewhat nettled him and he was resolved to land them safely without assistance  but it was a time of peril as well as exhausting effort and all of the rovers were glad enough when the last of the drifting lumber was passed and they came within hailing distance of the shore the wind had now gone down considerably and most of this was to be felt farther out on the lake  let us take them right down to the school dock sang out randy we can turn down the lake and the wind will be just strong enough to help us and so it was arranged  when the two rowboats came within sight of the school dock those on board found fully a dozen of the scholars there along with two of the teachers  are you safe cried one of the teachers as soon as the boats came within hailing distance  yes miss glover we are all right answered ruth  only we are rather wet added may  and im awfully glad to get back broke in annie who was fairly shivering over her trying experience  well anyway i think you cadets did perfectly splendid remarked alice  indeed they did broke out ruth quickly i dont believe anyone could have managed these boats better and she bestowed a glance of admiration first on jack and then on his cousins  it was a terrible blow and it came up so quickly that we all grew alarmed for your safety said miss glover  and then to think that you must get mixed up with that drifting lumber put in the other teacher the squall was bad enough without having anything like that happen  its too bad the lumbermen had their big raft go apart like that was jacks comment i guess those big sticks of timber are worth a good deal of money  they couldnt have had the raft chained together very tightly said miss glover who had come from a lumbering community where rafting was frequent i never heard of a raft going to pieces like that  well i dont know much about lumber rafts answered jack  say cant we leave our two rowboats here and ride back to the hall questioned randy i dont want to do any more rowing if i can help it  of course you can leave your boats here answered miss glover and she showed where the craft might be stowed away in the boathouse all of the rovers were glad enough to give up further work at the oars  i am awfully sorry our little outing turned out as it did remarked jack to ruth  and it was too bad to frighten you so added randy to all of the girls  oh it wasnt your fault that the squall came up answered ruth and besides that now it is over i think i rather enjoyed the adventurethat is ill enjoy telling about it she corrected  some day i hope well be able to spend a nicer time together said jack  perhaps murmured ruth and blushed  before the rovers left for colby hall they asked if jennie mason and ida brierley had returned  they have not come back yet answered one of the teachers we saw them going up the lake against the wind we were a little bit worried but i presume the motor boat can take care of itself in quite a blow  all theyve got to do is to turn on the gasolene while in a rowboat sometimes a fellows muscles give out was andys comment and this caused a smile  after bidding the girls and the others goodbye the four rovers walked towards the town there they were fortunate enough to find the hall autostage and were soon at the school once more  gee but my arms ache was freds remark on the way the muscles hurt so i can hardly keep still  youd better bathe them well with witch hazel or alcohol returned jack my muscles feel sore too  it took the wind right out of me came from andy funny toowith so much wind all around he added merrily  i cant help but think of how martell and brown treated us said randy seriously it was as mean as dirt  i believe they would have left us there to drown added fred  oh i wouldnt like to think that of them broke in jack just the same it was a very dirty thing to do not on our account so much as on account of the girls  when the boys got back the first person they met was spouter who wanted to know how his cousin may had enjoyed the outing he listened in some alarm to the story the rovers had to relate  it was a narrow shave all right was the comment and then his face took on a stern look and to think nappy martell and slugger brown treated you that way those fellows ought to be run out of this school  the squall on the lake had been noticed by some of the other cadets who had been out on the river and the news soon spread of the danger into which the rovers and their companions had run gif ned walt and several others wanted to know the particulars of the affair and all were loud in their denunciation of the cadets who had been running the motor boat  spouter is right declared gif those fellows ought to be run out of colby hall  after this i want nothing more to do with them added ned  i wonder what they would say if some of you had been drowned remarked walt  makes me want to pitch into em came from fatty who was present but then in one way its a pity to dirty ones hands on such cattle as that  of course the rover boys had come in late for supper professor lemm had started to find fault with andy and fred for this but he was quickly stopped by colonel colby who had come up to learn the particulars of what had occurred  i heard you were out in that big blow remarked the colonel i trust none of you suffered from it  well we had rather a narrow escape answered fred then he and andy gave a brief outline of what had happened not forgetting to mention how martell and brown had left them to their fate  too bad too bad murmured the colonel shaking his head slightly i did not think that any of our cadets would do such a thing and then he walked away in a very thoughtful mood  i wonder what hell say to brown and martell mused fred as after being dismissed by professor lemm they hurried to the mess hall as they were late they had missed the parade  maybe hell give em a piece of his mind i hope he does answered his cousin  nappy martell and slugger brown did not appear until supper was almost over both had a gloomy look as if something had gone decidedly wrong they glared sourly at the rover boys and their chums and then sat down to their meal without saying a word to anybody  ill wager something slipped a cog with them whispered fred to jack  ive got an idea returned the oldest of the rover boys maybe jennie mason and that other girl who were out in the motor boat gave them a piece of their mind for not aiding us  oh i hope they did jack  it wouldnt be anything to wonder at that jennie mason seemed to be a nice girl and i dont think she would stand for any such meanness  jacks surmise concerning what had happened to nappy and slugger was correct the two girls had pleaded with the two cadets to go back and give those in the rowboats aid and after much argument in which nappy and slugger had proved that they were anything but young gentlemen the girls had politely asked to be taken ashore this had brought on something of a quarrel and in the end the two cadets had taken the girls to a dock near the lumber yards and quite a distance from clearwater hall  now you can have the fun of walking to the school had been nappy martells final words  and i dont think youll go out with us again in a hurry slugger brown had added  ill never go out with you again ida brierley had answered  and id much prefer to walk to the school alone than to ride any further with you in the motor boat jennie mason had added and thus the four had parted the two girls resolving in their hearts never to have anything more to do with nappy martell and slugger brown     chapter xxii  the meeting with hixley high   football talk now filled the air at colby hall and for the time being most of the cadets forgot about how the rovers had been treated on the lake by nappy martell and slugger brown  nappy was particularly angry because of the way he had been treated by jennie mason on whom he had been sweet ever since they had become acquainted slugger too was hurt over what the girls had said about his meanness but he was far more put out over the fact that he could act only as a substitute on the regular eleven and that gif garrison had finally concluded to put jack in his place fred had not won out for the first eleven but gif had told him he stood so high on the scrub that he might possibly make the team before the season came to an end  its all those rovers fault growled slugger brown to martell  of course it is was the unreasonable reply ill tell you slug we ought to do something to get square with those chaps  if i break loose and do that itll be something theyll remember as long as they live declared slugger brown vehemently  nappy martell looked at his crony knowingly and then glanced around to see if anybody was listening  lets do it right now slug he said in a low voice i dont care what it is so long as we can get the best of those rovers  well think it over nap this isnt to be any onecent everyday affair you know  right you are im game for anythingjust remember that added the other cadet  as gif garrison had said there were three football games scheduled for colby hall that fall the first of these was to be with hixley high school located in a town at the other end of the lake then would follow a game of more importance with the clearwater country club at their beautiful grounds on the outskirts of haven point and then the last and most important game of allthat with columbus academy located about ten miles away whether the last named game would be played at colby hall or at the columbus academy grounds was still a question  in a few days jack recovered completely from the spiking he had received from slugger brown and then he went at his football practice with greater vigor than ever he took sluggers place on the regular eleven as already mentioned and in his first game they beat the scrub team by a score of 32 to 12  now thats better declared gif you didnt let the scrub walk all over you  fred had been on the scrub team and although that eleven had been defeated he was in a rather happy frame of mind for the reason that out of the twelve points scored he had been directly responsible for six points  i think fred is going some remarked jack to gif later on when he had a chance to speak to the football captain privately  youre right jack was the answer and ive got my eye on him  the game with hixley high was not a very important one yet it was made the occasion for quite a gala day by not only the boys of both schools but likewise the girls attending the high school and also the young ladies of clearwater hall the rover boys and some of their chums invited ruth and her several friends including jennie mason and ida brierley to be present and this invitation was gladly accepted  i dont wonder that slugger brown and nappy martell look so glum occasionally remarked spouter to jack the day after the invitations had been given and accepted i just had a talk with my cousin may and she says jennie mason and ida brierley are through with those two cadets they told nappy and slugger they thought they were nothing but cowards for the way they treated you rovers on the lake  well im glad theyve given up going with that pair announced jack  the last game with hixley high had been played on the grounds of that institution so that the game this year was to take place at colby hall  you fellows will have the honor of bringing the girls over from clearwater hall remarked jack to his cousins and his chums ill have to stay here and do a bit of practising  the autostage and a number of automobiles and carriages had been requisitioned and also a number of motor boats on the lake and in these the young folks from hixley high school and from clearwater hall journeyed to colby hall  jack was on the lookout for ruth and the others and lost no time in greeting the girl as soon as she appeared  im so glad that youre on hand to encourage us to win said he as he took ruths hand  thank you but how are you sure i am here to encourage you she questioned mischievously maybe im going to root for hixley high  you dare he returned earnestly and then they both laughed and hurried towards the grandstand where seats had been reserved for the entire party  whoop her up for hixley high was the cry and then those in favor of the high school took up the slogan      do or die     hixley high hixley high  they mean to win if yelling will do it was may powells comment  oh i guess the cadets of colby hall can yell too responded fred and he was right for a moment later there boomed out this refrain      who are we     cant you see     colby hall     dum dum dum dum dum     here we come with fife and drum     colby colby colby hall  and this the cadets repeated over and over again until they were hoarse  well ive got to go now said jack reluctantly as word came for the team to gather in the dressing room for final instructions  goodbye then said ruth sweetly and then looking jack full in the eyes she added earnestly oh i do hope youll win  they were simple words but the way in which they were spoken and the look that accompanied them thrilled the youth to the heart and he went down to the dressing room on feet that seemed to be walking on air  now then boys i expect every one of you to do his level best said gif hixley high has been bragging everywhere that it has a superior team this year and is going to walk all over us i want you to play with vigor from the very start and then followed a number of directions concerning plays and signals to all of which his eleven listened earnestly  when the colby hall team came forth they were given a loud round of applause and this was repeated when hixley high showed itself the high school boys were nearly all seniors and a glance sufficed to show that player for player they were quite a few pounds heavier than the cadets  if our eleven wins this game they will be going some was fattys whispered comment to a fellow cadet  youre right there was the answer those chaps certainly look pretty husky  it is not my intention here to give the particulars of this game with hixley high interesting as it proved to be it was not the big game of the seasonthat was to come later during the first quarter the playing on both sides was rather rough and ragged each school doing its best to wear its opponent out at the very start in these onslaughts the weight carried by hixley high told so that when the whistle blew the score was 6 to 3  hurrah hurrah came from the supporters of the high school and again and again they boomed out with their slogan  this game isnt over yet cried one of the followers of colby hall  we havent begun to play yet just watch us in the second half added another cadet  oh dear i thought colby hall would score sure pouted ruth  those hixley high boys are awfully big fellows answered may  the second quarter opened with a good deal of cheering for each side the playing now became more settled and the ball went back and forth from the 20yard line on one side to the 30yard line on the other then came a mixup in the midst of which jack managed to get the ball and start with it for the goal  rover has it  run jack run leg it for all youre worth  and jack did run making the best of his opportunity three of the hixley high players did their utmost to down him but when the third laid him low he was directly over the chalk mark  a touchdown was the cry from the colby hall cadets and then they gave vent to their feelings by tooting their horns and sounding their rattles  the touchdown was followed by a skilful kick for goal and with this in their favor colby hall went at the game with renewed vigor so that when the whistle blew for the ending of the second half the score stood 13 to 6 in favor of colby hall  thats the way to do it  keep it up boys  oh wasnt that a splendid run by jack cried ruth enthusiastically  it certainly was answered one of the other girls  with the score piling up against them hixley high grew fairly frantic in the third quarter as a consequence their play became rougher than ever and twice they had to be called to order and once they were penalized but their vigor told and in spite of all colby hall could do to hold them back they gained constantly and when the end of the third quarter was reached the score was a tie  thirteen to thirteen what do you think of that  some playing eh  each side cheered its own but many were the anxious faces when the two elevens lined up for the final quarter  now then boys dig into them cried mr crews earnestly show them what colby hall can do  watch emwatch em closely cautioned gif they may try to pull off some new stunt at the last minute  once more the two teams went at it hammer and tongs it was certainly a battle royal and on more than one occasion it looked as if some of the players might be seriously injured as it was hixley high had to put in one substitute and colby hall took on two but the fighting blood of the cadets was now up and with a great rush they carried the ball over the hixley high line they failed however to kick the goal much to the regret of their followers  never mind boys said gif encouragingly hold em now that is all i ask of youhold em  and hold them colby did although the high school lads fought like demons to carry the ball across the cadets territory back and forth went the play the crowd meanwhile yelling itself hoarse the ball was on the colby hall 15yard line when the whistle blew and the game was over  colby hall wins  hurrah hurrah  then the horns and rattles sounded out louder than ever and in a twinkling the football field was alive with visitors and the triumphant eleven was surrounded     chapter xxiii  target practice   colby hall prepared for a great celebration that night in honor of their victory over hixley high boxes and barrels had been stored away in anticipation of just such an occasion and these were brought out and stacked up at a safe place along the river front  bonfires tonightand big ones too cried andy and let off his surplusage of spirits by turning several handsprings  look out andy cried fred or some circus will capture you  sour grapes retorted the funloving youth  oh it was grandthe way you held hixley high back in that last quarter remarked ruth to jack i was so afraid they would break through and score i could hardly wait for the whistle to blow  it was certainly some game answered jack you see they are so much heavier than we are  the victorious eleven came in for all sorts of congratulations and jack was slapped on the back until the wind was almost knocked out of him as soon as he could escape from his friends he and the others took the girls down to a waiting automobile and set off for clearwater hall on the way the young folks sang and cut up to their hearts content having the best possible time  the only cadet at colby hall who was not elated over the victory was slugger brown even though two substitutes had been used in the game and even though the big fellow had repented of his former decision and agreed to play if called upon gif had ignored him and used a player at least ten pounds lighter in weight  he doesnt intend to give me a showand thats all there is to it remarked slugger to nappy martell bitterly  well you told him you wouldnt play unless you could go out at the start of the game answered his crony  i told him that first but afterwards i agreed to go in as a sub growled brown but i can see how it isthose rovers have told garrison how we acted on the lake and so garrison has made up his mind to ignore me entirely even though ive got the weight and can play as good as any of them  oh i dont doubt but what its the rovers fault retorted martell and that puts me in mindare we going to do anything to get square or not  dont worry about that napwell do something all right enough but i want the chance first to think up something that will be worth while answered slugger brown emphatically  the bonfires along the river were lit directly after supper after the cadets had received permission from colonel colby the boys were allowed to do about as they pleased the only stipulation being that they should avoid anything that might be dangerous or ungentlemanly  with the bonfires blazing high throwing a lurid glare over the campus and parade grounds the cadets sang and danced and then started an impromptu parade which took them around the various buildings of the school many carried torches while four had drums and bugles there was a good deal of horseplay and also something in the way of hazing  here is where we get back at codfish for some of his meanness cried randy as he and some of the others caught the sneak  then codfish was made to stand up on an unusually large barrel and sing after which he was told to hold out each hand for a valuable present  i dont want any present i want to get down cried the sneak  oh this is something very valuable codfish returned randy and winked at some of the others  just for the fun of it some of the cadets had obtained some potatoes from the storehouse and started to roast these under one of the bonfires two of the potatoes quite hot and black were brought forth and thrust into codfishs hands  ouch what do you mean by handing me redhot potatoes yelled the sneak in alarm  oh we thought you were hungry cried one of the other cadets  you wanted to burn methats what you wanted to do shrieked codfish who however was far more scared than hurt i want to get down  youve got to give us a dance first codfish ordered randy  thats right give us a jig put in andy  make it a boston sevenstep suggested jack  or a washington dip added fred  a dozen of the cadets were shouting at poor codfish to dance and presently the excited boy commenced to shuffle his feet  now jump up three times and well let you go cried randy  codfish made one leap into the air and came down on the barrel top successfully then he tried a second leap but as randy well knew the barrel top was weak and with a crash poor codfish went down straight into the big barrel up to his armpits  whoop codfish has busted the barrel cried fred  what do you mean by breaking up housekeeping like that codfish demanded andy  lets do the baker act for him went on randy quickly  the baker act queried several of the cadets whats that  dont you know the baker loves his rolls answered andy with a broad grin  thats the talk came in a shout lets give codfish a roll and before the sneak could save himself the barrel was tipped up on its side and sent rolling over and over towards the parade ground  ouch let up ill be killed screamed the victim this barrel may have a lot of nails in it  oh do you think thats true asked one of the cadets in fright  nary a nail i saw to that before we used the barrel answered randy such a rolling wont hurt him a bit and the cadets continued their sport with the barrel finally sending it down a slight hill in the direction of the river here it lodged against some bushes and codfish was allowed to crawl forth at once he took to his heels and disappeared  it was noticed by many that slugger brown and nappy martell had not participated in the festivities of the evening the two had gone off for a walk during which they smoked many cigarettes and talked over their grievances against the rovers on their return they were met by codfish who related to them his tale of woe  oh weve got to do something was nappy martells comment if we dont before we know it the rovers will be fairly running this school  well they wont run me growled slugger brown  the following monday found the rover boys once more hard at work over their studies they had now settled down to the regular routine of the hall and were doing very well not only in their classes but also in their training as young soldiers each of them could march and handle a gun as well as anybody and now they were given the privilege of practising at target shootingsomething which interested them greatly  lets get up a little match among ourselves said randy one day and this was agreed upon eight new cadets entering the contest  the shooting was done at a target set up against a tree some distance behind the gymnasium building and the boys did their practising under the direction of captain dale  it requires considerable practice to become an expert shot said the military instructor once in a while we find someone who is a naturalborn sharpshooter but that is very rare some of the best shots in the army are men who at the start hardly knew how to handle firearms  at this target practice a perfect score would have netted twentyfive points the contest went on merrily and at the conclusion it was found that andy had scored ten points randy twelve jack eighteen and fred nineteen one other cadet a youth named lewis barrow had scored twenty  well the prize goes to barrow cried jack  yes but we came pretty close to winning cried fred with justifiable pride  you and jack neednt complain was andys comment eighteen and nineteen points out of a possible twentyfive is going some especially for beginners  if i win the prize what is it questioned lewis barrow a tall lanky youth with a rather leathery face he came from the far west and knew much more about firearms than did the rovers  oh the prize is first choice of holes in half a dozen doughnuts snickered andy  holes in doughnuts replied barrow who was not overbright suffering buffaloes what would a fellow do with holes out of doughnuts and at this there was a little laugh  for beginners i think you have all done very well remarked captain dale the lowest score i see is nine last year when the new cadets went at practice we had several fellows who didnt hit the target  gee id hate to go hunting with such chaps was andys dry comment a fellow would have to get right directly in front of em to be sure of not being hit and this remark made even the military instructor laugh  ill be proud of all of you said major ralph mason when he heard of the scores that had been made first thing you know well have a company of genuine sharpshooters  this practising at a target will come in fine if we get a chance to do any hunting this winter remarked fred wow just think what would have happened if that target had been a deer or even a partridge  a deer or a partridge isnt apt to stand still returned randy if you want to become expert as a hunting shot youll have to practise at a swinging target  well thats to come later so captain dale said was the answer  say lets go out hunting some day when the season opens cried jack id like first rate to bag something even if it were only a few rabbits  thats the talk answered fred quickly as soon as the hunting season opens lets go out by all means  the target practice had been witnessed by slugger brown and nappy martell now when jack and fred spoke of hunting slugger browns face became thoughtful  i think i see a way to square accounts with those rovers he remarked to his crony from now on im going to watch em pretty closely if ever they do go out hunting i think well be able to put one over on em theyll never forget     chapter xxiv  the fun of halloween   halloween tomorrow night boys so get ready for some real fun  right you are andy remember what fun we had last year in new york  and what fun we had down on the farm two years ago scaring aleck pop and jack ness nearly to death broke in fred  i dont know whether theyll let us have any fun around colby hall or not remarked jack but in such a tone of voice that all of the others knew he was fooling  several days had passed since the target practice and the boys were gathered in the room used by andy and randy for studying all were deep in a discussion of what they might do on halloween when there came a knock on the door and dan soppinger came in  excuse me for interrupting you commenced dan but im up against a hard proposition can any of you tell me  gee the human question mark is at it again broke out randy  certainly we can tell you put in andy but please dont ask it  three and three make six three and three always have made six and three and three always will make six cried fred in a girlish tone of voice so whats the use of asking a question like that  who said anything about three and three making six snorted the human question mark what i was going to say was can any of you tell me  when nero discovered the north pole interrupted andy  no he wants to know when washington first crossed the pacific in a motor boat came from fred  no that isnt it at all declared jack seriously dan wants to know what kind of an automobile noah took on the ark  great scott what do you take me for groaned dan soppinger helplessly here i come in to ask you a perfectly simple question and you start with a lot of foolishness  why my dear dan we are helping you all we can cried andy in deeply injured tones  i want to know when florida was first settled and by whom cried dan desperately i bet ten cents none of you know  oh thats easy dan answered andy gravely florida was first settled by the alligators in the year one and at this remark there was such a burst of laughter that the human question mark gave it up in despair and fled  ive got a great scheme for halloween said andy a little later he had been walking up and down the room trying to make up his mind what they might do to have some fun i wonder if the girls over at clearwater hall wouldnt lend us some dresses and some girls hats for the occasion  they might if we agreed to lend them some of our suits in exchange  well we could do that easily enough answered fred we hardly ever have a chance to wear anything these days but our uniforms  what do you want to do andydress up as a girl questioned jack  thats it we might have dead loads of fun  the matter was discussed for a time and in the end a boy who often did errands for the cadets was dispatched to clearwater hall with a note to ruth and her chums the boy had performed this sort of service before and knew that he must deliver the note without allowing the communication to go through the school office  the messenger returned just as the cadets were on the point of retiring and brought back a letter from the girls in which they agreed to let the boys have what they wanted in return for some suits of male attire it was agreed that the exchange be made in the afternoon directly after the school session  the rover boys and two of their friends walked to haven point and there invested some of their spending money in the hire of an automobile then they rode back to the school procured several bundles of clothing and set out for clearwater hall  the girls were waiting for them at a spot secluded from observation and there an exchange of bundles took place interspersed with a good deal of laughing by the cadets and giggling on the part of the clearwater pupils  oh id love to see you dressed up as a girl cried ruth to jack  how about your being dressed up as a boy he returned  oh none of us will dare show ourselves outside the grounds returned ruth blushing miss garwood wouldnt permit it  well if we get the chance we may come up as far as yonder side fence put in fred if we do well give you the signalthree long whistles  nearly all of the cadets at colby hall were ready for halloween fun they dressed up in all sorts of disguises including those of monks indians negroes and ghosts lighted pumpkins with grinning faces cut into them were likewise numerous and one senior trailed around in a silk gown which he had brought from home for this very occasion  when the rover boys appeared dressed as young ladies with girls hats on their heads and parasols in their hands they were greeted with a loud cheer and this was redoubled as they marched around the campus arm in arm with several boys dressed as dudes and one attired as an admiral  some class to the rovers and no mistake was spouters comment he had on a pair of long whiskers a linen duster farm boots and a big straw hat  how do you do uncle si cried andy coming up to him and bowing how is corn  so high by gosh yu cant see the house answered spouter in country dialect do tell leetle gal but yu do look mighty purty yu do and at this there was a general snicker  at the first opportunity the rovers and several of their friends slipped away from the campus and hurried off in the direction of clearwater hall they were lucky enough to meet a big wagon the driver of which was going to the next town to pick up some young folks for a straw ride this man took them to the young ladies school just for the sport of it  when the rovers gave the signal ruth and her friends came running towards the side fence of the grounds all were attired in male costumes wearing exaggerated collars cuffs and neckties in addition ruth had on a big pair of picktoed shoes and a silk hat many years out of date she also carried a silverheaded cane  oh dont you want to take us out for a walk questioned andy in a highpitched feminine voice  very sorry my dear very sorry came from may powell in as deep a voice as she could command i have important business to attend to  oh jack what an awfully big girl you do make screamed ruth when she discovered his identity behind the little mask he wore i didnt know you were so large  and what a little man you are he answered gaily  dont say a word she returned see these sleeves they are all rolled up and i had to do the same with the trousers and she laughed merrily  although acting against the rules the rovers and their friends found an opening in the fence and for a brief quarter of an hour mingled with the girls on the campus of the school they had a barrel of fun to use andys way of expressing it and left only because it was getting late and they knew they would have to walk all the way back to colby hall  this is about the best halloween fun we ever had remarked jack while he and the others were on the return to the school  to make time the boys did not take the regular road through haven point to colby hall but tramped along a back highway which was considered something of a short cut this presently brought them in sight of a large farm which belonged to a hardfisted man named elias lacy  say we ought to call on old lacy and give him a scare said randy coming to a halt near the farmhouse  it would serve him right answered fred promptly  none of the rovers had a kindly feeling for elias lacy for the reason that the old man had once caught them getting chestnuts from a tree on the corner of his farm and had made them give up all the nuts they had gathered and had then threatened them with the law if they dared to set foot on his premises again  i know you cadets he had snarled you are all a pack of petty thieves i want you to keep away from here  he had suffered a great deal some cadets including slugger brown and nappy martell having at various times robbed him of his cherries his strawberries and some melons of these depredations however the rovers knew nothing  maybe lacy isnt around remarked jack he may have gone to town  they knew that the old man was a bachelor he had two young men working for him and also a woman who came in during the day to do the housework but all of these went home at night  i see somebody moving around the house now answered randy its lacy too  lets knock on the door and pretend we are young ladies in distress cried randy come on i wonder what hell do  dont ask him for any money he wont give you a cent chuckled fred  lets tell him some tramps stopped us and that we want him to go out and fight the fellows suggested one cadet that will show how brave a man lacy is we can take off our masks  so it was arranged and in a minute more the boys were all on the front piazza of the farmhouse ringing the old doorbell there was a sound within and in a moment more elias lacy came to the door with a lamp in one hand  what do you want he asked in astonishment when he saw what looked to be a number of welldressed girls confronting him  oh mr lacy wont you please protect us pleaded randy in his best feminine voice  three murderous tramps are after us gasped andy oh dear i know i shall faint  the tramps wanted to rob us cried jack  they are just outside your fence put in fred please go out and chase them away  elias lacy was staggered he placed his lamp on a little table near by and looked in wonder at the crowd before him  three tramps eh an goin to rob you why i never heard of sech a thing he shrilled mebbe id better git my gun  oh yes yes get your gun by all means get your gun and maybe youd better get a sword too cried randy  yes or a knife or aarazor put in andy  now now dont git so excited cried the old man for the boys insisted upon clinging to his arms and to his shoulders them tramps aint goin to eat you up  he was shortsighted and as the lamplight was poor he had not noticed the boys somewhat crude makeup he hurried into a room and came forth presently carrying a shotgun then he walked back into his kitchen  great cæsar hes got his gun all right enough said jack in a low voice  maybe hell use it on us when he discovers the trick returned fred  ill git my lantern an then we kin go after them tramps announced elias lacy and in a moment more he reappeared with a smoky lantern and started for the front door come on an show me where them tramps are he said determinedly     chapter xxv  off on a hunt   say as soon as we are outdoors let us give him the haha and run away whispered fred to the others  oh no lets have some more fun pleaded randy why the sport has just begun  thats it came from his twin  dont forget we are due at the hall remonstrated jack  now then show me them tramps cried elias lacy as the whole crowd went outdoors and towards the front gate  oh protect us please protect us shrieked randy and caught hold of the old mans coattails  dont let the tramps abduct us i dont want to live with any tramp i want to marry a millionaire screamed andy and began to cling so close to elias lacy that the old man could hardly move forward  the twins cut up so that the others had all they could do to keep from laughing one boy began to snicker but promptly clapped his hand over his mouth  dont hang on to me ordered the old farmer i cant use my gun if you clutch my arm like that and he tried to shake the twins off  oh there they arebehind the bushes screamed randy suddenly pointing off to the left  where demanded the old man holding his lantern over his head i dont see nothin  there they are screamed andy theyve got pistols too oh save us save us  drat the pesky rascals ill fix em snarled elias lacy and shaking loose the clinging boys he ran off lantern in one hand and shotgun held up to his shoulder with the other  now is our time to skip out cried jack  right you are added another of the crowd and then without waiting for the rest this cadet let up a cry sold mr lacy you are sold  sold with the compliments of the colby hall cadets cried another and then seeing that the disguise was at an end the boys began to shout a variety of things not at all complimentary to the old farmer  elias lacy was thunderstruck by the sudden turn of affairs and wheeling around he stared in openmouthed wonder at the retreating girlish figures  whats that he shrilled what are you runnin away fur  goodbye mr lacy sang out randy were only having a little fun  dont you know its halloween queried andy and then started to walk off on his hands but the dress he wore fell down around him and caused him to tumble over on his back in the gloom fred stumbled and fell on top of him  fun halloween bellowed elias lacy and of a sudden he became filled with rage you aint gals at all youre only playin a trick on me he snarled  goodbye and pleasant dreams shouted randy  dont tell any of your friends about the young ladies who called on you advised jack  and then the other cadets made various taunting remarks they had come to a halt to enjoy the old farmers discomfiture and at the same time to give andy and fred a chance to regain their feet  halt suddenly commanded elias lacy and set down his lantern on a fence post halt or ill shoot some of you and he aimed his shotgun at them  dont shoot cried several of the cadets in alarm for they could see that the old man was in a frame of mind to do almost anything  stop dont you dare stir a step or ill shoot as sure as youre standin there continued the old man and then as all of the boys halted he went on now come up here where i kin git a good look at you but dont you come too clost or try to play any more tricks if you do somebodyll sure git shot  there was no help for it and rather sheepishly the crowd of cadets came forward as he had ordered  it was only a bit of halloween fun we didnt mean any harm pleaded randy  take them bunnets an things off so i kin see your faces ordered the old man at the same time keeping the crowd covered with his shotgun  with great reluctance one after another the cadets took off their veils and hats the old man came a step or two closer looking at each face sharply his countenance grew even more hateful when he recognized the rovers  ha youre the same fellers who robbed my chestnut tree he snarled didnt i tell you to keep off my premises ive a good mind to have you locked up  oh come mr lacy it was only a bit of fun pleaded one lad didnt you go out on halloweens when you were a boy  no i didnt i stayed home an done my work was the harsh reply nowadays boys cut up altogether too much  had it not been for the shotgun the boys would have taken to their heels but with the old man thus armed none of them wanted to take any chances but then came a lucky interruption from back on the farm came a wild bellowing as if a cow was in trouble this was followed by the squealing of a number of pigs  hello those town boys must have come over after your cattle after all cried jack struck by a sudden idea  my cattle what do you know about my cattle questioned elias lacy quickly  thats it the town boys are after the cows and pigs broke in fred quick to catch jacks idea  youll lose them all if you dont look out mr lacy put in randy  they shant tech my cows nor my pigs neither snarled the old farmer and taking up his lantern he left the cadets and ran off towards the rear of the premises fortunately nothing serious had happened to his stock  nows the time to skip out cried jack and led the way and the others lost no time in following the cadets had to hold their skirts high to keep from tripping as they sped along they reached colby hall in safety and lost no time in rejoining their friends a little later the halloween celebration came to an end  old lacy will remember us was andys comment in speaking of the affair the next day hell have it in for us  im afraid so replied jack seriously  the main topic of conversation at the school now was the football game which was to take place with the eleven of the clearwater country club on the following saturday this was another gala occasion for the school and once more the boys had the pleasure of escorting the girls to and from the conflict  i hope we can do them up as we did hixley high remarked jack but this was not to be the clearwater country club eleven were much older than the cadets and much heavier and all the colby hall team could do was to hold them down to a score of 16 to 10  well thats not so bad but what it might be worse remarked gif when the defeated eleven had returned to colby hall i did hope however that we might hold them to at least a tie  they carried too much weight for us replied jack even slugger brown couldnt do anything against them for slugger had been used as a substitute in the third and fourth quarters but the big cadet had failed to show either form or efficiency he had been warned by the umpire because of an unfair tackle and this had put him in anything but a good humor  i wont play again so long as gif garrison is captain cried slugger to nappy martell and that evening he sent in his resignation which gif promptly accepted  the game with columbus academy was not to take place until two weeks later so that although they kept at their practice the football players had considerable time for other things jack and his cousins had continued their target practice and their shooting was now so accurate that captain dale complimented them upon it  the hunting season opens tomorrow announced jack one day as he came back from an errand to the town how id like to go out and try my luck  id like to go myself spoke up fred  a number of the senior cadets had received permission to go hunting and jack spoke to one of these youths about the prospects  id like first rate to have you come with me rover said the cadet frank newberry by name and if your cousin fred wants to come along he can do so  wed have to get permission first and also permission to use a couple of the shotguns answered jack the gun rack at colby hall boasted a number of these weapons but none of them could be taken out and used without special permission from captain dale  it was no easy matter for jack and fred to gain the desired permission but when colonel colby heard from captain dale what good shots the boys had proved to be he said they might go out along with frank newberry and some of the others  but i want you to be very careful said the colonel impressively i wouldnt have an accident happen to you for the world dont fire a charge until you are absolutely sure of what youre firing at never point your gun at anybody else and be very careful how you handle your weapon in climbing a fence or leaping over rocks or brushwood  the twins were a bit envious over the prospects for their cousins but they wished jack and fred the best of luck all of the cadets who were to go out had lessons in the morning but they departed directly after dinner and were told that they could remain out as long as they pleased  now dont forget to bring back a deer or a bear cried andy  and if you can bag a buffalo or a hippopotamus added his twin  well be lucky if we bag some rabbits and a squirrel or two or some woodcock answered jack big game doesnt exist around here any more the farms are too thick  well be sure and bring down a pink canary bird anyway advised andy and at this there was a general laugh  frank newberry had been out the year before and consequently knew much about the lay of the land  well go down into the woods directly back of haven point he announced last year the hunting there was much better than it was up the rick rack river  and then off the cadets started on the hunt much that was unusual lay in store for them     chapter xxvi  from one trouble to another   half an hour of tramping brought the two rover boys and their friends into the heart of the big woods frank newberry had mentioned they had entered it by way of the road they had used on halloween and were now almost directly behind elias lacys farm in fact although they were not aware of this a large section of the woods belonged to the old farmer  on their way into the timber they had heard various shots at a distance showing that other hunters were abroad then came a report so close at hand it made fred jump  you want to be very careful so that you dont mistake some other hunter for game cautioned frank newberry  exactly grumbled fred and i want the other hunters to be careful that they dont shoot me for a deer or a bear  the cadets continued to advance into the woods and then crossed an open space here they were fortunate enough to stir up quite a few rabbits and jack after an hours hunt had the pleasure of bringing down two while one was laid low by fred  so far the cadets had kept together but presently the party managed to catch sight of game in two directions and soon frank newberry and the seniors with him were hurrying off to the southward while the rover boys went after game that had gone northward  come right back to this spot cried frank newberry to the rovers  all right answered jack  their sporting blood aroused by the game already brought down urged jack and fred forward and almost before they knew it they had covered a long distance they presently came to another clearing bordering a goodsized pond here they stirred up half a dozen rabbits and also some squirrels and each succeeded in bringing down more than half the game sighted  say this is the finest sport ever declared fred as he looked at his game with deep satisfaction wont the others envy us when we get back to the hall with these  its sport enough for us returned jack i dont know what the rabbits and squirrels think about it though he added dryly  from a distance the boys had seen more game and they began to circle the pond then they heard a strange whirring in some bushes a distance further on  maybe well come across some wild turkeys or something like that said fred  i dont believe there are any wild turkeys around here answered jack  oh wouldnt it be fine if we sighted a deer or a bear sighed fred  you dont want much for your money do you laughed his cousin i rather think if a bear came after you youd take to your heels  maybe i wouldif he was a big one  on and on went the two boys and presently were rewarded by the sight of several small woodcock both fired almost at the same instant and two of the birds came fluttering down to thrash around in the bushes until put out of misery by the young hunters  two of em think of that chuckled fred oh this is simply glorious  so far the two boys had not met any of the strange hunters but now they came across two men well loaded down with rabbits they did not know it but one of the men was a farm hand employed by elias lacy  youd better keep away from the lacy place said the man with a sarcastic look at the rovers he had been on hand when the lads had had the chestnuts taken away by the old farmer and had also heard about the joke on halloween  dont you worry weve no use for mr lacy returned fred crossly  hes the meanest man we ever met added jack at this the farm hand only grinned and then he and his companion disappeared once more into the woods  so far the day had been typical of the autumn season somewhat gray with only an occasional showing of the sun now however it became rapidly darker and presently a few flakes of snow sifted down through the air  hello what do you know about this cried jack looking up i guess were going to have a snowstorm  oh i hope it doesnt snow very heavilyat least not until we get back to school returned fred quickly  a little snow wont hurt us fred  but if it got too thick jack we might lose our way  i dont believe it will come down as heavily as all thatnot at this season of the year  with the sky growing darker and the flakes of snow coming down thicker than ever the two boys sought to retrace their steps in the direction of the pond but in their eagerness to sight something at which to shoot they had not noted their path very carefully and as a consequence they now found themselves somewhat bewildered  if the sun was only out wed know in what direction to steer remarked jack but when the sky is this way a fellow is apt to get completely turned around  its too bad we didnt bring a pocket compass  thats true however we havent got one so well have to make the best of it come on  they had paused for a moment to rest and to survey their surroundings now they continued their tramping and at length came out on the edge of a sheet of water which they at first took to be the pond they had previously visited  there they go quick jack sang out fred and blazed away with his shotgun his cousin followed suit and soon they found they had bagged two additional rabbitsone the largest yet brought low  this isnt the pond at all cried jack in some disappointment after the excitement of shooting the rabbits had subsided i never saw this spot before  nor i what do you make of it jack  dont ask me it looks as if we were lost  hark i heard a shot cried fred a minute later while the pair were looking around trying to make up their minds in what direction to proceed next maybe those are our fellows shooting  the shot had come from their right and was presently followed by another thinking their friends might be close at hand the rovers started off as well as they could through the brushwood and between the trees but then they came to some rough ground covered with rocks and here further progress was all but impossible in the meanwhile no further reports had reached their ears  we are sure up against it remarked jack after he and his cousin had looked at each other rather helplessly it was darker than ever and the snow still continued to sift down through the trees  maybe well have to stay out here all night said fred after consulting his watch its half past five now  we ought to be on the way back to the hall if we expect any supper replied his cousin  being unable to advance further in that direction the rover boys sought to retrace their steps and after considerable trouble managed to return to the sheet of water they had left a while before but by this time the darkness of night had fallen  its no use cried fred helplessly were lost thats all there is to it  it was bad enough while it was daylight fred i really dont know what we are going to do now its dark answered jack seriously  on the return to the little pond fred had stumbled over some tree roots and this had lamed him a little  i cant walk very much further he said with a sigh and then he added quickly jack have you any matches  oh yes i put a box in my pocket before we started  good then if we have to stay here we can build a fire and maybe cook something  the boys tried the water of the pond and finding it fairly good drank their fill then they sat down to discuss the situation both were hungry and in the end they gathered some dry sticks started a fire and cooked one of the rabbits and also a squirrel which they ate with much satisfaction  well freeze to death if we stay here all night was freds dismal comment  oh nonot if we keep the fire going  then lets do that by all means it will not only keep us warm but it may be the means of directing somebody to this place  it was a long night for both of the boys they took turns at resting and at replenishing the fire and it is doubtful if either of them got much real sleep once in the early morning came an alarm and fred imagined a bear was in the bushes but the animal or whatever it was soon went away and that was the end of the disturbance  thank goodness it has stopped snowing remarked jack when the cousins were preparing a breakfast of another squirrel  the snow had not amounted to much being less than an inch in depth the storm had cleared away entirely and at the proper time the sun came up over the hills beyond clearwater lake  long before that time the two young hunters were once more on their way they had tramped along for fully half an hour when suddenly jack let up a shout of joy  hurrah weve struck a road at last now well find out where we are  the road was little more than a trail through the woods evidently made by the wagon or sled of some woodcutter it ran down a slight hill and the two boys lost no time in following it  i hope it brings us into haven point remarked fred as they strode along im getting tired of walking and of carrying the shotgun id rather have a ride  let us be thankful to get out of the woods fred we might have gotten so mixed up that wed have had to spend another night there  the two lads continued to follow the woods road and presently came into sight of several farm buildings including a corncrib and a long low cowshed  oh for the love of doughnuts cried jack an instant later fred do you know where we are  no i dont where  right in the back of old lacys place there is his house and the oldest rover boy pointed with his hand  youre right jack gee we almost ran into the old man again didnt we gasped fred we had better get out of here as quick as we can  now youre saying something returned his cousin come on before he catches sight of us  the two boys had just started to leave the road on which they had been traveling when a shout reached their ears the next moment another shout rent the frosty morning air and then two men came running towards the lads one carrying a gun and the other a pitchfork  stop there you young rascals stop roared out the voice of elias lacy stop i tell you caleb cover em with your gun  im doin it mr lacy replied the other man and leveled his gun at the boys he was the same man the rovers had met in the woods the afternoon before  with the weapon of the farm hand pointed at them the two rover boys came to a halt in a minute more the others came up elias lacy puffing because of his exertions  now ive caught you he snarled i didnt think it was goin to be so easy  youre certainly in luck mr lacy grinned caleb boggs i didnt think theyd stay roun here after doin it  they came back jest to have the laugh on me snarled the old farmer i know em i spose they did it cause i took them chestnuts away from em an on account o the way i treated em halloween night but ill fix em now ill have the law on em ill send em to states prison for ten years jest you see if i dont and thus the old man spluttered on saying many things the boys could not understand  see here mr lacy what are you so mad about queried jack finally cant you stand a little fun  stand a little fun yelled the excited old man fairly beside himself with rage it aint no fun to kill two o my cows he shook his bony fist at the boys ill have the law on you so i will ill send you both to states prison for ten years     chapter xxvii  elias lacys demand   the two rover boys stared at elias lacy in openmouthed amazement  what did you say about killing two cows questioned jack  have two of your cows been killed came from fred  at these questions the old farmer seemed to become more enraged than ever he raised his pitchfork as if to use it on the cadets  you cant play innercent with me he fairly screamed i know you you shot them cows an im agoin to send you to states prison fur it  its a purty serious businesskillin a mans cattle like that added caleb boggs with a shake of his head he still held his shotgun so as to cover the two boys  i dont know a thing about your cows and i certainly havent shot at them answered jack indignantly  we havent been anywhere near your cow pasture or your cowshed either said fred weve been hunting up in the woods yonder your man saw us  we got lost up there after it began to snow and we had to camp out all night explained jack we just found that road and were trying to get back to haven point and colby hall  it aint so it aint so snarled elias lacy you come over to my cow paster yesterday afternoon an shot both o them cows and then you run away one o my men seen you  he never did burst out jack i tell you we werent near your place  we went out hunting with a number of other cadets and we can prove it added his cousin  huh where are them other cadets now demanded the old farmer  we got separated in the woodsthey going off for some rabbits in one direction and we going off after some other rabbits in another direction explained the oldest rover boy i dont know where those other cadets are now probably they went back to the school  you aint got no right to hunt on my grounds  we were out in the open woods mr lacy where we had a perfect right to be  well we wont talk about that now snarled the old man im agoin to fix you for shootin them cows they was two of the best cows i had an they was wuth a lot o money  a wordy war followed during which the boys became almost as angry as the old farmer they insisted upon it that they had not been near his farm during the afternoon of the day before but he did not believe a word they said  im agoin to have the law on you he cried im agoin to have you arrested an ill make your folks pay fur them cows  hadnt we better march em down to the barn suggested the hired man then i kin hitch up the horses and we kin take em down to the town lockup  oh jack dont let them lock us up whispered fred in horror  if you lock us up mr lacy youll suffer for it said jack ill get my father to sue you for damages  dont you talk to me like that you young whippersnapper cried the old man i know what im adoin im agoin to turn you over to the town authorities an thats all there is to it  the old man was obdurate and he and the hired man forced the boys into the barn where the farmer stood guard with the shotgun while the hired man hooked up a team of horses to one of the farm wagons then the lads were told to get into the turnout  i dont think ill get in said jack  yes you will snarled elias lacy and then followed a lively scuffle but the two boys were no match for the men and they were quickly disarmed then being covered by the hired mans shotgun they had to get up into the wagon the hired man drove while elias lacy sat in the rear the shotgun ready for action so that the boys might not escape their own guns along with their game were placed on the bottom of the wagon under a blanket  it must be confessed that jack and fred were in no enviable frame of mind as the wagon with the two prisoners aboard headed in the direction of haven point they knew that news of their arrest would spread rapidly and they wondered what their friends and especially the girls at clearwater hall would think of it  gee but were in a pickle commented fred dismally  yes and the worst of it is i dont know how we are going to clear ourselves answered his cousin as near as i can learn those cows were shot while you and i were off by ourselves in the woods the hired man says the other man who works on the place saw two cadets disappearing between the trees  who can those fellows be jack  dont ask me probably two of our fellows who have some grudge against lacy  this talk was carried on in an undertone so that neither the old farmer nor his hired man could understand what was said  you neednt plan no trick to escape warned elias lacy raising his shotgun slightly  mr lacy what did you do with the two cows that were shot asked jack suddenly  i left em out in the paster right where they fell returned the old farmer i aint agoin to tech em till the authorities have looked em over  were they killed with bird shot or with rifle bullets  bird shotsame as youve been ausin in them shotguns of yourn  a portion of the roadway leading into haven point was being repaired and was closed off so in order to get down into the town they had to make something of a detour in the direction of colby hall  oh jack hadnt we better ask him to take us to the hall first whispered fred to his cousin maybe colonel colby can fix this up for us  i might ask him returned jack in a low tone  i aint agoin to colby hall snarled elias lacy after the question had been put to him im agoin to take you to the lockup  the journey towards the town was continued and presently those in the wagon came within sight of a rural free delivery turnout  hello there pete got any letters for us sang out the farm hand  one fur mr lacy replied the post carrier and driving closer he handed it over  i aint got no time to read letters now announced elias lacy as he thrust the communication into his pocket ive got other business to tend to  givin a couple of the colby cadets a ride eh ventured the carrier  im atakin em to the lockup pete they went an shot two o my cows  you dont say lias cried the carrier in amazement out huntin i spose and mistook em for deer or bears and he chuckled over his little joke  no they done it apurpose growled the farmer they held a grudge agin me an they thought they was agoin to git square but ill show em an dont you forgit it  we didnt shoot his cows came simultaneously from jack and fred  bad business but ive got to be on my way commented the carrier that road bein closed puts me away off my regular route and off he drove  three quarters of the distance to haven point had been covered when those in the wagon heard a shout and a moment later captain dale came galloping up on horseback  where in the world have you two cadets been he cried we have been looking all over for you  we got lost in the woods and had to camp out all night explained jack and then added did the others get back  oh yes and they fully expected that you would follow them and then seeing a peculiar look on the boys faces the military instructor of colby hall continued nothing wrong i hope  yes there isa whole lot wrong cried elias lacy before the cadets could answer they sneaked up to my farm an shot two o my cows  impossible exclaimed the military man  no it aint its so shrilled the old farmer they killed the cows an im on my way to put em in the haven point lockup  oh captain dale dont let him have us arrested pleaded fred we do not know anything about his cows and we certainly did not shoot them  tell me all about this demanded captain dale and in a highly excited fashion elias lacy told his story which was corroborated by his hired man  now ill hear what you have to say said the captain turning to jack and fred  they gave him the particulars of what had happened just as they had already related them to the old farmer then captain dale asked them a number of questions elias lacy interrupted continually  i aint agoin to stand no nonsense said the old man doggedly im agoin to put em in the lockup an do it right now  mr lacy allow me to tell you something said the military instructor coolly if these boys are guilty you will be justified in having them placed under arrest but if they are not guiltyand they claim they are innocentyoull make yourself liable for a big suit for damages  i dont care i know they shot them cows  no you dont know it you admit that the farm hand who saw the two cadets did not recognize them in fact he wasnt altogether sure that they were cadets now these boys claim they were nowhere near your pasture lot when the cows were shot i think the best thing you can do is to let them return to the hall with me colonel colby is away today but i will take the matter up with him just as soon as he returns  mebbe if i let em go to the hall theyll run away answered elias lacy the mention of a possible lawsuit for damages had taken some of the aggressiveness out of him  i will see to it that they do not run away answered captain dale we have a guardroom at the halla sort of lockup and if it is necessary i will have them placed there until colonel colby can investigate and until you can make up your mind what you want to do  the old farmer argued the matter for several minutes but in the end agreed to let the military instructor take charge of jack and fred  but remember he said in parting youve got to keep em under lock an key till i see colonel colby im agoin to make an investigation an im purty sure ill be able to prove that they killed them cows     chapter xxviii  in the guardroom   what in the world do you suppose has become of them randy  i give it up i hope they only lost their way and didnt have some kind of an accident  oh dont speak of an accident cried andy in horror it makes me shiver to think of it  i cant understand why they didnt rejoin us as they promised to do said frank newberry who was present we looked all over for them and fired one or two shots to attract their attention but it was all useless  the twins had passed a restless night following the continued absence from the school of their cousins early in the morning they had gone out in company with gif and spouter and covered many miles in a vain search for the absent ones they could not settle down to their class work and so were excused by professor brice  well ive got to be getting back to the classroom remarked frank newberry presently and he and several others who were present hurried away leaving the twins to themselves  the boys walked down the roadway which had been followed by the hunters the day before they had covered only a short distance when they saw a farm wagon approaching with captain dale beside it on his horse  there they are cried andy and an instant later added in amazement old lacy and one of his men are with them  yes and i bet that spells trouble for jack and fred announced his brother  the old farmer would not stop for the boys on the roadside but drove directly to the colby hall entrance  why whats the matter exclaimed randy to the military instructor  a little trouble boys was captain dales answer youll hear about it later and then he went after the wagon and the boys took to their heels and followed  now then you do what you promised snapped elias lacy after jack and fred had jumped from the wagon dont let em run away nohow  you can rest assured that i will take care of them mr lacy answered the captain coldly  when do you expect colonel colby back  some time this afternoon  then i guess ill be back by that time to see him an i guess ill be able to prove them boys is guilty too  why jack what is it all about demanded randy while his twin looked on questioningly the boys shotguns and game had been taken from the farm wagon and now the pair from the lacy farm drove away  youve got to search me declared jack old lacy accuses fred and me of shooting two of his cows  you didnt do it though did you queried andy  certainly not burst out fred all we know about it is what he has told us we werent even near the pasture where the cows were kept  as well as they were able jack and fred explained the situation to their cousins and also answered a number of questions put to them by captain dale the military instructor was much puzzled over the situation and hardly knew what to do  you heard what i promised mr lacy he said finally ill have to place you in the guardroom until colonel colby gets back but i imagine you would rather be kept there than let mr lacy take you down to the town lockup  it isnt fair to lock us up at all grumbled fred we have done no wrong of course we stayed away from the hall over night but that couldnt be helped it was no fun staying outdoors on such a cold night without shelter  cant you parole us captain queried jack  no i gave mr lacy my word that i would lock you up and ill have to do it ill see to it however that you suffer no discomforts while you are in the guardroom  after this there seemed no help for it and turning their guns and game over to the twins jack and fred followed captain dale through one of the lower corridors and then into a wing of the building here there was a room about twelve feet square the one window of which was barred and this was known officially as the school guardroom or prison  you may wash up if you care to do so and i will send you some breakfast announced captain dale and then left them in the room locking the door behind him  the apartment was but scantily furnished containing an iron cot a couple of stools a table and in one corner a wash bowl with running water there was a small steam radiator in the room and this the boys lost no time in turning on for the air was damp and cold  this is a fine prospect truly remarked fred as he sank down on one of the stools i wonder how long well have to stay in this hole  that remains to be seen fred i wish colonel colby were here i think he would give us some good advicebeing such an old friend of our fathers  gee id hate to have him send a letter home telling the folks that we were guilty of shooting a farmers cows  so would i i dont see how we are going to clear ourselves you can bet lacy will make out the blackest possible case against us  after their outing in the woods the boys were glad enough to wash themselves they had hardly finished when one of the waiters of the hall came in with a large tray filled with an appetizing breakfast  this isnt so bad declared jack when they had been left once more alone the boys ate heartily yet they were so much troubled that it is not likely the food did them any good  the report soon circulated throughout colby hall that jack and fred had been placed under arrest and many of the cadets wanted to know what it meant  theyve been arrested for shooting two of old lacys cows said codfish who had heard the news and had started to circulate it as quickly as possible they say old lacy is going to send them to states prison for it  spikeless mosquitoes cried fatty do you think they really went over there and shot the cows  i dont know im sure answered walt baxter who was present i know they didnt bear old lacy much goodwill they felt rather raw over the way the old man held em up with his shotgun when they were having their halloween fun  yes and they were down on lacy because he once took away some chestnuts they had gathered from one of his trees put in another cadet  shooting cows is rather a serious business was bart whites comment  this talk took place on the campus down in the gymnasium another group of cadets had gathered including nappy martell and slugger brown  locked up for killing old lacys cows eh cried martell with a satisfied grin on his face theyll catch it for that all right enough  i dont see why colonel colby dont fire em out of the school for it said slugger brown  maybe he will dismiss em if he finds out the report is true ventured another cadet  of course the report is true put in codfish who had come up didnt one of the hired men see em do it  is that so codfish  so they say  oh it would be just like those rovers to do something like that came from nappy martell they are that kind of fellows  i always thought they were pretty good chaps was the comment of another cadet  good chaps sneered slugger brown that shows you dont know em as well as we do they are sneaksall of emand wouldnt hesitate a minute to do anything underhanded i hope colonel colby gets after them and fires em out and then with a knowing look at martell slugger passed on and presently his crony followed him  a good deal of this talk drifted to the ears of the rover twins and hurt them not a little but they were in no position to combat what was said  of course we know jack and fred are innocent remarked randy to his brother but in a court of law it is one thing to know it and quite another thing to prove it  yet ive always heard it said that a man was innocent until he was proved guilty asserted andy  very true just the same many a man has been convicted on what they call circumstantial evidence and evidently the circumstantial evidence against jack and fred is pretty strong  in the guardroom the time for jack and fred passed slowly they discussed the situation from every possible point of view but without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion  even if they dont send us to prison for the crime they may make our fathers pay for the cows said jack  yes and colonel colby may send us home added fred dismally oh dear wouldnt that be the worst ever and he sank down on the cot and covered his face with his hands  it was martell and brown aided by codfish who saw to it that the report of jack and freds arrest was carried to clearwater hall this brought consternation to the girls particularly to ruth and may  i wont believe it declared ruth i dont believe jack and fred would be so mean  i dont believe it either cried spouters cousin somebody else must have done it  in the middle of the afternoon colonel colby returned to the hall and was at once acquainted with the affair by captain dale the colonel was on the point of questioning the two prisoners when a servant came in announcing the arrival of elias lacy the farmer was as wildly excited as he had been in the morning  i knowed i was right he cried flourishing a letter in the colonels face heres something i got to prove it it come by mail this mornin when i was bringin them young whelps over here i put the letter in my pocket an i forgot all about it until an hour ago jest read that will you and he thrust the communication into colonel colbys hand  the letter was postmarked at beach haven and had been mailed the evening previous it was written in a slanting backhand evidently disguised and ran as follows      dear mr lacy      your two cows were shot by jack rover and fred rover they were     out in the woods hunting when we saw them go towards your pasture     lot we thought they were up to some trick so watched them they     drove the two cows from the rest of the herd and then jack rover     gave one cow two shots and fred rover gave the other cow two shots     then they ran back into the woods as tight as they could go they     didnt join the other hunters they had gone out with most likely     because they were afraid      you had better go to colby hall and have them arrested before they     run away      yours truly      three boys who know but who do not dare to give you their names     chapter xxix  the exposure   there what do you think of that letter demanded elias lacy after colonel colby had read the communication  i dont know what to think of it mr lacy was the slow reply i have not yet had an opportunity to interview the two rovers if you will sit down here in my office ill talk to them and try to settle this matter with you  dont you want me to go with you questioned the old farmer quickly  no i prefer to interview them alone  all right then ill stay here but dont be too long cause i want to drive down to the town an git bill pixley the chief o police or one of his men  i dont think youll need any police mr lacy i think well be able to fix this matter up to your entire satisfaction answered colonel colby and then left the office and made his way along the corridors to the guardroom  his coming was a great relief to jack and fred for they felt that in colonel colby they had a real friend yet they were much troubled for they realized that the case looked black against them  now tell me everything you know dont hold back a single item said the colonel as he seated himself on one of the stools  thereupon both cadets related their story in detailhow they had gone out with frank newberry and the others how the two parties had become separated and how they had lost their way camped out over night and finally found the woods road leading down to the lacy farm and then how elias lacy and his hired man had held them up and threatened them with arrest  and you do not know a single thing about the shooting of the cows questioned the colonel eyeing them sternly  not a thing sir responded jack promptly  we dont know anything more about those cows than you do sir added fred vehemently we werent anywhere near his place when they were shot  then what do you two say to this letter continued the master of colby hall and presented the communication to them  jack read the letter with fred looking over his shoulder then of a sudden fred gave a cry of amazement  i think i know who wrote that letter he exclaimed  you do returned colonel colby and jack simultaneously  i think so although of course i am not sure fred looked at his cousin it would be just like him to do it  who are you talking about fred  im talking about slugger brown  slugger brown  do you mean slogwell brown queried the master of the school  yes sir  and what makes you think brown wrote that communication demanded colonel colby and now somewhat to their wonder the rovers realized that the colonel seemed to be unusually interested  because i once saw brown writing in backhand fashion on the blackboard in the gymnasium explained fred he wrote a hand almost identical with that i noticed it particularly because he was amusing himself by writing one line slanting backward and the next line slanting forward  did he know you were watching him  oh no i didnt stay there long enough for that he was all alone and as i didnt care to speak to him i passed out without his noticing it  how long ago was this  only about a week ago  hum the colonel mused for a moment knitting his brows closely as he did so that is worth investigating he thought for another moment you have nothing more to add to your story  no sir answered fred  i think weve told you everything colonel colby returned jack we are innocent and i trust you will do all you can to help us prove it  i shall do what is absolutely fair in the matter answered colonel colby and then left the two boys once more to themselves  andy and randy had begged for permission to talk things over with their cousins and they came in to see jack and fred almost immediately after colonel colby left  if slugger brown wrote that letter maybe he and nappy martell did the shooting remarked randy  they would be just mean enough to do it added his twin theyd do anything to get our crowd into trouble  why cant you two fellows watch brown and martell questioned jack you might tell gif and spouter and ned about it too find out where those two fellows were yesterday afternoon and find out if they used any of the shotguns  say thats an idea cried randy enthusiastically ill go at it right away  and so will i declared his brother maybe well be able to lay the whole blame on that pair  the twins talked it over with the others for a little while longer and then were let out of the guardroom by a servant who locked the door after them as they came out into the main corridor of the hall they saw that elias lacy was just leaving colonel colbys office  all right then ill wait the old farmer was saying but ill be back by tomorrow afternoon an if you cant prove by that time that them rover boys is innercent im agoin to have em locked up  very well mr lacy the colonel replied and bowed his visitor out of the door  well anyway the colonel has got old lacy to wait another day whispered randy that will give us just so much more time to get on the track of what martell and brown have been doing  all provided they are really guilty of playing this dirty trick answered his brother  in the upper hallway the twins ran across ned lowe and immediately took that cadet into their confidence and asked him if he would not try to find out for them where brown and martell had been the previous afternoon  for you see we cant ask them ourselves explained randy if we did that they would become suspicious at once  all right ill do what i can answered ned and made off without delay he came back in less than fifteen minutes looking much excited  how did you make out queried randy eagerly  great i want you two fellows to come upstairs at once while brown and martell are out of their rooms and i think you had better bring along one of the teachers as a witness  why what have you learned ned questioned andy  i saw them down near the gymnasium and sneaked up behind them and by rare good luck heard them talking about two shotguns that belonged in the gun rack they were wondering how they could get them from their rooms back into the gun rack without detection  hurrah i wager we have found em out ejaculated randy excitedly come on lets get one of the teachers at once  the boys were fortunate enough to fall in with professor brice a minute later and in a rather excited fashion they told the teacher of what they had learned and what they proposed to do  why certainly ill go with you said paul brice quickly i want just as much as anybody to get at the bottom of this affair  accompanied by the professor the three cadets hurried to the second floor of the hall and then to the rooms occupied by slugger brown and nappy martell the door to each was locked but one of them was opened for the crowd by an assistant janitor a hasty search revealed nothing in the shape of a firearm in either room and the rover boys were much disappointed but then randy thought of the bed and quickly raised the mattress on the springs rested a shotgun  and ill bet the other shotgun is in the other bed cried andy and he and the professor made an investigation the funloving rovers surmise was correct  these are guns belonging to the hall too cried ned pointing out the mark of the school on the stocks they must belong down in the gun rack just as slugger and martell said  bring those guns along boys and well go directly to colonel colbys office said professor brice and the cadets lost no time in doing as he directed  they found the master of the school seated at his desk looking over a mass of papers he gazed in wonder at the three lads and professor brice  we found the shotguns that were used on those cows cried randy his eyes sparkling  and do you know where we found em in the beds that slugger brown and nappy martell use broke in andy  whats this and now the colonel was really startled  you had better let the boys tell the beginning of the story and i will tell the end said professor brice  thereupon the two rovers repeated the talk that had taken place in the guardroom and then told how they had gotten ned to spy on brown and martell then ned told of what he had heard and of how the three had called on professor brice for assistance after that the teacher took up the narrative ending with the finding of the shotguns in the beds  it looks like a pretty clear case against brown and martell remarked the colonel slowly however i shall have to make a further investigation i will send for brown and martell at once  the colonel was as good as his word and inside of five minutes slugger and nappy came into the office together they looked much disturbed and this look increased when they saw andy and randy  brown and martell i have sent for you to answer a few questions began colonel colby sternly as the two cadets faced him i want you to answer me directly and truthfully what was your object in taking two of our shotguns from the gun rack and going over to mr lacys farm and shooting down two of his cows  whwhwhy whwhwhat do you mean faltered brown  we didntershooterany cows stammered martell  both boys were thrown into utter confusion and showed it plainly then slugger brown suddenly turned to glare at the rovers  is this some of your work he demanded if it is let me tell you ill pay you back for it  stop that talk brown commanded colonel colby i want you and martell to answer my question why did you go over there and shoot those cows  who says we shot the cows questioned nappy faintly  never mind who says so you did it and it is useless for you to deny it here are the two guns you took from the gun rack and afterwards hid in your beds and here is the despicable note you brown wrote and mailed to mr lacy and the colonel held out the communication  oh colonel colby i didididnt do it faltered slugger brown his face had suddenly gone white and he could scarcely speak  do you deny that this is your handwriting  iioh isiididntthat is and here slugger brown broke down absolutely not knowing what to say  did you mail that letter or did brown do it questioned the colonel quickly turning to martell  he did it i didnt have anything to do with it burst out nappy breaking down completely  it aint so cried slugger he was with me and he dropped the letter in the postoffice  and so you killed the cows to get the rovers into trouble said colonel colby and now his eyes glittered like steel a fine thing to do truly i did not think any of our cadets would stoop to such a base action  it was aera joke gasped nappy  a joke to kill two valuable cows martell if you talk that way ill be inclined to think you are losing your senses but evidently there is something radically wrong with both you and brown went on the master of the hall this case of the cows and the plot against the rovers is bad enough but i have another matter against you which may prove even worse  what is that questioned slugger very faintly  it is a case that captain larkins of the steam tug mary d has lodged against you he says he has absolute proof that both of you went out in a motor boat one day and tampered with the towing line and the chains of a large lumber raft so that when a sudden squall came up on the lake the towing line parted and the lumber raft went to pieces  oh say that must have been the squall we were out in exclaimed randy and we got caught among that floating lumber too  yes that was the time answered colonel colby  oh colonel cant we go to our cousins and tell them that they can have their freedom questioned andy with a sudden thought of those left in the guardroom  yes rover both of you and also lowe can go was the colonels reply i will settle this affair with brown and martell  and will you settle it with mr lacy too queried randy quickly  yes i will fix the whole matter up you may tell jack and fred that they need not worry any further on this score and thereupon andy randy and ned hurried away to bear the glad tidings to the prisoners  of course jack and fred were greatly pleased to be released they listened eagerly to all the twins and ned had to relate  so nappy and slugger are guilty cried jack what a mean way to act  and to think they are also guilty of sending that lumber adrift said fred theyll suffer for that  they ought to suffer answered his cousin     chapter xxx  a football victoryconclusion   whoop her up for colby hall  this is the time columbus academy wins  not on your life this is colby hall day  youll sing a different tune after the game is over  hurrah here come the elevens now  and then a wild shouting intermingled with the tooting of horns and the sounding of rattles rent the air while banners went waving on every side  it was the day of the great game between colby hall and columbus academy it had been decided that the contest should take place on the field belonging to the military academy and once again everything had been put in the best of order for this gala occasion the grandstand and the bleachers were overflowing with spectators and in a distant field were parked a hundred automobiles or more while in another field were numerous carriages and farm wagons  weve certainly got a crowd today remarked randy who with his brother was in the section of the stand reserved for the colbyites and their friends in front of the twins and their chums sat ruth may and half a dozen other girls from clearwater hall  i dont see anything of nappy martell or slugger brown remarked ida brierley who was with the girls  i hope you dont want to see them ida returned ruth promptly  indeed i do not answered the other girl i was only wondering what had become of them  jack told me they had both left the hall for the term they shot those cows you know and they had some other trouble which was hushed up  oh that was the trouble over that lumber raft put in jennie mason  right you are answered andy bending over and speaking in a low tone so that no outsider might hear their folks had to pony up a pretty penny too for the lumber and for the cows  oh well lets forget martell and brown broke in may i want to enjoy this game  and thats what we all want to do said alice strobell  what had been said concerning slugger brown and nappy martell was true questioned by colonel colby the two misguided cadets had finally broken down utterly and confessed everything telling how they had once gotten into a quarrel with captain larkins on the lake and how they had sought to get square by tampering with the fastenings of the lumber raft and the towline and they had also related the particulars of how they had watched jack and fred go out shooting and had then purloined the two shotguns from the gun rack and hurried over to the lacy farm to shoot the cows mr brown and mr martell had been called upon to pay both the lake captain and the old farmer heavy damages and thereupon they had withdrawn their sons from the hall for the time being  and im glad theyre gone had been freds comment i hope they never come back here again  yes we could do without brown and martell very well had been jacks answer  both of the cousins were particularly happy on this day jack occupied his former position on the eleven and fred had been drafted from the scrub team and put on the substitutes bench in place of brown  maybe ill get a chance to play cried the youngest rover eagerly when the football captain brought him the news  perhaps so fred answered gif although of course i hope none of our players get hurt  as the colby hall eleven marched out on the gridiron jack glanced towards the grandstand and caught ruths eye the girl gaily waved a colby hall banner at him then may caught sight of fred on the side lines and shook her hand at him  spectators from the town were almost as much interested in the contest as were the two schools this football game was always the big match of the season and many wagers were placed on the result in the past the contests had always been exceedingly bitter with the various scores almost a tie columbus academy winning by a narrow margin one year and colby hall taking the lead by an equally narrow margin the following year  when the columbus academy boys came out on the field it was seen that they were good husky fellows every bit as heavy as the colby hall eleven they looked in the pink of condition  i am afraid our boys will have their work cut out for them in this game remarked mr crews to colonel colby  well our boys look pretty fit answered the master of the hall  by the toss of a coin columbus academy won the choice of position and took the west goal the slight wind that was blowing being in their favor then the two teams lined up for the kickoff  now then boys show em what you can do yelled the colby hall cadets and then the school slogan rang out on the air  put it all over em boys yelled one of the columbus academy followers come on now all together he added and started up a song the refrain of which contained the line were here today to bury them  what an awful song to sing remarked ruth  oh you mustnt mind that returned andy gaily he sings best who sings last as the cat said to the bird  it must be confessed that both teams were rather nervous at the outset of the contest the play was decidedly ragged and one or two mistakes were made which however profited neither side anything the ball was carried first to the colby hall 10yard line and from there it went back to the columbus 15yard line and then it sawed back and forth until eight minutes of the first quarter had passed  gee this begins to look like a blank was spouters comment  so it does returned dan soppinger say can any of you tell me why the  dont ask questions now dan interrupted randy oh look look he burst out suddenly isnt that great  the ball had dribbled back and forth until by a punt it reached colby halls 20yard line it landed close to jack and like a flash he gathered it to his breast and started for the columbus goal  go it rover go it  dont let em down you jack  with his friends cheering lustily jack sped on dodging many straightarm tackles and skipping from right to left and then back again in order to avoid the numerous players who seemed to confront him as if by magic then somebody appeared on his left and the next moment he went down with a thud not knowing where he had landed  its a touchdown was the cry and then the colby hall followers went wild with delight while columbus academy was mute the girls stood up in the grandstand and waved their banners gaily  oh just to think jack did it murmured ruth and her face showed her intense satisfaction  now if only walt baxter can kick a goal cried randy  but this was not to be for at the moment the leather sailed through the air a strong puff of wind came up and the ball went just outside the posts  well never mind cried randy consolingly that puts us in the lead  the run had somewhat exhausted jack but still he insisted upon keeping on playing and after the wonderful exhibition he had made gif had not the heart to call in a substitute to take his place  but if with a touchdown in their favor colby thought to remain in the lead they soon had this hope shattered the columbus academy eleven played a fast and snappy second quarter and as a result before it was half over they took the ball on a fumble and circled the left end for twelve yards  say thats going some remarked fatty  oh it wont net them anything responded andy  but in this he was wrong for on the next two plays columbus carried the ball over the line for a touchdown  a tie a tie yelled the followers of the academy  now then boys dont miss the goal  it isnt likely theyll miss it grumbled andy the wind is in their favor the goal was kicked with ease and then the score stood columbus academy7 colby hall6  during the intermission between the second and third quarters gif and mr crews gave the eleven some very pointed instructions one player had hurt his ankle slightly and he was taken out and a substitute took his place but the substitute was not fred much to that youths disappointment  if the first and second quarters had been fast and snappy the third quarter was even more so back and forth went the ball and it was lost both by colby hall and by the academy team there were some really fine tackles and splendid runs but all of these availed nothing and when the whistle blew the score still stood 6 for colby hall as against 7 for columbus academy  tough luck groaned ned  oh were going to winim sure of it answered randy  i hope what you say proves true returned ruth hopefully  just before the whistle was given for the end of the third quarter there had been a grand crash and a fierce mixup on the field then it was found that both a columbus academy player and a colby hall youth would have to be taken out of the game  now then fred heres your chance said gif coming up to the youngest rover im going to put you in and i want you to help us win the game  win it is cried fred his eyes shining eagerly well either win or well die  when the whistle blew for the final quarter all of the players who trooped on the field had a doordie expression on their faces once more the play became fast and furious and as a result in less than three minutes columbus academy scored another touchdown which however failed of a goal  hurrah thats the way to do it yelled their followers in keen delight  brace up boys brace up this wont do at all come on now all together and then colby hall went in with renewed vigor so that inside of a few minutes more they too had scored another touchdown and from this they managed to kick a goal  hello what do you know about that another tie  thirteen to thirteen same as that other game say this is getting mighty interesting  so far fred although he had played as hard as anybody in the game had failed to make any appreciable showing now however with only a few minutes to spare he saw his chance  one of the columbus academy players had dropped back for a punt fred who was close at hand made a sudden leap over a protecting half back and blocked the kick  say look at that fred rover is in the game for keeps  send it back fred send it back  the words were scarcely spoken when the thrilled spectators saw that the youngest rover boy had the leather like a flash he sent it rolling back gif coming to his aid  a safety a safety for colby hall  hurrah that puts colby two points ahead  good work for fred rover  now then colby hall youve got em agoing keep it up  pitch into em columbus pitch into em  so the yelling went on while all of the spectators stood up in their seats anxious to see what might be accomplished next but there was no time to do more the whistle blew and the great game was over  colby hall had won  in a twinkling the huge field was covered with spectators running in all directions and the victorious eleven was surrounded many were the congratulations showered on all the players and it may well be believed that jack and fred came in for their full share  the finest game i ever saw declared colonel colby as he shook hands with all his youthful players  oh jack it was simply grandthat run you made exclaimed ruth when she saw him  yes and the way you played for that safety put in may to fred  columbus academy was much disheartened over its defeat yet it cheered the victors and was cheered in return and then the great crowd gradually dispersed  bonfire tonight boys and a big one too cried andy as he rushed up to fairly embrace both his cousins then to work off some of his high spirits the acrobatic youth turned several cartwheels and handsprings  what a pity our folks werent here to see this game said jack wistfully  never mind well write them all the particulars announced randy and well send them copies of the local paper too that will have a full account of it and this was done as soon as possible  after the game refreshments were served to the cadets and their particular friends and in this of course the rovers and the girls from clearwater hall joined then the boys took the girls back to their school in an automobile  we are certainly having one dandy time at this school remarked fred on the way back to colby hall  right you are answered randy  if only we hadnt had that trouble with slugger and nappy remarked jack  oh dont bother about those fellows cried andy i dont believe theyll ever trouble any of us again  but in this he was mistaken brown and martell did trouble them and in what manner will be related in the next volume of this series to be entitled the rover boys on snowshoe island or the old lumbermans treasure box  in that volume we shall meet all the boys and their chums again and also learn the particulars of a queer mystery and also of a great joke played upon professor asa lemm  the cadets of colby hall were a happy crowd that night a great bonfire blazed along the bank of the river and around this the boys cut up to their hearts content then they marched around and around the hall singing loudly  its certainly a dandy school isnt it remarked jack to his cousins  the best ever they answered in a chorus and here for the present we will leave the rover boys and say goodbye   the end     this isnt all  would you like to know what
