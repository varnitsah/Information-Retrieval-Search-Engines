its consequencesbuzzbys helm lashed amidshipsa whaling cruise begun  nobody ever caught john buzzby asleep by any chance whatever  no weasel was ever half so sensitive on that point as he was  wherever he happened to be and in the course of his adventurous life he had been to nearly all parts of the known world he was the first awake in the morning and the last asleep at night he always answered promptly to the first call and was never known by any man living to have been seen with his eyes shut except when he winked and that operation he performed less frequently than other men  john buzzby was an old salta regular trueblue jack tar of the old school who had been born and bred at sea had visited foreign parts innumerable had weathered more storms than he could count and had witnessed more strange sights than he could remember  he was tough and sturdy and grizzled and broad and square and massivea firstrate specimen of a john bull and according to himself always kept his weathereye open  this remark of his was apt to create confusion in the minds of his hearers for john meant the expression to be understood figuratively while in point of fact he almost always kept one of his literal eyes open and the other partially closed but as he reversed the order of arrangement frequently he might have been said to keep his leeeye as much open as the weather one  this peculiarity gave to his countenance an expression of earnest thoughtfulness mingled with humour buzzby was fond of being thought old and he looked much older than he really was  men guessed his age at fiftyfive but they were ten years out in their reckoning for john had numbered only fortyfive summers and was as tough and muscular as ever he had beenalthough not quite so elastic  john buzzby stood on the pier of the seaport town of grayton watching the active operations of the crew of a whaling ship which was on the point of starting for the icebound seas of the frozen regions and making sundry remarks to a stout fairhaired boy of fifteen who stood by his side gazing at the ship with an expression of deep sadness  shes a trimbuilt craft and a good seaboat ill be bound master fred observed the sailor but shes too small by half accordin to my notions and i have seen a few whalers in my day  them bowtimbers too are scarce thick enough for goin bump agin the ice o davis straits  howsomeiver ive seen worse craft drivin a good trade in the polar seas  shes a firstrate craft in all respects and you have too high an opinion of your own judgment replied the youth indignantly  do you suppose that my father who is an older man than yourself and as good a sailor would buy a ship and fit her out and go off to the whalefishery in her if he did not think her a good one  ah  master fred youre a chip of the old blockneck or nothing carry on all sail till you tear the masts out of her  reef the tgallant sails of your temper boy and dont run foul of an old man who has been all but a wetnurse to yetaught ye to walk and swim and pull an oar and build ships and has hauled ye out o the sea when ye fell infrom the time ye could barely stump along on two legs lookin like as if ye was more nor half seas over  well buzzby replied the boy laughing if youve been all that to me i think you have been a wetnurse too  but why do you run down my fathers ship  do you think im going to stand that  no not even from you old boy  hallo youngster shouted a voice from the deck of the vessel in question run up and tell your father were all ready and if he dont make haste hell lose the tide so he will and thatll make us have to start on a friday it will an thatll not do for me no how it wont so make sail and look sharp about it dowont you  what a tongue hes got remarked buzzby  before id go to sea with a first mate who jawed like that id be a landsman  dont ever you git to talk too much master fred wotever ye do  my maxim isand it has served me through life uncommonkeep your weathereye open and your tongue housed xcept when youve got occasion to use it  if that fellowd use his eyes more and his tongue less hed see your father comin down the road there right before the wind with his old sister in tow  how i wish he would have let me go with him muttered fred to himself sorrowfully  no chance now im afeared remarked his companion  the govnors as stiff as a norwester  nothin in the world can turn him once hes made up his mind but a regular soueaster  now if you had been my son and yonder tight craft my ship i would have said come at once but your father knows best lad and youre a wise son to obey orders cheerfully without question  thats another o my maxims obey orders an ax no questions  frederick ellice senior who now approached whispering words of consolation into the ear of his weeping sister might perhaps have just numbered fifty years  he was a fine big bold hearty englishman with a bald head grizzled locks a loud but not harsh voice a rather quick temper and a kind earnest enthusiastic heart  like buzzby he had spent nearly all his life at sea and had become so thoroughly accustomed to walking on an unstable foundation that he felt quite uncomfortable on solid ground and never remained more than a few months at a time on shore  he was a man of good education and gentlemanly manners and had worked his way up in the merchant service step by step until he obtained the command of a west india trader  a few years previous to the period in which our tale opens an event occurred which altered the course of captain ellices life and for a long period plunged him into the deepest affliction  this was the loss of his wife at sea under peculiarly distressing circumstances  at the age of thirty captain ellice had married a pretty blueeyed girl who resolutely refused to become a sailors bride unless she should be permitted to accompany her husband to sea  this was without much difficulty agreed to and forthwith alice bremner became mrs ellice and went to sea  it was during her third voyage to the west indies that our hero fred was born and it was during this and succeeding voyages that buzzby became all but a wetnurse to him  mrs ellice was a loving gentle seriouslyminded woman  she devoted herself heart and soul to the training of her boy and spent many a pleasant hour in that little unsteady cabin in endeavouring to instil into his infant mind the blessed truths of christianity and in making the name of jesus familiar to his ear  as fred grew older his mother encouraged him to hold occasional intercourse with the sailors for her husbands example taught her the value of a bold manly spirit and she knew that it was impossible for her to instil that into him but she was careful to guard him from the evil that he might chance to learn from the men by committing him to the tender care of buzzby  to do the men justice however this was almost unnecessary for they felt that a mothers watchful eye was on the child and no unguarded word fell from their lips while he was romping about the forecastle  when it was time for fred to go to school mrs ellice gave up her roving life and settled in her native town of grayton where she resided with her widowed sister amelia bright and her niece isobel here fred received the rudiments of an excellent education at a private academy  at the age of twelve however master fred became restive and during one of his fathers periodical visits home begged to be taken to sea  captain ellice agreed mrs ellice insisted on accompanying them and in a few weeks they were once again on their old home the ocean and fred was enjoying his native air in company with his friend buzzby who stuck to the old ship like one of her own stout timbers  but this was destined to be a disastrous voyage  one evening after crossing the line they descried a suspiciouslooking schooner to windward bearing down upon them under a cloud of canvas  what do you think of her buzzby enquired captain ellice handing his glass to the seaman  buzzby gazed in silence and with compressed lips for some time then he returned the glass at the same time muttering the word pirate  i thought so said the captain in a deep unsteady voice  there is but one course for us buzzby he continued glancing towards his wife who all unconscious of their danger sat near the taffrail employed with her needle these fellows show no mercy because they expect none either from god or man  we must fight to the last  go prepare the men and get out the arms  ill tell my wife  buzzby went forward but the captains heart failed him and he took two or three rapid hesitating turns on the quarterdeck ere he could make up his mind to speak  alice he said at length abruptly yonder vessel is a pirate  mrs ellice looked up in surprise and her face grew pale as her eye met the troubled gaze of her husband  are you quite sure frederick  yes quite  would god that i were left alone tobutnay do not be alarmed perhaps i am wrong it may be aa clipperbuilt trading vessel  if not alice we must make some show of fighting and try to frighten them  meanwhile you must go below  the captain spoke encouragingly as he led his wife to the cabin but his candid countenance spoke too truthfully and she felt that his look of anxious concern bade her fear the worst  pressing her fervently to his heart captain ellice sprang on deck  by this time the news had spread through the ship and the crew consisting of upwards of thirty men were conversing earnestly in knots of four or five while they sharpened and buckled on cutlasses or loaded pistols and carbines  send the men aft mr thompson said the captain as he paced the deck to and fro casting his eyes occasionally on the schooner which was rapidly nearing the vessel  take another pull at these maintopsailhalyards and send the steward down below for my sword and pistols  let the men look sharp weve no time to lose and hot work is before us  i will go for your sword father cried fred who had just come on deck  boy boy you must go below you can be of no use here  but father you know that im not afraid  i know that boy i know it well but youre too young to fight youre not strong enough besides you must comfort and cheer your mother she may want you  i am old enough and strong enough to load and fire a pistol father and i heard one of the men say we would need all the hands on board and more if we had them besides it was my mother who told me what was going on and sent me on deck to help you to fight  a momentary gleam of pride lit up the countenance of the captain as he said hastily you may stay then and turned towards the men who now stood assembled on the quarterdeck  addressing the crew in his own blunt vigorous style he said lads yon rascally schooner is a pirate as you all know well enough  i need not ask you if you are ready to fighti see by your looks you are  but thats not enoughyou must make up your minds to fight well  you know that pirates give no quarter  i see the decks are swarming with men  if you dont go at them like bulldogs youll walk the plank before sunset every man of you  now go forward and doubleshot your muskets and pistols and stick as many of the latter into your belts as they will hold  mr thompson let the gunner doubleshot the four big guns and load the little carronade with musket balls to the muzzle  if they do try to board us theyll get a warm reception  there goes a shot sir said buzzby pointing towards the piratical schooner from the side of which a white cloud burst and a round shot ricochetted over the sea passing close ahead of the ship  ay thats a request for us to layto said the captain bitterly but we wont  keep her away a point  ay ay sir sung out the man at the wheel  a second and third shot were fired but passed unheeded and the captain fully expecting that the next would be fired into them ordered the men below  we cant afford to lose a man mr thompson send them all down  please sir may i remain said buzzby touching his hat  obey orders answered the captain sternly  the sailor went below with a sulky fling  for nearly an hour the two vessels cut through the water before a steady breeze during which time the fastsailing schooner gradually overhauled the heavy westindiaman until she approached within speaking distance still captain ellice paid no attention to her but stood with compressed lips beside the man at the wheel gazing alternately at the sails of his vessel and at the windward horizon where he fancied he saw indications that led him to hope the breeze would fail ere long  as the schooner drew nearer a man leaped on the hammocknettings and putting a trumpet to his mouth sang out lustily ship ahoy where are you from and whats your cargo  captain ellice made no reply but ordered four of his men on deck to point one of the sternchasers  again the voice came harshly across the waves as if in passion heave to or ill sink you  at the same moment the black flag was run up to the peak and a shot passed between the main and foremast  stand by to point this gun said the captain in a subdued voice  ay ay sir  fetch a redhot iron luff luff a littlea little moresteady so at the last word there was a puff and a roar and an iron messenger flew towards the schooner  the gun had been fired more as a reply of defiance to the pirate than with the hope of doing him any damage but the shot had been well aimedit cut the schooners mainsailyard in two and brought it rattling down on deck  instantly the pirate yawed and delivered a broadside but in the confusion on deck the guns were badly aimed and none took effect  the time lost in this manoeuvre added to the crippled condition of the schooner enabled the westindiaman to gain considerably on her antagonist but the pirate kept up a welldirected fire with his bowchasers and many of the shots struck the hull and cut the rigging seriously  as the sun descended towards the horizon the wind fell gradually and ceased at length altogether so that both vessels lay rolling on the swell with their sails flapping idly against the masts  theyre a gittin out the boats sir remarked john buzzby who unable to restrain himself any longer had crept upon deck at the risk of another reprimand and if my eyes bent deceiving me theres a sail on the horizon to windardleastways the direction which wos windard afore it fell calm  shes bringing a breeze along with her remarked the captain but i fear the boats will come up before it reaches us  there are three in the water and manned already  there they come  now then call up all hands  in a few seconds the crew of the westindiaman were at their stations ready for action and captain ellice with fred at his elbow stood beside one of the sternchasers  meanwhile the boats of the pirate five in numberpulled away in different directions evidently with the intention of attacking the ship at different points  they were full of men armed to the teeth  while they rowed towards the ship the schooner resumed its fire and one ball cut away the spanker boom and slightly wounded two of the men with splinters  the guns of the ship were now brought to bear on the boats but without effect although the shot plunged into the water all round them  as they drew nearer a brisk fire of musketry was opened on them and the occasional falling of an oar and confusion on board showed that the shots told  the pirates replied vigorously but without effect as the men of the ship were sheltered by the bulwarks  pass the word to load and reserve fire said the captain and hand me a musket fred  load again as fast as i fire  so saying the captain took aim and fired at the steersman of the largest boat which pulled towards the stern  another fred  at this moment a withering volley was poured upon the boat and a savage yell of agony followed while the rowerswho remained unhurtpaused for an instant as if paralysed  next instant they recovered and another stroke would have brought them almost alongside when captain ellice pointed the little carronade and fired  there was a terrific crash the gun recoiled violently to the other side of the deck and the pirate boat sank leaving the sea covered with dead and wounded men  a number however who seemed to bear charmed lives seized their cutlasses with their teeth and swam boldly for the ship  this incident unfortunately attracted too much of the attention of the crew and ere they could prevent it another boat reached the bow of the ship the crew of which sprang up the side like cats formed on the forecastle and poured a volley upon the men  follow me lads shouted the captain as he sprang forward like a tiger  the first man he reached fell by a ball from his pistol in another moment the opposing parties met in a handtohand conflict meanwhile fred having been deeply impressed with the effect of the shot from the little carronade succeeded in raising and reloading it  he had scarcely accomplished this when one of the boats reached the larboard quarter and two of the men sprang up the side  fred observed them and felled the first with a handspike before he reached the deck but the pirate who instantly followed would have killed him had he not been observed by the second mate who had prevented several of the men from joining in the melee on the forecastle in order to meet such an emergency as this  rushing to the rescue with his party he drove the pirates back into the boat which was immediately pulled towards the bow where the other two boats were now grappling and discharging their crews on the forecastle  although the men of the westindiaman fought with desperate courage they could not stand before the increasing numbers of pirates who now crowded the forepart of the ship in a dense mass  gradually they were beaten back and at length were brought to bay on the quarterdeck  help father cried fred pushing through the struggling crowd heres the carronade ready loaded  ha boy well done cried the captain seizing the gun and with the help of buzzby who never left his side dragging it forward  clear the way lads  in a moment the little cannon was pointed to the centre of the mass of men and fired  one awful shriek of agony rose above the din of the fight as a wide gap was cut through the crowd but this only seemed to render the survivors more furious  with a savage yell they charged the quarterdeck but were hurled back again and again by the captain and a few chosen men who stood around him  at length one of the pirates who had been all along conspicuous for his strength and daring stepped deliberately up and pointing a pistol at the captains breast fired captain ellice fell and at the same moment a ball laid the pirate low another charge was made fred rushed forward to protect his father but was thrown down and trodden under foot in the rush and in two minutes more the ship was in possession of the pirates  being filled with rage at the opposition they had met with these villains proceeded as they said to make short work of the crew while several of them sprang into the cabin where they discovered mrs ellice almost dead with terror  dragging her violently on deck they were about to cast her into the sea when buzzby who stood with his hands bound suddenly burst his bonds and sprang towards her  a blow from the butt of a pistol however stretched him insensible on the deck  where is my husbandmy boy screamed mrs ellice wildly  theyve gone before you or theyll soon follow said a savage fiercely as he raised her in his powerful arms and hurled her overboard  a loud shriek was followed by a heavy plunge  at the same moment two of the men raised the captain intending to throw him overboard also when a loud boom arrested their attention and a cannonshot ploughed up the sea close in front of their bows  while the fight was raging no one had observed the fact that the breeze had freshened and a large manofwar with american colours at her peak was now within gunshot of the ship  no sooner did the pirates make this discovery than they rushed to their boats with the intention of pulling to their schooner but those who had been left in charge seeing the approach of the manofwar and feeling that there was no chance of escape for their comrades or as is more than probable being utterly indifferent about them crowded all sail and slipped away and it was now hulldown on the horizon to leeward  the men in the boats rowed after her with the energy of despair but the americans gave chase and we need scarcely add that in a very short time all were captured  when the manofwar rejoined the westindiaman the night had set in and a stiff breeze had arisen so that the long and laborious search that was made for the body of poor mrs ellice proved utterly fruitless captain ellice whose wound was very severe was struck down as if by a thunderbolt and for a long time his life was despaired of  during his illness fred nursed him with the utmost tenderness and in seeking to comfort his father found some relief to his own stricken heart  months passed away  captain ellice was conveyed to the residence of his sister in grayton and under her care and the nursing of his little niece isobel he recovered his wonted health and strength  to the eyes of men captain ellice and his son were themselves again but those who judge of mens hearts by their outward appearance and expressions in nine cases out of ten judge very wide of the mark indeed  both had undergone a great change  the brilliancy and glitter of this world had been completely and rudely dispelled and both had been led to enquire whether there was not something better to live for than mere present advantage and happiness something that would stand by them in those hours of sickness and sorrow which must inevitably sooner or later come upon all men  but captain ellice could not be induced to resume the command of his old ship or voyage again to the west indies  he determined to change the scene of his future labours and sail to the frozen seas where the aspect of every objecteven the ocean itselfwould be very unlikely to recall the circumstances of his loss  some time after his recovery captain ellice purchased a brig and fitted her out as a whaler determined to try his fortune in the northern seas  fred pleaded hard to be taken out but his father felt that he had more need to go to school than to sea so he refused and fred after sighing very deeply once or twice gave in with a good grace  buzzby too who stuck to his old commander like a leech was equally anxious to go but buzzby in a sudden and unaccountable fit of tenderness had just two months before married a wife who might be appropriately described as fat fair and forty and buzzbys wife absolutely forbade him to go  alas  buzzby was no longer his own master  at the age of fortyfive he becameas he himself expressed itan abject slave and he would as soon have tried to steer in a slipper bath right in the teeth of an equinoctial hurricane as have opposed the will of his wife  he used to sigh gruffly when spoken to on this subject and compare himself to a dutch galliot that made more leeway than headway even with a wind on the quarter  once he would remark i was clipperbuilt and could sail right in the winds eye but ever since i tuck this craft in tow ive gone to leeward like a tub  in fact i find theres only one way of going ahead with my poll and that is right before the wind  i used to yaw about a good deal at first but she tuck that out o me in a day or two  if i put the helm only so much as one stroke to starboard she guv a tug at the towrope that brought the wind dead aft again so ive gin it up and lashed the tiller right amidships  so buzzby did not accompany his old commander he did not even so much as suggest the possibility of it but he shook his head with great solemnity as he stood with fred and mrs bright and isobel at the end of the pier gazing at the brig with one eye very much screwed up and a wistful expression in the other while the graceful craft spread out her canvas and bent over to the breeze    chapter two  departure of the pole star for the frozen seassage reflections of mrs bright and sagacious remarks of buzzbyanxieties fears surmises and resolutionsisobela search proposeddeparture of the dolphin for the far north  digressions are bad at the best and we feel some regret that we should have been compelled to begin our book with one but they are necessary evils sometimes so we must ask our readers forgiveness and beg him or her to remember that we are still at the commencement of our story standing at the end of the pier and watching the departure of the pole star whaleship which is now a scarcely distinguishable speck on the horizon  as it disappeared buzzby gave a grunt fred and isobel uttered a sigh in unison and mrs bright resumed the fit of weeping which for some time she had unconsciously suspended  i fear we shall never see him again sobbed mrs bright as she took isobel by the hand and sauntered slowly home accompanied by fred and buzzby the latter of whom seemed to regard himself in the light of a shaggy newfoundland or mastiff who had been left to protect the family we are always hearing of whaleships being lost and somehow or other we never hear of the crews being saved as one reads of when ships are wrecked in the usual way on the seashore  isobel squeezed her mothers hand and looked up in her face with an expression that said plainly dont cry so mamma im sure he will come back but she could not find words to express herself so she glanced towards the mastiff for help  buzzby felt that it devolved upon him to afford consolation under the circumstances but mrs brights mind was of that peculiar stamp which repels advances in the way of consolation unconsciously and buzzby was puzzled  he screwed up first the right eye and then the left and smote his thigh repeatedly and assuredly if contorting his visage could have comforted mrs bright she would have returned home a happy woman for he made faces at her violently for full five minutes but it did her no good perhaps because she didnt see him her eyes being suffused with tears  ah yes resumed mrs bright with another burst i know they will never come back and your silence shows that you think so too and to think of their taking two years provisions with them in case of accidentsdoesnt that prove that there are going to be accidents and didnt i hear one of the sailors say that she was a crack ship a number one  i dont know what he meant by a number one but if shes a cracked ship i know she will never come back and although i told my dear brother of it and advised him not to go he only laughed at me which was very unkind im sure  here mrs brights feelings overcame her again  why aunt said fred scarce able to restrain a laugh despite the sadness that lay at his heart when the sailor said it was a crack ship he meant that it was a good one a firstrate one  then why did he not say what he meant  but you are talking nonsense boy do you think that i will believe a man means to say a thing is good when he calls it cracked and im sure nobody would say a cracked teapot was as good as a whole one but tell me buzzby do you think they ever will come back  why maam in coorse i do replied buzzby vehemently for why if they dont theyre the first that ever went out o this port in my day as didnt  theyve a good ship and lots o grub and its like to be a good season and captain ellice has for the most part good luck and theyve started with a fair wind and kep clear of a friday and what more could ye wish  i only wish as i was aboard along with them thats all  buzzby delivered himself of this oration with the left eye shut and screwed up and the right one open  having concluded he shut and screwed up the right eye and opened the lefthe reversed the engine so to speak as if he wished to back out from the scene of his triumph and leave the course clear for others to speak  but his words were thrown away on mrs bright who was emphatically a weakminded woman and never exercised her reason at all except in a spasmodic galvanic sort of way when she sought to defend or to advocate some unreasonable conclusion of some sort at which her own weak mind had arrived somehow so she shook her head and sobbed goodbye to buzzby as she ascended the sloping avenue that led to her pretty cottage on the green hill that overlooked the harbour and the sea beyond  as for john buzzby having been absent from home full half an hour beyond his usual dinnerhour he felt that for a man who had lashed his helm amidships he was yawing alarmingly out of his course so he spread all the canvas he could carry and steered right before the wind towards the village where in a little whitewashed lowroofed onedoored and twolittlewindowed cottage his spouse and dinner awaited him  to make a long story short three years passed away but the pole star did not return and no news of her could be got from the various whaleships that visited the port of grayton  towards the end of the second year buzzby began to shake his head despondingly and as the third drew to a close the expression of gloom never left his honest weatherbeaten face  mrs bright too whose anxiety at first was only half genuine now became seriously alarmed and the fate of the missing brig began to be the talk of the neighbourhood  meanwhile fred ellice and isobel grew and improved in mind and body but anxiety as to his fathers fate rendered the former quite unable to pursue his studies and he determined at last to procure a passage in a whaleship and go out in search of the brig  it happened that the principal merchant and shipowner in the town mr singleton by name was an intimate friend and old schoolfellow of captain ellice so fred went boldly to him and proposed that a vessel should be fitted out immediately and sent off to search for his fathers brig  mr singleton smiled at the request and pointed out the utter impossibility of his agreeing to it but he revived freds sinking hopes by saying that he was about to send out a whaler to the northern seas at any rate and that he would give orders to the captain to devote a portion of his time to the search and moreover agreed to let fred go as a passenger in company with his own son tom  now tom singleton had been freds bosom friend and companion during his first year at school but during the last two years he had been sent to the edinburgh university to prosecute his medical studies and the two friends had only met at rare intervals  it was with unbounded delight therefore that he found his old companion now a youth of twenty was to go out as surgeon of the ship and he could scarce contain himself as he ran down to buzzbys cottage to tell him the good news and ask him to join  of course buzzby was ready to go and what was of far greater importance in the matter his wife threw no obstacle in the way  on the contrary she undid the lashings of the helm with her own hand and told her wondering partner with a goodhumoured but firm smile to steer where he chose and she would content herself with the society of the two young buzzbys both miniature facsimiles of their father till he came back  once again a whaleship prepared to sail from the port of grayton and once again mrs bright and isobel stood on the pier to see her depart isobel was about thirteen now and as pretty a girl according to buzzby as you could meet with in any part of britain  her eyes were blue and her hair nutbrown and her charms of face and figure were enhanced immeasurably by an air of modesty and earnestness that went straight home to your heart and caused you to adore her at once buzzby doated on her as if she were his only child and felt a secret pride in being in some undefinable way her protector  buzzby philosophised about her too after a strange fashion  you see he would say to fred its not that her figurehead is cut altogether after a parfect pattern by no means for ive seen picturs and statues that wos better but she carries her head a little down dye see master fred and theres where it is thats the way i gauges the worth o young women jist accordin as they carry their chins up or down  if their brows come well forard and they seems to be lookin at the ground they walk on i knows their brains is firm stuff and in good workin order but when i sees them carryin their noses high out o the water as if they wos afeard o catchin sight o their own feet and their chins elewated so that a little boy standin in front o them couldnt see their faces nohow i make pretty sure that tother end is filled with a sort o mush thats fit only to think o dress and dancing  on the present occasion isobels eyes were red and swollen and by no means improved by weeping  mrs bright too although three years had done little to alter her character seemed to be less demonstrative and much more sincere than usual in her grief at parting from fred  in a few minutes all was ready  young singleton and buzzby having hastily but earnestly bade mrs bright and her daughter farewell leaped on board  fred lingered for a moment  once more dear aunt said he farewell  with gods blessing we shall come back soon  write to me darling isobel wont you to uppernavik on the coast of greenland  if none of our ships are bound in that direction write by way of denmark  old mr singleton will tell you how to address your letter and see that it be a long one  now then youngster jump aboard shouted the captain look sharp  ay ay returned fred and in another moment he was on the quarterdeck by the side of his friend tom  the ship loosed from her moorings spread her canvas and plunged forward on her adventurous voyage  but this time she does not grow smaller as she advances before the freshening breeze for you and i reader have embarked in her and the land now fades in the distance until it sinks from view on the distant horizon while nothing meets our gaze but the vault of the bright blue sky above and the plain of the dark blue sea below    chapter three  the voyagethe dolphin and her crewice aheadpolar scenesmasthead observationsthe first whalegreat excitement  and now we have fairly got into blue waterthe sailors delight the landsmans dread    the sea the sea the open sea   the blue the fresh the ever free  its my opinion remarked buzzby to singleton one day as they stood at the weather gangway watching the foam that spread from the vessels bow as she breasted the waves of the atlantic gallantlyits my opinion that our skipper is made o the right stuff  hes entered quite into the spirit of the thing and i heard him say to the first mate yesterday hed made up his mind to run right up into baffins bay and make enquiries for captain ellice first before goin to his usual whalinground  now thats wot i call doin the right thing for ye see he runs no small risk o gettin beset in the ice and losing the fishin season altogether by so doin  hes a fine fellow said singleton i like him better every day and i feel convinced he will do his utmost to discover the whereabouts of our missing friend but i fear much that our chances are small for although we know the spot which captain ellice intended to visit we cannot tell to what part of the frozen ocean ice and currents may have carried him  true replied buzzby giving to his left eye and cheek just that peculiar amount of screw which indicated intense sagacity and penetration but ive a notion that if they are to be found captain guy is the man to find em  i hope it may turn out as you say  have you ever been in these seas before buzzby  no sirnever but ive got a halfbrother wot has bin in the greenland whalefishery and ive bin in the southsea line myself  what line was that buzzby enquired david summers a sturdy boy of about fifteen who acted as assistant steward and was in fact a nautical maidofallwork  was it a logline or a bowline or a codline or a bit of the equatoreh  the old salt deigned no reply to this passing sally but continued his converse with singleton  i could give ye many a long yarn about the south seas said buzzby gazing abstractedly down into the deep  one time when i was about fifty mile to the souwest o cape horn i  dinners ready sir said a thin tall active man stepping smartly up to singleton and touching his cap  we must talk over that some other time buzzby  the captain loves punctuality  so saying the young surgeon sprang down the companion ladder leaving the old salt to smoke his pipe in solitude  and here we may pause a few seconds to describe our ship and her crew  the dolphin was a tight new barquerigged vessel of about three hundred tons burden built expressly for the northern whalefishery and carried a crew of fortyfive men  ships that have to battle with the ice require to be much more powerfully built than those that sail in unencumbered seas  the dolphin united strength with capacity and buoyancy  the under part of her hull and sides were strengthened with double timbers and fortified externally with plates of iron while internally stanchions and crossbeams were so arranged as to cause pressure on any part to be supported by the whole structure and on her bows where shocks from the ice might be expected to be most frequent and severe extra planking of immense strength and thickness was secured  in other respects the vessel was fitted up much in the same manner as ordinary merchantmen  the only other peculiarity about her worthy of notice was the crowsnest a sort of barrelshaped structure fastened to the foremasthead in which when at the whalingground a man is stationed to look out for whales  the chief men in the ship were captain guy a vigorous practical american mr bolton the first mate an earnest stout burly offhand englishman and mr saunders the second mate a sedate broadshouldered rawboned scot whose opinion of himself was unbounded whose power of argument was extraordinary not to say exasperating and who stood six feet three in his stockings mivins the steward was as we have already remarked a tall thin active young man of a brisk lively disposition and was somewhat of a butt among the men but being in a position of power and trust he was respected  the young surgeon tom singleton whom we have yet scarcely introduced to the reader was a tall slim but firmlyknit youth with a kind gentle disposition  he was always open straightforward and polite  he never indulged in broad humour though he enjoyed it much seldom ventured on a witticism was rather shy in the company of his companions and spoke little but for a quiet pleasant teteatete there was not a man in the ship equal to tom singleton  his countenance was spanishlooking and handsome his hair black short and curling and his budding moustache was soft and dark as the eyebrow of an andalusian belle  it would be unpardonable in this catalogue to omit the cook david mizzle  he was round and fat and oily as one of his own duff puddings  to look at him you could not help suspecting that he purloined and ate at least half of the salt pork he cooked and his sly dimpling laugh in which every feature participated from the point of his broad chin to the top of his bald head rather tended to favour this supposition  mizzle was prematurely baldbeing quite a young manand when questioned on the subject he usually attributed it to the fact of his having been so long employed about the cookingcoppers that the excessive heat to which he was exposed had stewed all the hair off his head  the crew was made up of stout active men in the prime of life nearly all of whom had been more or less accustomed to the whalefishing and some of the harpooners were giants in muscular development and breadth of shoulder if not in height  chief among these harpooners was amos parr a short thickset powerful man of about thirtyfive who had been at sea since he was a little boy and had served in the fisheries of both the northern and southern seas no one knew what country had the honour of producing himindeed he was ignorant of that point himself for although he had vivid recollections of his childhood having been spent among green hills and trees and streamlets he was sent to sea with a strange captain before he was old enough to care about the name of his native land  afterwards he ran away from his ship and so lost all chance of ever discovering who he was but as he sometimes remarked he didnt much care who he was so long as he was himself so it didnt matter  from a slight peculiarity in his accent and other qualities it was surmised that he must be an irishmana supposition which he rather encouraged being partial to the sons and particularly partial to the daughters of the emerald isle one of which last he had married just six months before setting out on this whaling expedition  such was the dolphin and her crew and merrily they bowled along over the broad atlantic with favouring winds and without meeting with anything worthy of note until they neared the coast of greenland  one fine morning just as the party in the cabin had finished breakfast and were dallying with the last few morsels of the repast as men who have more leisure than they desire are wont to do there was a sudden shock felt and a slight tremor passed through the ship as if something had struck her  ha exclaimed captain guy finishing his cup of chocolate there goes the first bump  ice ahead sir said the first mate looking down the skylight  is there much asked the captain rising and taking down a small telescope from the hook on which it usually hung  not much sironly a stream but there is an ice blink right ahead all along the horizon  hows her head mr bolton  norwest and by north sir  before this brief conversation came to a close fred ellice and tom singleton sprang up the companion and stood on the deck gazing ahead with feelings of the deepest interest  both youths were well read in the history of polar seas and regions they were well acquainted by name at least with floes and bergs and hummocks of ice but neither of them had seen such in reality  these objects were associated in their young minds with all that was romantic and wild hyperborean and polar brilliant and sparkling and light and whiteemphatically white  to behold ice actually floating on the salt sea was an incident of note in their existence and certainly the impressions of their first day in the ice remained sharp vivid and prominent long after scenes of a much more striking nature had faded from the tablets of their memories  at first the prospect that met their ardent gaze was not calculated to excite excessive admiration  there were only a few masses of low ice floating about in various directions  the wind was steady but light and seemed as if it would speedily fall altogether  gradually the blink on the horizon as the light haze always distinguishable above ice or snowcovered land is called resolved itself into a long white line of ice which seemed to grow larger as the ship neared it and in about two hours more they were fairly in the midst of the pack which was fortunately loose enough to admit of the vessel being navigated through the channels of open water  soon after the sun broke out in cloudless splendour and the wind fell entirely leaving the ocean in a dead calm  lets go to the foretop tom said fred seizing his friend by the arm and hastening to the shrouds  in a few seconds they were seated alone on the little platform at the top of the foremast just where it is connected with the foretopmast and from this elevated position they gazed in silent delight upon the fairylike scene  those who have never stood at the masthead of a ship at sea in a dead calm cannot comprehend the feeling of intense solitude that fills the mind in such a position  there is nothing analogous to it on land  to stand on the summit of a tower and look down on the busy multitude below is not the same for there the sounds are quite different in tone and signs of life are visible all over the distant country while cries from afar reach the ear as well as those from below  but from the masthead you hear only the few subdued sounds under your feetall beyond is silence you behold only the small ovalshaped platform that is your worldbeyond lies the calm desolate ocean  on deck you cannot realise this feeling for there sails and yards tower above you and masts and boats and cordage intercept your view but from above you take in the intense minuteness of your home at a single glanceyou stand aside as it were and in some measure comprehend the insignificance of the thing to which you have committed your life  the scene witnessed by our friends at the masthead of the dolphin on this occasion was surpassingly beautiful  far as the eye could stretch the sea was covered with islands and fields of ice of every conceivable shape  some rose in little peaks and pinnacles some floated in the form of arches and domes some were broken and rugged like the ruins of old border strongholds while others were flat and level like fields of white marble and so calm was it that the ocean in which they floated seemed like a groundwork of polished steel in which the sun shone with dazzling brilliancy  the tops of the icy islets were pure white and the sides of the higher ones of a delicate blue colour which gave to the scene a transparent lightness that rendered it preeminently fairylike  it far surpasses anything i ever conceived ejaculated singleton after a long silence  no wonder that authors speak of scenes being indescribable  does it not seem like a dream fred  tom said fred earnestly ive been trying to fancy myself in another world and i have almost succeeded  when i look long and intensely at the ice i get almost to believe that these are streets and palaces and cathedrals  i never felt so strong a desire to have wings that i might fly from one island to another and go floating in and out and round about those blue caves and sparkling pinnacles  its a curious fancy fred but not unnatural  tom said fred after another long silence has not the thought occurred to you that god made it all  some such thought did cross my mind fred for a moment but it soon passed away  is it not very strange that the idea of the creator is so seldom and so slightly connected with his works in our minds  again there was a long silence  both youths had a desire to continue the conversation and yet each felt an unaccountable reluctance to renew it  neither of them distinctly understood that the natural heart is enmity against god and that until he is converted by the holy spirit man neither loves to think of his maker nor to speak of him  while they sat thus musing a breeze dimmed the surface of the sea and the dolphin which had hitherto lain motionless in one of the numerous canals began slowly to advance between the islands of ice  the breeze freshened and rendered it impossible to avoid an occasional collision with the floating masses but the good ship was well armed for the fight and although she quivered under the blows and once or twice recoiled she pushed her way through the pack gallantly  in the course of an hour or two they were once more in comparatively clear water  suddenly there came a cry from the crowsnest there she blows  instantly every man in the ship sprang to his feet as if he had received an electric shock  where away shouted the captain  on the leebow sir replied the lookout  from a state of comparative quiet and repose the ship was now thrown into a condition of the utmost animation and apparently unmeaning confusion  the sight of a whale acted on the spirits of the men like wildfire  there she blows sang out the man at the masthead again  are we keeping right for her asked the captain  keep her away a bit steady replied the lookout  steady it is answered the man at the wheel  call all hands and get the boats out mr bolton said the captain  all hands ahoy shouted the mate in a tempestuous voice while the men rushed to their respective stations  boatsteerers get your boats ready  ay ay sir  there go flukes cried the lookout as the whale dived and tossed its flukes that is its tail in the air not more than a mile on the leebow shes heading right for the ship  down with the helm roared the captain  mr bolton brace up the mizzen topsail  hoist and swing the boats  lower away  in another moment three boats struck the water and their respective crews tumbled tumultuously into them  fred and singleton sprang into the sternsheets of the captains boat just as it pushed off and in less than five minutes the three boats were bounding over the sea in the direction of the whale like racehorses  every man did his best and the tough oars bent like hoops as each boats crew strove to outstrip the others    chapter four  the chase and the battlethe chances and dangers of whaling warbuzzby dives for his life and saves itso does the whale and loses itan anxious night which terminates happily though with a heavy loss  the chase was not a long one for while the boats were rowing swiftly towards the whale the whale was all unconsciously swimming towards the boats  give way now lads give way said the captain in a suppressed voice bend your backs boys and dont let the mate beat us  the three boats flew over the sea as the men strained their muscles to the utmost and for some time they kept almost in line being pretty equally matched but gradually the captain shot ahead and it became evident that his harpooner amos parr was to have the honour of harpooning the first whale  amos pulled the bow oar and behind him was the tub with the line coiled away and the harpoon bent on to it  being an experienced whaleman he evinced no sign of excitement save in the brilliancy of his dark eye and a very slight flush on his bronzed face they had now neared the whale and ceased rowing for a moment lest they should miss it when down  there she goes cried fred in a tone of intense excitement as he caught sight of the whale not more than fifty yards ahead of the boat  now boys said the captain in a hoarse whisper spring hard lay back hard i saystand up  at the last word amos parr sprang to his feet and seized the harpoon the boat ran right on to the whales back and in an instant parr sent two irons to the hitches into the fish  stern all  the men backed their oars with all their might in order to avoid the flukes of the wounded monster of the deep as it plunged down headlong into the sea taking the line out perpendicularly like lightning  this was a moment of great danger  the friction of the line as it passed the loggerhead was so great that parr had to keep constantly pouring water on it to prevent its catching fire  a hitch in the line at that time as it flew out of the tub or any accidental entanglement would have dragged the boat and crew right down  many such fatal accidents occur to whalers and many a poor fellow has had a foot or an arm torn off or been dragged overboard and drowned in consequence of getting entangled  one of the men stood ready with a small hatchet to cut the line in a moment if necessary for whales sometimes run out all that is in a boat at the first plunge and should none of the other boats be at hand to lend a second line to attach to the one nearly expended there is nothing for it but to cut  on the present occasion however none of these accidents befel the men of the captains boat  the line ran all clear and long before it was exhausted the whale ceased to descend and the slack was hauled rapidly in  meanwhile the other boats pulled up to the scene of action and prepared to strike the instant the fish should rise to the surface  it appeared suddenly not twenty yards from the mates boat where buzzby who was harpooner stood in the bow ready to give it the iron  spring lads spring shouted the mate as the whale spouted into the air a thick stream of water  the boat dashed up and buzzby planted his harpoon vigorously  instantly the broad flukes of the tail were tossed into the air and for a single second spread like a canopy over buzzbys head  there was no escape  the quick eye of the whaleman saw at a glance that the effort to back out was hopeless  he bent his head and the next moment was deep down in the waves  just as he disappeared the flukes descended on the spot which he had left and cut the bow of the boat completely away sending the stern high into the air with a violence that tossed men and oars and shattered planks and cordage flying over the monsters back into the seething caldron of foam around him  it was apparently a scene of the most complete and instantaneous destruction yet strange to say not a man was lost  a few seconds after the white foam of the sea was dotted with black heads as the men rose one by one to the surface and struck out for floating oars and pieces of the wrecked boat  theyre lost cried fred ellice in a voice of horror  not a bit of it youngster theyre safe enough ill warrant replied the captain as his own boat flew past the spot towed by the whale pay out amos parr give him line or hell tear the bows out of us  ay ay sir sang out amos as he sat coolly pouring water on the loggerhead round which a coil of the rope was whizzing like lightning all right  the mates men are all safe sir i counted them as we shot past and i seed buzzby come up last of all blowin like a grampus and small wonder considerin the dive he took  take another turn of the coil amos and hold on said the captain  the harpooneer obeyed and away they went after the whale like a rocket with a tremendous strain on the line and a bank of white foam gurgling up to the edge of the gunwale that every moment threatened to fill the boat and sink her  such a catastrophe is not of unfrequent occurrence when whalemen thus towed by a whale are tempted to hold on too long and many instances have happened of boats and their crews being in this way dragged under water and lost  fortunately the whale dashed horizontally through the water so that the boat was able to hold on and follow and in a short time the creature paused and rose for air  again the men bent to their oars and the rope was hauled in until they came quite close to the fish  this time a harpoon was thrown and a deep lancethrust given which penetrated to the vital parts of its huge carcass as was evidenced by the blood which it spouted and the convulsive lashing of its tremendous tail  while the captains crew were thus engaged saunders the second mate observing from the ship the accident to the first mates boat sent off a party of men to the rescue thus setting free the third boat which was steered by a strapping fellow named peter grim to follow up the chase  peter grim was the ships carpenter and he took after his name he was as the sailors expressed it a grim customer being burnt by the sun to a deep rich brown colour besides being covered nearly up to the eyes with a thick coalblack beard and moustache which completely concealed every part of his visage except his prominent nose and dark fierylooking eyes  he was an immense man the largest in the ship probably if we except the scotch second mate saunders to whom he was about equal in all respectsexcept argument  like most big men he was peaceable and goodhumoured  look alive now lads said grim as the men pulled towards the whale well get a chance yet we shall if you give way like tigers  split your sides boysdothats it  ah there she goes right down  pull away now and be ready when she rises  as he spoke the whale suddenly sounded that is went perpendicularly down as it had done when first struck and continued to descend until most of the line in the captains boat was run out  hoist an oar cried amos parr as he saw the coil diminishing  grim observed the signal of distress and encouraged his men to use their utmost exertions  another oaranother shouted parr as the whale continued its headlong descent  stand by to cut the line said captain guy with compressed lips  no hold on hold on  at this moment having drawn down more than a thousand fathoms of rope the whale slackened its speed and parr taking another coil round the loggerhead held on until the boat was almost dragged under water  then the line became loose and the slack was hauled in rapidly  meanwhile grims boat had reached the spot and the men now lay on their oars at some distance ahead ready to pull the instant the whale should show itself  up it came not twenty yards ahead  one short energetic pull and the second boat sent a harpoon deep into it while grim sprang to the bow and thrust a lance with deadly force deep into the carcass the monster sent up a stream of mingled blood oil and water and whirled its huge tail so violently that the sound could be heard a mile off  before it dived again the captains boat came up and succeeded in making fast another harpoon while several additional lancethrusts were given with effect and it seemed as if the battle were about to terminate when suddenly the whale struck the sea with a clap like thunder and darted away once more like a rocket to windward tearing the two boats after it as if they had been eggshells  meanwhile a change had come over the scene  the sun had set red and lowering behind a bank of dark clouds and there was every appearance of stormy weather but as yet it was nearly calm and the ship was unable to beat up against the light breeze in the wake of the two boats which were soon far away on the horizon  then a furious gust arose and passed away a dark cloud covered the sky as night fell and soon boats and whale were utterly lost to view  waes me cried the big scotch mate as he ran up and down the quarterdeck wringing his hands what is to be done noo  saunders spoke a mongrel kind of languagea mixture of scotch and englishin which although the scotch words were sparsely scattered the scotch accent was very strong  hows her head  nornorwest sir  keep her there then  maybe if the wind holds stiddy we may overhaul them before its quite dark  although saunders was really in a state of the utmost consternation at this unexpected termination to the whalehunt and expressed the agitation of his feelings pretty freely he was too thorough a seaman to neglect anything that was necessary to be done under the circumstances he took the exact bearings of the point at which the boats had disappeared and during the night which turned out gusty and threatening kept making short tacks while lanterns were hung at the mastheads and a huge torch or rather a small bonfire of tarred materials was slung at the end of a spar and thrust out over the stern of the ship  but for many hours there was no sign of the boats and the crew of the dolphin began to entertain the most gloomy forebodings regarding them  at length towards morning a small speck of light was noticed on the weatherbeam  it flickered for a moment and then disappeared  did ye see yon said saunders to mivins in an agitated whisper laying his huge hand on the shoulder of that worthy  down your helm to the steersman  ay ay sir  stiddy  steady it is sir  mivins face which for some hours had worn an expression of deep anxiety relaxed into a bland smile and he smote his thigh powerfully as he exclaimed thats them sir and no mistake  whats your opinion mr saunders  the second mate peered earnestly in the direction in which the light had been seen and mivins turning in the same direction screwed up his visage into a knot of earnest attention so complicated and intense that it seemed as if no human power could evermore unravel it  there it goes again cried saunders as the light flashed distinctly over the sea  down helm back foretopsails he shouted springing forward lower away the boat there  in a few seconds the ship was hove to and a boat with a lantern fixed to an oar was plunging over the swell in the direction of the light sooner than was expected they came up with it and a hurrah in the distance told that all was right  here we are thank god cried captain guy safe and sound  we dont require assistance mr saunders pull for the ship  a short pull sufficed to bring the three boats alongside and in a few seconds more the crew were congratulating their comrades with that mingled feeling of deep heartiness and a disposition to jest which is characteristic of men who are used to danger and think lightly of it after it is over  weve lost our fish however remarked captain guy as he passed the crew on his way to the cabin but we must hope for better luck next time  well well said one of the men wringing the water out of his wet clothes as he walked forward we got a good laugh at peter grim if we got nothin else by our trip  how was that jack  why ye see jist before the whale gave in it sent up a spout o blood and oil as thick as the mainmast and as luck would have it down it came slap on the head of grim drenchin him from head to foot and makin him as red as a lobster  ow did you lose the fish sir enquired mivins as our hero sprang up the side followed by singleton  lost him as men lose money in railway speculations nowadays  we sank him and that was the last of it  after he had towed us i dont know how farout of sight of the ship at any ratehe suddenly stopped and we pulled up and gave him some tremendous digs with the lances until he spouted jets of blood and we made sure of him when all at once down he went head foremost like a cannonball and took all the line out of both boats so we had to cut and he never came up again  at least if he did it became so dark that we never saw him  then we pulled to where we thought the ship was and after rowing nearly all night caught sight of your lights and here we are deadtired wet to the skin and minus about two miles of whaleline and three harpoons    chapter five  miscellaneous reflectionsthe coast of greenlanduppernaviknews of the pole starmidnight dayscientific facts and fairylike scenestom singletons opinion of poor old womenin danger of a squeezeescape  in pursuance of his original intention captain guy now proceeded through davis straits into baffins bay at the head of which he intended to search for the vessel of his friend captain ellice and afterwards prosecute the whalefishery  off the coast of greenland many whalers were seen actively engaged in warfare with the giants of the polar seas and to several of these captain guy spoke in the faint hope of gleaning some information as to the fate or the pole star but without success  it was now apparent to the crew of the dolphin that they were engaged as much on a searching as a whaling expedition and the fact that the commander of the lost vessel was the father of young mr fred as they styled our hero induced them to take a deep interest in the success of their undertaking  this interest was further increased by the graphic account that honest john buzzby gave of the death of poor mrs ellice and the enthusiastic way in which he spoke of his old captain  fred too had by his frank affable manner and somewhat reckless disposition rendered himself a general favourite with the men and had particularly recommended himself to mivins the steward who was possessed of an intensely romantic spirit by stating once or twice very emphatically that he fred meant to land on the coast of baffins bay should the captain fail to find his father and continue the search on foot and alone  there was no doubt whatever that poor fred was in earnest and had made up his mind to die in the search rather than not find him  he little knew the terrible nature of the country in which for a time his lot was to be cast and the hopelessness of such an undertaking as he meditated  with boyish inconsiderateness he thought not of how his object was to be accomplished he cared not what impossibilities lay in the way but with manly determination he made up his mind to quit the ship and search for his father through the length and breadth of the land  let not the reader smile at what he may perhaps style a childish piece of enthusiasm  many a youth at his age has dreamed of attempting as great if not greater impossibilities  all honour we say to the boy who dreams impossibilities and greater honour to him who like fred resolves to attempt them  james watt stared at an iron tea kettle till his eyes were dim and meditated the monstrous impossibility of making that kettle work like a horse and men might perhaps did smile at james watt then but do men smile at james watt nownow that thousands of iron kettles are dashing like dreadful comets over the length and breadth of the land not to mention the sea with long tails of men and women and children behind them  thats ow it is sir mivins used to say when spoken to by fred on the subject ive never bin in cold countries myself sir but ive bin in ot and i knows that with a stout pair o legs and a will to work a man can work is way hanywhere  of course theres not much of a poplation in them parts ive heerd but theres heskimos and where one man can live so can another and what one man can do so can anotherthats bin my hexperience and im not ashamed to hown it im not though i do say it as shouldnt and i honour you sir for your filleral detarmination to find your father sir and  steward shouted the captain down the cabin skylight  yes sir  bring me the chart  yes sir and mivins disappeared like a jackinthebox from the cabin just as tom singleton entered it  here we are fred he said seizing a telescope that hung over the cabin door within sight of the danish settlement of uppernavik come on deck and see it  fred needed no second bidding  it was here that the captain had hinted there would probably be some information obtained regarding the pole star and it was with feelings of no common interest the two friends examined the lowroofed houses of this outoftheway settlement  in an hour afterwards the captain and first mate with our young friends landed amid the clamorous greetings of the entire population and proceeded to the residence of the governor who received them with great kindness and hospitality but the only information they could obtain was that a year ago captain ellice had been driven there in his brig by stress of weather and after refitting and taking in a supply of provisions had set sail for england  here the dolphin laid in a supply of dried fish and procured several dogs besides an esquimaux interpreter and hunter named meetuck  leaving this little settlement they stood out once more to sea and threaded their way among the ice with which they were now well acquainted in all its forms from the mighty berg or mountain of ice to the wide field  they passed in succession one or two esquimaux settlements the last of which votlik is the most northerly point of colonisation  beyond this all was terra incognita  here enquiry was again made through the medium of the esquimaux interpreter who had been taken on board at uppernavik and they learned that the brig in question had been last seen beset in the pack and driving to the northward  whether or not she had ever returned they could not tell  a consultation was now held and it was resolved to proceed north as far as the ice would permit towards smiths sound and examine the coast carefully in that direction  for several weeks past there had been gradually coming over the aspect of nature a change to which we have not yet referred and which filled fred ellice and his friend the young surgeon with surprise and admiration this was the longcontinued daylight which now lasted the whole night round and increased in intensity every day as they advanced north  they had indeed often heard and read of it before but their minds had utterly failed to form a correct conception of the exquisite calmness and beauty of the midnightday of the north  everyone knows that in consequence of the axis of the earth not being perpendicular to the plane of its orbit round the sun the poles are alternately directed more or less towards that great luminary during one part of the year and away from it during another part  so that far north the days during the one season grow longer and longer until at last there is one long day of many weeks duration in which the sun does not set at all and during the other season there is one long night in which the sun is never seen  it was approaching the height of the summer season when the dolphin entered the arctic regions and although the sun descended below the horizon for a short time each night there was scarcely any diminution of the light at all and as far as ones sensations were concerned there was but one long continuous day which grew brighter and brighter at midnight as they advanced  how thoroughly splendid this is remarked tom singleton to fred one night as they sat in their favourite outlook the maintop gazing down on the glassy sea which was covered with snowy icebergs and floes and bathed in the rays of the sun and how wonderful to think that the sun will only set for an hour or so and then get up as splendid as ever  the evening was still as death  not a sound broke upon the ear save the gentle cries of a few seabirds that dipped ever and anon into the sea as if to kiss it gently while asleep and then circled slowly into the bright sky again  the sails of the ship too flapped very gently and a spar creaked plaintively as the vessel rose and fell on the gentle undulations that seemed to be the breathing of the ocean but such sounds did not disturb the universal stillness of the hour neither did the gambols of yonder group of seals and walrus that were at play round some fantastic blocks of ice nor did the soft murmur of the swell that broke in surf at the foot of yonder iceberg whose blue sides were seamed with a thousand watercourses and whose jagged pinnacles rose up like needles of steel into the clear atmosphere  there were many bergs in sight of various shapes and sizes at some distance from the ship which caused much anxiety to the captain although they were only a source of admiration to our young friends in the maintop  tom said fred breaking a long silence it may seem a strange idea to you but do you know i cannot help fancying that heaven must be something like this  im not sure that thats such a strange idea fred for it has two of the characteristics of heaven in itpeace and rest  true that didnt strike me  do you know i wish that it were always calm like this and that we had no wind at all  tom smiled  your voyage would be a long one if that were to happen  i dare say the esquimaux would join with you in the wish however for their kayaks and oomiaks are better adapted for a calm than a stormy sea  tom said fred breaking another long silence youre very tiresome and stupid tonight why dont you talk to me  because this delightful dreamy evening inclines me to think and be silent  ah tom thats your chief fault  you are always inclined to think too much and to talk too little  now i on the contrary am always  inclined to talk too much and think too little eh fred  bah dont try to be funny man you havent it in you  did you ever see such a miserable set of creatures as the old esquimaux women are at uppernavik  why what put them into your head enquired tom laughing  yonder iceberg look at it  theres the nose and chin exactly of the extraordinary hag you gave your silk pockethandkerchief to at parting now i never saw such a miserable old woman as that before did you  tom singletons whole demeanour changed and his dark eyes brightened as the strongly marked brows frowned over them while he replied yes fred i have seen old women more miserable than that  i have seen women so old that their tottering limbs could scarcely support them going about in the bitterest november winds with clothing too scant to cover their wrinkled bodies and so ragged and filthy that you would have shrunk from touching iti have seen such groping about among heaps of filth that the very dogs looked at and turned away as if in disgust  fred was inclined to laugh at his friends sudden change of manner but there was something in the young surgeons characterperhaps its deep earnestnessthat rendered it impossible at least for his friends to be jocular when he was disposed to be serious  fred became grave as he spoke  where have you seen such poor wretches tom he asked with a look of interest  in the cities the civilised cities of our own christian land  if you have ever walked about the streets of some of these cities before the rest of the world was astir at grey dawn you must have seen them shivering along and scratching among the refuse cast out by the tenants of the neighbouring houses  oh fred fred in my professional career short though it has been i have seen much of these poor old women and many others whom the world never sees on the streets at all experiencing a slow lingering death by starvation and fatigue and cold  it is the foulest blot on our country that there is no sufficient provision for the aged poor  i have seen those old women too replied fred but i never thought very seriously about them before  thats itthats just it people dont think otherwise this dreadful state of things would not continue  just listen now for a moment to what i have to say  but dont imagine that im standing up for the poor in general  i dont feelperhaps im wrong continued tom thoughtfullyperhaps im wrongi hope notbut its a fact i dont feel much for the young and the sturdy poor and i make it a rule never to give a farthing to young beggars not even to little children for i know full well that they are sent out to beg by idle goodfornothing parents  i stand up only for the aged poor because be they good or wicked they cannot help themselves  if a man fell down in the street struck with some dire disease that shrunk his muscles unstrung his nerves made his heart tremble and his skin shrivel up would you look upon him and then pass him by without thinking  no cried fred in an emphatic tone i would not  i would stop and help him  then let me ask you resumed tom earnestly is there any difference between the weakness of muscle and the faintness of heart which is produced by disease and that which is produced by old age except that the latter is incurable  have not these women feelings like other women  think you that there are not amongst them those who have known better times  they think of sons and daughters dead and gone perhaps just as other old women in better circumstances do but they must not indulge such depressing thoughts they must reserve all the energy the stamina they have to drag round the citybarefoot it may be and in the coldto beg for food and scratch up what they can find among the cinderheaps  they groan over past comforts and past times perhaps and think of the days when their limbs were strong and their cheeks were smoothfor they were not always hagsand remember that once they had friends who loved them and cared for them although they are old unknown and desolate now  tom paused and pressed his hand upon his flushed forehead  you may think it strange he continued that i speak to you in this way about poor old women but i feel deeply for their forlorn condition  the young can help themselves more or less and they have strength to stand their sorrows with hope blessed hope to keep them up but poor old men and old women cannot help themselves and cannot stand their sorrows and as far as this life is concerned they have no hope except to die soon and easy and if possible in summertime when the wind is not so very cold and bitter  but how can this be put right tom asked fred in a tone of deep commiseration  our being sorry for it and anxious about it and youve made me sorry i assure you can do very little good you know  i dont know fred replied tom sinking into his usual quiet tone if every city and town in great britain would start a society whose first resolution should be that they would not leave one poor old man or woman unprovided for that would do it  or if the government would take it in hand honestly that would do it  call all hands mr bolton cried the captain in a sharp voice  get out the icepoles and lower away the boats  hallo whats wrong said fred starting up  getting too near the bergs i suspect remarked tom  i say fred before we go on deck will you promise to do what i ask you  wellyes i will  will you promise then all through your life especially if you ever come to be rich or influential to think of and for old men and women who are poor  i will answered fred but i dont know that ill ever be rich or influential or able to help them much  of course you dont  but when a thought about them strikes you will you always think it out and if possible act it out as god shall enable you  yes tom i promise to do that as well as i can  thats right thank you my boy said the young surgeon as they descended the shrouds and leaped on deck  here they found the captain walking up and down rapidly with an anxious expression of face  after taking a turn or two he stopped short and gazed out astern  set the stunsails mr bolton  the breeze will be up in a little i think  let the men pull with a will  the order was given and soon the ship was under a cloud of canvas advancing slowly as the boats towed her between two large icebergs which had been gradually drawing near to each other the whole afternoon  is there any danger buzzby enquired fred as the sturdy sailor stood looking at the larger berg with an icepole in his hands  danger ay that there is lad more nors agreeable dye see  here we are without a breath o wind to get us on right between two bergs as could crack us like a walnut  we cant get to starboard of em for the current nor to larboard of em for the pack as ye see so we must go between them neck or nothing  the danger was indeed imminent  the two bergs were within a hundred yards of each other and the smaller of the two being more easily moved by the current probably was setting down on the larger at a rate that bade fair to decide the fate of the dolphin in a few minutes  the men rowed lustily but their utmost exertions could move the ship but slowly  aid was coming however direct from the hand of him who is a refuge in the time of danger  a breeze was creeping over the calm sea right astern and it was to meet this that the studding sails had been set alow and aloft so that the widespreading canvas projecting far to the right and left had to an inexperienced eye the appearance of being out of all proportion to the little hull by which it was supported  with breathless anxiety those on board stood watching the two bergs and the approaching breeze  at last it came  a few catspaws ruffled the surface of the sea distending the sails for a moment then leaving them flat and loose as before  this however was sufficient another such puff and the ship was almost out of danger but before it came the projecting summit of the smaller berg was overhanging the deck  at this critical moment the wind began to blow steadily and soon the dolphin was in the open water beyond  five minutes after she had passed the moving mountains struck with a noise louder than thunder the summits and large portions of the sides fell with a succession of crashes like the roaring of artillery just above the spot where the ship had lain not quarter of an hour before and the vessel for some time after rocked violently to and fro in the surges that the plunge of the falling masses raised    chapter six  the galeanchored to a berg which proves to be a treacherous one dangers of the packbeset in the icemivins shows an enquiring mindwalrusgale freshenschains and cablesholding on for lifean unexpected discoverya nip and its terrible consequencesyoked to an iceberg  the narrow escape related in the last chapter was but the prelude to a night of troubles  fortunately as we have before mentioned night did not now add darkness to their difficulties  soon after passing the bergs a stiff breeze sprang up off shore between which and the dolphin there was a thick belt of loose ice or sludge while outside the pack was in motion and presented a terrible scene of crashing and grinding masses under the influence of the breeze which soon freshened to a gale  keep her away two points said captain guy to the man at the wheel well make fast to yonder berg mr bolton if this gale carries us into the pack we shall be swept far out of our course if indeed we escape being nipped and sent to the bottom  being nipped is one of the numberless dangers to which arctic navigators are exposed  should a vessel get between two moving fields or floes of ice there is a chance especially in stormy weather of the ice being forced together and squeezing in the sides of the ship this is called nipping  ah remarked buzzby as he stood with folded arms by the capstan many and many a good ship has been sent to the bottom by that same ive seed a brig with my own two eyes squeezed together amost flat by two big floes of ice and after doin it they jist separated agin an let her go plump down to the bottom  before she was nipped the crew saved themselves by jumpin on to the ice and they wos picked up by our ship that wos in company  theres no dependin on the ice by no means remarked amos parr for ive seed the selfsame sort of thing that ye mention happen to a small schooner in davis straits only instead o crushin it flat the ice lifted it right high and dry out o the water and then let it down again without more ado as sound as iver  get out the warps and iceanchors there cried the captain  in a moment the men were in the boats and busy heaving and planting iceanchors but it was not until several hours had been spent in this tedious process that they succeeded in making fast to the berg  they had barely accomplished this when the berg gave indications of breaking up so they cast off again in great haste and not long afterwards a mass of ice many tons in weight fell from the edge of the berg close to where they had been moored  the captain now beat up for the land in the hope of finding anchoringground  at first the ice presented an impenetrable barrier but at length a lead of open water was found through which they passed to within a few hundred yards of the shore which at this spot showed a front of high precipitous cliffs  stand by to let go the anchor shouted the captain  ay ay sir  down your helm  let go  down went the anchor to the music of the rattling chaincable a sound which had not been heard since the good ship left the shores of old england  if we were only a few yards farther in sir remarked the first mate we should be better  im afraid of the stream of ice coming round yonder point  so am i replied the captain but we can scarcely manage it i fear on account of the shore ice  get out a boat mr saunders and try to fix an anchor  we may warp in a few yards  the anchor was fixed and the men strained at the capstan with a will but notwithstanding their utmost efforts they could not penetrate the shore ice  meanwhile the wind increased and snow began to fall in large flakes  the tide too as it receded brought a stream of ice round the point ahead of them which bore right down on their bows  at first the concussions were slight and the bow of the ship turned the floes aside but heavier masses soon came down and at last one fixed itself on the cable and caused the anchor to drag with a harsh grating sound  fred ellice who stood beside the second mate near the companion hatch looked enquiringly at him  ah thats bad said saunders shaking his head slowly i dinna like that sound  if were carried out into the pack there dear knows where well turn up in the long run  perhaps well turn bottom up sir suggested the fat cook as he passed at the moment with a tray of meat  mizzle could not resist a jokeno matter how unsuitable the time or dreadful the consequences  hold your tongue sir exclaimed saunders indignantly  attend to your business and speak only when youre spoken to  with some difficulty the mass of ice that had got foul of the cable was disengaged but in a few moments another and a larger mass fixed upon it and threatened to carry it away  in this extremity the captain ordered the anchor to be hove up but this was not easily accomplished and when at last it was hove up to the bow both flukes were found to have been broken off and the shank was polished bright with rubbing on the rocks  ice now came rolling down in great quantities and with irresistible force and at last the ship was whirled into the muchdreaded pack where she became firmly embedded and drifted along with it before the gale into the unknown regions of the north all that night  to add to their distress and danger a thick fog overspread the sea so that they could not tell whither the ice was carrying them and to warp out of it was impossible  there was nothing for it therefore but to drive before the gale and take advantage of the first opening in the ice that should afford them a chance of escape  towards evening of the following day the gale abated and the sun shone out bright and clear but the pack remained close as ever drifting steadily towards the north  were far beyond the most northerly sea that has ever yet been reached remarked captain guy to fred and singleton as he leaned on the weather bulwarks and gazed wistfully over the fields of ice in which they were embedded  i beg your pardon for differing captain guy but i think that captain parry was farther north than this when he attempted to reach the pole remarked saunders with the air of a man who was prepared to defend his position to the last  very possibly mr saunders but i think we are at least farther north in this direction than anyone has yet been at least i make it out so by the chart  im no sure o that rejoined the second mate positively charts are not always to be depended on and ive heard that whalers have been up hereabouts before now  perhaps you are right mr saunders replied the captain smiling nevertheless i shall take observations and name the various headlands until i find that others have been here before me  mivins hand me the glass it seems to me theres a watersky to the northward  what is a watersky captain enquired fred  it is a peculiar dark appearance of the sky on the horizon which indicates open waterjust the reverse of that bright appearance which you have often seen in the distance and which we call the iceblink  well have open water soon remarked the second mate authoritatively  mr saunders said mivins who having just finished clearing away and washing up the debris and dishes of one meal was enjoying in complete idleness the ten minutes of leisure that intervened between that and preparations for the nextmr saunders sir can you hinform me sir ow it is that the sea dont freeze at ome the same as it does hout ere  the countenance of the second mate brightened for he prided himself not a little on his vast and varied stores of knowledge and nothing pleased him so much as to be questioned particularly on knotty subjects  hem yes mivins i can tell ee that  ye must know that before fresh water can freeze on the surface the whole volume of it must be cooled down to 40 degrees and salt water must be cooled down to 45 degrees noo frost requires to be very long continued and very sharp indeed before it can cool the deep sea from the top to the bottom and until it is so cooled it canna freeze  oh remarked mivins who only half understood the meaning of the explanation ow very hodd  but can you tell me mr saunders ow it is that them ere hicebergs is made  thems wot i dont comprehend no ow  ay replied saunders there has been many a wiser head than yours puzzled for a long time aboot icebergs  but if yell use yer eyes youll see how they are formed  do you see the high cliffs yonder away to the noreast  well there are great masses o ice that have been formed against them by the melting and freezing of the snows of many years  when these become too heavy to stick to the cliffs they tumble into the sea and float away as icebergs  but the biggest bergs come from the foot of glaciers  we know what glaciers are mivins  no sir i dont  the second mate sighed  they are immense accumulations of ice mivins that have been formed by the freezings and meltings of the snows of hundreds of years  they cover the mountains of norway and switzerland and many other places in this world for miles and miles in extent and sometimes they flow down and fill up whole valleys  i once saw one in norway that filled up a valley eight miles long two miles broad and seven or eight hundred feet deep and that was only a wee bit of it for i was told by men who had travelled over it that it covered the mountains of the interior and made them a level field of ice with a surface like rough hard snow for more than twenty miles in extent  you dont say so sir said mivins in surprise  and dont they never melt  no never  what they lose in summer they more than gain in winter moreover they are always in motion but they move so slow that you may look at them ever so closely and so long youll not be able to observe the motionjust like the hour hand of a watchbut we know it by observing the changes from year to year  there are immense glaciers here in the arctic regions and the lumps which they are constantly shedding off into the sea are the icebergs that one sees and hears so much about  mivins seemed deeply impressed with this explanation and would probably have continued the conversation much longer had he not been interrupted by the voice of his mischievous satellite davie summers who touched his forelock and said please mr mivins shall i lay the tablecloth or would it be better to slump dinner with tea this afternoon  mivins started  ha caught me napping  down below you young dog  the boy dived instantly followed first by a dishclout rolled tightly up and well aimed and afterwards by his activelimbed superior  both reached the region of smells cruets and crockery at the same moment and each set energetically to work at their neverending duties  soon after this the ice suddenly loosened and the crew succeeded after a few hours hard labour in warping the dolphin once more out of the pack but scarcely had this been accomplished when another storm which had been gradually gathering burst upon them and compelled them once more to seek the shelter of the land  numerous walrus rolled about in the bays here and they approached much nearer to the vessel than they had yet done affording those on board a good view of their huge uncouth visages as they shook their shaggy fronts and ploughed up the waves with their tusks  these enormous creatures are the elephants of the arctic ocean  their aspect is particularly grim and fierce and being nearly equal to elephants in bulk they are not less terrible than they appear  in form they somewhat resemble seals having barrelshaped bodies with round or rather square blunt heads and shaggy bristling moustache and two long ivory tusks which curve downwards instead of upwards serving the purpose frequently of hooks by means of which and their foreflippers they can pull themselves up on the rocks and icebergs  indeed they are sometimes found at a considerable height up the sides of steep cliffs basking in the sun  fred was anxious to procure the skull of one of these monstrous animals but the threatening appearance of the weather rendered any attempt to secure one at that time impossible  a dark sinister scowl overhung the blink under the cloudbank to the southward and the dovkies which had enlivened their progress hitherto forsook the channel as if they distrusted the weather  captain guy made every possible preparation to meet the coming storm by warping down under the shelter of a ledge of rock to which he made fast with two good hawsers while everything was made snug on board  we are going to catch it i fear said fred glancing at the black clouds that hurried across the sky to the northward while he walked the deck with his friend tom singleton  i suspect so replied tom and it does not raise my spirits to see saunders shaking his huge visage so portentously  do you know i have a great belief in that fellow  he seems to know everything and to have gone through every sort of experience and i notice that most of his prognostications come to pass  so they do tom said fred but i wish he would put a better face on things till they do come to pass  his looks are enough to frighten one  i think we shall require another line out mr saunders remarked the captain as the gale freshened and the two hawsers were drawn straight and rigid like bars of iron send ashore and make a whaleline fast immediately  the second mate obeyed with a grunt that seemed to insinuate that he would have had one out long ago  in a few minutes it was fast and not a moment too soon for immediately after it blew a perfect hurricane heavier and heavier it came and the ice began to drift more wildly than ever  the captain had just given orders to make fast another line when the sharp twanging snap of a cord was heard  the sixinch hawser had parted and they were swinging by the two others with the gale roaring like a lion through the spars and rigging  half a minute more and twang twang came another report and the whaleline was gone  only one rope now held them to the land and prevented them being swept into the turmoil of ice and wind and water from which the rocky ledge protected them  the hawser was a good onea new teninch rope  it sung like the deep tones of an organ loud above the rattle of the rigging and the shrouds but that was its deathsong  it gave way with the noise of a cannon and in the smoke that followed its recoil they were dragged out by the wild ice and driven hither and hither at its mercy  with some difficulty the ship was warped into a place of comparative security in the rushing drift but it was soon thrown loose again and severely squeezed by the rolling masses  then an attempt was made to set the sails and beat up for the land but the rudder was almost unmanageable owing to the ice and nothing could be made of it so they were compelled to go right before the wind under closereefed topsails in order to keep some command of the ship  all hands were on deck watching in silence the ice ahead of them which presented a most formidable aspect  away to the north the strait could be seen growing narrower with heavy icetables grinding up and clogging it from cliff to cliff on either side  about seven in the evening they were close upon the piling masses to enter into which seemed certain destruction  stand by to let go the anchor cried the captain in the desperate hope of being able to wind the ship  whats that ahead of us exclaimed the first mate suddenly  ship on the starboard bow right inshore roared the lookout  the attention of the crew was for a moment called from their own critical situation towards the strange vessel which now came into view having been previously concealed from them by a large grounded berg  can you make her out mr bolton  yes sir i think shes a large brig but she seems much chafed and theres no name left on the stern if ever there was one  as he spoke the driving snow and fog cleared up partially and the brig was seen not three hundred yards from them drifting slowly into the loose ice  there was evidently no one on board and although one or two of the sails were loose they hung in shreds from the yards  scarcely had this been noted when the dolphin struck against a large mass of ice and quivered under the violence of the shock  let go shouted the captain  down went the heaviest anchor they had and for two minutes the chain flew out at the hawsehole  hold on  the chain was checked but the strain was awful  a mass of ice hundreds of tons weight was tearing down towards the bow  there was no hope of resisting it  time was not even afforded to attach a buoy or log to the cable so it was let slip and thus the dolphins best bower was lost for ever  but there was no time to think of or regret this for the ship was now driving down with the gale scraping against a lee of ice which was seldom less than thirty feet thick  almost at the same moment the strange vessel was whirled close to them not more than fifty yards distant between two driving masses of thick ice  what if it should be my fathers brig whispered fred ellice as he grasped singletons arm and turned to him a face of ashy paleness  no fear of that lad said buzzby who stood near the larboard gangway and had overheard the remark  id know your fathers brig among a thousand  as he spoke the two masses of ice closed and the brig was nipped between them  for a few seconds she seemed to tremble like a living creature and every timber creaked  then she was turned slowly on one side until the crew of the dolphin could see down into her hold where the beams were giving way and cracking up as matches might be crushed in the grasp of a strong hand  then the larboard bow was observed to yield as if it were made of soft clay the starboard bow was pressed out and the ice was forced into the forecastle  scarcely three minutes had passed since the nip commenced in one minute more the brig went down and the ice was rolling wildly as if in triumph over the spot where she had disappeared  the fate of this vessel which might so soon be their own threw a momentary gloom over the crew of the dolphin but their position left them no time for thought  one upturned mass rose above the gunwale smashed in the bulwarks and deposited half a ton of ice on deck scarcely had this danger passed when a new enemy appeared in sight ahead  directly in their way just beyond the line of floeice against which they were alternately thumping and grinding lay a group of bergs there was no possibility of avoiding them and the only question was whether they were to be dashed to pieces on their hard blue sides or perchance in some providential nook to find a refuge from the storm  theres an open lead between them and the floeice exclaimed bolton in a hopeful tone of voice seizing an icepole and leaping on the gunwale  look alive men with your poles cried the captain and shove with a will  the ay ay sir of the men was uttered with a heartiness that showed how powerfully this gleam of hope acted on their spirits but a new damp was cast over them when on gaining the open passage they discovered that the bergs were not at rest but were bearing down on the floeice with slow but awful momentum and threatened to crush the ship between the two  just then a low berg came driving up from the southward dashing the spray over its sides and with its forehead ploughing up the smaller ice as if in scorn  a happy thought flashed across the captains mind  down the quarter boat he cried  in an instant it struck the water and four men were on the thwarts  cast an iceanchor on that berg  peter grim obeyed the order and with a swing that hercules would have envied planted it securely  in another moment the ship was following in the wake of this novel tug  it was a moment of great danger for the bergs encroached on their narrow canal as they advanced obliging them to brace the yards to clear the impending icewalls and they shaved the large berg so closely that the portquarter boat would have been crushed if it had not been taken from the davits  five minutes of such travelling brought them abreast of a grounded berg to which they resolved to make fast the order was given to cast off the rope away went their white tug on his race to the far north and the ship swung round in safety under the lee of the berg where the crew acknowledged with gratitude their merciful deliverance from imminent danger    chapter seven  new characters introducedan old game under novel circumstances remarkable appearances in the skyoriley meets with a mishap  dumps was a remarkably grave and sly character and poker was a wagan incorrigible wagin every sense of the term  moreover although they had an occasional fight dumps and poker were excellent friends and great favourites with the crew  we have not yet introduced these individuals to our reader but as they will act a conspicuous part in the history of the dolphins adventurous career in the arctic regions we think it right now to present them  while at uppernavik captain guy had purchased a team of six good tough esquimaux dogs being desirous of taking them to england and there presenting them to several of his friends who were anxious to possess specimens of those animals  two of these dogs stood out conspicuous from their fellows not only in regard to personal appearance but also in reference to peculiarities of character  one was pure white with a lively expression of countenance a large shaggy body two erect sharppointed ears and a short projection that once had been a tail owing to some cause unknown however his tail had been cut or bitten off and nothing save the stump remained  but this stump did as much duty as if it had been fifty tails in one  it was never at rest for a moment and its owner evidently believed that wagging it was the true and only way to touch the heart of man therefore the dog wagged it so to speak doggedly  in consequence of this animals thieving propensities which led him to be constantly poking into every hole and corner of the ship in search of something to steal he was named poker  poker had three jetblack spots in his white visageone was the point of his nose the other two were his eyes  pokers bosom friend dumps was so named because he had the sulkiest expression of countenance that ever fell to the lot of a dog hopelessly incurable melancholy seemed to have taken possession of his mind for he never by any chance smiledand dogs do smile you know just as evidently as human beings do although not exactly with their mouths  dumps never romped either being old but he sat and allowed his friend poker to romp round him with a sort of sulky satisfaction as if he experienced the greatest enjoyment his nature was capable of in witnessing the antics of his youthful companionfor poker was young the prevailing colour of dumpss shaggy hide was a dirty brown with black spots two of which had fixed themselves rather awkwardly round his eyes like a pair of spectacles  dumps also was a thief and indeed so were all his brethren  dumps and poker were both of them larger and stronger and in every way better than their comrades and they afterwards were the sturdy steady unflinching leaders of the team during many a toilsome journey over the frozen sea  one magnificent afternoon a few days after the escape of the dolphin just related dumps and poker lay side by side in the leescuppers calmly sleeping off the effects of a surfeit produced by the eating of a large piece of pork for which the cook had searched in vain for threequarters of an hour and of which he at last found the bare bone sticking in the hole of the larboard pump  bad luck to them dogs exclaimed david mizzle stroking his chin as he surveyed the bone  if i could only find out now which of ye it was id have ye slaughtered right off and cooked for the mess i would  it was dumps as did it ill bet you a months pay said peter grim as he sat on the end of the windlass refilling his pipe which he had just smoked out  not a bit of it remarked amos parr who was squatted on the deck busily engaged in constructing a rope mat while several of the men sat round him engaged in mending sails or stitching canvas slippers etcetera  not a bit of it grim dumps is too honest by half to do sich a thing  twas poker as did it i can see by the roll of his eye below the skin  the blackguards only shammin sleep  on hearing his name mentioned poker gently opened his right eye but did not move  dumps on the contrary lay as if he heard not the base aspersion on his character  whatll ye bet it was dumps as did it cried davie summers who passed at the moment with a dish of some sort of edible towards the galley or cookinghouse on deck  ill bet you over the ead i will if you dont mind your business said mivins  youd better not retorted davie with a grin  its as much as your situations worth to lay a finger on me  thats it youngster give it im cried several of the men while the boy confronted his superior taking good care however to keep the foremast between them  what do you mean you young rascal cried mivins with a frown  mean said davie why i mean that if you touch me ill resign office and if i do that youll have to go out for everyone knows you cant get on without me  i say mivins cried tom green the carpenters mate if you were asked to say hold on hard to this handspike here my hearties how would ye go about it  hed it you a pretty ard crack hover the ead with it e would remarked one of the men throwing a ball of yarn at davie who stood listening to the conversation with a broad grin  in stepping back to avoid the blow the lad trod on dumpss paw and instantly there came from the throat of that excellent dog a roar of anguish that caused poker to leap as the cook expressed it nearly out of his own skin  dogs are by nature extremely sympathetic and remarkably inquisitive and no sooner was dumpss yell heard than it was vigorously responded to by every dog in the ship as the whole pack rushed each from his respective sleepingplace and looked round in amazement  hallo whats wrong there forard enquired saunders who had been pacing the quarterdeck with slow giant strides arguing mentally with himself in default of a better adversary  only trod on dumpss paw sir said mivins as he hurried aft the men are skylarking  skylarking are you said saunders going forward weel lads youve had a lot o hard work of late ye may go and take a run on the ice  instantly the men like boys set free from school sprang up tumbled over the side and were scampering over the ice like madmen  pitch over the ballthe football they cried  in a second the ball was tossed over the ships side and a vigorous game was begun  for two days past the dolphin had been sailing with difficulty through large fields of ice sometimes driving against narrow necks and tongues that interrupted her passage from one lead or canal to another at other times boring with difficulty through compact masses of sludge or occasionally when unable to advance farther making fast to a large berg or field  they were compelled to proceed north however in consequence of the pack having become fixed towards the south and thus rendering retreat impossible in that direction until the ice should be again set in motion  captain guy however saw by the steady advance of the larger bergs that the current of the ocean in that place flowed southward and trusted that in a short time the ice which had been forced into the strait by the gales would be released and open up a passage  meanwhile he pushed along the coast examining every bay and inlet in the hope of discovering some trace of the pole star or her crew  on the day about which we are writing the ship was beset by large fields the snowwhite surfaces of which extended north and south to the horizon while on the east the cliffs rose in dark frowning precipices from the midst of the glaciers that encumber them all the year round  it was a lovely arctic day  the sun shone with unclouded splendour and the bright air which trembled with that liquidity of appearance that one occasionally sees in very hot weather under peculiar circumstances was vocal with the wild music of thousands of gulls and auks and other seabirds which clustered on the neighbouring cliffs and flew overhead in clouds  all round the pure surfaces of the icefields were broken by the shadows which the hummocks and bergs cast over them and by the pools of clear water which shone like crystals in their hollows while the beautiful beryl blue of the larger bergs gave a delicate colouring to the dazzling scene  words cannot describe the intense glitter that characterised everything  every point seemed a diamond every edge sent forth a gleam of light and many of the masses reflected the rich prismatic colours of the rainbow  it seemed as if the sun himself had been multiplied in order to add to the excessive brilliancy for he was surrounded by parhelia or sundogs as the men called them  this peculiarity in the suns appearance was very striking  the great orb of day was about ten degrees above the horizon and a horizontal line of white passed completely through it extending to a considerable distance on either hand while around it were two distinct halos or circles of light  on the inner halo were situated the mocksuns which were four in numberone above and one below the sun and one on each side of him  not a breath of wind stirred the little flag that drooped from the mizzenpeak and the clamorous ceaseless cries of seabirds added to the merry shouts and laughter of the men as they followed the restless football rendered the whole a scene of life as it was emphatically one of beauty  aint it glorious panted davie summers vehemently as he stopped exhausted in a headlong race beside one of his comrades while the ball was kicked hopelessly beyond his reach by a comparatively fresh member of the party  ah then it bates the owld country intirely it does replied oriley wiping the perspiration from his forehead  it is needless to say that oriley was an irishman  we have not mentioned him until now because up to this time he had not done anything to distinguish himself beyond his messmates but on this particular day orileys star was in the ascendant and fortune seemed to have singled him out as an object of her special attention  he was a short man and a broad man and a particularly rugged manso to speak  he was all angles and corners  his hair stuck about his head in violently rigid and entangled tufts rendering it a matter of wonder how anything in the shape of a hat could stick on  his brow was a countless mass of evervarying wrinkles which gave to his sly visage an aspect of humorous anxiety that was highly divertingand all the more diverting when you came to know that the man had not a spark of anxiety in his composition though he often said he had  his dress like that of most jacktars was naturally rugged and he contrived to make it more so than usual  an its hot too it is he continued applying his kerchief again to his pate  if it warnt for the ice we stand on wed be melted down i do belave like bits o whale blubber  wot a jolly game football is aint it said davie seating himself on a hummock and still panting hard  ay boy thats jist what it is  the only objiction i have agin it is that it makes ye amost kick the left leg clane off yer body  why dont you kick with your right leg then stupid like other people enquired summers  why dont i is it  troth then i dont know for sartin  me father lost his left leg at the great battle o the nile and ive sometimes thought that had somethin to do wid it but then me mother was lame o the right leg intirely and wint about wid a crutch so i cant make out how it was dye see  look out pat exclaimed summers starting up here comes the ball  as he spoke the football came skimming over the ice towards the spot on which they stood with about thirty of the men running at full speed and shouting like maniacs after it  thats your sort my hearties another like that and its home  pitch into it mivins  youre the boy for me  now then grim trip him up hallo buzzby you bluffbowed dutchman luff luff or ill stave in your ribs  mind your eye mizzle theres green hell be into your larboard quarter in no time  hurrah  mivins up in the air with it kick boy kick like a spanker boom in a hurricane  such were a few of the expressions that showered like hail round the men as they rushed hither and thither after the ball  and here we may remark that the crew of the dolphin played football in a somewhat different style from the way in which that noble game is played by boys in england  sides indeed were chosen and boundaries were marked out but very little if any attention was paid to such secondary matters  to kick the ball and keep on kicking it in front of his companions was the ambition of each man and so long as he could get a kick at it that caused it to fly from the ground like a cannonshot little regard was had by anyone to the direction in which it was propelled  but of course in this effort to get a kick the men soon became scattered over the field and ever and anon the ball would fall between two men who rushed at it simultaneously from opposite directions  the inevitable result was a collision by which both men were suddenly and violently arrested in their career  but generally the shock resulted in one of the men being sent staggering backwards and the other getting the kick  when the two were pretty equally matched both were usually as they expressed it brought up all standing in which case a short scuffle ensued as each endeavoured to trip up the heels of his adversary  to prevent undue violence in such struggles a rule was laid down that hands were not to be used on any account  they might use their feet legs shoulders and elbows but not their hands  in such rough play the men were more equally matched than might have been expected for the want of weight among the smaller men was often more than counterbalanced by their activity and frequently a sturdy little fellow launched himself so vigorously against a heavy tar as to send him rolling head over heels on the ice  this was not always the case however and few ventured to come into collision with peter grim whose activity was on a par with his immense size  buzzby contented himself with galloping on the outskirts of the fight and putting in a kick when fortune sent the ball in his way  in this species of warfare he was supported by the fat cook whose oily carcass could neither stand the shocks nor keep up with the pace of his messmates  mizzle was a particularly energetic man in his way however and frequently kicked with such goodwill that he missed the ball altogether and the tremendous swing of his leg lifted him from the ice and laid him sprawling on his back  look out ahead shouted green the carpenters mate theres a sail bearing down on your larboard bow  mivins who had the ball before him at the moment saw his own satellite davie coming down towards him with vicious intentions  he quietly pushed the ball before him for a few yards then kicked it far over the boys head and followed it up like an antelope  mivins depended for success on his almost superhuman activity  his tall slight frame could not stand the shocks of his comrades but no one could equal or come near to him in speed and he was quite an adept at dodging a charge and allowing his opponent to rush far past the ball by the force of his own momentum  such a charge did peter grim make at him at this moment  starboard hard yelled davie summers as he observed his masters danger  starboard it is replied mivins and leaping aside to avoid the shock he allowed grim to pass  grim knew his man however and had held himself in hand so that in a moment he pulled up and was following close on his heels  its an ill wind that blows no good cried one of the crew towards whose foot the ball rolled as he quietly kicked it into the centre of the mass of men  grim and mivins turned back and for a time looked on at the general make that ensued  it seemed as though the ball must inevitably be crushed among them as they struggled and kicked hither and thither for five minutes in their vain efforts to get a kick and during those few exciting moments many tremendous kicks aimed at the ball took effect upon shins and many shouts of glee terminated in yells of anguish  it cant last much longer screamed the cook his face streaming with perspiration and beaming with glee as he danced round the outside of the circle  there it goes  as he spoke the ball flew out of the circle like a shell from a mortar  unfortunately it went directly over mizzles head  before he could wink he went down before them and the rushing mass of men passed over him like a mountain torrent over a blade of grass  meanwhile mivins ran ahead of the others and gave the ball a kick that nearly burst it and down it came exactly between oriley and grim who chanced to be far ahead of the others  grim dashed at it  och ye big villain muttered the irishman to himself as he put down his head and rushed against the carpenter like a batteringram  big though he was grim staggered back from the impetuous shock and oriley following up his advantage kicked the ball in a side direction away from everyone except buzzby who happened to have been steering rather wildly over the field of ice  buzzby on being brought thus unexpectedly within reach of the ball braced up his energies for a kick but seeing oriley coming down towards him like a runaway locomotive he pulled up saying quietly to himself ye may take it all yer own way lad im too old a bird to go for to make my carcass a buffer for a madcap like you to run agin  jack mivins however was troubled by no such qualms  he happened to be about the same distance from the ball as oriley and ran like a deer to reach it first  a pool of water lay in his path however and the necessity of going round it enabled the irishman to gain on him a little so that it became evident that both would come up at the same moment and a collision be inevitable  hold yer wind paddy shouted the men who paused for a moment to watch the result of the race  mind your timbers mivins  back your topsails oriley mind how he yaws  then there was a momentary silence of breathless expectation  the two men seemed about to meet with a shock that would annihilate both when mivins bounded to one side like an indiarubber ball  oriley shot past him like a rocket and the next instant went headforemost into the pool of water  this unexpected termination to the affair converted the intended huzzah of the men into a yell of mingled laughter and consternation as they hastened in a body to the spot but before they reached it orileys head and shoulders reappeared and when they came up he was standing on the margin of the pool blowing like a walrus  oh then but it is cowld he exclaimed wringing the water from his garments  och wheres the ball give me a kick or ill freeze so i will  as he spoke the drenched irishman seized the ball from mivins hands and gave it a kick that sent it high into the air  he was too wet and heavy to follow it up however so he ambled off towards the ship as vigorously as his clothes would allow him followed by the whole crew    chapter eight  fred and the doctor go on an excursion in which among other strange things they meet with red snow and a white bear and fred makes his first essay as a sportsman  but where were fred ellice and tom singleton all this time the reader will probably ask  long before the game at football was suggested they had obtained leave of absence from the captain and loaded with gamebags a botanical box and geological hammer and a musket were off along the coast on a semiscientific cruise  young singleton carried the botanical box and hammer being an enthusiastic geologist and botanist while fred carried the gamebag and musket  you see tom he said as they stumbled along over the loose ice towards the icebelt that lined the cliffsyou see im a great dab at ornithology especially when ive got a gun on my shoulder  when i havent a gun strange to say i dont feel half so enthusiastic about birds  thats a very peculiar style of regarding the science  dont you think it would be worth while communicating your views on the subject to one of the scientific bodies when we get home again  they might elect you a member fred  well perhaps i shall replied fred gravely but i say to be serious im really going to screw up my energies as much as possible and make coloured drawings of all the birds i can get hold of in the arctic regions  at least i would like to try  fred finished his remark with a sigh for just then the object for which he had gone out to those regions occurred to him and although the natural buoyancy and hopefulness of his feelings enabled him generally to throw off anxiety in regard to his fathers fate and join in the laugh and jest and game as heartily as anyone on board there were times when his heart failed him and he almost despaired of ever seeing his father again and these feelings of despondency had been more frequent since the day on which he witnessed the sudden and utter destruction of the strange brig  dont let your spirits down fred said tom whose hopeful and earnest disposition often reanimated his friends drooping spirits  it will only unfit you for doing any good service besides i think we have no cause yet to despair  we know that your father came up this inlet or strait or whatever it is and that he had a good stock of provisions with him according to the account we got at uppernavik and it is not more than a year since he was there  many and many a whaler and discovery ship has wintered more than a year in these regions  and then consider the immense amount of animal life all around us  they might have laid up provisions for many months long before winter set in  i know all that replied fred with a shake of his head but think of yon brig that we saw go down in about ten minutes  well so i do think of it  no doubt the brig was lost very suddenly but there was ample time had there been anyone on board to have leaped upon the ice and they might have got to land by jumping from one piece to another  such things have happened before frequently  to say truth at every point of land we turn i feel a sort of expectation amounting almost to certainty that we shall find your father and his party travelling southward on their way to the danish settlements  perhaps you are right  god grant that it may be so  as he spoke they reached the fixed ice which ran along the foot of the precipices for some distance like a road of hard white marble  many large rocks lay scattered over it some of them several tons in weight and one or two balanced in a very remarkable way on the edge of the cliffs  theres a curiouslooking gull i should like to shoot exclaimed fred pointing to a bird that hovered over his head and throwing forward the muzzle of his gun  fire away then said his friend stepping back a pace  fred being unaccustomed to the use of firearms took a wavering aim and fired  what a bother  ive missed it  try again remarked tom with a quiet smile as the whole cliff vomited forth an innumerable host of birds whose cries were perfectly deafening  its my opinion said fred with a comical grin that if i shut my eyes and point upwards i cant help hitting something but i particularly want yon fellow because hes beautifully marked  ah  i see him sitting on a rock yonder so here goes once more  fred now proceeded towards the coveted bird in the fashion that is known by the name of stalkingthat is creeping as close up to your game as possible so as to get a good shot and it said much for his patience and his future success the careful manner in which on this occasion he wound himself in and out among the rocks and blocks of ice on the shore in the hope of obtaining that seagull  at last he succeeded in getting to within about fifteen yards of it and then resting his musket on a lump of ice and taking an aim so long and steadily that his companion began to fancy he must have gone to sleep he fired and blew the gull to atoms  there was scarcely so much as a shred of it to be found  fred bore his disappointment and discomfiture manfully  he formed a resolution then and there to become a good shot and although he did not succeed exactly in becoming so that day he nevertheless managed to put several fine specimens of gulls and an auk into his bag  the last bird amused him much being a creature with a dumpy little body and a beak of preposterously large size and comical aspect  there were also a great number of eider ducks flying about but they failed to procure a specimen  singleton was equally successful in his scientific researches  he found several beautifully green mosses one species of which was studded with paleyellow flowers and in one place where a stream trickled down the steep sides of the cliffs he discovered a flowergrowth which was rich in variety of colouring  amid several kinds of tufted grasses were seen growing a small purple flower and the white star of the chickweed  the sight of all this richness of vegetation growing in a little spot close beside the snow and amid such cold arctic scenery would have delighted a much less enthusiastic spirit than that of our young surgeon  he went quite into raptures with it and stuffed his botanical box with mosses and rocks until it could hold no more and became a burden that cost him a few sighs before he got back to the ship  the rocks were found to consist chiefly of red sandstone  there was also a good deal of greenstone and gneiss and some of the spires of these that shot up to a considerable height were particularly striking and picturesque objects  but the great sight of the days excursion was that which unexpectedly greeted their eyes on rounding a cape towards which they had been walking for several hours  on passing this point they stopped with an exclamation of amazement  before them lay a scene such as the arctic regions alone can produce  in front lay a vast reach of the strait which at this place opened up abruptly and stretched away northward laden with floes and fields and hummocks and bergs of every shade and size to the horizon where the appearance of the sky indicated open water  ponds of various sizes and sheets of water whose dimensions entitled them to be styled lakes spangled the white surface of the floes and around these were sporting innumerable flocks of wild fowl many of which being pure white glanced like snowflakes in the sunshine  far off to the west the ice came down with heavy uniformity to the waters edge  on the right there was an array of cliffs whose frowning grandeur filled them with awe they varied from twelve to fifteen hundred feet in height and some of the precipices descended sheer down seven or eight hundred feet into the sea over which they cast a dark shadow  just at the feet of our young discoverers for such we may truly call them a deep bay or valley trended away to the right a large portion of which was filled with the spur of a glacier whose surface was covered with pink snow  one can imagine with what feelings the two youths gazed on this beautiful sight  it seemed as if that valley instead of forming a portion of the sterile region beyond the arctic circle were one of the sunniest regions of the south for a warm glow rested on the bosom of the snow as if the sun were shedding upon it his rosiest hues a little farther to the north the red snow ceased or only occurred here and there in patches and beyond it there appeared another gorge in the cliffs within which rose a tall column of rock so straight and cylindrical that it seemed to be a production of art  the whole of the back country was one great rolling distance of glacier and wherever a crevice or gorge in the riven cliffs afforded an opportunity this ocean of landice sent down spurs into the sea the extremities of which were constantly shedding off huge bergs into the water  what a scene exclaimed tom singleton when he found words to express his admiration  i did not think that our world contained so grand a sight  it surpasses my wildest dreams of fairyland  fairyland ejaculated fred with a slight look of contempt do you know since i came to this part of the world ive come to the conclusion that fairy tales are all stuff and very inferior stuff too  why this reality is a thousand million times grander than anything that was ever invented  but what surprises me most is the red snow  what can be the cause of it  i dont know replied singleton it has long been a matter of dispute among learned men but we must examine it for ourselves so come along  the remarkable colour of the snow referred to although a matter of dispute at the period of the dolphins visit to the arctic seas is generally admitted now to be the result of a curious and extremely minute vegetable growth which spreads not only over its surface but penetrates into it sometimes to a depth of several feet  the earlier navigators who discovered it and first told the astonished world that the substance which they had been accustomed to associate with the idea of the purest and most radiant whiteness had been seen by them lying red upon the ground attributed the phenomenon to innumerable multitudes of minute creatures belonging to the order radiata but the discovery of red snow among the central alps of europe and in the pyrenees and on the mountains of norway where marine animalcules could not exist effectually overturned this idea  the colouring matter has now been ascertained to result from plants belonging to the order called algae which have a remarkable degree of vitality and possess the power to an amazing extent of growing and spreading with rapidity even over such an ungenial soil as the arctic snow  while singleton was examining the red snow and vainly endeavouring to ascertain the nature of the minute specks of matter by which it was coloured fred continued to gaze with a look of increasing earnestness towards the tall column around which a bank of fog was spreading and partially concealing it from view  at length he attracted the attention of his companion towards it  i say im half inclined to believe that yon is no work of nature but a monument set up to attract the attention of ships  dont you think so  singleton regarded the object in question for some time  i dont think so fred it is larger than you suppose for the fogbank deceives us but let us go and seeit cannot be far off  as they drew near to the tall rock freds hopes began to fade and soon were utterly quenched by the fog clearing away and showing that the column was indeed of natures own constructing  it was a single solitary shaft of green limestone which stood on the brink of a deep ravine and was marked by the slaty limestone that once encased it  the length of the column was apparently about five hundred feet and the pedestal of sandstone on which it stood was itself upwards of two hundred feet high  this magnificent column seemed the flagstaff of a gigantic crystal fortress which was suddenly revealing by the clearing away of the fogbank to the north  it was the face of the great glacier of the interior which here presented an unbroken perpendicular fronta sweep of solid glassy wall which rose three hundred feet above the waterlevel with an unknown depth below it  the sun glittered on the crags and peaks and battlements of this ice fortress as if the mysterious inhabitants of the far north had lit up their fires and planted their artillery to resist further invasion  the effect upon the minds of the two youths who were probably the first to gaze upon those wondrous visions of the icy regions was tremendous for a long time neither of them could utter a word and it would be idle to attempt to transcribe the language in which at length their excited feelings sought to escape  it was not until their backs had been for some time turned on the scene and the cape near the valley of red snow had completely shut it out from view that they could condescend to converse again in their ordinary tones on ordinary subjects  as they hastened back over the icebelt at the foot of the cliffs a loud boom rang out in the distance and rolled in solemn echoes along the shore  there goes a gun exclaimed tom singleton hastily pulling out his watch  hallo do you know what time it is  pretty late i suppose it was afternoon i know when we started and we must have been out a good while now  what time is it  just two oclock in the morning  what do you mean to say it was yesterday when we started and that weve been walking all night and got into tomorrow morning without knowing it  even so fred  we have overshot our time and the captain is signalling us to make haste  he said that he would not fire unless there seemed some prospect of the ice moving so we had better run unless we wish to be left behind come along  they had not proceeded more than half a mile when a polar bear walked leisurely out from behind a lump of ice where it had been regaling itself on a dead seal and sauntered slowly out towards the icebergs seaward not a hundred yards in advance of them  hallo look there what a monster shouted fred as he cocked his musket and sprang forward  whatll you do tom youve no gun  never mind ill do what i can with the hammer  only make sure you dont miss  dont fire till you are quite close to him  they were running after the bear at top speed while they thus conversed in hasty and broken sentences when suddenly they came to a yawning crack in the ice about thirty feet wide and a mile long on either hand with the rising tide boiling at the bottom of it  bruins pursuers came to an abrupt halt  now isnt that disgusting  probably it was and the expression of chagrin on freds countenance as he said so evidently showed that he meant it but there is no doubt that this interruption to their hunt was extremely fortunate for to attack a polar bear with a musket charged only with small shot and a geological hammer would have been about as safe and successful an operation as trying to stop a locomotive with ones hand  neither of them had yet had experience of the enormous strength of this white monarch of the frozen regions and his tenacity of life although both were reckless enough to rush at him with any arms they chanced to have  give him a long shot quick cried singleton  fred fired instantly and the bear stopped and looked round as much as to say did you speak gentlemen  then not receiving a reply he walked away with dignified indifference and disappeared among the icehummocks  an hour afterwards the two wanderers were seated at a comfortable breakfast in the cabin of the dolphin relating their adventures to the captain and mates and although unwittingly to mivins who generally managed so to place himself while engaged in the mysterious operations of his little pantry that most of the cabintalk reached his ear and travelled thence through his mouth to the forecastle  the captain was fully aware of this fact but he winked at it for there was nothing but friendly feeling on board the ship and no secrets  when however matters of serious import had to be discussed the cabin door was closed and mivins turned to expend himself on davie summers who in the capacity of a listener was absolutely necessary to the comfortable existence of the worthy steward  having exhausted their appetites and their information fred and tom were told that during their absence a bear and two seals had been shot by meetuck the esquimaux interpreter whom they had taken on board at uppernavik and they were further informed that the ice was in motion to the westward and that there was every probability of their being released by the falling tide  having duly and silently weighed these facts for a few minutes they simultaneously and as if by a common impulse yawned and retired to bed    chapter nine  the dolphin gets beset in the icepreparations for wintering in the icecaptain guys code of laws  an accident now befell the dolphin which effectually decided the fate of the ship and her crew at least for that winter  this was her getting aground near the ravine of the giant flagstaff before mentioned and being finally beset by ice from which all efforts on the part of the men to extricate her proved abortive and in which she was ultimately frozen inhard and fast  the first sight the crew obtained of the red snow filled them with unbounded amazement and a few of the more superstitious amongst them with awe approaching to fear  but soon their attention was attracted from this by the wonderful column  och then may i niver exclaimed oriley the moment he caught sight of it if there bent the north pole at long lastsure enough  the laugh that greeted this remark was almost immediately checked partly from the feelings of solemnity inspired by the magnificent view which opened up to them and partly from a suspicion on the part of the more ignorant among the men that there might be some truth in orileys statement after all  but their attention and energies were speedily called to the dangerous position of the ship which unexpectedly took the ground in a bay where the water proved to be unusually shallow and before they could warp her off the ice closed round her in compact immovable masses  at first captain guy was not seriously alarmed by this untoward event although he felt a little chagrin in consequence of the detention for the summer was rapidly advancing and it behoved him to return to baffins bay and prosecute the whalefishing as energetically as possible but when day after day passed and the ice round the ship still remained immovable he became alarmed and sought by every means in his power to extricate himself  his position was rendered all the more aggravating by the fact that a week after he was beset the main body of the ice in the strait opened up and drifted to the southward leaving a comparatively clear sea through which he could have pushed his way without much difficulty in any direction but the solid masses in which they lay embedded were fast to the ground for about fifty yards beyond the vessel seaward and until these should be floated away there was no chance of escape  get up some powder and canisters mr bolton he exclaimed one morning after breakfast ill try what can be done by blasting the ice the highest spring tide will occur tomorrow and if the ship dont move then we shall  he did not finish the sentence but turned on his heel and walked forward where he found buzzby and some of the men preparing the icesaws  ay ay muttered the mate as he went below to give the necessary directions you dont need to conclude your speech captain  if we dont get out tomorrow were locked up for one winter at least if not more  ay and yell no get oot tomorrow remarked saunders with a shake of his head as he looked up from the logbook in which he was making an entry  were hard and fast so well just have to make the best ot  saunders was right as the efforts of the next day proved  the ice lay around the vessel in solid masses as we have said and with each of the last three tides these masses had been slightly moved  saws and ice chisels therefore had been in constant operation and the men worked with the utmost energy night and day taking it by turns and having double allowance of hot coffee served out to them  we may mention here that the dolphin carried no spirits except what was needed for medicinal purposes and for fuel to several small cookinglamps that had been recently invented  it had now been proved by many voyagers of experience that in cold countries as well as hot men work harder and endure the extremity of hardship better without strong drink than with it and the dolphins crew were engaged on the distinct understanding that coffee and tea and chocolate were to be substituted for rum and that spirits were never to be given to anyone on board except in cases of extreme necessity  but to returnalthough the men worked as only those can who toil for liberation from long imprisonment no impression worth mentioning could be made on the ice  at length the attempt to rend it by means of gunpowder was made  a jar containing about thirty pounds of powder was sunk in a hole in an immense block of ice which lay close against the stern of the ship mivins being light of foot was set to fire the train  he did so and ranran so fast that he missed his footing in leaping over a chasm and had wellnigh fallen into the water below  there was a whiz and a loud report and the enormous mass of ice heaved upwards in the centre and fell back in huge fragments  so far the result was satisfactory and the men were immediately set to sink several charges in various directions around the vessel to be in readiness for the highest tide which was soon expected  warps and hawsers were also got out and fixed to the seaward masses ready to heave on them at a moments notice the ship was lightened as much as possible by lifting her stores upon the ice and the whole crewcaptain mates and allworked and heaved like horses until the perspiration streamed from their faces while mizzle kept supplying them with a constant deluge of hot coffee  fred and the young surgeon too worked like the rest with their coats off handkerchiefs bound round their heads and shirtsleeves tucked up to their shoulders  at last the tide roseinch by inch and slowly as if it grudged to give them even a chance of escape  mivins grew impatient and unbelieving under it  i dont think itll rise another hinch he remarked to oriley who stood near him  niver fear boy  the capting knows a sight better than you do and he says itll rise a fut yit  does he asked grim who was also beginning to despond  ov coorse he does  sure he towld me in a confidential way just before he wint to turn in last nightif it wasnt yisturday forenoon for its meself as niver knows an hour o the day since the sun became dissipated and tuck to sittin up all night in this fashion  shut up yer tatie trap and open yer weather eye muttered buzzby who had charge of the gang therell be time enough to speak after were off  gradually as the tide rose the ice and the ship moved and it became evident that the latter was almost afloat though the former seemed to be only partly raised from the ground  the men were at their several posts ready for instant action and gazing in anxious expectation at the captain who stood watch in hand ready to give the word  now then fire he said in a low voice  in a moment the ice round the ship was rent and upheaved as if some leviathan of the deep were rising from beneath it and the vessel swung slowly round  a loud cheer burst from the men  now lads heave with a will roared the captain  round went the capstan the windlass clanked and the ship forged slowly ahead as the warps and hawsers became rigid  at that moment a heavy block of ice which had been overbalanced by the motion of the vessel fell with a crash on the rudder splitting off a large portion of it and drawing the iron bolts that held it completely out of the sternpost  never mind heave awayfor your lives cried the captain  jump on board all of you  the few men who had until now remained on the ice scrambled up the side there was a sheet of ice right ahead which the ship could not clear but which she was pushing out to sea in advance of her  suddenly this took the ground and remained motionless  out there with icechisels  sink a hole like lightning  prepare a canister mr bolton quick shouted the captain in desperation as he sprang over the side and assisted to cut into the unwieldy obstruction the charge was soon fixed and fired but it only split the block in two and left it motionless as before  a few minutes after the ship again grounded the ice settled round her the spring tide was lost and they were not delivered  those who know the bitterness of repeated disappointment and of hope deferred may judge of the feelings with which the crew of the dolphin now regarded their position  little indeed was said but the grave looks of most of the men and the absence of the usual laugh and jest and disposition to skylark which on almost all other occasions characterised them showed too plainly how heavily the prospect of a winter in the arctic regions weighed upon their spirits  they continued their exertions to free the ship however for several days after the high tide and did not finally give in until all reasonable hope of moving her was utterly annihilated  before this however a reaction began to take place the prospects of the coming winter were discussed and some of the more sanguine looked even beyond the winter and began to consider how they would contrive to get the ship out of her position into deep water again  fred ellice too thought of his father and this abrupt check to the search and his spirits sank again as his hopes decayed  but poor fred like the others at last discovered that it was of no use to repine and that it was best to face his sorrows and difficulties like a man  among so many men there were all shades of character and the fact that they were doomed to a years imprisonment in the frozen regions was received in very different ways  some looked grave and thought of it seriously others laughed and treated it lightly a few grumbled and spoke profanely but most of them became quickly reconciled and in a week or two nearly all forgot the past and the future in the duties and cares and amusements of the present  captain guy and his officers however and a few of the more sedate men among whom were buzzby and peter grim looked forward with much anxiety knowing full well the dangers and trials that lay before them  it is true the ship was provisioned for more than a year but most of the provisions were salt and tom singleton could have told them had they required to be told that without fresh provisions they stood a poor chance of escaping that dire disease scurvy before which have fallen so many gallant tars whom nothing in the shape of dangers or difficulties could subdue  there were indeed myriads of wild fowl flying about the ship on which the men feasted and grew fat every day and the muskets of meetuck and those who accompanied him seldom failed to supply the ship with an abundance of the flesh of seals walrus and polar bears portions of all of which creatures were considered very good indeed by the men and particularly by the dogs which grew so fat that they began to acquire a very disreputable waddle in their gait as they walked the deck for exercise which they seldom did by the way being passionately fond of sleep  but birds and perchance beasts might be expected to take themselves off when the winter arrived and leave the crew without fresh food  then although the dolphin was supplied with every necessary for a whaling expedition and with many luxuries besides she was illprovided with the supplies that men deem absolutely indispensable for a winter in the arctic regions where the cold is so bitterly intense that after a prolonged sojourn mens minds become almost entirely engrossed by two clamant demands of naturefood and heat  they had only a small quantity of coal on board and nothing except a few extra spars that could be used as a substitute while the bleak shores afforded neither shrub nor tree of any kind  meanwhile they had a sufficiency of everything they required for at least two or three months to come and for the rest as grim said they had stout hearts and strong arms  as soon as it became apparent that they were to winter in the bay which the captain named the bay of mercy all further attempt to extricate the ship was abandoned and every preparation for spending the winter was begun and carried out vigorously  it was now that captain guys qualities as a leader began to be displayed  he knew from long experience and observation that in order to keep up the morale of any body of men it was absolutely necessary to maintain the strictest discipline  indeed this rule is so universal in its application that many men find it advantageous to impose strict rules on themselves in the regulation of their time and affairs in order to keep their own spirits under command  one of the captains first resolves therefore was to call the men together and address them on this subject and he seized the occasion of the first sabbath morning they spent in the bay of mercy when the crew were assembled on the quarterdeck to speak to them  it was an exceedingly bright day  captain guy stood up and in an earnest firm tone said  my lads i consider it my duty to say a few plain words to you in reference to our present situation and prospects  i feel that the responsibility of having brought you here rests very much upon myself and i deem it my solemn duty in more than the ordinary sense to do all i can to get you out of the ice again  you know as well as i do that this is impossible at the present time and that we are compelled to spend a winter here  some of you know what that means but the most of you know it only by hearsay and thats much the same as knowing nothing about it at all  before the winter is done your energies and endurance will probably be taxed to the uttermost  i think it right to be candid with you  the life before you will not be childsplay but i assure you that it may be mingled with much that will be pleasant and hearty if you choose to set about it in the right way  well then to be short about it  there is no chance whatever of our getting through the winter in this ship comfortably or even safely unless the strictest discipline is maintained aboard  i know for ive been in similar circumstances before that when cold and hunger and it may be sickness press upon usshould it please the almighty to send these on us in great severityyou will feel duty to be irksome and youll think it useless and perhaps be tempted to mutiny  now i ask you solemnly while your minds are clear from all prejudices each individually to sign a written code of laws and a written promise that you will obey the same and help me to enforce them even with the punishment of death if need be  now lads will you agree to that  agreed agreed cried the men at once and in a tone of prompt decision that convinced their leader he had their entire confidencea matter of the highest importance in the critical circumstances in which they were placed  well then ill read the rules they are few but sufficiently comprehensive  first  prayers shall be read every morning before breakfast unless circumstances render it impossible to do so  the captain laid down the paper and looked earnestly at the men  my lads i have never felt so strongly as i now do the absolute need we have of the blessing and guidance of the almighty and i am persuaded that it is our duty as well as our interest to begin not only the sabbath but every day with prayer  second  the ordinary duties of the ship shall be carried on the watches regularly set and relieved regular hours observed and the details of duty attended to in the usual way as when in harbour  third  the officers shall take watch and watch about as heretofore except when required to do otherwise the logbooks and meteorological observations etcetera shall be carried on as usual  fourth  the captain shall have supreme and absolute command as when at sea but he on his part promises that should any peculiar circumstance arise in which the safety of the crew or ship shall be implicated he will if the men are so disposed call a council of the whole crew in which case the decision of the majority shall become law but the minority in that event shall have it in their option to separate from the majority and carry along with them their share of the general provisions  fifth  disobedience to orders shall be punishable according to the decision of a council to be appointed specially for the purpose of framing a criminal code hereafter to be submitted for the approval of the crew  the rules above laid down were signed by every man in the ship  several of them could not write but these affixed a cross x at the foot of the page against which their names were written by the captain in presence of witnesses which answered the same purpose  and from that time until events occurred which rendered all such rules unnecessary the work of the ship went on pleasantly and well    chapter ten  beginning of wintermeetuck effects a remarkable change in the mens appearancemossing and working and plans for a winter campaign  in august the first frost came and formed young ice on the sea but this lasted only for a brief hour or two and was broken up by the tide and melted  by the 10th of september the young ice cemented the floes of last years ice together and soon rendered the ice round the ship immovable  hummocks clustered round several rocky islets in the neighbourhood and the rising and falling of the tide covered the sides of the rocks with bright crystals  all the feathered tribes took their departure for less rigorous climes with the exception of a small white bird about the size of a sparrow called the snowbird which is the last to leave the icy north  then a tremendous storm arose and the sea became choked up with icebergs and floes which the frost soon locked together into a solid mass  towards the close of the storm snow fell in great abundance and when the mariners ventured again to put their heads up the opened hatchways the decks were kneedeep the drift to windward was almost level with the bulwarks every yard was edged with white every rope and cord had a light side and a dark every point and truck had a white button on it and every hole corner crack and crevice was choked up  the land and the sea were also clothed with this spotless garment which is indeed a strikingly appropriate emblem of purity and the only dark objects visible in the landscape were those precipices which were too steep for the snow to lie on the towering form of the giant flagstaff and the leaden clouds that rolled angrily across the sky  but these leaden clouds soon rolled off leaving a blue wintry sky and a bright sun behind  the storm blew itself out early in the morning and at breakfasttime on that day when the sun was just struggling with the last of the clouds captain guy remarked to his friends who were seated round the cabin table well gentlemen we must begin hard work today  hard work captain exclaimed fred ellice pausing for a second or two in the hard work of chewing a piece of hard salt junk why what do you call the work weve been engaged in for the last few weeks  play my lad that was only playjust to bring our hands in before setting to work in earnest  what do you think of the health of the men doctor  never was better but i fear the hospital will soon fill if you carry out your threat in regard to work  no fear remarked the second mate the more work the better health is my experience  busy men have no time to git seek  no doubt of it sir said the first mate bolting a large mouthful of pork  nothing so good for em as work  there are two against you doctor said the captain  then its two to two cried fred as he finished breakfast for i quite agree with tom and with that excellent proverb which says all work and no play makes jack a dull boy  the captain shook his head as he said of all the nuisances i ever met with in a ship a semipassenger is the worst  i think fred i must get you bound apprentice and give you regular work to do you goodfornothing  we need scarcely say that the captain jested for fred was possessed of a spirit that cannot rest so to speak unless at work  he was able to do almost anything after a fashion and was never idle for a moment even when his hands chanced to be unemployed his brows were knitted busily planning what to do next  well now gentlemen resumed the captain let us consider the order of business  the first thing that must be done now is to unstow the hold and deposit its contents on the small island astern of us which we shall call store island for brevitys sake  get a tent pitched there mr bolton and bank it up with snow  you can leave grim to superintend the unloading  then mr saunders do you go and set a gang of men to cut a canal through the young ice from the ship to the island fortunately the floes there are wide enough apart to let our quarterboats float between them  the unshipping wont take long  tell buzzby to take a dozen men with him and collect moss well need a large quantity for fuel and if another storm like this comes itll be hard work to get down to it  send meetuck to me when you go on deck i shall talk to him as to our prospects of finding deer hereabouts and arrange a hunt  doctor you may either join the hunting party or post up the observations etcetera which have accumulated of late  thank you captain said singleton ill accept the latter duty the more willingly that i wish to have a careful examination of my botanical specimens  and what am i to do captain enquired fred  what you please lad  then ill go and take care of meetuck hes apt to get into mischief when left  at this moment a tremendous shout of laughter longcontinued came from the deck and a sound as of numbers of men dancing overhead was heard  the party in the cabin seized their caps and sprang up the companion where they beheld a scene that accounted for the laughter and induced them to join in it  at first sight it seemed as if thirty polar bears had boarded the vessel and were executing a dance of triumph before proceeding to make a meal of the crew but on closer inspection it became apparent that the men had undergone a strange transformation and were capering with delight at the ridiculous appearance they presented they were clad from head to foot in esquimaux costume and now bore as strong a resemblance to polar bears as man could attain to  meetuck was the pattern and the chief instrument in effecting this change  at uppernavik captain guy had been induced to purchase a large number of foxskins deerskins sealskins and other furs as a speculation and had them tightly packed and stowed away in the hold little imagining the purpose they were ultimately destined to serve meetuck had come on board in a mongrel sort of wornout sealskin dress but the instant the cold weather set in he drew from a bundle which he had brought with him a dress made of the furs of the arctic fox some of the skins being white and the others blue  it consisted of a loose coat somewhat in the form of a shirt with a large hood to it and a short elongation behind like the commencement of a tail  the boots were made of white bearskin which at the end of the foot were made to terminate with the claws of the animal and they were so long that they came up the thigh under the coat or jumper as the men called it and thus served instead of trousers  he also wore fur mittens with a bag for the fingers and a separate little bag for the thumb  the hair on these garments was long and soft and worn outside so that when a man enveloped himself in them and put up the hood which wellnigh concealed the face he became very much like a bear or some such creature standing on its hindlegs  meetuck was a short fat burly little fellow by nature but when he put on his winter dress he became such a round soft squat hairy and comicallooking creature that no one could look at him without laughing and the shout with which he was received on deck the first time he made his appearance in his new costume was loud and prolonged  but meetuck was as goodhumoured an esquimaux as ever speared a walrus or lanced a polar bear  he joined in the laugh and cut a caper or two to show that he entered into the spirit of the joke  when the ship was set fast and the thermometer fell pretty low the men found that their ordinary dreadnoughts and peajackets etcetera were not a sufficient protection against the cold and it occurred to the captain that his furs might now be turned to good account  sailors are proverbially good needlemen of a rough kind  meetuck showed them how to set about their work each man made his own garments and in less than a week they were completed  it is true the boots perplexed them a little and the less ingenious among the men made very rare and curiouslooking footgear for themselves but they succeeded after a fashion and at last the whole crew appeared on deck in their new habiliments as we have already mentioned capering among the snow like bears to their own entire satisfaction and to the intense delight of meetuck who now came to regard the white men as brothersso true is it that the tailor makes the man  ow orribly eavy it is haint it gasped mivins after dancing round the mainhatch till he was nearly exhausted  heavy cried buzzby whose appearance was such that you would have hesitated to say whether his breadth or length was greaterheavy dye say  it must be your sperrits wots heavy then for i feel as light as a feather myself  o morther then may i niver sleep on a bed made o sich feathers cried oriley capering up to green the carpenters mate and throwing a mass of snow in his face  the frost rendered it impossible to form the snow into balls but the men made up for this by throwing it about each others eyes and ears in handfuls  what dye mean by insultin my matetake that said peter grim giving the irishman a twirl that tumbled him on the deck  oh bad manners to ye spluttered oriley as he rose and ran away why dont ye hit a man o yer own size  deed then it must be because theres not one o my own size to hit remarked the carpenter with a broad grin  this was true  grims colossal proportions were increased so much by his hairy dress that he seemed to spread out into the dimensions of two large men rolled into one  but oriley was not to be overturned with impunity  skulking round behind the crew who were laughing at grims joke he came upon the giant in the rear and seizing the short tail of his jumper pulled him violently down on the deck  ah then give it him boys cried oriley pushing the carpenter flat down and obliterating his black beard and his whole visage in a mass of snow  several of the wilder spirits among the men leaped on the prostrate grim and nearly smothered him before he could gather himself up for a struggle then they fled in all directions while their victim regained his feet and rushed wildly after them  at last he caught oriley and grasping him by the two shoulders gave him a heave that was intended and calclated as amos parr afterwards remarked to pitch him over the foretopsailyard  but an irishman is not easily overcome  oriley suddenly straightened himself and held his arms up over his head and the violent heave which according to parr was to have sent him to such an uncomfortable elevation only pulled the jumper completely off his body and left him free to laugh in the face of his big friend and run away  at this point the captain deemed it prudent to interfere  come come my lads he cried enough o this  thats not the morning work is it  im glad to find that your new dresses he added with a significant smile make you fond of rough work in the snow theres plenty of it before us  come down below with me meetuck i wish to talk with you  as the captain descended to the cabin the men gave a final cheer and in ten minutes they were working laboriously at their various duties  buzzby and his party were the first ready and off to cut moss  they drew a sledge after them towards the redsnow valley which was not more than two miles distant from the ship  this mossing as it was termed was by no means a pleasant duty  before the winter became severe the moss could be cut out from the beds of the snow streams with comparative ease but now the mixed turf of willows heaths grasses and moss was frozen solid and had to be quarried with crowbars and carried to the ship like so much stone  however it was prosecuted vigorously and a sufficient quantity was soon procured to pack on the decks of the ship and around its sides so as to keep out the cold  at the same time the operation of discharging the stores was carried on briskly and fred in company with meetuck oriley and joseph west started with the dogsledge on a hunting expedition  in order to enable the reader better to understand the condition of the dolphin and her crew we will detail the several arrangements that were made at this time and during the succeeding fortnight  as a measure of precaution the ship by means of blasting sawing and warping was with great labour got into deeper water where one nights frost set her fast with a sheet of ice three inches thick round her in a few weeks this ice became several feet thick and the snow drifted up her hull so much that it seemed as if she were resting on the land and had taken final leave of her native element  strong hawsers were then secured to store island in order to guard against the possibility of her being carried away by any sudden disruption of the ice  the disposition of the masts yards and sails were next determined on the topgallant masts were struck the lower yards got down to the housings  the topsail yards gaff and jibboom however were left in their places the topsails and courses were kept bent to the yards the sheets being unrove and the clews tucked in  the rest of the binding sails were stowed on deck to prevent their thawing during winter and the spare spars were lashed over the ships sides to leave a clear space for taking exercise in bad weather  the stores in order to relieve the strain on the ship were removed to store island and snugly housed under the tent erected there and then a thick bank of snow was heaped up round it  after this was accomplished all the boats were hauled up beside the tent and covered with snow except the two quarter boats which were left hanging at the davits all winter  when the thermometer fell below zero it was found that the vapours below and the breath of the men condensed on the beams of the lower deck and in the cabin near the hatchway  it was therefore resolved to convert some sheetiron which they fortunately possessed into pipes which being conducted from the cookingstove through the length of the ship served in some degree to raise the temperature and ventilate the cabins  a regular daily allowance of coal was served out and four steady men appointed to attend to the fire in regular watches for the double purpose of seeing that none of the fuel should be wasted and of guarding against fire  they had likewise charge of the firepumps and buckets and two tanks of water all of which were kept in the hatchway in constant readiness in case of accidents  in addition to this a firebrigade was formed with joseph west a steady quiet active young seaman as its captain and their stations in the event of fire were fixed beforehand also a hole was kept constantly open in the ice alongside to ensure at all times a sufficient supply of water  strict regulations as to cleanliness and the daily airing of the hammocks were laid down and adhered to throughout the winter  a regular allowance of provisions was appointed to each man so that they should not run the risk of starving before the return of the wild fowl in spring  but those provisions were all salt and the captain trusted much to their hunting expeditions for a supply of fresh food without which there would be little hope of their continuing in a condition of good health  coffee was served out at breakfast and cocoa at supper besides being occasionally supplied at other times to men who had been engaged in exhausting work in extremely cold weather  afterwards when the dark season set in and the crew were confined by the intense cold more than formerly within the ship various schemes were set afoot for passing the time profitably and agreeably  among others a school was started by the captain for instructing such of the crew as chose to attend in reading writing and arithmetic and in this hyperborean academy fred ellice acted as the writingmaster and tom singleton as the accountant  the men were much amused at first at the idea of goin to school and some of them looked rather shy at it but oriley after some consideration came boldly forward and said well boys bad luck to me if i dont think ill be a scholard afther all  my old granmother used to tell me whin i refused to go to the school that was kip be an owld man as tuck his fees out in murphies and photteensays she ah ye spalpeen yell niver be cliverer nor the pig ye wont ah then i hope not says i for sure shes far the cliverest in the house an ye wouldnt have me to be cliverer than me own granmother would ye says i  so i niver wint to school and more be token i cant sign me name and if it was only to learn how to do that ill go and jine indeed i will  so oriley joined and before long every man in the ship was glad to join in order to have something to do  the doctor also twice a week gave readings from shakespeare a copy of which he had fortunately brought with him  he also read extracts from the few other books they happened to have on board and after a time finding unexpectedly that he had a talent that way he began to draw upon his memory and his imagination and told long stories which were facetiously called lectures to the men who listened to them with great delight  then fred started an illustrated newspaper once a week which was named the arctic sun and which was in great favour during the whole course of its brief existence  it is true only one copy was issued each morning of publication because besides supplying the greater proportion of the material himself and executing the illustrations in a style that would have made mr leech of the present day envious he had to transcribe the various contributions he received from the men and others in a neat legible hand  but this one copy was perused and reperused as no single copy of any paper extantnot excepting the times or punchhas ever yet been perused and when it was returned to the editor to be carefully placed in the archives of the dolphin it was emphatically the worse for wear  besides all this a theatre was set agoingof which we shall have more to say hereafter  in thus minutely recounting the various expedients which these banished men fell upon to pass the long dark hours of an arctic winter we may perhaps give the reader the impression that a great deal of thought and time were bestowed upon amusement as if that were the chief end and object of their life in those regions  but we must remind him that though many more pages might be filled in recounting all the particulars but a small portion of their time was after all taken up in this way and it would have been well for them had they been able to find more to amuse them than they did for the depressing influence of the longcontinued darkness and the want of a sufficiency of regular employment for so many months added to the rigorous nature of the climate in which they dwelt wellnigh broke their spirits at last  in order to secure warmth during winter the deck of the ship was padded with moss about a foot deep and down below the walls were lined with the same material  the floors were carefully plastered with common paste and covered with oakum a couple of inches deep over which a carpet of canvas was spread  every opening in the deck was fastened down and covered deeply over with moss with the exception of one hatch which was their only entrance and this was kept constantly closed except when it was desirable to ventilate  curtains were hung up in front of it to prevent draughts  a canvas awning was also spread over the decks from stem to stern so that it was confidently hoped the dolphin would prove a snug tenement even in the severest cold  as has been said before the snowdrift almost buried the hull of the ship and as snow is a good nonconductor of heat this further helped to keep up the temperature within  a staircase of snow was built up to the bulwarks on the larboard quarter and on the starboard side an inclined plane of snow was sloped down to the ice to facilitate the launching of the sledges when they had to be pulled on deck  such were the chief arrangements and preparations that were made by our adventurers for spending the winter but although we have described them at this point in our story many of them were not completed until a much later period    chapter eleven  a hunting expedition in the course of which the hunters meet with many interesting dangerous peculiar and remarkable experiences and make acquaintance with seals walrus deer and rabbits  we must now return to fred ellice and his companions meetuck the esquimaux oriley and joseph west whom we left while they were on the point of starting on a hunting expedition  they took the direction of the ice hummocks out to the sea and seated comfortably on a large sledge were dragged by the team of dogs over the ice at the rate of ten miles an hour  well did i iver expect to ride in a carriage and six exclaimed oriley in a state of great glee as the dogs dashed forward at full speed while meetuck flourished his awful whip making it crack like a pistolshot ever and anon  the sledge on which they travelled was of the very curious and simple construction peculiar to the esquimaux and was built by peter grim under the direction of meetuck  it consisted of two runners of about ten feet in length six inches high two inches broad and three feet apart  they were made of tough hickory slightly curved in front and were attached to each other by cross bars  at the stem of the vehicle there was a low back composed of two uprights and a single bar across the whole machine was fastened together by means of tough lashings of raw sealhide so that to all appearance it was a rickety affair ready to fall to pieces  in reality however it was very strong  no metal nails of any kind could have held in the keen frost they would have snapped like glass at the first jolt but the sealskin fastenings yielded to the rude shocks and twistings to which the sledge was subjected and seldom gave way or if they did were easily and speedily renewed without the aid of any other implement than a knife  but the whip was the most remarkable part of the equipage  the handle was only sixteen inches in length but the lash was twenty feet long made of the toughest sealskin and as thick as a mans wrist near the handle whence it tapered off to a fine point  the labour of using such a formidable weapon is so great that esquimaux usually when practicable travel in couples one sledge behind the other  the dogs of the last sledge follow mechanically and require no whip and the riders change about so as to relieve each other  when travelling the whip trails behind and can be brought with a tremendous crack that makes the hair fly from the wretch that is struckand esquimaux are splendid shots so to speak  they can hit any part of a dog with certainty but usually rest satisfied with simply cracking the whip a sound that produces an answering yell of terror whether the lash takes effect or not  our hunters were clothed in their esquimaux garments and cut the oddest imaginable figures  they had a soft rotund cuddledup appearance that was powerfully suggestive of comfort  the sled carried one days provisions a couple of walrus harpoons with a sufficient quantity of rope four muskets with the requisite ammunition an esquimaux cookinglamp two stout spears two tarpaulins to spread on the snow and four blanket sleepingbags  these last were six feet long and just wide enough for a man to crawl into at night feet first  what a jolly style of travelling isnt it cried fred as the dogs sprang wildly forward tearing the sledge behind them dumps and poker leading and looking as lively as crickets  well now isnt it true that wits jumpthats jist what i was sayin to meself remarked oriley grinning from ear to ear as he pulled the fur hood farther over his head crossed his arms more firmly on his breast and tried to double himself up as he sat there like an overgrown rat  i wouldnt exchange it with the lord mayor o london and his coach an sixso i wouldnt  arrah have a care meetuck ye baste or yell have us kilt  this last exclamation was caused by the reckless driver dashing over a piece of rough ice that nearly capsized the sledge  meetuck did not answer but he looked over his shoulder with a quiet smile on his oily countenance  ah then ye may laugh said oriley with a menacing look but av ye break a bone o me body ill  down went the dogs into a crack in the ice as he spoke over went the sledge and hurled them all out upon the ice  musha but yeve done it  hallo west are you hurt cried fred anxiously as he observed the sailor fall heavily on the ice  oh no sir all right thank you replied the man rising alertly and limping to the sledge  only knocked the skin off my shin sir  west was a quiet serious polite man an american by birth who was much liked by the crew in consequence of a union of politeness and modesty with a disposition to work far beyond his strength  he was not very robust however and in powers of physical endurance scarcely fitted to engage in an arctic expedition  an dont ye think its worth makin enquiries about me cried oriley who had been tossed into a crevice in a hummock where he lay jammed and utterly unable to move  fred and the esquimaux laughed heartily while oriley extricated himself from his awkward position  fortunately no damage was done and in five minutes they were flying over the frozen sea as madly as ever in the direction of the point at the opposite side of redsnow valley where a cloud of frostsmoke indicated open water  now look you mr meetuck av ye do that again yell better dont let me tell ye  sure the back o mes track entirely said oriley as he rearranged himself with a look of comfort that belied his words  och there ye go again he cried as the sled suddenly fell about six inches from a higher level to a lower where the floe had cracked causing the teeth of the whole party to come together with a snap  a man dursent spake for fear o bitin his tongue off  no fee said meetuck looking over his shoulder with a broader smirk  no fee ye lump of pork its a double fee ill have to pay the dacter an ye go on like that  no fee was meetucks best attempt at the words no fear  he had picked up a little english during his brief sojourn with the sailors and already understood much of what was said to him but words were as yet few and his manner of pronouncing them peculiar  holo look look cried the esquimaux leaping suddenly off the sledge and checking the dogs  eh what where ejaculated fred seizing his musket  i think i see something sir cried west shading his eyes with his hand and gazing earnestly in the direction indicated by meetuck  so do i be the mortial said oriley in a hoarse whisper  i see the mountains and the sky i do as plain as the nose on me face  hush stop your nonsense man said fred  i see a deer im certain of it  meetuck nodded violently to indicate that fred was right  well whats to be done luckily we are well to leeward and it has neither sighted nor scented us  meetuck replied by gestures and words to the effect that west and oriley should remain with the dogs and keep them quiet under the shelter of a hummock while he and fred should go after the reindeer accordingly away they went making a pretty long detour in order to gain the shore and come upon it under the shelter of the grounded floes behind which they might approach without being seen  in hurrying along the coast they observed the footprints of a musk ox and also of several arctic hares and foxes which delighted them much for hitherto they had seen none of those animals and were beginning to be fearful lest they should not visit that part of the coast at all  of course fred knew not what sort of animals had made the tracks in question but he was an adept at guessing and the satisfied looks of his companion gave him reason to believe that he was correct in his surmises  in half an hour they came within range and fred after debating with himself for some time as to the propriety of taking the first shot triumphed over himself and stepping back a pace motioned to the esquimaux to fire  but meetuck was an innate gentleman and modestly declined so fred advanced took a good aim and fired  the deer bounded away but stumbled as it went showing that it was wounded  ha ha  meetuck exclaimed fred as he recharged in tremendous excitement taking twice as long to load in consequence ive improved a little you see in my shoot o bother thisramrodtut tut there thats it  bang went meetucks musket at that moment and the deer tumbled over upon the snow  well done old fellow cried fred springing forward  at the same instant a white hare darted across his path at which he fired without even putting the gun to his shoulder and knocked it over to his own intense amazement  the three shots were the signal for the men to come up with the sledge which they did at full gallop oriley driving and flourishing the long whip about in a way that soon entangled it hopelessly with the dogs traces  ah then yeve done it this time ye have sure enough  musha what a purty crature it is  now isnt it west  stop then wont ye to the restive dogs yeve broke my heart entirely and the whips tied up into iver so many knots  arrah meetuck ye may drive yer coach yerself for me you may ive had more nor enough of it  in a few minutes the deer and the hare were lashed to the sledgewhich the irishman asserted was a great improvement inasmuch as the carcass of the former made an excellent seatand they were off again at full gallop over the floes  they travelled without further interruption or mishap until they drew near to the open water when suddenly they came upon a deep fissure or crack in the ice about four feet wide with water in the bottom  here they came to a dead stop  arrah whats to be done now enquired oriley  indeed i dont know replied fred looking toward meetuck for advice  hup cutup ice mush hurroo said that fat individual  fortunately he followed his advice with a practical illustration of its meaning seizing an axe he ran to the nearest hummock and chopping it down rolled the heaviest pieces he could move into the chasm  the others followed his example and in the course of an hour the place was bridged across and the sledge passed over  but the dogs required a good deal of coaxing to get them to trust to this rude bridge which their sagacity taught them was not to be depended on like the works of nature  a quarter of an hours drive brought them to a place where there was another crack of little more than two feet across  meetuck stretched his neck and took a steady look at this as they approached it at full gallop  being apparently satisfied with his scrutiny he resumed his look of selfsatisfied placidity  look out meetuck pull up cried fred in some alarm but the esquimaux paid no attention  o morther were gone now for iver exclaimed oriley shutting his eyes and clenching his teeth as he laid fast hold of the sides of the sledge  the feet of the dogs went faster and faster until they pattered on the hard surface of the snow like rain  round came the long whip as oriley said like the shot of a young cannon and the next moment they were across skimming over the ice on the other side like the wind  it happened that there had been a break in the ice at this point on the previous night and the floes had been cemented by a sheet of ice only an inch thick  upon this to the consternation even of meetuck himself they now passed and in a moment ere they were aware they were passing over a smooth black surface that undulated beneath them like the waves of the sea and crackled fearfully  there was nothing for it but to go on  a moments halt would have allowed the sledge to break through and leave them struggling in the water  there was no time for remark  each man held his breath  meetuck sent the heavy lash with a tremendous crack over the backs of the whole team but just as they neared the solid floe the left runner broke through  in a moment the men flung themselves horizontally upon their breasts and scrambled over the smooth surface until they gained the white ice while the sledge and the dogs nearest to it were sinking  one vigorous pull however by dogs and men together dragged the sledge upon the solid floe even before the things in it had got wet  safe cried fred as he hauled on the sledge rope to drag it farther out of danger  so we are replied oriley breathing very hard and its meself thought to have had a wet skin at this minute  come west lind a hand to fix the dogs will ye  a few minutes sufficed to put all to rights and enable them to start afresh  being now in the neighbourhood of dangerous ice they advanced with a little more caution the possibility of seals being in the neighbourhood also rendered them more circumspect  it was well that they were on the alert for a band of seals were soon after descried in a pool of open water not far ahead and one of them was lying on the ice  there were no hummocks however in the neighbourhood to enable them to approach unseen but the esquimaux was prepared for such a contingency he had brought a small sledge of about two feet in length by a foot and a half in breadth which he now unfastened from the large sledge and proceeded quietly to arrange it to the surprise of his companions who had not the least idea what he was about to do and watched his proceedings with much interest  is it to sail on the ice yere goin boy enquired oriley at last when he saw meetuck fix a couple of poles about four feet long into a hole in the little sledge like two masts and upon these spread a piece of canvas upwards of a yard square with a small hole in the centre of it  but meetuck answered not  he fastened the canvas sail to a crossyard above and below  then placing a harpoon and coil of rope on the sledge and taking up his musket he made signs to the party to keep under the cover of a hummock and pushing the sledge before him advanced towards the seals in a stooping posture so as to be completely hid behind the bit of canvas  oh the haythen i see it now exclaimed oriley his face puckering up with fun  ah but its a cliver trick no doubt of it  what a capital dodge said fred crouching behind the hummock and watching the movements of the esquimaux with deep interest  west hand me the little telescope youll find it in the pack  here it is sir said the man pulling out a glass of about six inches long and handing it to fred  how many is there an ye plaze  six i think yesone two threei cant make them out quite but i think there are six besides the one on the ice  hist there he sees him  ah  meetuck hes too quick for you  as he spoke the seal on the ice began to show symptoms of alarm meetuck had approached to within shot but he did not fire the wary esquimaux had caught sight of another object which a lump of ice had hitherto concealed from view  this was no less a creature than a walrus who chanced at that time to come up to take a gulp of fresh air and lave his shaggy front in the brine before going down again to the depths of his ocean home  meetuck therefore allowed the seal to glide quietly into the sea and advanced towards this new object of attack at length he took a steady aim through the hole in the canvas screen and fired  instantly the seal dived and at the same time the water round the walrus was lashed into foam and tinged with red  it was evidently badly wounded for had it been only slightly hurt it would probably have dived  meetuck immediately seized his harpoon and rushed towards the struggling monster while fred grasped a gun and oriley a harpoon and ran to his assistance  west remained to keep back the dogs  as meetuck gained the edge of the ice the walrus recovered partially and tried with savage fury to reach his assailant who planted the harpoon deep in its breast and held on to the rope while the animal dived  whereabouts is he cried oriley as he came panting to the scene of action  as he spoke the walrus ascended almost under his nose with a loud bellow and the irishman started back in terror as he surveyed at close quarters for the first time the colossal and horrible countenance of this elephant of the northern sea  oriley was no coward but the suddenness of the apparition was too much for him and we need not wonder that in his haste he darted the harpoon far over the animals head into the sea beyond  neither need we feel surprised that when fred took aim at its forehead the sight of its broad muzzle fringed with bristling moustache and defended by huge tusks caused him to miss it altogether  but oriley recovered hauled his harpoon back and succeeded in planting it deep under the creatures left flipper and fred reloading lodged a ball in its head which finished it  with great labour the four men aided by the dogs drew it out upon the ice  this was a great prize for walrus flesh is not much inferior to beef and would be an acceptable addition of fresh meat for the use of the dolphins crew and there was no chance of it spoiling for the frost was now severe enough to freeze every animal solid almost immediately after it was killed  the body of this walrus was not less than eighteen feet long and eleven in circumference  it was more like an elephant in bulk and rotundity than any other creature  it partook very much of the form of a seal having two large pawlike flippers with which when struggling for life it had more than once nearly succeeded in getting upon the ice its upper face had a square bluff aspect and its broad muzzle and cheeks were completely covered by a coarse quilllike beard of bristles which gave to it a peculiarly ferocious appearance  the notion that the walrus resembles man is very much overrated  the square bluff shape of the head already referred to destroys the resemblance to humanity when distant and its colossal size does the same when near  some of the seals deserve this distinction more their drooping shoulders and oval faces being strikingly like to those of man when at a distance  the white ivory tusks of this creature were carefully measured by fred and found to be thirty inches long  the resemblance of the walrus to our domestic landanimals has obtained for it among sailors the names of the seahorse and seacow and the records of its ferocity when attacked are numerous  its hide is nearly an inch thick and is put to many useful purposes by the esquimaux who live to a great extent on the flesh of this creature  they cut up his hide into long lines to attach to the harpoons with which they catch himself the said harpoons being pointed with his own tusks  this tough hide is not the only garment the walrus wears to protect him from the cold  he also wears underflannels of thick fat and a topcoat of close hair so that he can take a siesta on an iceberg without the least inconvenience  talking of siestas by the way the walrus is sometimes caught napping  occasionally when the weather is intensely cold the hole through which he crawls upon the ice gets frozen over so solidly that on waking he finds it beyond even his enormous power to break it in this extremity there is no alternative but to go to sleep again anddie which he does as comfortably as he can  the polar bears however are quick to smell him out and assembling round his carcass for a feast they dispose of him body and bones without ceremony  as it was impossible to drag this unwieldy animal to the ship that night for the days had now shortened very considerably the hunters hauled it towards the land and having reached the secure ice prepared to encamp for the night under the lee of a small iceberg    chapter twelve  a dangerous sleep interrupteda night in a snowhut and an unpleasant visitorsnowed up  now then cried fred as they drew up on a level portion of the icefloe where the snow on its surface was so hard that the runners of the sledge scarce made an impression on it let us to work lads and get the tarpaulins spread we shall have to sleep tonight under starspangled bedcurtains  troth said oriley gazing round towards the land where the distant cliffs loomed black and heavy in the fading light and out upon the floes and hummocks where the frost smoke from pools of open water on the horizon circled round the pinnacles of the icebergstroth its a cowld place intirely to go to wans bed in but that fatfaced exqueemaw seems to be settin about it quite coolly so here goes  it would be difficult to set about it otherwise than coolly with the thermometer thirtyfive below zero remarked fred beating his hands together and stamping his feet while the breath issued from his mouth like dense clouds of steam and fringed the edges of his hood and the breast of his jumper with hoarfrost  its quite purty it is remarked oriley in reference to this wreath of hoarfrost which covered the upper parts of each of them its jist like the ermine that kings and queens wear so im towld and its chaper a long way  i dont know that said joseph west  it has cost us a rough voyage and a winter in the arctic regions if it doesnt cost us more yet to put that ermine fringe on our jumpers  i can make nothing of this knot try what you can do with it messmate will you  sorra wan o me ll try it cried oriley suddenly leaping up and swinging both arms violently against his shoulders ive got two hands i have but niver a finger on themleastwise i feel none though it is some small degrae o comfort to see them  my toes are much in the same condition said west stamping vigorously until he brought back the circulation  dance then wid me cried the irishman suiting his action to the word  ive a mortial fear o bein bit wid the frost for its no joke let me tell you  didnt i see a whole ships crew wance that wos wrecked in the gulf o saint lawrence about the beginnin o winter and before they got to a part o the coast where there was a house belongin to the furtraders ivery manjack o them was frostbit more or less they wor  wan lost a thumb and another the jint of a finger or two and most o them had two or three toes off an there wos wan poor fellow who lost the front half o wan fut an the heel o the other an two inches o the bone was stickin out  sure its truth im tellin ye for i seed it wid me own two eyes i did  the earnest tones in which the last words were spoken convinced his comrades that oriley was telling the truth so having a decided objection to be placed in similar circumstances they danced and beat each other until they were quite in a glow  why what are you at there meetuck exclaimed fred pausing  igloe make replied the esquimaux  igwhat enquired oriley  oh i see shouted fred hes going to make a snowhutigloes they call them here  capitali never thought of that  come along lets help him  meetuck was indeed about to erect one of those curious dwellings of snow in which for the greater part of the year his primitive countrymen dwell  he had no taste for starspangled bedcurtains when solid walls whiter than the purest dimity were to be had for nothing his first operation in the erection of this hut was to mark out a circle of about seven feet diameter  from the inside of this circle the snow was cut by means of a long knife in the form of slabs nearly a foot thick and from two to three feet long having a slight convexity on the outside  these slabs were then so cut and arranged that when they were piled upon each other round the margin of the circle they formed a domeshaped structure like a beehive which was six feet high inside and remarkably solid  the slabs were cemented together with loose snow and every accidental chink or crevice filled up with the same material the natives sometimes insert a block of clear ice in the roof for a window but this was dispensed with on the present occasionfirstly because there was no light to let in and secondly because if there had been they didnt want it  the building of the hut occupied only an hour for the hunters were cold and hungry and in their case the old proverb might have been paraphrased no work no supper  a hole just large enough to permit a man to creep through on his hands and knees formed the door of this beehive  attached to this hole and cemented to it was a low tunnel of about four feet in length  when finished both ends of the tunnel were closed up with slabs of hard snow which served the purpose of double doors and effectually kept out the cold  while this tunnel was approaching completion fred retired to a short distance and sat down to rest a few minutes on a block of ice  a great change had come over the scene during the time they were at work on the snowhut  the night had settled down and now the whole sky was lit up with the vivid and beautiful coruscations of the aurora borealisthat magnificent meteor of the north which in some measure makes up to the inhabitants for the absence of the sun  it spread over the whole extent of the sky in the form of an irregular arch and was intensely brilliant  but the brilliancy varied as the green ethereal fire waved mysteriously to and fro or shot up long streamers toward the zenith  these streamers or merry dancers as they are sometimes termed were at times peculiarly bright  their colour was most frequently yellowish white sometimes greenish and once or twice of a lilac tinge  the strength of the light was something greater than that of the moon in her quarter and the stars were dimmed when the aurora passed over them as if they had been covered with a delicate gauze veil  but that which struck our hero as being most remarkable was the magnitude and dazzling brightness of the host of stars that covered the black firmament  it seemed as if they were magnified in glory and twinkled so much that the sky seemed as it were to tremble with light a feeling of deep solemnity filled freds heart as he gazed upwards and as he thought upon the creator of these mysterious worldsand remembered that he came to this little planet of ours to work out the miracle of our redemption the words that he had often read in the bible lord what is man that thou art mindful of him came forcibly to his remembrance and he felt the appropriateness of that sentiment which the sweet singer of israel has expressed in the words praise ye him sun and moon praise him all ye stars of light  there was a deep solemn stillness all arounda stillness widely different from that peaceful composure which characterises a calm day in an inhabited land  it was the deathlike stillness of that most peculiar and dreary desolation which results from the total absence of animal existence  the silence was so oppressive that it was with a feeling of relief he listened to the low distant voices of the men as they paused ever and anon in their busy task to note and remark on the progress of their work  in the intense cold of an arctic night the sound of voices can be heard at a much greater distance than usual and although the men were far off and hummocks of ice intervened between them and fred their tones broke distinctly though gently on his ear yet these sounds did not interrupt the unusual stillness  they served rather to impress him more forcibly with the vastness of that tremendous solitude in the midst of which he stood  gradually his thoughts turned homeward and he thought of the dear ones who circled round his own fireside and perchance talked of him of the various companions he had left behind and the scenes of life and beauty where he used to wander but such memories led him irresistibly to the far north again for in all homescenes the figure of his father started up and he was back again in an instant searching toilsomely among the floes and icebergs of the polar seas  it was the invariable ending of poor freds meditations and however successful he might be in entering for a time into the spirit of fun that characterised most of the doings of his shipmates and in following the bent of his own joyous nature in the hours of solitude and in the dark night when no one saw him his mind ever reverted to the one engrossing subject like the oscillating needle to the pole  as he continued to gaze up long and earnestly into the starry sky his thoughts began to wander over the past and the present at random and a cold shudder warned him that it was time to return to the hut but the wandering thoughts and fancies seemed to chain him to the spot so that he could not tear himself away  then a dreamy feeling of rest and comfort began to steal over his senses and he thought how pleasant it would be to lie down and slumber but he knew that would be dangerous so he determined not to do it  suddenly he felt himself touched and heard a voice whispering in his ear  then it sounded loud  hallo sir  mr ellice  wake up sir dye hear me and he felt himself shaken so violently that his teeth rattled together  opening his eyes reluctantly he found that he was stretched at full length on the snow and joseph west was shaking him by the shoulder as if he meant to dislocate his arm  hallo west is that you  let me alone man i want to sleep  fred sank down again instantlythat deadly sleep produced by cold and from which those who indulge in it never awaken was upon him  sleep cried west frantically youll die sir if you dont rouse up  hallo  meetuck  oriley help here  i tell you murmured fred faintly i want to sleeponly a moment or twoah  i see is the hut finished  well well go leave me  ill followina  his voice died away again just as meetuck and oriley came running up the instant the former saw how matters stood he raised fred in his powerful arms set him on his feet and shook him with such vigour that it seemed as if every bone in his body must be forced out of joint  what mane ye by that ye blubberbag cried the irishman wrathfully doubling his mittened fists and advancing in a threatening manner towards the esquimaux but seeing that the savage paid not the least attention to him and kept on shaking fred violently with a goodhumoured smile on his countenance he wisely desisted from interfering  in a few minutes fred was able to stand and look about him with a stupid expression and immediately the esquimaux dragged and pushed and shook him along towards the snowhut into which he was finally thrust though with some trouble in consequence of the lowness of the tunnel  here by means of rubbing and chafing with a little more buffeting he was restored to some degree of heat on seeing which meetuck uttered a quiet grunt and immediately set about preparing supper  i do believe ive been asleep said fred rising and stretching himself vigorously as the bright flame of a tin lamp shot forth and shed a yellow lustre on the white walls  aslape is it be me conscience an ye have just  oh then may i never indulge in the same sort o slumber  why so asked fred in some surprise  you fell asleep on the ice sir answered west while he busied himself in spreading the tarpaulin and blanketbags on the floor of the hut and you were very near frozen to death  frozen musha  im not too shure that hes melted yit said oriley taking him by the arm and looking at him dubiously  fred laughed  oh yes im melted now  but lets have supper else i shall faint for hunger  did i sleep many hours  you slept only five minutes said west in some surprise at the question  you were only gone about ten minutes altogether  this was indeed the case  the intense desire for sleep which is produced in arctic countries when the frost seizes hold of the frame soon confuses the faculties of those who come under its influence  as long as fred had continued to walk and work he felt quite warm but the instant he sat down on the lump of ice to rest the frost acted on him being much exhausted too by labour and long fasting he was more susceptible than he would otherwise have been to the influence of cold so that it chilled him at once and produced that deadly lethargy from which but for the timely aid of his companions he would never have recovered  the arrangements for supping and spending the night made rapid progress and under the influence of fire and animal heatfor the dogs were taken in beside themthe igloe became comfortably warm yet the snowwalls did not melt or become moist the intense cold without being sufficient to counteract and protect them from the heat within  the fair roof however soon became very dingy and the odour of melted fat rather powerful  but arctic travellers are proof against such trifles  the tarpaulin was spread over the floor and a tin lamp into which several fat portions of the walrus were put was suspended from a stick thrust into the wall  round this lamp the hunters circled each seated on his blanketbag and each attended to the duty which devolved upon him  meetuck held a tin kettle over the flame till the snow with which it was filled melted and became cold water and then gradually heated until it boiled and all the while he employed himself in masticating a lump of raw walrus flesh much to the amusement of fred and to the disgust real or pretended of oriley  but the irishman and fred too and every man on board the dolphin came at last to relish raw meat and to long for it  the esquimaux prefer it raw in these parts of the world although some travellers assert that in more southern latitudes they prefer cooked meat and with good reason for it is much more nourishing than cooked flesh and learned scientific men who have wintered in the arctic regions have distinctly stated that in those cold countries they found raw meat to be better for them than cooked meat and they assure us that they at last came to prefer it  we would not have our readers to begin forthwith to dispense with the art of cookery and cast soyer to the dogs but we would have them henceforth refuse to accept that common opinion and vulgar error that esquimaux eat their food raw because they are savages  they do it because nature teaches them that under the circumstances it is best  the duty that devolved upon oriley was to roast small steaks of the walrus in which operation he was assisted by west while fred undertook to get out the biscuitbag and pewter plates and to infuse the coffee when the water should boil  it was a strange feast in a strange place but it proved to be a delightful one for hunger requires not to be tempted and is not fastidious  oh but its good isnt it remarked oriley smacking his lips as he swallowed a savoury morsel of the walrus and tossed the remnanta sinewy bitto dumps who sat gazing sulkily at the flame of the lamp having gorged himself long before the bipeds began supper  arrah ye wont take it wont ye  here poker  poker sprang forward wagging the stump of his tail and turned his head to one side as if to say well whats up  any fun going  here take that old boy dumps is sulky  poker took it at once and a single snap caused it to vanish  he too had finished supper and evidently ate the morsel to please the irishman  hand me the coffee meetuck said fred  the biscuit lies beside you dont give in so soon man  thank you sir i have about done  meetuck ye haythen try a bit o the roast do now av it was only to plaaze me  meetuck shook his head quietly and cutting a fifteenth lump off the mass of raw walrus that lay beside him proceeded leisurely to devour it  the dogs is nothin to him muttered oriley  isnt it a curious thing now to think that were all at sea a eatin and drinkin and slaapinor goin to slaapejist as if we wor on the land and the great ocean away down below us there wid whales and seals and walrusses and mermaids for what i know a swimmin about jist under whare we sit and maybe lookin through the ice at us this very minute isnt it quare  it is odd said fred laughing and not a very pleasant idea however as there is at least twelve feet of solid ice between us and the company you mention we dont need to care much  ov coorse not replied oriley nodding his head approvingly as he lighted his pipe thats my mind intirely in all cases o danger when ye dont need to be afeared ye neednt much care  its a good chart to steer by that same  this last remark seemed to afford so much food for thought to the company that nothing further was said by anyone until fred rose and proposed to turn in  west had already crawled into his blanketbag and was stretched out like a mummy on the floor and the sound of meetucks jaws still continued as he winked sleepily over the walrus meat when a scraping was heard outside the hut  sure its the foxes ill go and look whispered oriley laying down his pipe and creeping to the mouth of the tunnel  he came back however faster than he went with a look of consternation for the first object that confronted him on looking out was the enormous head of a polar bear  to glance round for their firearms was the first impulse but these had unfortunately been left on the sledge outside  what was to be done  they had nothing but their claspknives in the igloe  in this extremity meetuck cut a large hole in the back of the hut intending to creep out and procure one of the muskets but the instant the opening was made the bears head filled it up  with a savage yell oriley seized the lamp and dashed the flaming fat in the creatures face  it was a reckless deed for it left them all in the dark but the bear seemed to think himself insulted for he instantly retreated and when meetuck emerged and laid hold of a gun he had disappeared  they found on issuing into the open air that a stiff breeze was blowing which from the threatening appearance of the sky promised to become a gale but as there was no apprehension to be entertained in regard to the stability of the floe they returned to the hut taking care to carry in their arms along with them  having patched up the hole closed the doors rekindled the lamp and crept into their respective bags they went to sleep for however much they might dread the return of bruin slumber was a necessity of nature that would not be denied  meanwhile the gale freshened into a hurricane and was accompanied with heavy snow and when they attempted to move next morning they found it impossible to face it for a single moment  there was no alternative therefore but to await the termination of the gale which lasted two days and kept them close prisoners all the time  it was very wearisome doubtless but they had to submit and sought to console themselves and pass the time as pleasantly as possible by sleeping and eating and drinking coffee    chapter thirteen  journey resumedthe hunters meet with bears and have a great fight in which the dogs are sufferersa bears dinnermode in which arctic rocks travelthe icebelt  in the abating of the great storm referred to in the last chapter the hunters sought to free themselves from their snowy prison and succeeded in burrowing so to speak upwards after severe labour for the hut was buried in drift which the violence of the gale had rendered extremely compact  oriley was the first to emerge into the upper world  having dusted the snow from his garments and shaken himself like a newfoundland dog he made sundry wry faces and gazed round him with the look of a man that did not know very well what to do with himself  its a quare place it is intirely he remarked with a shake of the head that betokened intense sagacity while he seated himself on a mound of snow and watched his comrades as they busied themselves in dragging their sleepingbags and cooking utensils from the cavern they had just quitted  oriley seemed to be in a contemplative mood for he did not venture any further remark although he looked unutterable things as he proceeded quietly to fill his little black pipe  ho oriley lend a hand you lazy fellow cried fred work first and play afterwards you skulker  sure that same is what im doin replied oriley with a bland smile which he eclipsed in a cloud of smoke  havent i bin workin like a naagur for two hours to git out of that hole and aint i playin a tune on me pipe now  but i wont be crossgrained  ill lind ye a hand av ye behave yerself  its a bad thing to be crossgrained he continued pocketing his pipe and assisting to arrange the sledge me owld grandmother always towld me that and she was wise she wos beyand ordnr  more like salomon nor anything else  she must have directed that remark specially to you i think said fredlet dumps lead west hes tougher than the othersdid she not oriley  be no manes  it wos to the pig she said it  most of her conversation and she had a power of it wos wid the pig and manys the word o good advice she gave it as it sat in its usual place beside the fire forenint her but it was all thrown away it wos for there wosnt another pig in all the length o ireland as had sich a will o its own and it had a screech too when it wasnt plaazed as bate all the steam whistles in the world it did  ive often moralated on that same and ive noticed that as it is wid pigs so it is wid men and womensome of them at lastethe more advice ye give them the less they take  down poker quiet good dog said west as he endeavoured to restrain the ardour of the team which being fresh and full fed could scarcely be held in by the united efforts of himself and meetuck while their companions lashed their provisions etcetera on the sledge  hold on lads cried fred as he fastened the last lashing  well be ready in a second  now then jump on two of you  catch hold of the tailline meetuck  all right  hall right yelled the esquimaux as he let go the dogs and sprang upon the sledge  the team struggled and strained violently for a few seconds in their efforts to overcome the vis inertiae of the sledge and it seemed as if the traces would part but they were made of tough walrus hide and held on bravely while the heavy vehicle gradually fetched way and at length flew over the floes at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour travelling however was not now quite as agreeable as it had been when they set out from the ship for the floes were swept bare in some places by the gale while in other places large drifts had collected so that the sledge was either swaying to and fro on the smooth ice and swinging the dogs almost off their feet or it was plunging heavily through banks of soft snow  as the wind was still blowing fresh and would have been dead against them had they attempted to return by a direct route to the ship they made for the shore intending to avail themselves of the shelter afforded by the icebelt  meanwhile the carcass of the walrus at least as much of it as could not be packed on the sledge was buried in the hut and a spear planted above it to mark the spot  hah an its cowld said oriley wrapping himself more closely in his fur jumper as they sped along  i wish we wos out o the wind i do  youll have your wish soon then answered west for that row of icebergs were coming to will shelter us nearly all the way to the land  surely you are taking us too much off to the right meetuck said fred we are getting farther away from the ship  no fee  be win too trong  we turn hup long shore very quick soonha  meetuck accompanied each word with a violent nod of his head at the same time opening and shutting his mouth and winking with both eyes being apparently impressed with the conviction that such contortions of visage rendered his meaning more apparent  look look ho  nannook nannook  a bear a bear whispered the esquimaux with sudden animation just as they gained the lee of the first iceberg  the words were unnecessary however for the whole party were looking ahead with the most intense eagerness at a bear which their sudden advent had aroused from a nap in the crevice of the iceberg  a little cub was discerned a moment after standing by her side and gazing at the intruders with infantine astonishment  while the muskets were being loosened and drawn out meetuck let slip all the dogs and in a few seconds they were engaged in active warfare with the enemy  oh musha  dumps is gone intirely  the quadruped referred to was tossed to a height of about thirty feet and alighted senseless upon the ice  the bear seized him with her teeth and tossed him with an incredibly slight effort  the other dogs nothing daunted by the fate of their comrade attacked the couple in the rear biting their heels and so distracting their attention that they could not make an energetic attack in any direction  another of the dogs however a young one waxing reckless ventured too near the old bear and was seized by the back and hurled high into the air through which it wriggled violently and descended with a sounding whack upon the ice  at the same moment a volley from the hunters sent several balls into the carcass of both mother and cub but although badly wounded neither of them evinced any sign of pain and exhaustion as they continued to battle with the remaining dogs  the dogs that had already fallen in the fray had not been used to bearhuntinghence their signal defeat but this was not the case with the others all of which were old campaigners and poker especially although not old in years was a practical fighter having been trained not to attack but to harass  the systematic and steady way in which they advanced before the bear and retired right and left leading her into a profitless pursuit was very interesting to witness  another volley from the hunters caused them to make off more rapidly and wounded the cub severely so much so that in a few minutes it began to flag  seeing this the mother placed it in front of her and urged it forward with her snout so quickly that it was with the utmost difficulty the men could keep up with them  a welldirected shot however from fred ellice brought the old bear to the ground but she rose instantly and again advanced pushing her cub before her while the dogs continued to embarrass her  they now began to fear that in spite of dogs and men the wounded bears would escape when an opportune crack in the ice presented itself into which they both tumbled followed by the yelping and we may add limping dogs  before they could scramble up on the other side meetuck and fred being light of foot gained upon them sufficiently to make sure shots  there they go cried fred as the shebear bounced out of the crack with poker hanging to her heels  pokers audacity had at last outstripped his sagacity and the next moment he was performing a tremendous somersault  before he reached the ice meetuck and fred fired simultaneously and when the smoke cleared away the old bear was stretched out in death  hitherto the cub had acted exclusively on the defensive and entrusted itself entirely to the protection of its dam but now it seemed to change its character entirely  it sprang upon its mothers body and assuming an attitude of extreme ferocity kept the dogs at bay snapping and snarling right and left until the hunters came up  for the first time since the chase began a feeling of intense pity touched freds heart and he would have rejoiced at that moment had the mother risen up and made her escape with her cub  he steeled his heart however by reflecting that fresh provisions were much wanted on board the dolphin still neither he nor his shipmates could bring themselves to shoot the gallant little animal and it is possible that they might have made up their minds to allow it to escape after all had not meetuck quietly ended their difficulty by putting a ball through its heart  ah then meetuck said oriley shaking his head as they examined their prize yere a hardhearted spalpeen ye are to kill a poor little baby like that in cowld blood  well its yer natur an yer trade so i spose its all right  the weight of this bear which was not of the largest size was afterwards found to be above five hundred pounds and her length was eight feet nine inches  the cub weighed upwards of a hundred pounds and was larger than a newfoundland dog  the operation of cutting out the entrails preparatory to packing on the sledge was now commenced by meetuck whose practised hand applied the knife with the skill though not with the delicacy of a surgeon  she has been a hungry bear it seems remarked fred as he watched the progress of the work if we may judge from the emptiness of her stomach  och but shes had a choice morsel if it was a small wan exclaimed oriley in surprise as he picked up a plug of tobacco  on further examination being made it was found that this bear had dined on raisins tobacco pork and adhesive plaster  such an extraordinary mixture of articles of course led the party to conclude that either she had helped herself to the stores of the dolphin placed on store island or that she had fallen in with those of some other vessel  this subject afforded food for thought and conversation during the next hour or two as they drove towards the ship along the icebelt of the shore  the icebelt referred to is a zone of ice which extends along the shore from the unknown regions of the north  to the south it breaks up in summer and disappears altogether but in the latitude which our travellers had now reached it was a permanent feature of the scenery all the year round following the curvatures and indentations of bays and rivers and increasing in winter or diminishing in summer but never melting entirely away  the surface of this icebelt was covered with immense masses of rock many tons in weight which had fallen from the cliffs above  pointing to one of these as they drove along west remarked to fred  there is a mystery explained sir i have often wondered how huge solitary stones that no machinery of mans making could lift have come to be placed on sandy shores where there were no other rocks of any kind within many miles of them  the ice must have done it i see  true west the ice if it could speak would explain many things that now seem to us mysterious and yonder goes a big rock on a journey that may perhaps terminate at a thousand miles to the south of this  the rock referred to was a large mass that became detached from the cliffs and fell as he spoke with a tremendous crash upon the icebelt along which it rolled for fifty yards  there it would lie all winter and in spring the mass of ice to which it was attached would probably break off and float away with it to the south gradually melting until it allowed the rock to sink to the bottom of the sea or depositing it perchance on some distant shore where such rocks are not wont to lie there to remain an object of speculation and wonderment to the unlearned of all future ages  some of the bergs close to which they passed on the journey were very fantastically formed and many of them were more than a mile long with clear blue glassy surfaces indicating that they had been but recently thrown off from the great glacier of the north  between two of these they drove for some time before they found that they were going into a sort of blind alley  sure the roads gittin narrower observed oriley as he glanced up at the blue walls which rose perpendicularly to a height of sixty feet on either hand  have a care meetuck or yell jam us up ye will  tis a pity we left the icebelt remarked fred for this rough work among the bergs is bad for man and dog  how say you meetuck shall we take to it again when we get through this place  faix then well niver git through said oriley pointing to the end of the chasm where a third iceberg had entirely closed the opening  the esquimaux pulled up and after advancing on foot a short way to examine returned with a rueful expression on his countenance  ha no passage i suppose said fred  bad luck to ye cried oriley wont ye spaake  no rodmuss go back replied meetuck turning the dogs in the direction whence they had come and resuming his place on the sledge  the party had to retrace their steps half a mile in consequence of this unfortunate interruption and return to the level track of the icebelt which they had left for a time and taken to the seaice in order to avoid the sinuosities of the land  to add to their misfortunes the dogs began to flag so that they were obliged to walk behind the sledge at a slow pace and snow began to fall heavily  but they pressed forward manfully and having regained the shoreice continued to make their way northward towards the ship which was now spoken of by the endearing name of home    chapter fourteen  departure of the suneffects of darkness on dogswinter arrangements in the interior of the dolphin  it is sad to part with an old friend especially if he be one of the oldest and best friends we ever had  when the day of departure arrives it is of no avail that he tells us kindly he will come back again  that assurance is indeed a comfort after he is gone and a sweet star of hope that shines brighter and brighter each day until he comes back but it is poor consolation to us at the time of parting when we are squeezing his hand for the last time and trying to crush back the drops that will overflow  the crew of the dolphin had in the course of that winter to part with one of their best friends one whom they regarded with the most devoted attachment one who was not expected to return again till the following spring and one therefore whom some of them might perhaps never see again  mivins became quite lowspirited about it and said as ow ed ave a eavy eart for hever and hever hamen after he was gone  oriley remarked in reference to his departure that every man in the ship was about to lose a son  yes indeed he did he perpetrated that atrocious pun and wasnt a bit ashamed of it  oriley had perpetrated many a worse pun than that before its to be hoped that for the credit of his country he has perpetrated a few better ones since  yes the period at length arrived when the great source of light and heat was about to withdraw his face from these arctic navigators for a long long time and leave them in unvarying night  it was a good while however before he went away altogether and for many weeks after winter set in in all its intensity he paid them a daily visit which grew gradually shorter and shorter until that sad evening in which he finally bade them farewell  about the middle of october the dark months overspread the bay of mercy and the reign of perpetual night began  there was something terribly depressing at first in this uninterrupted gloom and for some time after the sun ceased to show his disc above the horizon the men of the dolphin used to come on deck at noon and look out for the faint streak of light that indicated the presence of the lifegiving luminary with all the earnestness and longing of eastern fireworshippers  the dogs too became sensibly affected by the continued absence of light and seemed to draw more sympathetically than ever to their human companions in banishment  a curious and touching instance of this feeling was exhibited when the pack were sent to sleep on store island a warm kennel had been erected for them there partly in order that the ship might be kept more thoroughly clean and partly that the dogs might act as a guard over the stores in case bears or wolves should take a fancy to examine them  but nothing would induce the poor animals to keep away from the ship and remain beyond the sound of human voices they deserted their comfortable abode with one consent the first time they were sent to it preferring to spend the night by the side of the ship upon the bare snow  coaxing them was of no use  oriley tried it in vain  at then said he to dumps with a wheedling air and expression of intense affection that would have taken by storm the heart of any civilised dog wont ye come now an lay in yar own kennel  sure its a beautiful wan an as warm as the heart of an iceberg  doo come now avic an ill show ye the way  but dumpss heart was marble  he wouldnt budge  by means of a piece of walrus however he was at length induced to go with the irishman to the kennel and was followed by the entire pack  here oriley endeavoured to make them comfortable and prevailed on them to lie down and go to sleep but whenever he attempted to leave them they were up and at his heels in a moment  och but yere too fond o me entirely  doo lie down agin and ill sing ye a ditty  true to his word oriley sat down by the dogkennel and gave vent to a howl which his owld grandmother he said used to sing to the pig and whether it was the effects of this lullaby or of the cold it is impossible to say but oriley at length succeeded in slipping away and regaining the ship unobserved by his canine friends  half an hour later he went on deck to take a mouthful of fresh air before supper and on looking over the side he saw the whole pack of dogs lying in a circle close to the ship with dumps comfortably asleep in the middle and using pokers back for a pillow  faix but ye must be fond of the cowld to lie there all night when yeve got a palace on store island  fond of society rather observed captain guy who came on deck at the moment the poor creatures cannot bear to be left alone  it is a strange quality in dogs which i have often observed before  have ye capting  sure i thought it was all owin to the bad manners o that baste dumps which is for iver leadin the other dogs into mischief  suppers ready sir said mivins coming up the hatchway and touching his cap  look here mivins said oriley as the captain went below can ye point out the mornin star to me lad  the morning star said mivins slowly as he thrust his hands into the breast of his jumper and gazed upwards into the dark sky where the starry host blazed in arctic majesty  no of course i cant  why dont you know that there haint no morning star when its night all round  faix yere right  i niver thought o that  mivins was evidently a little puffed up with a feeling of satisfaction at the clever way in which he had got out of the difficulty without displaying his ignorance of astronomy and was even venturing in the pride of his heart to make some speculative and startling assertions in regard to the eavenly bodies generally when buzzby put his head up the hatchway  hallo messmates wots ado now  heres the supper awaitin and the tea bilin like blazes  mivins instantly dived down below as the sailors express it and we may remark in passing that the expression in this particular case was not inappropriate for mivins as we have elsewhere said was remarkably agile and supple and gave beholders a sort of impression that he went headforemost at everything  oriley followed at a more reasonable rate and in a few minutes the crew of the dolphin were seated at supper in the cabin eating with as much zest and laughing and chatting as blithely as if they were floating calmly on their ocean home in temperate climes  sailors are proverbially lighthearted and in their moments of comfort and social enjoyment they easily forget their troubles  the depression of spirits that followed the first disappearance of the sun soon wore off and they went about their various avocations cheerfully by the light of the aurora borealis and the stars  the cabin in which they now all lived together had undergone considerable alterations  after the return of fred ellice and the huntingparty whom we left on the icebelt in the last chapter the bulkhead or partition which separated the cabin from the hold had been taken down and the whole was thrown into one large apartment in order to secure a freer circulation of air and warmth  all round the walls inside of this apartment moss was piled to the depth of twelve inches to exclude the cold and this object was further gained by the spreading of a layer of moss on the deck above  the cabin hatchway was closed and the only entrance was at the farther end through the hold by means of a small doorway in the bulkhead to which was attached a sort of porch with a curtain of deerskins hung in front of it  in the centre of the floor stood an iron cookingstove which served at once the purpose of preparing food and warming the cabin which was lighted by several small oillamps  these were kept burning perpetually for there was no distinction between day and night in midwinter either in the cabin or outofdoors  in this snuglooking place the officers and men of the ship messed and dwelt and slept together but notwithstanding the apparent snugness it was with the greatest difficulty they could keep themselves in a sufficient degree of warmth to maintain health and comfort  whenever the fire was allowed to get low the beams overhead became coated with hoarfrost and even when the temperature was raised to the utmost possible pitch it was cold enough at the extreme ends of the apartment to freeze a jug of water solid  a large table occupied the upper end of the cabin between the stove and the stern and round this the officers and crew were seated when oriley entered and took his place among them  each individual had his appointed place at the messtable and with unvarying regularity these places were filled at the appointed hours  the dogs seem to be disobedient remarked amos parr as his comrade sat down theyd be the better of a taste o meetucks cat i think  its truth yere sayin replied oriley commencing a violent assault on a walrus steak they dont obey orders at all at all  an dumps the blaggard is as crossgrained as me grandmothers owld pig  a general laugh here interrupted the speaker for oriley could seldom institute a disparaging comparison without making emphatic allusion to the pig that once shared with him the hospitalities of his grandmothers cabin  why everything you speak of seems to be like that wonderful pig messmate said peter grim  yere wrong there intirely retorted oriley  i niver seed nothing like it in all me thravels except yerself and that only in regard to its muzzle which was black and all kivered over with bristles it wos ill throuble for another steak messmate that walrus is great livin we owe ye thanks for killin it mister ellice  youre fishing for compliments but im afraid i have none to give you your first harpoon you know was a little wide of the mark if i recollect right wasnt it  yis it wosabout as wide as the first bullet  i misremember exactly who fired it wos it you meetuck  meetuck being deeply engaged with a junk of fat meat at that moment expressed all he had to say in a convulsive gasp without interrupting his supper  try a bit of the bear said fred to tom singleton its better than the walrus to my taste  id rather not answered tom with a dubious shake of the head  its a most unconscionable thing to eat a beast o that sort remarked saunders gravely  especially one who has been in the habit of living on raisins and stickingplaster said bolton with a grin  i have been thinking about that said captain guy who had been for some time listening in silence to the conversation and i cannot help thinking that esquimaux must have found a wreck somewhere in this neighbourhood and carried away her stores which bruin had managed to steal from them  may they not have got some of the stores of the brig we saw nipped some months ago suggested singleton  possibly they may  i dinna think thats likely said saunders shaking his head  yon brig had been deserted long ago and her stores must have been consumed if they were taken out of her at all before we thought o comin here  for some time the party in the cabin ate in silence  we must wait patiently resumed the captain as if he were tired of following up a fruitless train of thought  what of your theatricals fred we must get them set agoing as soon as possible  the captain spoke animatedly for he felt that with the prospect of a long dark winter before them it was of the greatest importance that the spirits of the men should be kept up  i find it difficult to beat up recruits answered fred laughing peter grim has flatly refused to act and oriley says he could no more learn a part off by heart than  his grandmothers pig could interrupted david mizzle who having concluded supper now felt himself free to indulge in conversation  och ye spalpeen whispered the irishman  i have written out the half of a play which i hope to produce in a few days on the boards of our arctic theatre with a talented company but i must have one or two more menone to act the part of a lady  will you take that part buzzby  wot me cried the individual referred to with a stare of amazement  oh yes do buzzby cried several of the men with great delight youre just cut out for it  blue eyes said one  fair hair cried another  and plump said a third  wid cheeks like the hide of a walrus cried oriley but sure it wont show wid a veil on  come now you wont refuse  but buzzby did refuse not however so determinedly but that he was induced at last to allow his name to be entered in freds notebook as a supernumerary  hark cried the captain surely the dogs must have smelt a bear  there was instantly a dead silence in the cabin and a long loud wail from the dogs was heard outside  its not like their usual cry when game is near said the second mate  hand me my rifle mivins said the captain springing up and pulling forward the hood of his jumper as he hurried on deck followed by the crew  it was a bright still frosty night and the air felt intensely sharp as if needles were pricking the skin while the mens breath issued from their lips in white clouds and settled in hoarfrost on the edges of their hoods  the dogs were seen galloping about the ice hummocks as if in agitation darting off to a considerable distance at times and returning with low whines to the ship  it is very strange remarked the captain  jump down on the ice boys and search for footprints  extend as far as store island and see that all is right there  in a few seconds the men scattered themselves right and left and were lost in the gloom while the vessel was left in charge of mivins and four men  a strict search was made in all directions but no traces of animals could be found the stores on the island were found undisturbed and gradually the dogs ceased their agitated gyrations and seemed inclined to resume their slumbers on the ice  seeing this and supposing that they were merely restless captain guy recalled his men and not long after every man in the cabin of the dolphin was buried in profound slumber    chapter fifteen  strangers appear on the scenethe esquimaux are hospitably entertained by the sailorsa spirited trafficthieving propensities and summary justice  dumps sat on the top of a hummock about quarter of a mile from the ship with an expression of subdued melancholy on his countenance and thinking evidently about nothing at all  poker sat in front of him gazing earnestly and solemnly right into his eyes with a look that said as plain as if he had spoken what a tremendously stupid old fellow you are to be sure  having sat thus for full five minutes dumps wagged his tail  poker observing the action returned the compliment with his stump  then poker sprang up and barked savagely as much as to say play wont you but dumps wouldnt so poker endeavoured to relieve his mind by gambolling violently round him  we would not have drawn your attention reader to the antics of our canine friends were it not for the fact that these antics attracted the notice of a personage who merits particular description  this was no other than one of the esquimaux inhabitants of the landa woman and such a woman  most people would have pronounced her a man for she wore precisely the same dressfur jumper and long bootsthat was worn by the men of the dolphin  her lips were thick and her nose was blunt she wore her hair turned up and twisted into a knot on the top of her head her hood was thrown back and inside of this hood there was a babya small and a very fat baby  it was so to speak a conglomerate of dumplings  its cheeks were two dumplings and its arms were four dumplingsone above each elbow and one below  its hands also were two smaller dumplings with ten extremely little dumplings at the end of them  this baby had a nose of course but it was so small that it might as well have had none and it had a mouth too but that was so capacious that the half of it would have been more than enough for a baby double the size  as for its eyes they were large and blackblack as two coalsand devoid of all expression save that of astonishment  such were the pair that stood on the edge of the icebelt gazing down upon dumps and poker  and no sooner did dumps and poker catch sight of them than they sprang hastily towards them wagging their tailsor more correctly speaking their tail and a quarter  but on a nearer approach those sagacious animals discovered that the woman and her child were strangers whereupon they set up a dismal howl and fled towards the ship as fast as they could run  now it so happened that at this very time the howl of the dogs fell upon the ears of two separate parties of travellersthe one was a band of esquimaux who were moving about in search of seals and walrus to which band this woman and her baby belonged the other was a party of men under command of buzzby who were returning to the ship after an unsuccessful hunt  neither party saw the other for one approached from the east the other from the west and the icebelt on the point of which the woman stood rose up between them  hallo whats yon exclaimed peter grim who was first to observe the woman  dunno said buzzby halting it looks like a bear  faix an it is then its got a young wan on its back cried oriley  we had better advance and find out remarked west as he led the way while several of the men threw up their arms in token of their friendly intentions  oriley capered somewhat extravagantly as he drew near partly with the intention of expressing his feelings of goodwill towards the unknown and partly in order to relieve the excitement caused by the unexpected apparition  these demonstrations however had the effect of terrifying the woman who wheeled suddenly round and made off  och it is a man  hooray boys give chase  men dont usually carry babies on their backs and tie their hair up into topknots remarked grim as he darted past in pursuit  a few seconds sufficed to enable grim to overtake the woman who fell on her knees the instant she felt the sailors heavy hand on her shoulder  dont be afeard we wont hurt ye said buzzby in a soothing tone patting the woman on the head and raising her up  no avic wes yer frinds well not harm a hair o yer beautiful head we wont  ah then its a swate child it is bless its fat face said oriley stroking the babys head tenderly with his big hand  it was with difficulty that the poor creatures fears were calmed at first but the genuine tenderness displayed by the men towards the baby and the perfect complacency with which that conglomerate of dumplings received their caresses soon relieved her mind and she began to regard her captors with much curiosity while they endeavoured by signs and words to converse with her  unfortunately meetuck was not with the party he having been left on board ship to assist in a general cleaning of the cabin that had been instituted that day  sure now ye dont know how to talk with a girl at all ye dont let me try cried oriley after several of the party had made numerous ineffectual attempts to convey their meaning  listen to me darlint and dont mind them stupid grampusses  where have ye comed from now tell me dear doo now  oriley accompanied the question with a smile of ineffable sweetness and a great deal of energetic pantomime which doubtless explained much of his meaning to himself but certainly to no one else  ah then ye dont onderstand me  well well now isnt that strange look you avic have ye seen a brig or a brigs crew anywhere betune this and the north poletry now an remimber  he illustrated this question by holding up both arms straight above his head to represent the masts of a brig and sticking his right leg straight out in front of him to represent the bowsprit but the woman gazed at him with an air of obtuse gravity that might have damped the hopes even of an irishman oriley prided himself however on not being easily beat and despite his repeated failure and the laughter of his messmates was proceeding to make a third effort when a loud shout from the cliffs caused the whole party to start and turn their eyes in that direction  the cry had been uttered by a figure whose costume bore so close a resemblance to that which they themselves wore that they thought for a moment it was one of their own shipmates but a second glance proved that they were mistaken for the individual in question carried a spear which he brandished with exceedingly fierce and warlike intentions  faix it must be her husband said oriley  hallo lads theres more on em cried grim as ten or twelve esquimaux emerged from the rents and caverns of the icebelt and scrambling to the top of surrounding hummocks and eminences gazed towards the party of white men while they threw about their arms and legs and accompanied their uncouth and violent gesticulations with loud excited cries  ive a notion he added that it was the scent o them chaps set the dogs off after yon strange fashion tother night  it was evident that the esquimaux were not only filled with unbounded astonishment at this unexpected meeting with strangers but were also greatly alarmed to see one of their own women in their power  lets send the woman over to them suggested one of the men  no no keep her as a hostage said another  look out lads cried buzzby hastily examining the priming of his musket as additional numbers of the wild inhabitants of the north appeared on the scene and crowned the icebelt and the hummocks around them  lets show a bold front  draw up in single line and hold on to the woman  west put her in front  the men instantly drew up in battle array and threw forward their muskets but as there was only a dozen of them they presented a very insignificant group compared with the crowds of esquimaux who appeared on the ice in front of them  now then stand fast men and ill show ye wots the way to manage them chaps  keep yer weathereyes open and dont let them git in rear o ye  so saying buzzby took the woman by the arm and led her out a few yards in front of his party while the esquimaux drew closer together to prepare either to receive or make an attack as the case might be  he then laid his musket down on the ice and still holding the woman by the arm advanced boldly towards the natives unarmed  on approaching to within about twenty yards of them he halted and raised both arms above his head as a sign of friendship  the signal was instantly understood and one big fellow leaped boldly from his elevated position on a lump of ice threw down his spear and ran to meet the stranger  in a few minutes buzzby and the esquimaux leader came to a mutual understanding as to the friendly disposition of their respective parties and the woman was delivered up to this big fellow who turned out to be her husband after all as oriley had correctly guessed  the other esquimaux seeing the amicable terms on which the leaders met crowded in and surrounded them  leave the half o ye to guard the arms and come on the rest of ye without em shouted buzzby  the men obeyed and in a few minutes the two parties mingled together with the utmost confidence  the sailors however deemed it prudent to get possession of their arms again as soon as possible and after explaining as well as they could by signs that their home was only at a short distance the whole band started off for the ship  the natives were in a most uproarious state of hilarity and danced and yelled as they ambled along in their hairy dresses evidently filled with delight at the prospect of forming a friendship with the white strangers as they afterwards termed the crew of the dolphin although some of the said crew were from exposure only a few shades lighter than themselves  captain guy was busily engaged with fred ellice and tom singleton in measuring and registering the state of the tide when this riotous band turned the point of the icebelt to the northward and came suddenly into view  jump down below fred and fetch my rifle and sword there are the natives cried the captain seizing his telescope  call all hands mivins and let them arm look alive  all ands ahoy shouted the steward looking down the hatchway tumble up there tumble up ere come the heskimows  bring your harms with ye  look alive  ay ay shouted the men from below and in a few minutes they crowded up the hatchway pulling up their hoods and hauling on their mittens for it was intensely cold  why captain there are some of our men with them exclaimed tom singleton as he looked through his pocketglass at them  so there arei see buzzby and grim come thats fortunate for they must have made friends with them which it is not always easy to do hide your muskets men but keep on your cutlasses its as well to be prepared though i dont expect to find those people troublesome  is the soup in the coppers david mizzle  yes sir it is  then put in an extra junk of pork and fill it up to the brim  while the cook went below to obey this order the captain and half of the crew descended to the ice and advanced unarmed to meet the natives the remainder of the men stayed behind to guard the ship and be ready to afford succour if need be but the precaution was unnecessary for the esquimaux met the sailors in the most frank and confiding manner and seemed quite to understand captain guy when he drew a line round the ship and stationed sentries along it to prevent them from crossing the natives had their dogs and sledges with them and the former they picketed to the ice while a few of their number and the woman whose name was aninga were taken on board and hospitably entertained  it was exceedingly interesting and amusing to observe the feelings of amazement and delight expressed by those barbarous but goodhumoured and intelligent people at everything they saw  while food was preparing for them they were taken round the ship on deck and below and the sailors explained in pantomime the uses of everything  they laughed and exclaimed and shouted and even roared with delight and touched everything with their fingers just as monkeys are wont to do when let loose  captain guy took aninga and her tall husband awatok to the cabin where through the medium of meetuck he explained the object of their expedition and questioned the chief as to his knowledge of the country  unfortunately awatok and his band had travelled from the interior to the coast and never having been more than twenty or thirty miles to the north of the bay of mercy could give no information either in regard to the formation of the coast or the possibility of europeans having wintered there  in fact neither he nor his countrymen had ever seen europeans before and they were so much excited that it was difficult to obtain coherent answers to questions  the captain therefore postponed further enquiries until they had become somewhat accustomed to the novelty of their position  meanwhile david mizzle furnished them with a large supply of peasoup which they seemed to relish amazingly  not so however the salt pork with which it had been made  they did indeed condescend to eat it but they infinitely preferred a portion of raw walrus flesh which had been reserved as food for the dogs and which they would speedily have consumed had it not been removed out of their reach  having finished this they were ordered to return to their camp on the ice beside the ship and a vigorous barter was speedily begun  first of all however a number of presents were made to them and it would really have done your heart good reader to have witnessed the extravagant joy displayed by them on receiving such trifles as bits of hoopiron beads knives scissors needles etcetera  iron is as precious among them as gold is among civilised people  the small quantities they possessed of it had been obtained from the few portions of wrecks that had drifted ashore in their icebound land  they used it for pointing their spearheads and harpoons which in default of iron were ingeniously made of ivory from the tusks of the walrus and the horn of the narwal  a bit of iron therefore was received with immense glee and a penny lookingglass with shouts of delight  but the present which drew forth the most uproarious applause was a union jack which the captain gave to their chief awatok  he was in the cabin when it was presented to him  on seeing its gaudy colours unrolled and being told that it was a gift to himself and his wife he caught his breath and stared as if in doubt alternately at the flag and the captain then he gave vent to a tremendous shout seized the flag hugged it in his arms and darted up on deck literally roaring with delight  the sympathetic hearts of the natives on the ice echoed the cry before they knew the cause of it but when they beheld the prize they yelled and screamed and danced and tossed their arms in the air in the most violent manner  theyre all mad ivery mothers son o them exclaimed oriley who for some time had been endeavouring to barter an old rusty knife for a pair of sealskin boots  they looks like it said grim who stood looking on with his legs apart and his arms crossed and grinning from ear to ear  to add to the confusion the dogs became affected with the spirit of excitement that filled their masters and gave vent to their feelings in loud and continuous howling which nothing could check  the imitative propensity of these singular people was brought rather oddly into play during the progress of traffic  busby had produced a large roll of tobaccowhich they knew the use of having already been shown how to use a pipeand cut off portions of it which he gave in exchange for foxskins and deerskins and sealskin boots  observing this a very sly old esquimaux began to slice up a deerskin into little pieces which he intended to offer for the small pieces of tobacco  he was checked however before doing much harm to the skin and the principles of exchange were more perfectly explained to him  the skins and boots besides walrus and seals flesh which the crew were enabled to barter at this time were of the utmost importance for their fresh provisions had begun to get low and their boots were almost worn out so that the scene of barter was exceedingly animated  davie summers and his master mivins shone conspicuous as bargainmakers and carried to their respective bunks a large assortment of native articles fred and tom singleton too were extremely successful and in a few hours a sufficient amount of skins were bartered to provide them with clothing for the winter  the quantity of fresh meat obtained however was not enough to last them a week for the esquimaux lived from hand to mouth and the crew felt that they must depend on their own exertions in the hunt for this indispensable article of food without which they could not hope to escape the assaults of the sailors dread enemy scurvy  meetucks duties were not light upon this occasion as you may suppose  arrah then dont ye onderstand me cried oriley in an excited tone to a particularly obtuse and remarkably fat esquimaux who was about as sharp at a bargain as himself  hallo  meetuck come here do and tell this porkfaced spalpeen what im sayin  sure i couldnt spake it plainer av i was to try  ill never get this fellow to understand said fred  meetuck my boy come here and explain to him  ho meetuck shouted peter grim give this old blockhead a taste o your lingo  i never met his match for stupidity  i do believe that this rascal wants the ole of this ball o twine for the tusk of a seaoss  meetuck weres meetuck  i say give us a and ere like a good fellow cried mivins but mivins cried in vain for at that moment saunders had violently collared the interpreter and dragged him towards an old esquimaux woman whose knowledge of scotch had not proved sufficient to enable her to understand the energeticallyexpressed words of the second mate  during all this time the stars had been twinkling brightly in the sky and the aurora shed a clear light upon the scene while the air was still calm and cold but a cloud or two now began to darken the horizon to the northeast and a puff of wind blew occasionally over the icy plain and struck with such chilling influence on the frames of the traffickers that with one consent they closed their business for that day and the esquimaux prepared to return to their snow village which was about ten miles to the southward and which village had been erected by them only three days previous to their discovery of the ship  im sorry to find remarked the captain to those who were standing near him that these poor creatures have stolen a few trifling articles from below  i dont like to break the harmonious feeling which now exists between us for the sake of a few worthless things but i know that it does more harm than good to pass over an offence with the natives of these regions for they attribute our forbearance to fear  perhaps you had better tax them with the theft suggested the surgeon they may confess it if we dont look very angry  a few more remarks were made by several of those who stood on the quarterdeck suggesting a treatment of the esquimaux which was not of the gentlest nature for they felt indignant that their hospitality had been abused  no no replied the captain to such suggestions we must exercise forbearance  these poor fellows do not regard theft in the same light that we do besides it would be foolish to risk losing their friendship  go down meetuck and invite awatok and his wife and half a dozen of the chief men into the cabin  say i wish to have a talk with them  the interpreter obeyed and in a few minutes the officers of the ship and the chiefs of the esquimaux were assembled in solemn conclave round the cabin table  tell them meetuck said the captain that i know they have stolen two pieces of hoop iron and a tin kettle and ask them why they were so ungrateful as to do it  the esquimaux who were becoming rather alarmed at the stern looks of those around them protested earnestly that they knew nothing about it and that they had not taken the things referred to  say that i do not believe them answered the captain sternly  it is an exceedingly wicked thing to steal and to tell lies  white men think those who are guilty of such conduct to be very bad  ah ye villain cried saunders seizing one of the esquimaux named oosuck by the shoulder and drawing forth an iron spoon which he observed projecting from the end of his boot  an exclamation of surprise and displeasure burst from the officers but the esquimaux gave vent to a loud laugh  they evidently thought stealing to be no sin and were not the least ashamed of being detected awatok however was an exception  he looked grave and annoyed but whether this was at being found out or at the ingratitude of his people they could not decide  tell them said the captain that i am much displeased  if they promise to return the stolen goods immediately i will pass over their offence this time and we will trade together and live like brothers and do each other good but if not and if any more articles are taken i will punish them  having had this translated to them the chiefs were dismissed but the expression of indifference on some of their faces proved that no impression had been made upon them  in a quarter of an hour the articles that had been mentioned as missing were returned and in order to restore harmony several plugs of tobacco and a few additional trinkets were returned by the messenger soon after the dogs were harnessed the sledges packed and with many protestations of goodwill on both sides the parties separated  a few cracks of their long whipsa few answering howls from the dogsand the esquimaux were off and out of sight leaving the dolphin in her former solitude under the shadow of the frowning cliffs  fetch me the telescope mivins said the captain calling down the hatchway  ay ay sir answered the steward  wheres my hatchet cried peter grim striding about the deck and looking into every corner in search of his missing implement  its my best one and i cant get on without it nohow  the captain bit his lip for he knew full well the cause of its absence  please sir said the steward coming on deck with a very perturbed expression of countenance thethea  speak out man whats the matter with you  the glass aint nowhere to be seen sir  turn up all hands shouted the captain jumping down the hatchway arm the men mr bolton and order the largest sledge to be got ready instantly  this will never do  harness the whole team  instantly the dolphins deck was a scene of bustling activity muskets were loaded jumpers and mittens put on dogs caught and harnessed and every preparation made for a sudden chase  there that will do cried the captain hurrying on deck with a brace of pistols and a cutlass in his belt six men are enough let twelve of the remainder follow on foot  jump on the sledge grim and buzzby oriley you go too  have a care fred not too near the front  now meetuck  one crack of the long whip terminated the sentence as if with a full stop and in another moment the sledge was bounding over the snow like a feather at the tails of twelve dogs  it was a long chase for it was a stern one but the esquimaux never dreamed of pursuit and as their dogs were not too well fed they had progressed rather slowly  in less than two hours they were distinguished on the horizon far off to the southward winding their way among the hummocks  now meetuck said the captain drive like the wind and lay me alongside of awatoks sledge and be ready men to act  ay ay sir was the prompt reply as the heavy whip fell on the flanks of the leaders  a few minutes brought them up with awatoks sledge and captain guy leaping upon it with a claspknife in his hand cut the traces in a twinkling set the dogs free and turning round seized the esquimaux by the collar  the big chief at first showed a disposition to resent this unceremonious treatment but before he could move grim seized his elbows in his iron grasp and tied them adroitly together behind his back with a cord  at the same time poor aninga and her baby were swiftly transferred to the sailors sledge  seeing this the whole band of natives turned back and rushed in a body to the rescue flourishing their lances and yelling fiercely  form line shouted the captain handing awatok and aninga over to the care of oriley  three of you on the right fire over their heads and let the rest reserve their fire  i will kill one of their dogs for it wont do to let them fancy that nothing but noise comes out of our muskets  readypresent  a rattling volley followed and at the same moment one of the dogs fell with a deathyell on the ice and dyed it with its blood  forward shouted the captain  the men advanced in a body at a smart run but the terrified esquimaux who had never heard the report of firearms before did not wait for them they turned and fled precipitately but not before grim captured oosuck and dragged him forcibly to the rear where he was pinioned and placed on the sledge with the others  now then lads that will do get upon the sledge again  away with you meetuck  look after awatok grim oriley will see that aninga does not jump off  that he will darlint said the irishman patting the woman on the back  and i shall look after the baby said fred chucking that series of dumplings under the chinan act of familiarity that seemed to afford it immense satisfaction for notwithstanding the melancholy position of its father and mother as prisoners it smiled on fred benignly  in five minutes the party were far on their way back to the ship and in less than five hours after the esquimaux had closed their barter and left for their village four of their number including the baby were close prisoners in the dolphins hold  it was not captain guys intention however to use unnecessarily harsh means for the recovery of the missing articles  his object was to impress the esquimaux with a salutary sense of the power promptitude and courage of europeans and to check at the outset their propensity for thieving  having succeeded in making two of their chief men prisoners he felt assured that the lost telescope and hatchet would soon make their appearance and in this he was not mistaken  going to the hold where the prisoners sat with downcast looks he addressed to them a lengthened speech as to the sin and meanness of stealing in general and of stealing from those who had been kind to them in particular  he explained to them the utter hopelessness of their attempting to deceive or impose upon the white men in any way whatever and assured them that if they tried that sort of thing again he would punish them severely but that if they behaved well and brought plenty of walrus flesh to the ship he would give them hoopiron beads lookingglasses etcetera  these remarks seemed to make a considerable impression on his uncouth hearers  and now said the captain in conclusion i shall keep awatok and his wife and child prisoners here until my telescope and hatchet are returned awatoks visage fell and his wife looked stolid and i shall send oosuck to his tribe oosucks face lit up amazingly to tell them what i have said  in accordance with this resolve oosuck was set free and making use of his opportunity with prompt alacrity he sped away on foot over the ice to the southward and was quickly lost to view    chapter sixteen  the arctic theatre enlarged upongreat success of the first playthe esquimaux submit and become fast friends  the 1st of december was a great day on board the dolphin for on that day it was announced to the crew that the arctic theatre would be opened under the able management of mr f ellice with the play of blunderbore or the arctic giant  the bill of which two copies were issued gratis to the crew announced that the celebrated peter grim esquire who had so long trodden the boards of the dolphin with unparalleled success had kindly consented to appear in the character of blunderbore for one winter only  the other parts were as followswhackinta a beautiful esquimaux widow who had been captured by two polar bears both of which were deeply in love with her by frederick ellice esquire  first bear a big one by terence oriley esquire  second bear a little one by david summers esquire  ben bolt a brave british seaman who had been wrecked in blunderbores desolate dominions all the crew having perished except himself by john buzzby esquire  these constituted the various characters of the piece the name of which had been kept a profound secret from the crew until the morning of the day on which it was acted  freds duties as manager and author upon this occasion were by no means light for his troop being unaccustomed to study found the utmost difficulty in committing the simplest sentences to memory  oriley turned out to be the sharpest among them but having agreed to impersonate the first bear and having to act his part in dumb show bears not being supposed capable of speechhis powers of memory had not to be exerted  grim was also pretty good but davie summers could not be got to remember even the general arrangements of the piece and as for buzzby he no sooner mastered a line than he forgot the one before it and almost gave it up in despair but by dint of much study and many rehearsals in secret under the superintendence of fred and tom singleton who undertook to assist they succeeded at last in going through with it with only a few mistakes  on the morning of the 1st december while the most of the crew were away at red snow valley cutting moss fred collected his corps dramatique for a last rehearsal in the forecastle where they were secure from interruption the place being so cold that no one would willingly go into it except under the force of necessity  a dim lantern lit up the apartment faintly  we must do it without a mistake this time said fred ellice opening his book and calling upon grim to begin  tis cold began grim  stop youre wrong  oh so i am cried grim slapping his thigh ill begin again  it may be remarked here that although blunderbore was supposed to be an esquimaux monarch he was compelled to speak english being unfortunately ignorantif we may so speakof his native tongue  oh tis a dismal thing began grim again to dwell in solitude and cold  tis very cold grim shuddered here tremendously andand whats next  hunger said fred  hunger gnaws my vitals  my name is blunderbore  twere better had i been born a blunderbuss cause then i have gone off and dwelt in climes more shootable to my tender constitoosion  ha is that a bear i sees before me  its not sees interrupted fred  at this moment a tremendous roar was heard and oriley bounded from behind a topsail which represented an iceberg dressed from head to foot in the skin of a white bear which had been killed a few days before  stop oriley cried fred youre too soon man  i have to come on first as an esquimaux woman and when grim says to the woman he wishes he could see a bear then you are to come  och whirra but me brains is confuged intirely wid it all said oriley rising on his hindlegs and walking off with his tail literally as well as figuratively between his legs  now buzzby now its your timewhen you hear the word misery come on and fight like a trojan with the bears  the doctor will remind you  fred was remarkably patient and painstaking and his pupils though not apt scholars were willing so that the morning rehearsal was gone through with fewer mistakes than might have been expected and when the crew came back to dinner about midday which however was as dark as midnight their parts were sufficiently well got up and nothing remained to be done but to arrange the stage and scenery for the evenings entertainmentit having been resolved that the performance should commence after supper  the stage was at the after part of the cabin and raised about a foot above the deck and its management had been intrusted to the doctor who assisted by peter grim transformed that portion of the ship into a scene so romantically beautiful that the first sight of it petrified the crew with surprise  but until the curtain should rise all arrangements were carefully concealed from everyone except the dramatis personae  even the captain and officers were forbidden to peep behind the sail that formed a curtain to the stage and this secrecy besides being necessary was extremely useful inasmuch as it excited the curiosity of the men and afforded them food for converse and speculation for a week before the great day arrived  the longedfor hour came at last  the cabin tables having been removed and rows of seats placed in front of the stage the men were admitted from the deck to which they had been expelled an hour previous in order not to impede preliminary arrangements  there was great joking of course as they took their seats and criticised the fittings up  david mizzle was of opinion that the footlights wos oncommon grand which was an unquestionable fact for they consisted of six tin lamps filled with sealoil from the wicks of which rose a compound of yellow flame and smoke that had a singularly luminous effect  amos parr guessed that the curtain would be certain sure to get jammed at the first haul and several of the others were convinced that oriley would stick his part in one way or another  however an end was put to all remarks and expectation raised on tiptoe by the ringing of a small handbell and immediately thereafter a violent pulling at the curtain which concealed the stage but the curtain remained immovable they always do on such occasions and a loud whispering was heard behind the scenes  clap on extra tackle and call all hands to hoist away suggested one of the audience  the laugh with which this advice was received was checked in the bud by the sudden rising of the curtain with such violence that the whole framework of the theatre shook again  for a few seconds a dead silence reigned for the men were stricken dumb with genuine amazement at the scene before them  the stage was covered with white sheets arranged in such a manner as to represent snow and the more effectually to carry out the idea several huge blocks of real ice and a few patches of snow were introduced here and there the cold in the afterpart of the cabin being too great to permit of their melting  a topgallant sail on which were painted several blue cracks and some strong white lights did duty for an iceberg and filled up the whole back of the scene  in front of this in the centre of the stage on an extemporised hummock sat peter grim as the giant blunderbore his colossal proportions were enhanced by the addition of an entire white bearskin to his ordinary hairy dress and which was thrown round his broad shoulders in the form of a tippet  a broad scarlet sash was tied round his waist and a crown of brown paper painted in alternate diamonds of blue red and yellow sat upon his brow  grim was in truth a magnificentlooking fellow with his black beard and moustache and the mockheroic frown with which he gazed up as one of the audience suggested at the aurora borealis while he grasped an enormous club in his right hand became him well  the first few seconds of dead silence with which this was received were succeeded by a long and loud burst of applause the heartiness of which plainly showed that the scene far exceeded the expectations of the men  bravo cried the captain excellent nothing could be better  it beats natur quite said one  all to sticks cried another  and wot a treemendous giant he makes  three cheers for peter grim lads  three cheers were promptly given with right goodwill but the giant did not move a muscle  he was far too deeply impressed with the importance of playing his part well to acknowledge the compliment having gazed long enough to enable the men to get rid of their first flow of enthusiasm blunderbore rose majestically and coming forward to the footlights looked straight over the heads of the men and addressed himself to the opposite bulkhead  oh tis a dismal thing he began and continued to spout his part with flashing eyes and considerable energy until he came to the word blunderbuss when either from a mistaken notion as to when it was his time to go on or nervous forgetfulness of the plan of the piece the little bear sprang over the edge of the iceberg and alighted on the middle of the stage  oh bad luck to yees intirely said the big bear from behind the scenes in an angry whisper which was distinctly heard by the audience yeve gone and spoiled it all ye have  come off will ye and take yer turn at the right time wont ye  in the midst of the shout of delight caused by this mistake oriley forgetting that he was a bear rushed on the stage on his hindlegs seized the little bear by the foreleg and dragged him off at the other side amid loud applause  blunderbore with admirable selfpossession resumed his part the instant there was a calm and carried it successfully to a close  just as he ended fred waddled on in the guise of an esquimaux woman and so well was he got up that the crew looked round to see if aninga who with her husband had been allowed to witness the play was in her place  fred had intentionally taken aninga as his model and had been very successful in imitating the topknot of hair  the baby too was hit off to perfection having been made by mivins who proved himself a genius in such matters  its head was a ball of rags covered with brown leather and two white bone buttons with black spots in the centre did duty for its eyes  the first thing whackinta did on coming forward was to deposit the baby on the snow with its head downwards by mistake whereat it began to scream vociferously  this scream was accomplished by davie summers creeping below the stage and putting his mouth to a hole in the flooring close to which the babys head lay  davies falsetto was uncommonly like to a childs voice and the effect was quite startling of course whackinta tried to soothe it and failing in this she whipped it which caused it to yell with tenfold violence  thereafter losing all patience she covered its face and stuffed its mouth with a quantity of snow and laying it down on its back placed a large block of ice on its head  this as might be expected had the desired effect and the baby was silencednot however until whackinta had twice called down the hole in a hoarse whisper thatll do davie stop man stop then sitting down on the hummock which blunderbore had just leftand from behind which he was now eagerly watching hershe began to weep  having given full vent to her feelings in a series of convulsive sobs whackinta addressed a lengthened harangue in a melancholy tone of voice to the audience the gist of which was that she was an unfortunate widow that two bears had fallen in love with her and stolen her away from her happy home in nova zembla and although they allowed her to walk about as much as she chose they watched her closely and prevented her escaping to her own country  worst of all they had told her that she must agree to become the wife of one or other of them and if she did not make up her mind and give them an answer that very day she was to be killed and eaten by both of them  in order the more strongly to impress the audience with her forlorn condition whackinta sang a tender and touching ditty composed by herself expressly for the occasion and sang it so well that it was encored twice  to all this blunderbore listened with apparent rapture and at length ventured to advance and discover himself but the instant whackinta saw him she fell on her knees and trembled violently  spare me good king she said do not slay me  i am a poor widow and have been brought here by two bears against my will  woman said the giant my name is blunderbore  i am as you perceive by my crown a king and i am a lonely man  if i kill the two bears you speak of will you marry me  oh do not ask me good blunderbore i cannot  it is impossible  i cannot love you you areforgive me for saying ittoo big and fierce and ugly to love  blunderbore frowned angrily and the audience applauded vociferously at this  you cannot love me  hah exclaimed the giant glaring round with clenched teeth  at this moment the big bear uttered an awful roar whackinta gave a piercing scream and fled and blunderbore hid himself hastily behind the hummock  the next moment the two bears bounded on the stage and began to gambol round it tossing up their hindlegs and roaring and leaping in a manner that drew forth repeated plaudits  at length the little bear discovered the baby and uttering a frantic roar of delight took it in its forepaws and held it up  the big bear roared also of course and rushing forward caught the baby by the leg and endeavoured to tear it away from the little bear at which treatment the poor baby again commenced to cry passionately  in the struggle the babys head came off upon which the little bear put the head into its mouth and swallowed it  the big bear immediately did the same with the body but its mouth was too small and the body stuck fast and could not be finally disposed of until the little bear came to the rescue and pushed it forcibly down its throat  having finished this delicate little morsel the two bears rose on their hindlegs and danced a hornpipe togethertom singleton playing the tune for them on a flute behind the scenes  when this was done they danced off the stage and immediately as if in the distance was heard the voice of a man singing  it came gradually nearer and at last buzzby in the character of ben bolt swaggered up to the footlights with his hands in his breeches pockets    im a jolly jolly tar   wot has comed from afar   an its all for to seek my fortin  sang buzzby  but ive not found it yit he continued breaking into prose and there dont seem much prospect o findin it here anyhow wot an orrible cold place it is ugh  buzzby was received with enthusiastic cheers for he was dressed in the old familiar blue jacket white ducks pumps and straw hat set jauntily on one side of his heada costume which had not been seen for so many months by the crew of the dolphin that their hearts warmed to it as if it were an old friend  buzzby acted with great spirit and was evidently a prime favourite  he could scarcely recollect a word of his part but he remembered the general drift of it and had ready wit enough to extemporise  having explained that he was the only survivor of a shipwrecked crew he proceeded to tell some of his adventures in foreign lands and afterwards described part of his experiences in a song to which the doctor played an accompaniment behind the scenes  the words were composed by himself sung to the wellknown scotch air corn riggs and ran as follows  the jolly tar    my comrades you must know   it was many years ago   i left my daddys cottage in the green wood o   and i jined a manowar   an became a jolly tar   an fought for king and country on the high seas o   pull boys cheerily our home is on the sea   pull boys merrily and lightly o   pull boys cheerily the wind is passing   free   an whirling up the foam and water skyhigh o    theres been many a noble fight   but trafalgar was the sight   that beat the greeks and romans in their glory o   for britains jolly sons   worked the thunderblazing guns   and nelson stood the bravest in the forefront o   pull boys etcetera    a roaring cannon shot   came an hit the very spot   where my leg goes clickanjumble in the socket o   and swept it overboard   with the precious little hoard   of pipe an tin an baccy in the pocket o   pull boys etcetera    they took me down below   an they laid me with a row   of killed and wounded messmates on a table o   then up comes dr keg   an says heres a livin leg   ill sew upon the stump if i am able o   pull boys etcetera    this good and sturdy limb   had belonged to fightin tim   an scarcely had they sewed it on the socket o   when up the hatch i flew   an dashed among the crew   an sprang on board the frenchman like a rocket o   pull boys etcetera    twas this that gained the day   for that leg it cleared the way   and the battle raged like fury while it lasted o   then ceased the shot and shell   to fall upon the swell   and the unionjack went bravely to the masthead o   pull boys etcetera  we need scarcely say that this song was enthusiastically encored and that the chorus was done full justice to by the audience who picked it up at once and zang it with lusty vehemence  at the last word ben bolt nodded familiarly thrust his hands into his pockets and swaggered off whistling yankee doodle  it was a matter of uncertainty where he had swaggered off to but it was conjectured that he had gone on his journey to anywhere that might turn up  meanwhile blunderbore had been bobbing his head up and down behind the hummock in amazement at what he heard and saw and when ben bolt made his exit he came forward  this was the signal for the two bears to discover him and rush on with a terrific roar  blunderbore instantly fetched them each a sounding whack on their skulls leaped over both their backs and bounded up the side of the iceberg where he took refuge and turned at bay on a little ice pinnacle constructed expressly for that purpose  an awful fight now ensued between the giant and the two bears  the pinnacle on which blunderbore stood was so low that the big bear by standing up on its hindlegs could just scratch his toes which caused the giant to jump about continually but the sides of the iceberg were so smooth that the bears could not climb up it  this difficulty indeed constituted the great and amusing feature of the fight for no sooner did the little bear creep up to the edge of the pinnacle than the giants tremendous club came violently down on his snout which had been made of hard wood on purpose to resist the blows and sent it sprawling back on the stage where the big bear invariably chanced to be in the way and always fell over it  then they both rose and roaring fearfully renewed the attack while blunderbore laid about him with the club ferociously  fortune however did not on this occasion favour the brave  the big bear at last caught the giant by the heel and pulled him to the ground the little bear instantly seized him by the throat and notwithstanding his awful yells and struggles it would have gone ill with blunderbore had not ben bolt opportunely arrived at that identical spot at that identical moment in the course of his travels  oh it was a glorious thing to see the fearnothing dareanything fashion in which when he saw how matters stood ben bolt threw down his stick and bundle drew his cutlass and attacked the two bears at once singlehanded crying come on in a voice of thunder  and it was a satisfactory thing to behold the way in which he cut and slashed at their heads the heads having been previously prepared for such treatment and the agility he displayed in leaping over their backs and under their legs and holding on by their tails while they vainly endeavoured to catch him  the applause was frequent and prolonged and the two esquimaux prisoners rolled about their burly figures and laughed till the tears ran down their fat cheeks  but when ben bolt suddenly caught the two bears by their tails tied them together in a double knot and fled behind a hummock which the big bear passed on one side and the little bear on the other and so as a matter of course stuck hard and fast the laughter was excessive and when the gallant british seaman again rushed forward massacred the big bear with two terrific cuts slew the little bear with one tremendous backhander and then sank down on one knee and pressed his hand to his brow as if he were exhausted a cheer ran from stem to stern of the dolphin the like of which had not filled the hull of that good ship since she was launched upon her ocean home  it was just at this moment that whackinta chanced curiously enough to return to this spot in the course of her wanderings  she screamed in horror at the sight of the dead bears which was quite proper and natural and then she started at the sight of the exhausted bolt and smiled sweetlywhich was also naturalas she hastened to assist and sympathise with him  ben bolt fell in love with her at once and told her so offhand to the unutterable rage of blunderbore who recovered from his wounds at that moment and seizing the sailor by the throat vowed he would kill and quarter and stew and boil and roast and eat him in one minute if he didnt take care what he was about  the audience felt some fears for ben bolt at this point but their delight knew no bounds when shaking the giant off and springing backwards he buttoned up his coat and roared rather than said that though he were all the blunderbores and blunderbusses in the world rolled together and changed into one immortal blundercannon he didnt care a pinch of bad snuff for him and would knock all the teeth in his head down his throat  this valorous threat he followed up by shaking his fist close under the giants nose and crying out come on  but the giant did not come on he fortunately recollected that he owed his life to the brave sailor so he smiled and saying he would be his friend through life insisted on seizing him by the hand and shaking it violently  thereafter he took ben bolt and whackinta by their right hands and leading them forward to the footlights made them a long speech to the effect that he owed a debt of gratitude to the former for saving his life which he could never repay and that he loved the latter too sincerely to stand in the way of her happiness  then he joined their right hands and they went down on one knee and he placed his hands on their heads and looked up at the audience with a benignant smile and the curtain fell amid rapturous cheers  in this play it seemed somewhat curious and unaccountable that whackinta forgot to enquire for her demolished baby and appeared to feel no anxiety whatever about it it was also left a matter of uncertainty whether ben bolt and his esquimaux bride returned to live happily during the remainder of their lives in england or took up their permanent abode with blunderbore but it is not our province to criticisewe merely chronicle events as they occurred  the entertainments were to conclude with a hornpipe from mivins but just as that elastic individual had completed the first of a series of complicated evolutions and was about to commence the second a vociferous barking of the dogs was heard outside accompanied by the sound of human voices  the benches were deserted in a moment and the men rushed upon deck catching up muskets and cutlasses which always stood in readiness as they went  the sounds proceeded from a party of about twenty esquimaux who had been sent from the camp with the stolen property and with a humble request that the offence might be forgiven and their chief and his wife returned to them  they were all unarmed and the sincerity of their repentance was further attested by the fact that they brought back not only the hatchet and telescope but a large assortment of minor articles that had not been missed  of course the apology was accepted and after speeches were delivered and protestations of undying friendship made on both sides the party were presented with a few trinkets and a plug of tobacco each and sent back in a state of supreme happiness to their village where for a week awatok kept the men of his tribe and aninga the women in a state of intense amazement by their minute descriptions of the remarkable doings of the white strangers  the friendship thus begun between the esquimaux and the dolphins crew was never once interrupted by any unpleasant collision during the months that they afterwards travelled and hunted in company  strength of muscle and promptitude in action are qualities which all nations in a savage state understand and respect and the sailors proved that they possessed these qualities in a higher degree than themselves during the hardships and dangers incident to arctic life while at the same time their seemingly endless resources and contrivances impressed the simple natives with the belief that white men could accomplish anything they chose to attempt    chapter seventeen  expeditions on footeffects of darkness on dogs and menthe first deathcaught in a trapthe esquimaux camp  dont know how it is an i cant tell wot it is but so it is remarked buzzby to grim a week after the first night of the theatricals that that ere actin has done us all a sight o good here we are as merry as crickets every one although were short of fresh meat and symptoms o scurvy are beginnin to show on some of us  its the mind havin occupation an bein prewented from broodin over its misfortins replied grim with the air of a philosopher  grim did not put this remark in turned commas although he ought to have done so seeing that it was quoted from a speech made by the captain to singleton the day before  you see continued grim weve been actin every night for a week past well if we hadnt been actin we should ha been thinkin an sleepintoo much of which you see aint good for us buzzby and would never pay  buzzby was not quite sure of this but contented himself by saying well mayhap yere right  im sorry its to come to an end so soon but there is no doubt that fresh meat is ondispensablean that reminds me messmate that ive not cleaned my musket for two days an it wouldnt do to go on a hunt with a foul piece nohow  we start at 10 oclock am dont we  grim admitted that they didremarking that it might just as well be 10 pm for all the difference the sun would make in itand went below with buzzby  in the cabin active preparations were making for an extended hunting expedition which the empty state of the larder rendered absolutely necessary  for a week past the only fresh provisions they had procured were a white fox and a rabbit notwithstanding the exertions of meetuck fred and the doctor who with three separate parties had scoured the country for miles round the ship  scurvy was now beginning to appear among them and captain guy felt that although they had enough of salt provisions to last them the greater part of the winter if used with economy they could not possibly subsist on these alone  an extended expedition in search of seals and walrus was therefore projected  it was determined that this should consist of two parties the one to proceed north the other to travel south in the tracks of the esquimaux who had left their temporary village in search of walrusthey also being reduced almost to a state of starvation  the plan of the expedition was as follows  one party consisting of ten men under bolton the first mate was to take the largest sledge and the whole team of dogs on which with twelve days provisions and their sleepingbags they were to proceed northward along the coast as far as possible and in the event of being unsuccessful they were to turn homeward on the eighth day and make the best of their way back on short allowance  the other party consisting of fifteen men under saunders the second mate was to set off to the southward on foot dragging a smaller sledge behind them and endeavour to find the esquimaux who it was supposed could not be far off and would probably have fresh meat in their camp  it was a clear cold and beautiful starlight day when the two parties started simultaneously on their separate journeys  the coruscations of the aurora were more than usually vivid and the snow gave forth that sharp dry crunching sound under the heels of the men as they moved about that denotes intense frost  mind that you hug the land mr bolton said the captain at parting dont get farther out on the floes than you can help  to meet with a gale on the ice is no joke in these latitudes  the first mate promised obedience and the second mate having been also cautioned to hug the land and not to use their small supply of spirits for any other purpose than that of lighting the lamp except in cases of the most urgent need they set off with three hearty cheers which were returned by captain guy and those who remained with him in the ship all the able and effective men were sent on these expeditions those who remained behind were all more or less affected with scurvy except the captain himself whose energetic nature seemed invulnerable and whose flow of spirits never failed  indeed it is probable that to this hearty and vigorous temperament under god he owed his immunity from disease for since provisions began to fail he along with all his officers had fared precisely like the menthe few delicacies they possessed having been reserved for the sick  unfortunately their stock of limejuice was now getting low and the crew had to be put on short allowance  as this acid is an excellent antiscorbutic or preventive of scurvy as well as a cure its rapid diminution was viewed with much concern by all on board  the longcontinued absence of the sun too now began to tell more severely than ever on men and dogs  on the very day the expeditions took their departure one of the latter which had been left behind on account of illness was attacked with a strange disease of which several of the team eventually died before the winter came to an end  it was seized with spasms and after a few wild paroxysms lapsed into a lethargic state  in this condition the animal functions went on apparently as well as usual the appetite continued not only good but voracious  the disease was clearly mental  it barked furiously at nothing and walked in straight or curved lines perseveringly or at other times it remained for hours in moody silence and then started off howling as if pursued in thirtysix hours after the first attack the poor animal died and was buried in the snow on store island  this was the first death that had occurred on board and although it was only a dog and not one of the favourites its loss cast a gloom over the crew for several days  it was the first blow of the fell destroyer in the midst of their little community which could ill spare the life even of one of the lower animals and they felt as if the point of the wedge had now been entered and might be driven farther home ere long  the expressive delight of the poor dogs on being admitted to the light of the cabin showed how ardently they longed for the return of the sun it was now the beginning of december and the darkness was complete not the faintest vestige of twilight appeared even at noon  midnight and noonday were alike  except when the stars and aurora were bright there was not light enough to distinguish a mans form at ten paces distant and a blacker mass than the surrounding darkness alone indicated where the high cliffs encompassed the bay of mercy  when therefore anyone came on deck the first thing he felt on groping his way about was the cold noses of the dogs pushed against his hands as they frisked and gambolled round him  they howled at the appearance of an accidental light as if they hoped the sun or at least the moon were going to rise once more and they rejoiced on being taken below and leaped up in the mens faces for sympathy and whined and all but spoke with excess of satisfaction  the effect of the monotony of longcontinued darkness and the absence of novelty had much to do also with the indifferent health of many of the men  after the two expeditions were sent out those who remained behind became much more lowspirited and the symptoms of scurvy increased  in these circumstances captain guy taxed his inventive genius to the utmost to keep up their spirits and engage their minds he assumed an air of bustling activity and attached a degree of importance to the regular performance of the light duties of the ship that they did not in reality possess apart from their influence as discipline  the cabin was swept and aired the stove cleaned the fittings dusted the beds made the tides thermometers and barometers registered the logs posted up clothes mended food cooked traps visited etcetera with the regularity of clockwork and every possible plan adopted to occupy every waking hour and to prevent the men from brooding over their position  when the labours of the day were over plans were proposed for getting up a concert or a new play in order to surprise the absentees on their return  stories were told over and over again and enjoyed if good or valued far beyond their worth if bad when old stories failed and old books were read new stories were invented and here the genius of some was drawn out while the varied information of others became of great importance  tom singleton in particular entertained the men with songs and lively tunes on the flute and told stories as one of them remarked like a book  joseph west too was an invaluable comrade in this respect  he had been a studious boy at school and a lover of books of all kinds especially books of travel and adventure  his memory was good and his inventive powers excellent so that he recalled wonderful and endless anecdotes from the unfathomable stores of his memory strung them together into a sort of story and told them in a soft pleasant voice that captivated the ears of his audience but poor west was in delicate health and could not speak so long as his messmates would have wished  the rough life they led and the frequent exposure to intense cold had considerably weakened a frame which had never been robust and an occasional cough when he told a long story sometimes warned him to desist  games too were got up  hideandseek was revived with all the enthusiasm of boyhood and foxchase was got up with tremendous energy  in all this the captain was the most earnest and vigorous and in doing good to others he unconsciously did the greatest possible amount of good to himself for his forgetfulness of self and the activity of his mind in catering for the wants and amusements of his men had the effect of imparting a cheerfulness to his manner and a healthy tone to his mind that tended powerfully to sustain and invigorate his body  but despite all this the men grew worse and a few of them showed such alarming symptoms that the doctor began to fear there would soon be a breach in their numbers  meanwhile saunders and his fifteen men trudged steadily to the southward dragging their sledge behind them  the icefloes however turned out to be very rugged and hummocky and retarded them so much that they made but slow progress until they passed the red snow valley and doubled the point beyond it  here they left the floes and took to the natural highway afforded by the icebelt along which they sped more rapidly and arrived at the esquimaux village in the course of about five hours  here all was deserted and silent  bits of seal and walrus hide and bones and tusks were scattered about in all directions but no voices issued from the domeshaped huts of snow  theyre the likest things to beeskeps i ever saw remarked saunders as he and his party stood contemplating the little group of huts  and they dont seem to care much for big doors  saunders referred here to the low tunnels varying from three to twelve feet that formed the entrance to each hut  mayhap theres some o them asleep inside suggested tom green the carpenters mate suppose we go in and see  i dare say yere no far wrong replied the second mate to whom the idea seemed to be a new one  go in davie summers yere a wee chap and can bend your back better than the most o us  davie laughed as he went down on his hands and knees and creeping in at the mouth of one of the tunnels which barely permitted him to enter in that position disappeared  several of the party at the same time paid similar visits to the other huts but they all returned with the same remark empty  the interiors were begrimed with lampblack and filth and from their appearance seemed to have been deserted only a short time before  buzzby who formed one of the party rubbed his nose for some time in great perplexity until he drew from davie summers the remark that his proboscis was red enough by nature and didnt need rubbing  its odd he remarked they seems to ha bin here for some time and yit theyve niver looked near the ship but once  wots become on em i dont know  dont you said davie in a tone of surprise now that is odd  one would have thought that a fellow who keeps his weathereye so constantly open should know everything  dont chaff boy but lend a hand to undo the sledlashings  i see that mr saunders is agoin to anchor here for the night  the second mate who had been taking a hasty glance at the various huts of the village selected two of the largest as a lodging for his men and having divided them into two gangs ordered them to turn in and sleep as hard as possible  spose we may sup first said summers in a whining tone of mock humility  in coorse you may answered tom green giving the lad a push that upset him in the snow  come here buzzby i want to speak to ee said saunders leading him aside  it seems to me that the esquimaux canna be very far off and i observe their tracks are quite fresh in the snow leadin to the southward so i mean to have a night march after them but as the men seem pretty weel tired ill only take two o the strongest  who dye think might go  ill go myself sir  very good and who else think ee  amos parr seems freshest  i think tom greens the man wot can do it  i seed him capsize davie summers jist now in the snow an when a man can skylark i always know hes got lots o wind in im  very good  then go buzzby and order him to get ready and look sharp about it  ay ay sir cried buzzby as he turned to prepare green for the march  in pursuance of this plan an hour afterwards saunders and his two followers left the camp with their sleepingbags and a days provisions on their shoulders having instructed the men to follow with the sledge at the end of five hours which period was deemed sufficient time for rest and refreshment  for two hours the trio plodded silently onward over the icebelt by the light of a clear starry sky  at the end of that time clouds began to gather to the westward rendering the way less distinct but still leaving sufficient light to render travelling tolerably easy  then they came to a part of the coast where the icebelt clung close to a line of perpendicular cliffs of about three miles in extent  the icebelt here was about twenty feet broad  on the left the cliffs referred to rose sheer up several hundred feet on the right the icebelt descended only about three feet to the floes  here our three adventurous travellers were unexpectedly caught in a trap  the tide rose so high that it raised the sea ice to a level with the icebelt and welling up between the two completely overflowed the latter  the travellers pushed on as quickly as possible for the precipices on their left forbade all hope of escape in that direction while the gap between the icebelt and the floes which was filled with a gurgling mixture of ice and water equally hemmed them in on the right  worse than all the tide continued to rise and when it reached halfway to their knees they found it dangerous to advance for fear of stepping into rents and fissures which were no longer visible  whats to be done noo enquired saunders coming to a full stop and turning to buzzby with a look of blank despair  dunno replied buzzby with an equally blank look of despair as he stood with his legs apart and his arms hanging down by his sidethe very personification of imbecility  if i wos a fly id know wot to do id walk up the side o that cliff till i got to a dry bit and then id stick on  but not bein a fly in coorse i cant  buzzby said this in a recklessly facetious tone and tom green followed it up with a remark to the effect that hed be blowed if he ever wos in sich a fix in his life intimating his belief at the same time that his toes wos freezin  no fear o that said the second mate theyll no freeze as lang as theyre in the water  well just have to stand here till the tide goes doon  saunders said this in a dogged tone and immediately put his plan in force by crossing his arms and planting his feet firmly on the submerged ice and wide apart  buzzby and green however adopted the wiser plan of moving constantly about within a small circle and after saunders had argued for half an hour as to the advantages of this plan he followed their example  the tide rose above their knees but they had fortunately on boots made by the esquimaux which were perfectly waterproof their feet therefore although very cold were quite dry in an hour and threequarters the icebelt was again uncovered and the halffrozen travellers resumed their march with the utmost energy  two hours later and they came to a wide expanse of level ground at the foot of the high cliffs where a group of esquimaux huts similar to those they had left was descried  theyre all deserted too remarked buzzby  but buzzby was wrong for at that moment a very small and particularly fat little boy in a foxskin dress appeared at the mouth of one of the low tunnels that formed the entrance to the nearest hut  this boy looked exactly like a ladys muff with a hairy head above it and a pair of feet below  the instant he observed the strangers he threw up his arms uttered a shrill cry of amazement and disappeared in the tunnel next instant a legion of dogs rushed out of the huts barking furiously and on their heels came the entire population creeping on their hands and knees out of the tunnel mouths like dark hairy monsters issuing from their holes  they had spears and knives of ivory with them but a glance showed the two parties that they were friends and in a few moments awatok and his comrades were chattering vociferously round the sailors and endeavouring by word and sign to make themselves understood  the esquimaux received the three visitors and the rest of the sledgeparty who came up a few hours later with the utmost hospitality  but we have not space to tell of how they dragged them into their smoky huts of snow and how they offered them raw seals flesh to eat and how on the sailors expressing disgust they laughed and added moss mixed with oil to their lamps to enable them to cook their food and how they managed by signs and otherwise to understand that the strangers had come in search of food at which they the esquimaux were not surprised and how they assured their visitors also by means of signs that they would go ahunting with them on the following day whereat they the sailors were delighted and shook hands all round  neither have we space to tell of how the visitors were obliged to conform to custom and sleep in the same huts with men women children and dogs and how they felt thankful to be able to sleep anywhere and anyhow without being frozen  all this and a great deal more we are compelled to skip over here and leave it unwillingly to the vivid imagination of our reader    chapter eighteen  the hunting partyreckless drivinga desperate encounter with a walrus etcetera  late in the day by the bright light of the stars the sailors and the esquimaux left the snowhuts of the village and travelling out to seaward on the floes with dogs and sledges lances and spears advanced to do battle with the walrus  the northern lights were more vivid than usual making the sky quite luminous and there was a sharp freshness in the air which while it induced the hunters to pull their hoods more tightly round their faces also sent their blood careering more briskly through their veins as they drove swiftly over the ice in the esquimaux sledges  did ye ever see walrusses afore davie enquired buzzby who sat beside summers on the leading sledge  none but what ive seed on this voyage  theyre remarkable creeturs rejoined buzzby slapping his hand on his thigh  ive seed many a one in my time an i can tell ye lad theyre ugly customers  they fight like good uns and give the esquimaux a deal o trouble to kill themthey do  tell me a story about em buzzbydo like a good chap said davie summers burying his nose in the skirts of his hairy garment to keep it warm  youre a capital hand at a yarn now fire away  a story lad i dont know as how i can exactly tell ye a story but ill give ye wot they calls a hanecdote  it wos about five years ago more or less i wos out in baffins bay becalmed off one o the eskimo settlements when we wos lookin over the side at the lumps of ice floatin past up got a walrus not very far offshore and out went half a dozen kayaks as they call the eskimo mens boats and they all sot on the beast at once  well it wos one o the brown walrusses which is always the fiercest and the moment he got the first harpoon he went slap at the man that threw it but the fellow backed out and then a cry was raised to let it alone as it wos a brown walrus  one young eskimo howsiver would have another slap at it and went so close that the brute charged upset the kayak and ripped the man up with his tusks  seein this the other eskimos made a dash at it and wounded it badly but the upshot wos that the walrus put them all to flight and made off clear away with six harpoons fast in its hide  buzzbys tellin ye gammon roared tom green who rode on the second sledge in rear of that on which davie summers sat  what ist all about  about gammon of coorse retorted davie  keep yer mouth shut for fear your teeth freeze  cant ye lead us a better road shouted saunders who rode on the third sledge my bones are rattlin about inside a me like a bag o ninepins  give the dogs a cut old fellow said buzzby with a chuckle and a motion of his arm to the esquimaux who drove his sledge  the esquimaux did not understand the words but he quite understood the sly chuckle and the motion of the arm so he sent the lash of the heavy whip with a loud crack over the backs of the team  hold on for life cried davie as the dogs sprang forward with a bound  the part they were about to pass over was exceedingly rough and broken and buzzby resolved to give his shipmates a shake  the pace was tremendous  the powerful dogs drew their loads after them with successive bounds which caused a succession of crashes as the sledges sprang from lump to lump of ice and the mens teeth snapped in a truly savage manner  baack yeer toopsails will ye shouted amos parr  but the delighted esquimaux leader who entered quite into the joke had no intention whatever of backing his topsails he administered another crack to the team which yelled madly and bounding over a wide chasm in the ice came down with a crash which snapped the line of the leading dog and set it free  here buzzby caused the driver to pull up  stop ye varmint  come to an anchor said he  is that a way to drive the poor dogs  ye might have stopped him sooner i think cried the second mate in wrath  hai shouted the band of esquimaux pointing to a hummock of ice a few hundred yards in advance of the spot on which they stood  instantly all were silent and gazing intently ahead at a dark object that burst upwards through the ice  a walrus whispered buzzby  so it is answered amos parr  ive my doobts on that point remarked saunders  before the doubts of the second mate could be resolved the esquimaux uttered another exclamation and pointed to another dark object a quarter of a mile to the right  it was soon found that there were several of these ocean elephants sporting about in the neighbourhood and bursting up the young ice that had formed on several holes by using their huge heads as batteringrams  it was quickly arranged that the party should divide into three and while a few remained behind to watch and restrain the dogs the remainder were to advance on foot to the attack  saunders buzzby amos parr davie summers and awatok formed one party and advanced with two muskets and several spears towards the walrus that had been first seen the sailors taking care to keep in rear of awatok in order to follow his lead for they were as yet ignorant of the proper mode of attack  awatok led the party stealthily towards a hummock behind which he caused them to crouch until the walrus should dive  this it did in a few minutes and then they all rushed from their place of concealment towards another hummock that lay about fifty yards from the hole  just as they reached it and crouched the walrus rose snorting the brine from its shaggy muzzle and lashing the water into foam with its flippers  losh what a big un exclaimed saunders in amazement and well he might for this was an unusually large animal more like an elephant in size than anything else  it had two enormous ivory tusks with which it tore and pounded large fragments from the icetables while it barked like a gigantic dog and rolled its heavy form about in sport  awatok now whispered to his comrades and attempted to get them to understand that they must follow him as fast as possible at the next run  suddenly the walrus dived  awatok rushed forward and in another instant stood at the edge of the hole with his spear in readiness in his right hand and the coil of line in his left  the others joined him instantly and they had scarcely come up when the huge monster again rose to the surface  saunders and buzzby fired at his head the moment it appeared above water and awatok at the same time planted a spear in his breast and ran back with the coil  the others danced about in an excited state throwing their spears and missing their mark although it was a big one frequently  give him a lancethrust amos cried saunders reloading his piece  but amos could not manage it for the creature lashed about so furiously that although he made repeated attempts he failed to do more than prick its tough sides and render it still more savage  buzzby too made several daring efforts to lance it but failed and nearly slipped into the hole in his recklessness  it was a wild scene of confusion the spray was dashed over the ice round the hole and the men as they ran about in extreme excitement slipped and occasionally tumbled in their haste while the maddened brute glared at them like a fiend and bellowed in its anger and pain  suddenly it dived leaving the men staring at each other  the sudden cessation of noise and turmoil had a very strange effect  ist away enquired saunders with a look of chagrin  he was answered almost instantly by the walrus reappearing and making furious efforts by means of its flippers and tusks to draw itself out upon the ice while it roared with redoubled energy  the shot that was instantly fired seemed to have no effect and the welldirected harpoon of awatok was utterly disregarded by it  amos parr however gave it a lancethrust that caused it to howl vehemently and dyed the foam with its blood  hand me a spear buzzby cried saunders the musketballs seem to hurt him as little as peas  oot o my gait  the second mate made a rush so tremendous that something awful would infallibly have resulted had he not struck his foot against a bit of ice and fallen violently on his breast  the impetus with which he had started shot him forward till his head was within a foot of the walruss grim muzzle  for one moment the animal looked at the man as if it were surprised at his audacity and then it recommenced its frantic struggles snorting blood and foam and water into saunderss face as he scrambled out of its way  immediately after awatok fixed another harpoon in its side and it dived again  the struggle that ensued was tremendous and the result seemed for a long time to be doubtful  again and again shots were fired and spearthrusts made with effect but the huge creature seemed invulnerable  its ferocity and strength remained unabated while the mensailors and esquimaux alikewere nearly exhausted  the battle had now lasted three hours the men were panting from exertion the walrus still bellowing was clinging to the edge of the ice which for several yards round the hole was covered with blood and foam  wot a brute it is said buzzby sitting down on a lump of ice and looking at it in despair  we might have killed it lang ago had i not wet my gun growled saunders regarding his weapon which was completely drenched with a look of contempt  give it another poke awatok cried amos parr youll know best whereabouts its life lies i can make nothin ot  awatok obeyed and gave it a thrust under the left flipper that seemed to reach its heart for it fell back into the water and struggled violently  at the same moment davie summers mounted to the top of a hummock part of which overhung the pool and launched a harpoon down upon its back  this latter blow seemed to revive its ferocity for it again essayed to clamber out on the ice and looked up at davie with a glance of seeming indignation while buzzby who had approached fell backward as he retreated from before it  at the same time saunders succeeded in getting his musket to go off  the ball struck it in the eye and entering the brain caused instant death a result which was greeted with three enthusiastic cheers  the getting of this enormous creature out of the water would have been a matter of no small difficulty had there not been such a large party present  even as it was it took them a considerable time to accomplish this feat and to cut it up and pack it on the sledges  while the battle above described was going on two smaller walrus had been killed and secured and the esquimaux were in a state of great glee for previous to the arrival of the sailors they had been unsuccessful in their hunts and had been living on short allowance  on returning home there was a general feasting and merrymaking and saunders felt that if he remained there long they would not only eat up their own meat but his also  he therefore resolved to return immediately to the ship with his prize and leave part of his men behind to continue the hunt until he should return with the sledge  but he was prevented from putting this intention into practice by a hurricane which burst over the arctic regions with inconceivable bitterness and for two days kept all the inhabitants of the snowvillage confined to their huts  this hurricane was the fiercest that had swept over these bleak regions of ice since the arrival of the dolphin  the wind shrieked as it swept round the cliffs and down the ravines and out upon the frozen sea as if a legion of evil spirits were embodied and concentrated in each succeeding blast  the snowdrift rose in solid masses whirled madly round for a few seconds and then was caught by the blast and swept away like sheets of white flame  the thermometer stood at 23 degrees below zero a temperature that was mild compared with what it usually had been of late but the fierce wind abstracted heat from everything exposed to it so rapidly that neither man nor beast could face it for a moment  buzzby got a little bit of his chin frozen while he merely put his head out at the door of the hut to see how the weather looked and davie summers had one of his fingers slightly frozen while in the act of carrying in one of the muskets that had been left outside by mistake  as for the esquimaux they recked not of the weather  their snowhuts were warm and their mouths were full so like wise men and women they waited patiently withindoors till the storm should blow itself out the doings of these poor people were very curious  they ate voraciously and evidently preferred their meat raw  but when the sailors showed disgust at this they at once made a small fire of moss mingled with blubber over which they halfcooked their food  their mode of procuring fire was curious  two small stones were taken one a piece of white quartz the other a piece of ironstone and struck together smartly the few sparks that flew out were thrown upon a kind of white down found on the willows under which was placed a lump of dried moss  it was usually a considerable time before they succeeded in catching a spark but once caught they had no difficulty in blowing it into a flame  they had also an ingenious contrivance for melting snow  this was a flat stone supported by two other stones and inclined slightly at one end upon this flat stone a lump of snow was placed and below it was kindled a small fire of moss and blubber  when the stone became heated the snow melted and flowed down the incline into a small sealskin cup placed there to catch it  during the continuance of the storm the sailors shared the food and lodging of these esquimaux  they were a fat oily hospitable dirty race and vied with each other in showing kindness to those who had been thus thrown into their society  as davie summers expressed it they were regular trumps and according to buzzbys opinion they wos the jolliest set o human walrusses wot he had ever comed across in all his travels and he ought to know for he had always kep his weathereye open he had and wouldnt give in on that pint he wouldnt to no man livin    chapter nineteen  the northern partya narrow escape and a great discoveryesquimaux again and a joyful surprise  it is interesting to meditate sometimes on the deviousness of the paths by which men are led in earthly affairseven when the startingpoint and object of pursuit are the same  the two parties which left the dolphin had for their object the procuring of fresh food  the one went south and the other north but their field was the samethe surface of the frozen sea and the margin of the icegirt shore  yet how different their experiences and results were the sequel will show  as we have already said the northern party was in command of bolton the first mate and consisted of ten men among whom were our hero fred peter grim oriley and meetuck with the whole team of dogs and the large sledge  being fine weather when they set out they travelled rapidly making twenty miles as near as they could calculate in the first six hours the dogs pulled famously and the men stepped out well at first being cheered and invigorated mentally by the prospect of an adventurous excursion and fresh meat  at the end of the second day they buried part of their stock of provisions at the foot of a conspicuous cliff intending to pick it up on their return and thus lightened they advanced more rapidly keeping farther out on the floes in hopes of falling in with walrus or seals  their hopes however were doomed to disappointment  they got only one seal and that was a small onescarcely sufficient to afford a couple of meals to the dogs  they were misfortunate entirely as oriley remarked and to add to their misfortunes the floeice became so rugged that they could scarcely advance at all  things grow worse and worse remarked grim as the sledge for the twentieth time that day plunged into a crack in the ice and had to be unloaded ere it could be got out  the sledge wont stand much o sich work and if it breaksgoodbye to it for it wont mend without wood and theres none here  no fear of it cried bolton encouragingly its made of material as tough as your own sinews grim and wont give way easily as the thumps it has withstood already prove  has it never struck you fred he continued turning to our hero who was plodding forward in silencehas it never struck you that when things in this world get very bad and we begin to feel inclined to give up they somehow or other begin to get better  why yes i have noticed that but i have a vague sort of feeling just now that things are not going to get better  i dont know whether its this longcontinued darkness or the want of good food but i feel more downcast than i ever was in my life before  boltons remark had been intended to cheer but freds answer proved that a discussion of the merits of the question was not likely to have a good effect on the men whose spirits were evidently very much cast down so he changed the subject  fortunately at that time an incident occurred which effected the mates purpose better than any efforts man could have made  it has frequently happened that when arctic voyagers have from sickness and long confinement during a monotonous winter become so depressed in spirits that games and amusements of every kind failed to rouse them from their lethargic despondency sudden danger has given to their minds the needful impulse and effected a salutary change for a time at least in their spirits  such was the case at the present time  the men were so worn with hard travel and the want of fresh food and depressed by disappointment and longcontinued darkness that they failed in their attempts to cheer each other and at length relapsed into moody silence freds thoughts turned constantly to his father and he ceased to remark cheerfully as was his wont on passing objects  even orileys jests became few and far between and at last ceased altogether  bolton alone kept up his spirits and sought to cheer his men the feeling of responsibility being probably the secret of his superiority over them in this respect  but even boltons spirits began to sink at last  while they were thus groping sadly along among the hummocks a large fragment of ice was observed to break off from a berg just over their heads  look out follow me quick shouted the first mate in a loud sharp voice of alarm at the same time darting in towards the side of the berg  the startled men obeyed the order just in time for they had barely reached the side of the berg when the enormous pinnacle fell and was shattered into a thousand fragments on the spot they had just left  a rebounding emotion sent the blood in a crimson flood to freds forehead and this was followed by a feeling of gratitude to the almighty for the preservation of himself and the party  leaving the dangerous vicinity of the bergs they afterwards kept more inshore  what can yonder mound be said fred pointing to an object that was faintly seen at a short distance off upon the bleak shore  an esquimaux hut maybe replied grim  what thinkee meetuck  meetuck shook his head and looked grave but made no reply  why dont you answer said bolton but come along well soon see  meetuck now made various ineffectual attempts to dissuade the party from examining the mound which turned out to be composed of stones heaped upon each other but as all the conversation of which he was capable failed to enlighten his companions as to what the pile was they instantly set to work to open a passage into the interior believing that it might contain fresh provisions as the esquimaux were in the habit of thus preserving their superabundant food from bears and wolves in half an hour a hole large enough for a man to creep through was formed and fred entered but started back with an exclamation of horror on finding himself in the presence of a human skeleton which was seated on the ground in the centre of this strange tomb with its head and arms resting on the knees  it must be an esquimaux grave said fred as he retreated hastily that must be the reason why meetuck tried to hinder us  i should like to see it said grim stooping and thrusting his head and shoulders into the hole  what have you got there asked bolton as grim drew back and held up something in his hand  dont know exactly  its like a bit o cloth  on examination the article was found to be a shred of coarse cloth of a blue or black colour and being an unexpected substance to meet with in such a place bolton turned round with it to meetuck in the hope of obtaining some information  but meetuck was gone  while the sailors were breaking into the grave meetuck had stood aloof with a displeased expression of countenance as if he were angry at the rude desecration of a countrymans tomb but the moment his eye fell on the shred of cloth an expression of mingled surprise and curiosity crossed his countenance and without uttering a word he slipped noiselessly into the hole from which he almost immediately issued bearing several articles in his hand these he held up to view and with animated words and gesticulations explained that this was the grave of a white man not of a native  the articles he brought out were a pewter plate and a silver tablespoon  theres a name of some kind written here said bolton as he carefully scrutinised the spoon  look here fred your eyes are better than mine see if you can make it out  fred took it with a trembling hand for a strange feeling of dread had seized possession of his heart and he could scarcely bring himself to look upon it  he summoned up courage however but at the first glance his hand fell down by his side and a dimness came over his eyes for the word pole star was engraven on the handle  he would have fallen to the ground had not bolton caught him  dont give way lad the ship may be all right  perhaps this is one o the crew that died  fred did not answer but recovering himself with a strong effort he said pull down the stones men  the men obeyed in silence and the poor boy sat down on a rock to await the result in trembling anxiety  a few minutes sufficed to disentomb the skeleton for the men sympathised with their young comrade and worked with all their energies  cheer up fred said bolton coming and laying his hand on the youths shoulder its not your father  there is a bit of black hair sticking to the scalp  with a fervent expression of thankfulness fred rose and examined the skeleton which had been placed in a sort of sack of skin but was destitute of clothing  it was quite dry and must have been there a long time  nothing else was found but from the appearance of the skull and the presence of the plate and spoon there could be no doubt that it was that of one of the pole stars crew  it was now resolved that they should proceed along the coast and examine every creek and bay for traces of the lost vessel  oh bolton my heart misgives me said fred as they drove along i fear that they have all perished  niver a bit sir said oriley in a sympathising tone yon chap must have died and been buried here be the crew as they wint past  you forget that sailors dont bury men under mounds of stone with pewter plates and spoons beside them  oriley was silenced for the remark was unanswerable  he may ha bin left or lost on the shore and been found by the esquimaux suggested peter grim  is that not another tomb enquired one of the men pointing towards an object which stood on the end of a point or cape towards which they were approaching  ere anyone could reply their ears were saluted by the wellknown bark of a pack of esquimaux dogs  in another moment they dashed into the midst of a snow village and were immediately surrounded by the excited natives  for some time no information could be gleaned from their interpreter who was too excited to make use of his meagre amount of english  they observed however that the natives although much excited did not seem to be so much surprised at the appearance of white men amongst them as those were whom they had first met with near the ship  in a short time meetuck apparently had expended all he had to say to his friends and turned to make explanations to bolton in a very excited tone but little more could be made out than that what he said had some reference to white men  at length in desperation he pointed to a large hut which seemed to be the principal one of the village and dragging the mate towards it made signs to him to enter  bolton hesitated an instant  he wants you to see the chief of the tribe no doubt said fred youd better go in at once  a loud voice shouted something in the esquimaux language from within the hut  at the sound freds heart beat violently and pushing past the mate he crept through the tunnelled entrance and stood within  there was little furniture in this rude dwelling  a dull flame flickered in a stone lamp which hung from the roof and revealed the figure of a large esquimaux reclining on a couch of skins at the raised side of the hut  the man looked up hastily as fred entered and uttered a few unintelligible words  father cried fred gasping for breath and springing forward  captain ellice for it was indeed he started with apparent difficulty and pain into a sitting posture and throwing back his hood revealed a face whose open hearty benignant expression shone through a coat of dark brown which long months of toil and exposure had imprinted on it it was thin however and careworn and wore an expression that seemed to be the result of longcontinued suffering  father he exclaimed in an earnest tone who calls me father  dont you know me fatherdont you remember fredlook at  fred checked himself for the wild look of his father frightened him  ah these dreams murmured the old man i wish they did not come so  placing his hand on his forehead he fell backwards in a state of insensibility into the arms of his son    chapter twenty  keeping it downmutual explanationsdeathnewyears day  it need scarcely be said that the sailors outside did not remain long in ignorance of the unexpected and happy discovery related in the last chapter  bolton who had crept in after fred with proper delicacy of feeling retired the moment he found how matters stood and left father and son to expend in the privacy of that chamber of snow those feelings and emotions which can be better imagined than described  the first impulse of the men was to give three cheers but bolton checked them in the bud  no no lads  we must hold on he said in an eager but subdued voice doubtless it would be pleasant to vent our feelings in a hearty cheer but it would startle the old gentleman inside  get along with you and let us get ready a good supper  oh morther exclaimed oriley holding on to his sides as if he believed what he said me bilerll bust av ye dont let me screech  squeeze down the safetyvalve a bit longer then cried bolton as they hurried along with the whole population to the outskirts of the village  now then ye may fire away they wont hear yehuzza  a long enthusiastic cheer distantly burst from the sailors and was immediately followed by a howl of delight from the esquimaux who capered round their visitors with uncouth gestures and grinning faces  entering one of the largest huts preparations for supper were promptly begun  the esquimaux happened to be well supplied with walrus flesh so the lamps were replenished and the hiss of the frying steaks and dropping fat speedily rose above all other sounds  meanwhile fred and his father having mutually recovered somewhat of their wonted composure began to tell each other the details of their adventures since they last met while the former prepared a cup of coffee and a steak for their mutual comfort  but father said fred busying himself at the lamp you have not yet told me how you came here and what has become of the pole star and how it was that one of your men came to be buried in the esquimaux fashion and how you got your leg broken  truly fred i have not told you all that and to give it you all in detail will afford us many a long hour of converse hereafter if it please god whose tenderness and watchful care of me has never failed but i can give you a brief outline of it thus  i got into baffins bay and made a good fishing of it the first year but was beset in the ice and compelled to spend two winters in these regions  the third year we were liberated and had almost got fairly on our homeward voyage when a storm blew us to the north and carried us up here  then our good brig was nipped and went to the bottom and all the crew were lost except myself and one man  we succeeded in leaping from one piece of loose ice to another until we reached the solid floe and gained the land where we were kindly received by the esquimaux but poor wilson did not survive long  his constitution had never been robust and he died of consumption a week after we landed  the esquimaux buried him after their own fashion and as i afterwards found had buried a plate and a spoon along with him  these with several other articles had been washed ashore from the wreck  since then i have been living the life of an esquimaux awaiting an opportunity of escape either by a ship making its appearance or a tribe of natives travelling south  i soon picked up their language and was living in comparative comfort when during a sharp fight i chanced to have with a polar bear i fell and broke my leg  i have lain here for many months and have suffered much fred but thank god i am now almost well and can walk a little though not yet without pain  dear father said fred how terribly you must have felt the want of kind hands to nurse you during those dreary months and how lonely you must have been  it were impossible here to enter minutely into the details of all that captain ellice related to fred during the next few days while they remained together in the esquimaux village  to tell of the dangers the adventures and the hairbreadth escapes that the crew of the pole star went through before the vessel finally went down would require a whole volume  we must pass it all over and also the account of the few days that followed during which sundry walrus were captured and return to the dolphin to which captain ellice had been conveyed on the sledge carefully wrapped up in deerskins and tended by fred  a party of the esquimaux accompanied them and as a number of the natives from the other village had returned with saunders and his men to the ship the scene she presented when all parties were united was exceedingly curious and animated  the esquimaux soon built quite a little town of snowhuts all round the dolphin and the noise of traffic and intercourse was peculiarly refreshing to the ears of those who had long been accustomed to the deathlike stillness of an arctic winter  the beneficial effect of the change on men and dogs was instantaneous  their spirits rose at once and this with the ample supply of fresh meat that had been procured soon began to drive scurvy away  there was one dark spot however in this otherwise pleasant sceneone impending event that cast a gloom over all  in his narrow berth in the cabin joseph west lay dying  scurvy had acted more rapidly on his delicate frame than had been expected  despite tom singletons utmost efforts and skill the fell disease gained the mastery and it soon became evident that this hearty and excellent man was to be taken away from them  during the last days of his illness captain ellice was his greatest comfort and his constant companion  it was on christmasday that west died  next day the body of joseph west was put in a plain deal coffin and conveyed to store island where it was placed on the ground  they had no instruments that could penetrate the hard rock so were obliged to construct a tomb of stones after the manner of the esquimaux under which the coffin was laid and left in solitude  newyears day came and preparations were made to celebrate the day with the usual festivities  but the recent death had affected the crew too deeply to allow them to indulge in the unrestrained hilarity of that season  prayers were read in the morning and both captain guy and captain ellice addressed the men feelingly in allusion to their late shipmates death and their own present position  a good dinner was also prepared and several luxuries served out among which were the materials for the construction of a large plumpudding  but no grog was allowed and they needed it not  as the afternoon advanced stories were told and even songs were sung but these were of a quiet kind and the men seemed from an innate feeling of propriety to suit them to the occasion  old friends were recalled and old familiar scenes described the hearths of home were spoken of with a depth of feeling that showed how intense was the longing to be seated round them again and future prospects were canvassed with keen interest and with hopeful voices new years day came and went and when it was gone the men of the dolphin did not say what a jolly day it was  they said little or nothing but long after they thought of it as a bright spot in their dreary winter in the bay of mercyas a day in which they had enjoyed earnest glad and sober communings of heart    chapter twenty one  first gleam of lighttrip to welcome the sunbears and strange discoveriesoriley is recklessfirst view of the sun  the wisest of men has told us that it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold the sun but only those who spend a winter in the arctic regions can fully appreciate the import of that inspired saying  it is absolutely essential to existence that the bright beams of the great luminary should fall on animal as well as plant  most of the poor dogs died for want of this blessed light and had it been much longer withheld doubtless our navigators would have sunk also  about the 20th of january a faint gleam of light on the horizon told of the coming day  it was hailed with rapture and long before the bright sun himself appeared on the southern horizon the most of the men made daily excursions to the neighbouring hilltops to catch sight of as much as possible of his faint rays  day by day those rays expanded and at last a sort of dawn enlightened a distant portion of their earth which faint though it was at first had much the appearance in their eyes of a bright day  but time wore on and real day appeared  the red sun rose in all its glory showed a rim of its glowing disc above the frozen sea and then sank leaving a long gladsome smile of twilight behind  this great event happened on the 19th of february and would have occurred sooner but for the high cliffs to the southward which intervened between the ship and the horizon  on the day referred to a large party was formed to go to the top of the cliffs at red snow valley to welcome back the sun  theres scarce a man left behind remarked captain guy as they started on this truly joyous expedition  only mizzle sir said buzzby slapping his hands together for the cold was intense he said as how hed stop and have dinner ready agin our return  there was a general laugh from the men who knew that the worthy cook had other reasons for not goingnamely his shortness of wind and his inveterate dislike to ascend hills  come fred cried captain ellice who had completely recovered from his accident i shall be quite jealous of your friend singleton if you bestow so much of your company on him  walk with me sirrah i command you as i wish to have a chat  you are unjust to me replied fred taking his fathers arm and falling with him a little to the rear of the party tom complains that i have quite given him up of late  och isnt it a purty sight remarked oriley to mivins to see us all goin out like good little childers to see the sun rise of a beautiful mornin like this  so it his answered mivins but i wish it wasnt quite so cold  it was indeed coldso cold that the men had to beat their hands together and stamp their feet and rush about like real children in order to keep their bodies warm  this month of february was the coldest they had yet experienced  several times the thermometer fell to the unexampled temperature of 75 degrees below zero or 107 degrees below the freezingpoint of water  when we remind our young readers that the thermometer in england seldom falls so low as zero except in what we term weather of the utmost severity they may imagineor rather they may try to imaginewhat 75 degrees below zero must have been  it was not quite so cold as that upon this occasion otherwise the men could not have shown face to it  lets have leapfrog shouted davie we can jump along as well as walk along  hooray hup  the hup was rather an exclamation of necessity than of delight inasmuch as that it was caused by davie coming suddenly down flat on the ice in the act of vainly attempting to go leapfrog over mivinss head  thats your sort cried amos parr down with you buzzby  buzzby obeyed and amos being heavy and past the agile time of life leaped upon instead of over his back and there stuck  not so high lads cried captain guy  come mr saunders give us a back  faix hed better go on his hands an knees  thats it over you go hurrah lads  in five minutes nearly the whole crew were panting from their violent exertions and those who did not or could not join panted as much from laughter  the desired result however was speedily gained  they were all soon in a glow of heat and bade defiance to the frost  an hours sharp climb brought the party almost to the brow of the hill from which they hoped to see the sun rise for the first time for nearly five months  just as they were about to pass over a ridge in the cliffs captain guy who had pushed on in advance with tom singleton was observed to pause abruptly and make signals for the men to advance with caution  he evidently saw something unusual for he crouched behind a rock and peeped over it  hastening up as silently as possible they discovered that a group of polar bears were amusing themselves on the other side of the cliffs within long gunshot  unfortunately not one of the party had brought firearms  intent only on catching a sight of the sun they had hurried off unmindful of the possibility of their catching sight of anything else  they had not even a spear and the few oak cudgels that some carried however effectual they might have proved at donnybrook were utterly worthless there  there were four large bears and a young one and the gambols they performed were of the most startling as well as amusing kind  but that which interested and surprised the crew most was the fact that these bears were playing with barrels and casks and tentpoles and sails they were engaged in a regular frolic with these articles tossing them up in the air pawing them about and leaping over them like kittens in these movements they displayed their enormous strength several times their leaps although performed with the utmost ease were so great as to prove the iron nature of their muscles  they tossed the heavy casks too high in the air like tennisballs and in two instances while the crew were watching them dashed a cask in pieces with a slight blow of their paws  the tough canvas yielded before them like sheets of paper and the havoc they committed was wonderful to behold  most extraordinary exclaimed captain guy after watching them for some time in silence  i cannot imagine where these creatures can have got hold of such things  were not the goods at store island all right this morning mr bolton  yes sir they were  nothing missing from the ship  no sir nothing  its most unaccountable  captain guy said oriley addressing his commander with a solemn face havent ye more nor wance towld me the queer thing in the deserts they calls the mirage  i have answered the captain with a puzzled look  an didnt ye say there was something like it in the polar seas that made ye see flags an ships an things o that sort when there was no sich things there at all  true oriley i did  faix then its my opinion that yon bears is a mirage an the sooner we git out o their way the better  a smothered laugh greeted this solution of the difficulty  i think i can give a better explanationbegging your pardon oriley said captain ellice who had hitherto looked on with a sly smile  more than a year ago when i was driven past this place to the northward i took advantage of a calm to land a supply of food and a few stores and medicines to be a standby in case my ship should be wrecked to the northward  ever since the wreck actually took place i have looked forward to this cache of provisions as a point of refuge on my way south  as i have already told you i have never been able to commence the southward journey and now i dont require these things which is lucky for the bears seem to have appropriated them entirely  had i known of them sooner captain said captain guy the bears should not have had a chance  that accounts for the supply of tobacco and stickingplaster we found in the bears stomach remarked fred laughing  true boy yet it surprises me that they succeeded in breaking into my cache for it was made of heavy masses of stone many of which required two and three men to lift them even with the aid of handspikes  whats wrong with oriley said fred pointing to that eccentric individual who was gazing intently at the bears muttering between his teeth and clenching his cudgel nervously  shure its a cryin shame he soliloquised in an undertone quite unconscious that he was observed that ye should escape ye villains av i only had a musket nowbut i hant  arrah av it was only a spear  be the mortial  i think i could crack the skull o the small wan  faix then ill try  at the last word before anyone was aware of his intentions this son of erin whose blood was now up sprang down the cliffs towards the bears flourishing his stick and shouting wildly as he went  the bears instantly paused in their game but showed no disposition to retreat  come back you madman shouted the captain but the captain shouted in vain  stop halt come back chorused the crew  but oriley was deaf he had advanced to within a few yards of the bears and was rushing forward to make a vigorous attack on the little one  hell be killed exclaimed fred in dismay  follow me men shouted the captain as he leaped the ridge make all the noise you can  in a moment the surrounding cliffs were reverberating with the loud halloos and frantic yells of the men as they burst suddenly over the ridge and poured down upon the bears like a torrent of maniacs  bold though they were they couldnt stand this  they turned tail and fled followed by the disappointed howls of oriley and also by his cudgel which he hurled violently after them as he pulled up  having thus triumphantly put the enemy to flight the party continued their ascent of the hill and soon gained the summit  there it is shouted fred who in company with mivins first crossed the ridge and tossed his arms in the air  the men cheered loudly as they hurried up and one by one emerged into a red glow of sunshine  it could not be termed warm for it had no power in that frosty atmosphere and only a small portion of the suns disc was visible  but his light was on every crag and peak around and as the men sat down in groups and as it were bathed in the sunshine winking at the bright gleam of light with halfclosed eyes they declared that it felt warm and wouldnt hear anything to the contrary although saunders true to his nature endeavoured to prove to them that the infinitely small degree of heat imparted by such feeble rays could not by any possibility be felt except in imagination  but saunders was outvoted  indeed under the circumstances he had not a chance of proving his point for the more warm the dispute became the greater was the amount of animal heat that was created to be placed falsely to the credit of the sun  patience however is a virtue which is sure to meet with a reward  the point which saunders failed to prove by argument was pretty well proved to everyone though not admitted by the agency of john frost  that remarkably bitter individual nestled round the men as they sat sunning themselves and soon compelled them to leap up and apply to other sources for heat  they danced about vigorously and again took to leapfrog  then they tried their powers at the old familiar games of home  hopstepandjump raised the animal thermometer considerably and the standing leap running leap and high leap sent it up many degrees but a general race brought them almost to a summer temperature and at the same time most unexpectedly secured to them a hare  this little creature of which very few had yet been procured darted in an evil hour out from behind a rock right in front of the men who having begun the race for sport now continued it energetically for profit  a dozen sticks were hurled at the luckless hare and one of these felled it to the ground  after this they returned home in triumph keeping up all the way an animated dispute as to the amount of heat shed upon them by the sun and upon that knotty question  who killed the hare  neither point was settled when they reached the dolphin and we may add for the sake of the curious reader neither point is settled yet    chapter twenty two  the arctic sunrats  rats  ratsa huntingpartyout on the floeshardships  among the many schemes that were planned and carried out for lightening the long hours of confinement to their wooden home in the arctic regions was the newspaper started by fred ellice and named as we have already mentioned the arctic sun  it was so named because as fred stated in his first leading article it was intended to throw light on many things at a time when there was no other sun to cheer them  we cannot help regretting that it is not in our power to present a copy of this wellthumbed periodical to our readers but being of opinion that something is better than nothing we transcribe the following extract as a specimen of the contributions from the forecastle  it was entitled  john buzzbys oppinyuns o things in ginral  mr editeras you was so good as to ax from me a contribootion to your waluable peeryoddical i beg heer to stait that this heer article is intended as a ginral summery o the noos wots agoin  your reeders will be glad to no that of late the wethers bin gittin colder but theyll be better pleased to no that before the middle o nixt sumer its likely to git a long chawk warmer  theres a ginral complaint heer that mivins has bin eatin the shuger in the pantry an thats wots makin it needfull to put us on short allowance  davie summers sais he seed him at it and its a dooty the guvermint owes to the publik to have the matter investigated  its ginrally expected howsever that the guvermint wont trubble its hed with the matter theres bin an onusual swarmin o rats in the ship of late an davie summers has had a riglar hunt after them  the lad has becum more than ornar expert with his bow an arrow for he niver misses nowexceptin always when he dusnt hitan for the most part takes them on the pint on the snowt with his bluntheded arow which he drives inthe snowt not the arow  theres a ginral wish among the crew to no whether the north pole is a pole or a dot  mizzle sais its a dot and oriley swears no he dont do that for weve gin up swearin in the fogsail but he sais that its a real post bout as thick again as the mainmast an nine or ten times as hy  grim sais its nother wun thing nor anuther but a hydeear that is sumhow or other a fact but yit dont exist at all  tom green wants to no if theres any conexshun between it an the pole thats connected with elections  in fact were all at sea in a riglar muz abut this an as dr singletons a syentiffick man praps hell give us a leadin article in your nixtso no more at present from  yours to command john buzzby  this contribution was accompanied with an outline illustration of mivins eating sugar with a ladle in the pantry and davie summers peeping in at the doorboth likenesses being excellent  some of the articles in the arctic sun were grave and some were gay but all of them were profitable for fred took care that they should be charged either with matter of interest or matter provocative of mirth and assuredly no newspaper of similar calibre was ever looked forward to with such expectation or read and reread with such avidity  it was one of the expedients that lasted longest in keeping up the spirits of the men  the rathunting referred to in the foregoing summery was not a mere fiction of buzzbys brain  it was a veritable fact  notwithstanding the extreme cold of this inhospitable climate the rats in the ship increased to such a degree that at last they became a perfect nuisance nothing was safe from their attacks whether substances were edible or not they were gnawed through and ruined and their impudence which seemed to increase with their numbers at last exceeded all belief they swarmed everywhereunder the stove about the beds in the lockers between the sofacushions amongst the moss round the walls and inside the boots and mittens when empty of the men  and they became so accustomed to having missiles thrown at them that they acquired to perfection that art which buzzby described as keeping ones weathereye open  you couldnt hit one if you tried  if your hand moved towards an object with which you intended to deal swift destruction the intruder paused and turned his sharp eyes towards you as if to say what going to try it againcome then heres a chance for you  but when you threw at best you could only hit the empty space it had occupied the moment before  or if you seized a stick and rushed at the enemy in wrath it grinned fiercely showed its long white teeth and then vanished with a fling of its tail that could be construed into nothing but an expression of contempt  at last an expedient was hit upon for destroying these disagreeable inmates  small bows and arrows were made the latter having heavy blunt heads and with these the men slaughtered hundreds  whenever anyone was inclined for a little sport he took up his bow and arrows and retiring to a dark corner of the cabin watched for a shot  davie summers acquired the title of nimrod in consequence of his success in this peculiar field  at first the rats proved a capital addition to the dogs meals but at length some of the men were glad to eat them especially when fresh meat failed altogether and scurvy began its assaults  white or arctic foxes too came about the ship sometimes in great numbers and proved an acceptable addition to their fresh provisions but at one period all these sources failed and the crew were reduced to the utmost extremity having nothing to eat except salt provisions  notwithstanding the cheering influence of the sun the spirits of the men fell as their bodily energies failed  nearly twothirds of the ships company were confined to their berths  the officers retained much of their wonted health and vigour partly in consequence no doubt of their unwearied exertions in behalf of others  they changed places with the men at last owing to the force of circumstancesministering to their wants drawing water fetching fuel and cooking their foodcarrying out in short the divine command by love serve one another  during the worst period of their distress a party was formed to go out upon the floes in search of walrus  if we dont get speedy relief remarked captain guy to tom singleton in reference to this party some of us will die  i feel certain of that  poor buzzby seems on his last legs and mivins is reduced to a shadow  the doctor was silent for the captains remark was too true  you must get up your party at once and set off after breakfast mr bolton he added turning to the first mate  who can accompany you  theres peter grim sir hes tough yet and not much affected by scurvy and mr saunders i think may  no interrupted the doctor saunders must not go  he does not look very ill and i hope is not but i dont like some of his symptoms  well doctor we can do without him  theres tom green and oriley nothing seems able to bring down oriley  then theres  theres fred ellice cried fred himself joining the group ill go with you if youll take me  most happy to have you sir our healthy hands are very short but we can muster sufficient i think  the captain suggested amos parr and two or three more men and then dismissed his first mate to get ready for an immediate start  i dont half like your going fred said his father  youve not been well lately and hunting on the floes i know from experience is hard work  dont fear for me father ive quite recovered from my recent attack which was but slight after all and i know full well that those who are well must work as long as they can stand  ho lads look alive there are you ready shouted the first mate down the hatchway  ay ay sir replied grim and in a few minutes the party were assembled on the ice beside the small sledge with their shoulderbelts on for most of the dogs were either dead or dying of that strange complaint to which allusion has been made in a previous chapter  they set out silently but ere they had got a dozen yards from the ship captain guy felt the impropriety of permitting them thus to depart  up lads and give them three cheers he cried mounting the ships side and setting the example  a hearty generous spirit when vigorously displayed always finds a ready response from human hearts  the few sailors who were on deck at the time and one or two of the sick men who chanced to put their heads up the hatchway rushed to the side waved their mittensin default of capsand gave vent to three hearty british cheers  the effect on the drooping spirits of the huntingparty was electrical  they pricked up like chargers that had felt the spur wheeled round and returned the cheer with interest  it was an apparently trifling incident but it served to lighten the way and make it seem less dreary for many a long mile  im tired of it entirely cried oriley sitting down on a hummock on the evening of the second day after setting out on the hunt here we is two days out and not a sign o life nowhere  come dont give in said bolton cheerfully were sure to fall in with a walrus today  i think so cried fred we have come so far out upon the floes that there must be open water near  come on then cried peter grim dont waste time talking  thus urged oriley rose and throwing his sledgestrap over his shoulder plodded on wearily with the rest  their provisions were getting low now and it was felt that if they did not soon fall in with walrus or bears they must return as quickly as possible to the ship in order to avoid starving  it was therefore a matter of no small satisfaction that on turning the edge of an iceberg they discovered a large bear walking leisurely towards them  to drop their sledgelines and seize their muskets was the work of a moment but unfortunately long travelling had filled the pans with snow and it required some time to pick the touchholes clear  in this extremity peter grim seized a hatchet and ran towards it while oriley charged it with a spear  grim delivered a tremendous blow at its head with his weapon but his intention was better than his aim for he missed the bear and smashed the corner of a hummock of ice  oriley was more successful  he thrust the spear into the animals shoulder but the shoulderblade turned the head of the weapon and caused it to run along at least three feet just under the skin  the wound although not fatal was so painful that bruin uttered a loud roar of disapproval wheeled round and ran awayan act of cowardice so unusual on the part of a polar bear that the whole party were taken by surprise  several shots were fired after him but he soon disappeared among the icehummocks having fairly made off with orileys spear  the disappointment caused by this was great but they had little time to think of it for soon after a stiff breeze of wind sprang up which freshened into a gale compelling them to seek the shelter of a cluster of icebergs in the midst of which they built a snowhut  before night a terrific storm was raging with the thermometer 40 degrees below zero the sky became black as ink drift whirled round them in horrid turmoil and the wild blast came direct from the north over the frozen sea shrieking and howling in its strength and fury  all that night and the next day it continued  then it ceased and for the first time that winter a thaw set in so that ere morning their sleepingbags and socks were thoroughly wetted  this was of short duration however  in a few hours the frost set in again as intense as ever converting all their wet garments and bedding into hard cakes of ice  to add to their misfortunes their provisions ran out and they were obliged to abandon the hut and push forward towards the ship with the utmost speed  night came on them while they were slowly toiling through the deep drifts that the late gale had raised and to their horror they found they had wandered out of their way and were still but a short distance from their snowhut  in despair they returned to pass the night in it and spreading their frozen sleepingbags on the snow they lay down silent and supperless to rest till morning    chapter twenty three  unexpected arrivalsthe rescuepartylost and foundreturn to the ship  the sixth night after the huntingparty had left the ship grim and fred ellice suddenly made their appearance on board  it was quite dark and the few of the ships company who were able to quit their berths were seated round the cabin at their meagre evening meal  hallo fred exclaimed captain ellice as his son staggered rather than walked in and sank down on a locker  whats wrong boy where are the rest of you  fred could not answer neither he nor grim were able to utter a word at first  it was evident that they laboured under extreme exhaustion and hunger  a mouthful of hot soup administered by tom singleton rallied them a little however  our comrades are lost i fear  lost exclaimed captain guy  how so  speak my boy but hold take another mouthful before you speak  where did you leave them say you  fred looked at the captain with a vacant stare  out upon the ice to the north but i say what a comical dream ive had  here he burst into a loud laugh  poor freds head was evidently affected so his father and tom carried him to his berth  all this time grim had remained seated on a locker swaying to and fro like a drunken man and paying no attention to the numerous questions that were put to him by saunders and his comrades  this is bad exclaimed captain guy pressing his hand on his forehead  a search must be made suggested captain ellice  its evident that the party have broken down out on the floes and fred and grim have been sent to let us know  i know it answered captain guy a search must be made and that instantly if it is to be of any use but in which direction are we to go is the question  these poor fellows cannot tell us  out on the ice to the north is a wide word  fred fred can you not tell us in which direction we ought to go to search for them  yes far out on the floesamong hummocksfar out murmured fred halfunconsciously  we must be satisfied with that  now mr saunders assist me to get the small sledge fitted out  ill go to look after them myself  an ill go with ee sir said the second mate promptly  i fear you are hardly able  no fear o me sir  im better than ee think  i must go too added captain ellice it is quite evident that you cannot muster a party without me  thats impossible interrupted the doctor your leg is not strong enough nearly for such a trip besides my dear sir you must stay behind to perform my duties for the ship cant do without a doctor and i shall go with captain guy if he will allow me  that he wont cried the captain  you say truly the ship cannot be left without a doctor  neither you nor my friend ellice shall leave the ship with my permission  but dont let us waste time talking  come summers and mizzle you are well enough to join and meetuck you must be our guide look alive and get yourselves ready  in less than half an hour the rescue party were equipped and on their way over the floes  they were six in allone of the freshest among the crew having volunteered to join those already mentioned  it was a very dark night and bitterly cold but they took nothing with them except the clothes on their backs a supply of provisions for their lost comrades their sleepingbags and a small leather tent  the captain also took care to carry with them a flask of brandy  the colossal bergs which stretched like wellknown landmarks over the sea were their guides at first but after travelling ten hours without halting they had passed the greater number of those with which they were familiar and entered upon an unknown region  here it became necessary to use the utmost caution  they knew that the lost men must be within twenty miles of them but they had no means of knowing the exact spot and any footprints that had been made were now obliterated in these circumstances captain guy had to depend very much on his own sagacity  clambering to the top of a hummock he observed a long stretch of level floe to the northward  i think it likely he remarked to saunders who had accompanied him that they may have gone in that direction  it seems an attractive road among the chaos of iceheaps  im no sure o that objected saunders yonders a pretty clear road away to the west maybe they took that  perhaps they did but as fred said they had gone far out on the ice to the north i think it likely theyve gone in that direction  maybe yer right sir and maybe yer wrang answered saunders as they returned to the party  as this was the second mates method of intimating that he felt that he ought to give in though he didnt give in and never would give in absolutely the captain felt more confidence in his own opinion  now meetuck keep your eyes open he added as they resumed their rapid march  after journeying on for a considerable distance the men were ordered to spread out over the neighbouring icefields in order to multiply the chances of discovering tracks but there seemed to be some irresistible power of attraction which drew them gradually together again however earnestly they might try to keep separate  in fact they were beginning to be affected by the longcontinued march and the extremity of the cold  this last was so great that constant motion was absolutely necessary in order to prevent them from freezing  there was no time allowed for restlife and death were in the scale  their only hope lay in a continuous and rapid advance so as to reach the lost men ere they should freeze or die of starvation  holo look eer shouted meetuck as he halted and went down on his knees to examine some marks on the snow  these are tracks cried captain guy eagerly  what think you saunders  they look like it  follow them up meetuck  go in advance my lad and let the rest of you scatter again  in a few minutes there was a cry heard and as the party hastened towards the spot whence it came they found davie summers pointing eagerly to a little snowhut in the midst of a group of bergs  with hasty steps they advanced towards it and the captain with a terrible misgiving at heart crept in  ah then is it yerself darlint were the first words that greeted him  a loud cheer from those without told that they heard and recognised the words  immediately two of them crept in and striking a light kindled a lamp which revealed the careworn forms of their lost comrades stretched on the ground in their sleepingbags  they were almost exhausted for want of food but otherwise they were uninjured  the first congratulations over the rescue party immediately proceeded to make arrangements for passing the night  they were themselves little better than those whom they had come to save having performed an uninterrupted march of eighteen hours without food or drink  it was touching to see the tears of joy and gratitude that filled the eyes of the poor fellows who had given themselves up for lost as they watched the movements of their comrades while they prepared food for them and the broken fitful conversation was mingled strangely with alternate touches of fun and deep feeling indicating the conflicting emotions that struggled in their breasts  i knowed ye would come captain bless you sir said amos parr in an unsteady voice  come  av coorse ye knowed it cried oriley energetically  och but dont be long wid the mate darlints me stummiks shut up intirely  there wont be room for us all here im afraid remarked bolton  this was true  the hut was constructed to hold six and it was impossible that ten could sleep in it although they managed to squeeze in  never mind that cried the captain  here take a drop of soup gently not too much at a time  ah then its cruel of ye it is to give me sich a small taste  it was necessary however to give men in their condition a small taste at first so oriley had to rest content  meanwhile the rescue party supped heartily and after a little more food had been administered to the halfstarved men preparations were made for spending the night  the tent was pitched and the sleepingbags spread out on the snow then captain guy offered up fervent thanks to god for his protection thus far and prayed shortly but earnestly for deliverance from their dangerous situation after which they all lay down and slept soundly till morningor at least as soundly as could be expected with a temperature at 55 degrees below zero  next morning they prepared to set out on their return to the ship  but this was no easy task  the exhausted men had to be wrapped up carefully in their blankets which were sewed closely round their limbs then packed in their sleepingbags and covered completely up only a small hole being left opposite their mouths to breathe through and after that they were lashed side by side on the small sledge  the larger sledge with the muskets ammunition and spare blankets had to be abandoned then the rescue party put their shoulders to the trackingbelts and away they went briskly over the floes  but the drag was a fearfully heavy one for men who besides having walked so long and so far on the previous day were most of them much weakened by illness and very unfit for such laborious work  the floes too were so rugged that they had frequently to lift the heavy sledge and its living load over deep rents and chasms which in circumstances less desperate they would have scarcely ventured to do  work as they would however they could not make more than a mile an hour and night overtook them ere they reached the level floes  but it was of the utmost importance that they should continue to advance so they pushed forward until a breeze sprang up that pierced them through and through  fortunately there was a bright moon in the sky which enabled them to pick their way among the hummocks  suddenly without warning the whole party felt an alarming failure of their energies  captain guy who was aware of the imminent danger of giving way to this feeling cheered the men to greater exertion by word and voice but failed to rouse them they seemed like men walking in their sleep  come saunders cheer up man cried the captain shaking the mate by the arm but saunders stood still swaying to and fro like a drunken man  mizzle begged to be allowed to sleep if it were only for two minutes and poor davie summers deliberately threw himself down on the snow from which had he been left he would never more have risen  the case was now desperate  in vain the captain shook and buffeted the men  they protested that they did not feel coldthey were quite warm and only wanted a little sleep  he saw that it was useless to contend with them so there was nothing left for it but to pitch the tent  this was done as quickly as possible though with much difficulty and the men were unlashed from the sledge and placed within it  the others then crowded in and falling down beside each other were asleep in an instant  the excessive crowding of the little tent was an advantage at this time as it tended to increase their animal heat  captain guy allowed them to sleep only two hours and then roused them in order to continue the journey but short though the period of rest was it proved sufficient to enable the men to pursue their journey with some degree of spirit  still it was evident that their energies had been overtaxed for when they neared the ship next day tom singleton who had been on the lookout and advanced to meet them found that they were almost in a state of stupor and talked incoherently sometimes giving utterance to sentiments of the most absurd nature with expressions of the utmost gravity  meanwhile good news was brought them from the ship  two bears and a walrus had been purchased from the esquimaux a party of whomsleek fat

summerbright glowing summercame at last to gladden the heart of man and beast in the polar regions  we have purposely omitted to make mention of spring for there is no such season properly so called within the arctic circle  winter usually terminates with a gushing thaw and summer then begins with a blaze of fervent heat  not that the heat is really so intense as compared with that of southern climes but the contrast is so great that it seems as though the torrid zones had rushed towards the pole  about the beginning of june there were indications of the coming heat fresh water began to trickle from the rocks and streamlets commenced to run down the icebergs  soon everything became moist and a marked change took place in the appearance of the icebelt owing to the pools that collected on it everywhere and overflowed  seals now became more numerous in the neighbourhood and were frequently killed near the atluks or holes so that fresh meat was secured in abundance and the scurvy received a decided check  reindeer rabbits and ptarmigan too began to frequent the bay so that the larder was constantly full and the messtable presented a pleasing varietyrats being no longer the solitary dish of fresh meat at every meal  a few small birds made their appearance from the southward and these were hailed as harbingers of the coming summer  one day oriley sat on the taffrail basking in the warm sun and drinking in health and gladness from its beams  he had been ill and was now convalescent  buzzby stood beside him  ive bin thinkin said buzzby that we dont half know the blessins that are given to us in this here world till weve had em taken away look now how were enjoyin the sun an the heat just as if it wos so much gold  goold echoed oriley in a tone of contempt faix i niver thought so little o goold before let me tell ye  goold can buy many a thing it can but it cant buy sunshine  hallo whats this  oriley accompanied the question with a sudden snatch of his hand  look here buzzby  have a care now jist watch the opening o my fist  wot is it enquired buzzby approaching and looking earnestly at his comrades clenched hand with some curiosity  there he comes  now then not so fast ye spalpeen  as he spoke a small fly which had been captured crept out from between his fingers and sought to escape  it was the first that had visited these frozen regions for many many months and the whole crew were summoned on deck to meet it as if it were an old and valued friend  let it go poor thing cried half a dozen of the men gazing at the little prisoner with a degree of interest that cannot be thoroughly understood by those who have not passed through experiences similar to those of our arctic voyagers  ay dont hurt it poor thing  youre squeezin it too hard cried amos parr  squaazing it no then im not  go avic an me blessin go wid ye  the big rough hand opened and the tiny insect spreading its gossamer wings buzzed away into the bright atmosphere where it was soon lost to view  rig up the icesaws mr bolton set all hands at them and get out the powdercanisters cried captain guy coming hastily on deck  ay ay sir responded the mate  all hands to the icesaws  look alive boys  ho  mr saunders wheres mr saunders  here i am answered the worthy second mate in a quiet voice  oh youre there get up some powder mr saunders and a few canisters  there was a heartiness in the tone and action with which these orders were given and obeyed that proved they were possessed of more than ordinary interest as indeed they were for the time had now come for making preparations for cutting the ship out of winterquarters and getting ready to take advantage of any favourable opening in the ice that might occur  do you hope to effect much enquired captain ellice of captain guy who stood at the gangway watching the men as they leaped over the side and began to cut holes with ice chisels preparatory to fixing the saws and powdercanisters  not much replied the captain but a little in these latitudes is worth fighting hard for as you are well aware  many a time have i seen a ships crew strain and heave on warps and cables for hours together and only gain a yard by all their efforts but many a time also have i seen a single yard of headway save a ship from destruction  true rejoined captain ellice i have seen a little of it myself there is no spot on earth i think equal to the polar regions for bringing out into bold relief two great and apparently antagonistic truthsnamely mans urgent need of all his powers to accomplish the work of his own deliverance and mans utter helplessness and entire dependence on the sovereign will of god  when shall we sink the canisters sir asked bolton coming up and touching his hat  in an hour mr bolton the tide will be full then and we shall try what effect a blast will have  my opeenion is remarked saunders who passed at the moment with two large bags of gunpowder under his arms that itll have no effect at a  itll just loosen the ice roond the ship  the captain smiled as he said that is all the effect i hope for mr saunders  should the outward ice give way soon we shall then be in a better position to avail ourselves of it  as saunders predicted the effect of powder and saws was merely to loosen and rend the icetables in which the dolphin was imbedded but deliverance was coming sooner than any of those on board expected  that night a storm arose which for intensity of violence equalled if it did not surpass the severest gales they had yet experienced  it set the great bergs of the polar seas in motion and these moving mountains of ice slowly and majestically began their voyage to southern climes crashing through the floes overturning the hummocks and ripping up the icetables with quiet but irresistible momentum  for two days the war of ice continued to rage and sometimes the contending forces in the shape of huge tongues and corners of bergs were forced into the bay of mercy and threatening swift destruction to the little craft which was a mere atom that might have been crushed and sunk and scarcely missed in such a wild scene  at one time a table of ice was forced out of the water and reared up like a sloping wall of glass close to the stern of the dolphin where all the crew were assembled with icepoles ready to do their utmost but their feeble efforts could have availed them nothing had the slowlymoving mass continued its onward progress  lower away the quarterboat cried the captain as the sheet of ice six feet thick came grinding down towards the starboard quarter  buzzby grim and several others sprang to obey but before they could let go the falltackles the mass of ice rose suddenly high above the deck over which it projected several feet and caught the boat  in another moment the timbers yielded the thwarts sprang out or were broken across and slowly yet forcibly as a strong hand might crush an eggshell the boat was squeezed flat against the ships side  shove lads if it comes on were lost cried the captain seizing one of the long poles with which the men were vainly straining every nerve and muscle  they might as well have tried to arrest the progress of a berg  on it came and crushed in the starboard quarter bulwarks providentially at that moment it grounded and remained fast but the projecting point that overhung them broke off and fell on the deck with a crash that shook the good ship from stem to stern  several of the men were thrown violently down but none were seriously hurt in this catastrophe  when the storm ceased the ice out in the strait was all in motion and that round the ship had loosened so much that it seemed as if the dolphin might soon get out into open water and once more float upon its natural element  every preparation therefore was made the stores were reshipped from store island the sails were shaken out and those of them that had been taken down were bent on to the yards  tackle was overhauled and in short everything was done that was possible under the circumstances  but a week passed away ere they succeeded in finally warping out of the bay into the open sea beyond  it was a lovely morning when this happy event was accomplished  before the tide was quite full and while they were waiting until the command to heave on the warps should be given captain guy assembled the crew for morning prayers in the cabin  having concluded he said  my lads through the great mercy of heaven we have been all except one spared through the trials and anxieties of a long and dreary winter and are now i trust about to make our escape from the ice that has held us fast so long  it becomes me at such a time to tell you that if i am spared to return home i shall be able to report that every man in this ship has done his duty  you have never flinched in the hour of danger and never grumbled in the hour of trial  only one manour late brave and warmhearted comrade joseph westhas fallen in the struggle  for the mercies that have never failed us and for our success in rescuing my gallant friend captain ellice we ought to feel the deepest gratitude  we have need however to pray for a blessing on the labours that are yet before us for you are well aware that we shall probably have many a struggle with the ice before we are once more afloat on blue water  and now lads away with you on deck and man the capstan for the tide is about full  the capstan was manned and the hawsers were hove taut  inch by inch the tide rose and the dolphin floated  then a lusty cheer was given and amos parr struck up one of those hearty songs intermingled with ho and yo heave ho that seem to be the life and marrow of all nautical exertion  at last the good ship forged ahead and boring through the loose ice passed slowly out of the bay of mercy  do you know i feel quite sad at quitting this dreary spot said fred to his father as they stood gazing backward over the taffrail  i could not have believed that i should have become so much attached to it  we become attached to any spot fred in which incidents have occurred to call forth frequently our deeper feelings  these rocks and stones are intimately associated with many events that have caused you joy and sorrow hope and fear pain and happiness  men cherish the memory of such feelings and love the spots of earth with which they are associated  ah father yonder stands one stone at least that calls forth feelings of sorrow  fred pointed as he spoke to store island which was just passing out of view  on this lonely spot the men had raised a large stone over the grave of joseph west  oriley whose enthusiastic temperament had caused him to mourn over his comrade more perhaps than any other man in the ship had carved the name and date of his death in rude characters on the stone  it was a conspicuous object on the low island and every eye in the dolphin was fixed on it as they passed  soon the point of rock that had sheltered them so long from many a westerly gale intervened and shut it out from view for ever  a week of uninterrupted fair wind and weather had carried the dolphin far to the south of their dreary winteringground and all was going well when the worst of all disasters befell the shipshe caught fire how it happened no one could tell  the smoke was first seen rising suddenly from the hold  instantly the alarm was spread  firemen to your posts shouted the captain  man the waterbuckets steady men no hurry  keep order  ay ay sir was the short prompt response and the most perfect order was kept  every command was obeyed instantly with a degree of vigour that is seldom exhibited save in cases of life and death  buzzby was at the starboard and peter grim at the larboard gangway while the men stood in two rows extending from each to the main hatch up which everthickening clouds of dark smoke were rolling  bucket after bucket of water was passed along and dashed into the hold and everything that could be done was done but without effect  the fire increased  suddenly a long tongue of flame issued from the smoking cavern and lapped round the mast and rigging with greedy eagerness  theres no hope said captain ellice in a low voice laying his hand gently on captain guys shoulder  the captain did not reply but gazed with an expression of the deepest regret for one moment at the work of destruction  next instant he sprang to the falls of the larboard quarterboat  now lads he cried energetically get out the boats  bring up provisions mr bolton and a couple of spare sails  mr saunders see to the ammunition and muskets  quick men  the cabin will soon be too hot to hold you  setting the example the captain sprang below followed by fred and tom singleton who secured the charts a compass chronometer and quadrant also the logbook and the various journals and records of the voyage captain ellice also did active service and being cool and selfpossessed he recollected and secured several articles which were afterwards of the greatest use and which but for him would in such a trying moment have probably been forgotten  meanwhile the two largest boats in the ship were lowered  provisions masts sails and oars etcetera were thrown in  the few remaining dogs among whom were dumps and poker were also embarked and the crew hastily leaping in pushed off  they were not a moment too soon  the fire had reached the place where the gunpowder was kept and although there was not a great quantity of it there was enough when it exploded to burst open the deck  the wind having free ingress fanned the fire into a furious blaze and in a few moments the dolphin was wrapped in flames from stem to stern  it was a little after sunset when the fire was discovered in two hours later the good ship was burned to the waters edge then the waves swept in and while they extinguished the fire they sank the blackened hull leaving the two crowded boats floating in darkness on the bosom of the iceladen sea    chapter twenty five  escape to uppernavikletter from homemeetucks grandmotherdumps and poker again  for three long weeks the shipwrecked mariners were buffeted by winds and waves in open boats but at last they were guided in safety through all their dangers and vicissitudes to the colony of uppernavik  here they found several vessels on the point of setting out for europe one of which was bound for england and in this vessel the crew of the dolphin resolved to ship  nothing of particular interest occurred at this solitary settlement except one thing but that one thing was a great event and deserves very special notice  it was nothing less than the receipt of a letter by fred from his cousin isobel  fred and isobel having been brought up for several years together felt towards each other like brother and sister  fred received the letter from the pastor of the settlement shortly after landing while his father and the captain were on board the english brig making arrangements for their passage home  he could scarcely believe his eyes when he beheld the wellknown hand but having at last come to realise the fact that he actually held a real letter in his hand he darted behind one of the curious primitive cottages to read it  here he was met by a squad of inquisitive natives so with a gesture of impatience he rushed to another spot but he was observed and followed by half a dozen esquimaux boys and in despair he sought refuge in the small church near which he chanced to be  he had not been there a second however when two old women came in and approaching him began to scan him with critical eyes  this was too much so fred thrust the letter into his bosom darted out and was instantly surrounded by a band of natives who began to question him in an unknown tongue  seeing that there was no other resource fred turned him round and fled towards the mountains at a pace that defied pursuit and coming to a halt in the midst of a rocky gorge that might have served as an illustration of what chaos was he sat him down behind a big rock to peruse isobels letter  having read it he reread it having reread it he read it over again having read it over again he meditated a little exclaiming several times emphatically my darling isobel and then he read bits of it here and there having done which he read the other bits and so got through it again  as the letter was a pretty long one it took him a considerable time to do all this then it suddenly occurred to him that he had been thus selfishly keeping it all to himself instead of sharing it with his father so he started up and hastened back to the village where he found old mr ellice in earnest confabulation with the pastor of the place  seizing his parent by the arm fred led him into a room in the pastors house and looking round to make sure that it was empty he sought to bolt the door but the door was a primitive one and had no bolt so fred placed a huge oldfashioned chair against it and sitting down therein while his father took a seat opposite he unfolded the letter and yet once again read it through  the letter was about twelve months old and ran thus  grayton 25th july  my darling fred  it is now two months since you left us and it seems to me two years oh how i do wish that you were back  when i think of the terrible dangers that you may be exposed to amongst the ice my heart sinks and i sometimes fear that we shall never see you or your dear father again but you are in the hands of our father in heaven dear fred and i never cease to pray that you may be successful and return to us in safety dear good old mr singleton told me yesterday that he had an opportunity of sending to the danish settlements in greenland so i resolved to write though i very much doubt whether this will ever find you in such a wild faroff land  oh when i think of where you are all the romantic stories i have ever read of polar regions spring up before me and you seem to be the hero of them all  but i must not waste my paper thus  i know you will be anxious for news  i have very little to give you however  good old mr singleton has been very kind to us since you went away  he comes constantly to see us and comforts dear mamma very much  your friend dr singleton will be glad to hear that he is well and strong  tell my friend buzzby that his wife sends her compliments  i laugh while i write the word  yes she actually sends er compliments to her husband  she is a very stern but a really excellent woman  mamma and i visit her frequently when we chance to be in the village  her two boys are the finest little fellows i ever saw  they are both so like each other that we cannot tell which is which when they are apart and both are so like their father that we can almost fancy we see him when looking at either of them  the last day we were there however they were in disgrace for johnny had pushed freddy into the washingtub and freddy in revenge had poured a jug of treacle over johnnys head  i am quite sure that mrs buzzby is tired of being a widowas she calls herselfand will be very glad when her husband comes back  but i must reserve chitchat to the end of my letter and first give you a minute account of all your friends  here followed six pages of closelywritten quarto which however interesting they might be to those concerned cannot be expected to afford much entertainment to our readers so we will cut isobels letter short at this point  capns ready to go aboord sir said oriley touching his cap to captain ellice while he was yet engaged in discussing the letter with his son  very good  an plaaze sir av yell take the throuble to look in at mrs meetuck in passin itll do yer heart good it will  very well well look in replied the captain as he quitted the house of the worthy pastor  the personage whom oriley chose to style mrs meetuck was meetucks grandmother  that old lady was an esquimaux whose age might be algebraically expressed as an unknown quantity  she lived in a boat turned upside down with a small window in the bottom of it and a hole in the side for a door  when captain ellice and fred looked in the old woman who was a mere mass of bones and wrinkles was seated on a heap of moss beside a fire the only chimney to which was a hole in the bottom of the boat  in front of her sat her grandson meetuck and on a cloth spread out at her feet were displayed all the presents with which that good hunter had been loaded by his comrades of the dolphin meetucks mother had died many years before and all the affection in his naturally warm heart was transferred to and centred upon his old grandmother  meetucks chief delight in the gifts he received was in sharing them as far as possible with the old woman  we say as far as possible because some things could not be shared with her such as a splendid new rifle and a silvermounted huntingknife and powderhorn all of which had been presented to him by captain guy over and above his wages as a reward for his valuable services  but the trinkets of every kind which had been given to him by the men were laid at the feet of the old woman who looked at everything in blank amazement yet with a smile on her wrinkled visage that betokened much satisfaction  meetucks oily countenance beamed with delight as he sat puffing his pipe in his grandmothers face  this little attention we may remark was paid designedly for the old woman liked it and the youth knew that  they have enough to make them happy for the winter said captain ellice as he turned to leave the hut  faix they have  theres only two things wantin to make it complate  what are they enquired fred  murphies and a pig sure  thats all they need  wots come o dumps and poker enquired buzzby as they reached the boat  oh i quite forgot them cried fred stay a minute ill run up and find them  they cant be far off  for some time fred searched in vain  at last he bethought him of meetucks hut as being a likely spot in which to find them  on entering he found the couple as he had left them the only difference being that the poor old woman seemed to be growing sleepy over her joys  have you seen dumps or poker anywhere enquired fred  meetuck nodded and pointed to a corner where comfortably rolled up on a mound of dry moss lay dumps poker as usual making use of him as a pillow  thems is go bed said meetuck  thems must get up then and come aboard cried fred whistling  at first the dogs being sleepy seemed indisposed to move but at last they consented and following fred to the beach were soon conveyed aboard the ship  next day captain guy and his men bade meetuck and the kind hospitable people of uppernavik farewell and spreading their canvas to a fair breeze set sail for england    chapter twenty six  the returnthe surprisebuzzbys sayings and doingsthe narrative fighting battles oer againconclusion  once again we are on the end of the quay at grayton  as fred stands there all that has occurred during the past year seems to him but a vivid dream  captain guy is there and captain ellice and buzzby and mrs buzzby too and the two little buzzbys also and mrs bright and isobel and tom singleton and old mr singleton and the crew of the wrecked dolphin and in short the whole worldof that part of the country  it was a great day for grayton that  it was a wonderful dayquite an indescribable day but there were also some things about it that made captain ellice feel somehow that it was a mysterious day for while there were hearty congratulations and much sobbing for joy on the part of mrs bright there were also whisperings which puzzled him a good deal  come with me brother said mrs bright at length taking him by the arm i have to tell you something  isobel who was on the watch joined them and fred also went with them towards the cottage  dear brother said mrs bright iioh isobel tell him  i cannot  what means all this mystery said the captain in an earnest tone for he felt that they had something serious to communicate  dear uncle said isobel you remember the time when the pirates attacked  she paused for her uncles look frightened her  go on isobel he said quickly  your dear wife uncle was not lost at that time  captain ellice turned pale  what mean you girl  how came you to know this  then a thought flashed across him  seizing isobel by the shoulder he gasped rather than said  speak quickisis she alive  yes dear uncle she  the captain heard no more  he would have fallen to the ground had not fred who was almost as much overpowered as his father supported him in a few minutes he recovered and he was told that alice was alivein englandin the cottage  this was said as they approached the door alice was aware of her husbands arrival  in another moment husband and wife and son were reunited  scenes of intense joy cannot be adequately described and there are meetings in this world which ought not to be too closely touched upon such was the present  we will therefore leave captain ellice and his wife and son to pour out the deep feelings of their hearts to each other and follow the footsteps of honest john buzzby as he sailed down the village with his wife and children and a host of admiring friends in tow  buzzbys feelings had been rather powerfully stirred up by the joy of all around and a tear would occasionally tumble over his weatherbeaten cheek and hang at the point of his sunburnt and oft frostbitten nose despite his utmost efforts to subdue such outrageous demonstrations  sit down john dear said mrs buzzby in kind but commanding tones when she got her husband fairly into his cottage the little parlour of which was instantly crowded to excess  sit down john dear and tell us all about it  wot begin to spin the whole yarn o the voyage afore ive had time to say how dye do exclaimed buzzby at the same time grasping his two uproarious sons who had the instant he sat down rushed at his legs like two miniature midshipmen climbed up them as if they had been two masts and settled on his knees as if they had been their own favourite crosstrees  no john not the yarn of the voyage replied his wife while she spread the board before him with bread and cheese and beer but tell us how you found old captain ellice and where and whats comed of the crew  werry good then here goes  buzzby was a man of action  he screwed up his weathereye the one next his wife of course that being the quarter from which squalls might be expected and began a yarn which lasted the better part of two hours  it is not to be supposed that buzzby spun it off without interruption besides the questions that broke in upon him from all quarters the two buzzbys junior scrambled as far as was possible into his pockets pulled his whiskers as if they had been hoisting a mainsail therewith and generally behaved in such an obstreperous manner as to render coherent discourse all but impracticable  he got through with it however and then mrs buzzby intimated her wish pretty strongly that the neighbours should vacate the premises which they did laughingly pronouncing buzzby to be a trump and his better half a true blue  goodday old chap said the last who made his exit tillers fixed aginnailed amidships eh  hard and fast replied buzzby with a broad grin as he shut the door and returned to the bosom of his family  two days later a grand feast was given at mrs brights cottage to which all the friends of the family were invited to meet with captain ellice and those who had returned from their long and perilous voyage it was a joyful gathering that and glad and grateful hearts were there  two days later still and another feast was given  on this occasion buzzby was the host and buzzbys cottage was the scene  it was a joyful meeting too and a jolly one to boot for oriley was there and peter grim and amos parr and david mizzle and mivinsin short the entire crew of the lost dolphincaptain mates surgeon and all fred and his father were also there and old mr singleton and a number of other friends so that all the rooms in the house had to be thrown open and even then mrs buzzby had barely room to move  it was on this occasion that buzzby related to his shipmates how mrs ellice had escaped from drowning on the night they were attacked by pirates on board the indiaman  he took occasion to relate the circumstances just before the people from the house arrived and as the reader may perhaps prefer buzzbys account to ours we give it as it was delivered  you see it happened this way began buzzby  hand us a coal buzzby to light my pipe before ye begin said peter grim  ah then howld yer tongue blunderbore cried oriley handing the glowing coal demanded with as much nonchalance as if his fingers were made of castiron  well ye see resumed buzzby when poor mrs ellice wos pitched overboard as i seed her with my own two eyes  stop buzzby said mivins ow was er ead at the time  shut up cried several of the men go on buzzby  well i think her ead was souwest if it warnt noreast  anyhow it was pintin somewhere or other round the compass  but as i wos sayin when mrs ellice struck the water an she told me all about it herself ye must know she sank and then she comed up and didnt know how it wos but she caught hold of an oar that wos floatin close beside her and screamed for help but no help came for it was dark and the ship had disappeared so she gave herself up for lost but in a little the oar struck agin a big piece o the wreck o the pirates boat and she managed to clamber upon it and lay there amost dead with cold till mornin  the first thing she saw when day broke forth wos a big ship bearin right down on her and she wos just about run down when one o the men observed her from the bow  hard aport roared the man  port it is cried the man at the wheel an round went the ship like a duck jist missin the bit of wreck as she passed  a boat wos lowered and mrs ellice wos took aboard  well she found that the ship wos bound for the sandwich islands and as they didnt mean to touch at any port in passin mrs ellice had to go on with her  misfortins dont come single howsiver  the ship was wrecked on a coral reef and the crew had to take to their boats wich they did an got safe to land but the land they got to wos an outotheway island among the feejees and a spot where ships never come so they had to make up their minds to stop there  i thought said amos parr that the feejees were cannibals and that whoever was wrecked or cast ashore on their coasts was killed and roasted and eat up at once  so yere right rejoined buzzby but providence sent the crew to one o the islands that had bin visited by a native christian missionary from one o the other islands and the people had gin up some o their worst practices and wos thinkin o turnin over a new leaf altogether so the crew wos spared and took to livin among the natives quite comfortable like  but they soon got tired and took to their boats agin and left  mrs ellice however determined to remain and help the native christians till a ship should pass that way  for three years nothin but canoes hove in sight o that lonesome island then at last a brig came and cast anchor offshore  it wos an australian trader that had been blown out o her course on her way to england so they took poor mrs ellice aboard and brought her homeand thats how it wos  buzzbys outline although meagre is so comprehensive that we do not think it necessary to add a word  soon after he had concluded the guests of the evening came in and the conversation became general  buzzbys jollification as it was called in the village was long remembered as one of the most interesting events that had occurred for many years  one of the chief amusements of the evening was the spinning of long yarns about the incidents of the late voyage by men who could spin them well  their battles in the polar seas were all fought oer again  the wondering listeners were told how esquimaux were chased and captured how walrus were lanced and harpooned how bears were speared and shot how long and weary journeys were undertaken on foot over immeasurable fields of ice and snow how icebergs had crashed around their ship and chains had been snapped asunder and tough anchors had been torn from the ground or lost how schools had been set agoing and a theatre got up and how provisions having failed rats were eatenand eaten too with gusto  all this and a great deal more was told on that celebrated nightsometimes by one sometimes by another and sometimes to the confusion of the audience by two or three at once and not unfrequently to the still greater confusion of storytellers and audience alike the whole proceedings were interrupted by the outrageous yells and turmoil of the two indomitable young buzzbys as they romped in reckless joviality with dumps and poker  but at length the morning light broke up the party and stories of the world of ice came to an end  and now reader our tale is told  but we cannot close without a parting word in regard to those with whom we have held intercourse so long  it must not be supposed that from this date everything in the affairs of our various friends flowed on in a tranquil uninterrupted course  this world is a battlefield on which no warrior finds rest until he dies and yet to the christian warrior on that field the hour of death is the hour of victory  change is written in broad letters on everything connected with time and he who would do his duty well and enjoy the greatest possible amount of happiness here must seek to prepare himself for every change  men cannot escape the general law  the current of their particular stream may long run smooth but sooner or later the rugged channel and the precipice will come  some streams run quietly for many a league and only at the last are troubled  others burst from their very birth on rocks of difficulty and rush throughout their course in tortuous broken channels  so was it with the actors in our story  our heros course was smooth having fallen in love with his friend tom singletons profession he studied medicine and surgery became an md and returned to practise in grayton which was a flourishing seaport and during the course of freds career extended considerably  fred also fell in love with a pretty young girl in a neighbouring town and married her  tom singleton also took up his abode in grayton there being as he said room for two  ever since tom had seen isobel on the end of the quay on the day when the dolphin set sail for the polar regions his heart had been taken prisoner  isobel refused to give it back unless he tom should return the heart which he had stolen from her  this he could not do so it was agreed that the two hearts should be tied together and they two should be constituted joint guardians of both  in short they were married and took mrs bright to live with them not far from the residence of old mr singleton who was the fattest and jolliest old gentleman in the place and the very idol of dogs and boys who loved him to distraction  captain ellice having had as he said more than his share of the sea resolved to live on shore and being possessed of a moderately comfortable income he purchased mrs brights cottage on the green hill that overlooked the harbour and the sea  here he became celebrated for his benevolence and for the energy with which he entered into all the schemes that were devised for the benefit of the town of grayton  like tom singleton and fred he became deeply interested in the condition of the poor and had a special weakness for poor old women which he exhibited by searching up and doing good to every poor old woman in the parish  captain ellice was also celebrated for his garden which was a remarkably fine one for his flagstaff which was a remarkably tall and magnificent one and for his telescope which constantly protruded from his drawingroom window and pointed in the direction of the sea  as for the otherscaptain guy continued his career at sea as commander of an east indiaman  he remained stout and truehearted to the last like one of the oak timbers of his own good ship  bolton saunders mivins peter grim amos parr and the rest of them were scattered in a few years as sailors usually are to the four quarters of the globe  oriley alone was heard of again  he wrote to buzzby by manes of the ritin he had larnd aboord the dolfin informing him that he had forsaken the say and become a small farmer near cork  he had plenty of murphies and also a pigthe latter bein he said so like the wan that belonged to his owld grandmother that he thought it must be the same wan comed alive agin or its darter  and buzzbypoor buzzbyhe also gave up the sea much against his will by command of his wife and took to miscellaneous work of which there was plenty for an active man in a seaport like grayton  his rudder poor man was again and this time permanently lashed amidships and whatever breeze mrs buzzby chanced to blow his business was to sail right before it  the two little buzzbys were the joy of their fathers heart
