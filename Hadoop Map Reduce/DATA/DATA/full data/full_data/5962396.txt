5962396	the betrothed     introduction1832   the tales of the crusaders was determined upon as the title of the following series of the novels rather by the advice of the few friends whom death has now rendered still fewer than by the authors own taste not but that he saw plainly enough the interest which might be excited by the very name of the crusaders but he was conscious at the same time that that interest was of a character which it might be more easy to create than to satisfy and that by the mention of so magnificent a subject each reader might be induced to call up to his imagination a sketch so extensive and so grand that it might not be in the power of the author to fill it up who would thus stand in the predicament of the dwarf bringing with him a standard to measure his own stature and showing himself therefore says sterne a dwarf more ways than one  it is a fact if it were worth while to examine it that the publisher and author however much their general interests are the same may be said to differ so far as title pages are concerned and it is a secret of the taletelling art if it could be termed a secret worth knowing that a takingtitle as it is called best answers the purpose of the bookseller since it often goes far to cover his risk and sells an edition not unfrequently before the public have well seen it but the author ought to seek more permanent fame and wish that his work when its leaves are first cut open should be at least fairly judged of thus many of the best novelists have been anxious to give their works such titles as render it out of the readers power to conjecture their contents until they should have an opportunity of reading them  all this did not prevent the tales of the crusaders from being the title fixed on and the celebrated year of projects eighteen hundred and twentyfive being the time of publication an introduction was prefixed according to the humour of the day    the first tale of the series was influenced in its structure rather by the wish to avoid the general expectations which might be formed from the title than to comply with any one of them and so disappoint the rest the story was therefore less an incident belonging to the crusades than one which was occasioned by the singular cast of mind introduced and spread wide by those memorable undertakings the confusion among families was not the least concomitant evil of the extraordinary preponderance of this superstition it was no unusual thing for a crusader returning from his long toils of war and pilgrimage to find his family augmented by some young offshoot of whom the deserted matron could give no very accurate account or perhaps to find his marriagebed filled and that instead of becoming nurse to an old man his household dame had preferred being the ladylove of a young one numerous are the stories of this kind told in different parts of europe and the returned knight or baron according to his temper sat down good naturedly contented with the account which his lady gave of a doubtful matter or called in blood and fire to vindicate his honour which after all had been endangered chiefly by his forsaking his household gods to seek adventures in palestine  scottish tradition quoted i think in some part of the border minstrelsy ascribes to the clan of tweedie a family once stout and warlike a descent which would not have misbecome a hero of antiquity a baron somewhat elderly we may suppose had wedded a buxom young lady and some months after their union he left her to ply the distaff alone in his old tower among the mountains of the county of peebles near the sources of the tweed he returned after seven or eight years no uncommon space for a pilgrimage to palestine and found his family had not been lonely in his absence the lady having been cheered by the arrival of a stranger of whose approach she could give the best account of any one who hung on her skirts and called her mammy and was just such as the baron would have longed to call his son but that he could by no means make his age correspond according to the doctrine of civilians with his own departure for palestine he applied to his wife therefore for the solution of this dilemma the lady after many floods of tears which she had reserved for the occasion informed the honest gentleman that walking one day alone by the banks of the infant river a human form arose from a deep eddy still known and termed tweedpool who deigned to inform her that he was the tutelar genius of the stream and bongre malgre became the father of the sturdy fellow whose appearance had so much surprised her husband this story however suitable to pagan times would have met with full credence from few of the barons contemporaries but the wife was young and beautiful the husband old and in his dotage her family the frazers it is believed were powerful and warlike and the baron had had fighting enough in the holy wars the event was that he believed or seemed to believe the tale and remained contented with the child with whom his wife and the tweed had generously presented him the only circumstance which preserved the memory of the incident was that the youth retained the name of tweed or tweedie the baron meanwhile could not as the old scotch song says keep the cradle rowing and the tweed apparently thought one natural son was family enough for a decent presbyterian lover and so little gall had the baron in his composition that having bred up the young tweed as his heir while he lived he left him in that capacity when he died and the son of the rivergod founded the family of drummelzier and others from whom have flowed in the phrase of the ettrick shepherd many a brave fellow and many a bauld feat  the tale of the noble moringer is somewhat of the same natureit exists in a collection of german popular songs entitled sammlung deutschen volkslieder berlin 1807 published by messrs busching and von der hagen the song is supposed to be extracted from a manuscript chronicle of nicholas thomann chaplain to st leonard in wissenhorn and dated 1533 the ballad which is popular in germany is supposed from the language to have been composed in the fifteenth century the noble moringer a powerful baron of germany about to set out on a pilgrimage to the land of st thomas with the geography of which we are not made acquainted resolves to commit his castle dominions and lady to the vassal who should pledge him to keep watch over them till the seven years of his pilgrimage were accomplished his chamberlain an elderly and a cautious man declines the trust observing that seven days instead of seven years would be the utmost space to which he would consent to pledge himself for the fidelity of any woman the esquire of the noble moringer confidently accepts the trust refused by the chamberlain and the baron departs on his pilgrimage the seven years are now elapsed all save a single day and night when behold a vision descends on the noble pilgrim as he sleeps in the land of the stranger    it was the noble moringer within an orchard slept   when on the barons slumbering sense a boding vision crept   and whispered in his ear a voice   tis time sir knight to wake   thy lady and thy heritage another master take    thy tower another banner knows thy steeds another rein   and stoop them to anothers will thy gallant vassal train   and she the lady of thy love so faithful once and fair   this night within thy fathers hall she weds marstettens heir  the moringer starts up and prays to his patron st thomas to rescue him from the impending shame which his devotion to his patron had placed him in danger of incurring st thomas who must have felt the justice of the imputation performs a miracle the moringers senses were drenched in oblivion and when he waked he lay in a wellknown spot of his own domain on his right the castle of his fathers and on his left the mill which as usual was built not far distant from the castle    he leaned upon his pilgrims staff and to the mill he drew   so altered was his goodly form that none their master knew   the baron to the miller said good friend for charity   tell a poor pilgrim in your land what tidings may there be    the miller answered him againhe knew of little news   save that the lady of the land did a new bridegroom choose   her husband died in distant land such is the constant word   his death sits heavy on our souls he was a worthy lord    of him i held the little mill which wins me living free   god rest the baron in his grave he aye was kind to me   and when st martins tide comes round and millers take their toll   the priest that prays for moringer shall have both cope and stole  the baron proceeds to the castle gate which is bolted to prevent intrusion while the inside of the mansion rung with preparations for the marriage of the lady the pilgrim prayed the porter for entrance conjuring him by his own sufferings and for the sake of the late moringer by the orders of his lady the warder gave him admittance    then up the hall paced moringer his step was sad and slow   it sat full heavy on his heart none seemed their lord to know   he sat him on a lowly bench oppressed with wo and wrong   short while he sat but neer to him seemed little space so long    now spent was day and feasting oer and come was evening hour   the time was nigh when new made brides retire to nuptial bower   our castles wont a brides man said hath been both firm and long   no guest to harbour in our halls till he shall chant a song  when thus called upon the disguised baron sung the following melancholy ditty    chill flows the lay of frozen age twas thus the pilgrim sung   nor golden mead nor garment gay unlocks his heavy tongue   once did i sit thou bridegroom gay at board as rich as thine   and by my side as fair a bride with all her charms was mine    but time traced furrows on my face and i grew silver haird   for locks of brown and cheeks of youth she left this brow and beard   once rich but now a palmer poor i tread lifes latest stage   and mingle with your bridal mirth the lay of frozen age  the lady moved at the doleful recollections which the palmers song recalled sent to him a cup of wine the palmer having exhausted the goblet returned it and having first dropped in the cup his nuptial ring requested the lady to pledge her venerable guest    the ring hath caught the ladys eye she views it close and near   then might you hear her shriek aloud the moringer is here   then might you see her start from seat while tears in torrents fell   but if she wept for joy or wo the ladies best can tell    full loud she utterd thanks to heaven and every saintly power   that had restored the moringer before the midnight hour   and loud she utterd vow on vow that never was there bride   that had like her preserved her troth or been so sorely tried    yes here i claim the praise she said to constant matrons due   who keep the troth that they have plight so stedfastly and true   for count the term howeer you will so that you count aright   seven twelvemonths and a day are out when bells toll twelve tonight     it was marstetten then rose up his falchion there he drew    he kneeled before the moringer and down his weapon threw    my oath and knightly faith are broke these were the words he said    then take my liege thy vassals sword and take thy vassals head     the noble moringer he smiled and then aloud did say    he gathers wisdom that hath roamed seven twelvemonths and a day    my daughter now hath fifteen years fame speaks her sweet and fair    i give her for the bride you lose and name her for my heir     the young bridegroom hath youthful bride the old bridegroom the old    whose faith were kept till term and tide so punctually were told    but blessings on the warder kind that oped my castle gate    for had i come at morrow tide i came a day too late  there is also in the rich field of german romance another edition of this story which has been converted by m tieck whose labours of that kind have been so remarkable into the subject of one of his romantic dramas it is however unnecessary to detail it as the present author adopted his idea of the tale chiefly from the edition preserved in the mansion of haighhall of old the mansionhouse of the family of braidshaigh now possessed by their descendants on the female side the earls of balcarras the story greatly resembles that of the noble moringer only there is no miracle of st thomas to shock the belief of good protestants i am permitted by my noble friends the lord and lady of haighhall to print the following extract from the family genealogy     sir william bradshaghe 2d    sone to sr john was a    great traveller and a    souldyer and married    to    mabell daughter and    sole heire of hugh    noris de haghe and    blackrode and had issue    en 8 e 2    of this mabel is a story by tradition of undouted    verity that in sr william bradshages absence    being 10 yeares away in the wares she    married a welsh kt sr william retorninge    from the wars came in a palmers habit amongst    the poore to haghe who when she saw     congetringe that that he favoured her former    husband wept for which the kt chasticed her    at wich sr william went and made him selfe    knawne

every week    barefout and bare leggd to a crosse ner wigan    from the haghe wilest she lived  is called    mabb to this day  ther monument lyes    in wigan church as you see ther portrd    an dom 1315  there were many vestiges around haighhall both of the catholic penances of the lady mabel and the history of this unfortunate transaction in particular the whole history was within the memory of man portrayed upon a glass window in the hall where unfortunately it has not been preserved mabs cross is still extant an old ruinous building is said to have been the place where the lady mabel was condemned to render penance by walking hither from haighhall barefooted and barelegged for the performance of her devotions this relic to which an anecdote so curious is annexed is now unfortunately ruinous time and whitewash says mr roby have altogether defaced the effigies of the knight and lady on the tomb the particulars are preserved in mr robys traditions of lancashire footnote a very elegant work 2 vols 1829 by j roby mrsl to which the reader is referred for further particulars it does not appear that sir william braidshaigh was irreparably offended against the too hasty lady mabel although he certainly showed himself of a more fiery mould than the scottish and german barons who were heroes of the former tales the tradition which the author knew very early in life was told to him by the late lady balcarras he was so much struck with it that being at that time profuse of legendary lore he inserted it in the shape of a note to waverley the first of his romantic offences had he then known as he now does the value of such a story it is likely that as directed in the inimitable receipt for making an epic poem preserved in the guardian he would have kept it for some future opportunity  as however the tale had not been completely told and was a very interesting one and as it was sufficiently interwoven with the crusades the wars between the welsh and the norman lords of the marches was selected as a period when all freedoms might be taken with the strict truth of history without encountering any well known fact which might render the narrative improbable perhaps however the period which vindicates the probability of the tale will with its wars and murders be best found described in the following passage of gryffyth ap edwins wars  this prince in conjunction with algar earl of chester who had been banished from england as a traitor in the reign of edward the confessor marched into herefordshire and wasted all that fertile country with fire and sword to revenge the death of his brother rhees whose head had been brought to edward in pursuance of an order sent by the king on account of the depredations which he had committed against the english on the borders to stop these ravages the earl of hereford who was nephew to edward advanced with an army not of english alone but of mercenary normans and french whom he had entertained in his service against gryffyth and algar he met them near hereford and offered them battle which the welsh monarch who had won five pitched battles before and never had fought without conquering joyfully accepted the earl had commanded his english forces to fight on horseback in imitation of the normans against their usual custom but the welsh making a furious and desperate charge that nobleman himself and the foreign cavalry led by him were so daunted at the view of them that they shamefully fled without fighting which being seen by the english they also turned their backs on the enemy who having killed or wounded as many of them as they could come up with in their flight entered triumphantly into hereford spoiled and fired the city razed the walls to the ground slaughtered some of the citizens led many of them captive and to use the words of the welsh chronicle left nothing in the town but blood and ashes after this exploit they immediately returned into wales undoubtedly from a desire of securing their prisoners and the rich plunder they had gained the king of england hereupon commanded earl harold to collect a great army from all parts of the kingdom and assembling them at gloucester advanced from thence to invade the dominions of gryffyth in north wales he performed his orders and penetrated into that country without resistance from the welsh gryffyth and algar returning into some parts of south wales what were their reasons for this conduct we are not well informed nor why harold did not pursue his advantage against them but it appears that he thought it more advisable at this time to treat with than subdue them for he left north wales and employed himself in rebuilding the walls of hereford while negotiations were carrying on with gryffyth which soon after produced the restoration of algar and a peace with that king not very honourable to england as he made no satisfaction for the mischief he had done in the war nor any submissions to edward harold must doubtless have had some private and forcible motives to conclude such a treaty the very next year the welsh monarch upon what quarrel we know not made a new incursion into england and killed the bishop of hereford the sheriff of the county and many more of the english both ecclesiastics and laymen edward was counselled by harold and leofrick earl of mercia to make peace with him again which he again broke nor could he be restrained by any means from these barbarous inroads before the year one thousand and sixtythree when edward whose patience and pacific disposition had been too much abused commissioned harold to assemble the whole strength of the kingdom and make war upon him in his own country till he had subdued or destroyed him that general acted so vigorously and with so much celerity that he had like to have surprised him in his palace but just before the english forces arrived at his gate having notice of the danger that threatened him and seeing no other means of safety he threw himself with a few of his household into one of his ships which happened at the instant to be ready to sail and put to sealyttletons hist of england vol ii p 338  this passage will be found to bear a general resemblance to the fictitious tale told in the romance  abbotsford 1st june 1832     introduction  minutes of sederunt of a general meeting of the shareholders designing to form a jointstock company united for the purpose of writing and publishing the class of works called the waverley novels  held in the waterloo tavern regents bridge edinburgh 1st june 1825  the reader must have remarked that the various editions of the proceedings at this meeting were given in the public papers with rather more than usual inaccuracy the cause of this was no ill timed delicacy on the part of the gentlemen of the press to assert their privilege of universal presence wherever a few are met together and to commit to the public prints whatever may then and there pass of the most private nature but very unusual and arbitrary methods were resorted to on the present occasion to prevent the reporters using a right which is generally conceded to them by almost all meetings whether of a political or commercial description our own reporter indeed was bold enough to secrete himself under the secretarys table and was not discovered till the meeting was wellnigh over we are sorry to say he suffered much in person from fists and toes and two or three principal pages were torn out of his notebook which occasions his report to break off abruptly we cannot but consider this behaviour as more particularly illiberal on the part of men who are themselves a kind of gentlemen of the press and they ought to consider themselves as fortunate that the misused reporter has sought no other vengeance than from the tone of acidity with which he has seasoned his account of their proceedingsedinburgh newspaper  a meeting of the gentlemen and others interested in the celebrated publications called the waverley novels having been called by public advertisement the same was respectably attended by various literary characters of eminence and it being in the first place understood that individuals were to be denominated by the names assigned to them in the publications in question the eidolon or image of the author was unanimously called to the chair and jonathan oldbuck esq of monkbarns was requested to act as secretary  the preses then addressed the meeting to the following purpose  gentlemen i need scarcely remind you that we have a joint interest in the valuable property which has accumulated under our common labours while the public have been idly engaged in ascribing to one individual or another the immense mass of various matter which the labours of many had accumulated you gentlemen well know that every person in this numerous assembly has had his share in the honours and profits of our common success it is indeed to me a mystery how the sharpsighted could suppose so huge a mass of sense and nonsense jest and earnest humorous and pathetic good bad and indifferent amounting to scores of volumes could be the work of one hand when we know the doctrine so well laid down by the immortal adam smith concerning the division of labour were those who entertained an opinion so strange not wise enough to know that it requires twenty pairs of hands to make a thing so trifling as a pintwenty couple of dogs to kill an animal so insignificant as a fox  hout man said a stout countryman i have a grewbitch at home will worry the best tod in pomoragrains before ye could say dumpling  who is that person said the preses with some warmth as it appeared to us  a son of dandy dinmonts answered the unabashed rustic god ye may mind him i thinkane o the best in your aught i reckon and ye see i am come into the farm and maybe something mair and a whoen shares in this buiktrade of yours  well well replied the preses peace i pray thee peace gentlemen when thus interrupted i was on the point of introducing the business of this meeting being as is known to most of you the discussion of a proposition now on your table which i myself had the honour to suggest at last meeting namely that we do apply to the legislature for an act of parliament in ordinary to associate us into a corporate body and give us a personi standi in judicio with full power to prosecute and bring to conviction all encroachers upon our exclusive privilege in the manner therein to be made and provided in a letter from the ingenious mr dousterswivel which i have received  oldbuck warmlyi object to that fellows name being mentioned he is a common swindler  for shame mr oldbuck said the preses to use such terms respecting the ingenious inventor of the great patent machine erected at groningen where they put in raw hemp at one end and take out ruffled shirts at the other without the aid of hackle or ripplingcombloom shuttle or weaverscissors needle or seamstress he had just completed it by the addition of a piece of machinery to perform the work of the laundress but when it was exhibited before his honour the burgomaster it had the inconvenience of heating the smoothingirons redhot excepting which the experiment was entirely satisfactory he will become as rich as a jew  well added mr oldbuck if the scoundrel  scoundrel mr oldbuck said the preses is a most unseemly expression and i must call you to order mr dousterswivel is only an eccentric genius  pretty much the same in the greek muttered mr oldbuck and then said aloud and if this eccentric genius has work enough in singeing the dutchmans linen what the devil has he to do here  why he is of opinion that at the expense of a little mechanism some part of the labour of composing these novels might be saved by the use of steam there was a murmur of disapprobation at this proposal and the words blown up and bread taken out of our mouths and they might as well construct a steam parson were whispered and it was not without repeated calls to order that the preses obtained an opportunity of resuming his address  orderorder pray support the chair hear hear hear the chair  gentlemen it is to be premised that this mechanical operation can only apply to those parts of the narrative which are at present composed out of commonplaces such as the lovespeeches of the hero the description of the heroines person the moral observations of all sorts and the distribution of happiness at the conclusion of the piece mr dousterswivel has sent me some drawings which go far to show that by placing the words and phrases technically employed on these subjects in a sort of framework like that of the sage of laputa and changing them by such a mechanical process as that by which weavers of damask alter their patterns many new and happy combinations cannot fail to occur while the author tired of pumping his own brains may have an agreeable relaxation in the use of his fingers  i speak for information mr preses said the rev mr lawrence templeton but i am inclined to suppose the late publication of walladmor to have been the work of dousterswivel by the help of the steamengine footnote a romance by the author of waverley having been expected about this time at the great commercial mart of literature the fair of leipsic an ingenious gentleman of germany finding that none such appeared was so kind as to supply its place with a work in three volumes called walladmor to which he prefixed the christian and surname at full length the character of this work is given with tolerable fairness in the text   for shame mr templeton said the preses there are good things in walladmor i assure you had the writer known any thing about the country in which he laid the scene  or had he had the wit like some of ourselves to lay the scene in such a remote or distant country that nobody should be able to backspeer footnote scottish for crossexamine him him said mr oldbuck  why as to that said the preses you must consider the thing was got up for the german market where folks are no better judges of welsh manners than of welsh crw footnote the ale of the ancient british is called crw in their native language  i make it my prayer that this be not found the fault of our own next venture said dr dryasdust pointing to some books which lay on the table i fear the manners expressed in that betrothed of ours will scarce meet the approbation of the cymmerodion i could have wished that llhuyd had been looked into that powel had been consultedthat lewiss history had been quoted the preliminary dissertations particularly in order to give due weight to the work  weight said captain clutterbuck by my soul it is heavy enough already doctor  speak to the chair said the preses rather peevishly  to the chair then i say it said captain clutterbuck that the betrothed is heavy enough to break down the chair of john of gaunt or cadoredris itself i must add however that in my poor mind the talisman goes more trippingly off footnote this was an opinion universally entertained among the friends of the author  it is not for me to speak said the worthy minister of saint ronans well but yet i must say that being so long engaged upon the siege of ptolemais my work ought to have been brought out humble though it be before any other upon a similar subject at least  your siege parson said mr oldbuck with great contempt will you speak of your paltry prosedoings in my presence whose great historical poem in twenty books with notes in proportion has been postponed ad grcecas kalendas the preses who appeared to suffer a great deal during this discussion now spoke with dignity and determination gentlemen he said this sort of discussion is highly irregular there is a question before you and to that gentlemen i must confine your attention priority of publication let me remind you gentlemen is always referred to the committee of criticism whose determination on such subjects is without appeal i declare i will leave the chair if any more extraneous matter be introducedand now gentlemen that we are once more in order i would wish to have some gentleman speak upon the question whether as associated to carry on a jointstock trade in fictitious narrative in prose and verse we ought not to be incorporated by act of parliament what say you gentlemen to the proposal vis unita fortior is an old and true adage  societas mater discordiarum is a brocard as ancient and as veritable said oldbuck who seemed determined on this occasion to be pleased with no proposal that was announced by the chair  come monkbarns said the preses in his most coaxing manner you have studied the monastic institutions deeply and know there must be a union of persons and talents to do any thing respectable and attain a due ascendance over the spirit of the age tres faciunt collegiumit takes three monks to make a convent  and nine tailors to make a man replied oldbuck not in the least softened in his opposition a quotation as much to the purpose as the other  come come said the preses you know the prince of orange said to mr seymour without an association we are a rope of sand  i know replied oldbuck it would have been as seemly that none of the old leaven had been displayed on this occasion though you be the author of a jacobite novel i know nothing of the prince of orange after 1688 but i have heard a good deal of the immortal william the third  and to the best of my recollection said mr templeton whispering to oldbuck it was seymour made the remark to the prince not the princo to seymour but this is a specimen of our friends accuracy poor gentleman he trusts too much to his memory of late yearsfailing fast sirbreaking up  and breaking down too said mr oldbuck but what can you expect of a man too fond of his own hasty and flashy compositions to take the assistance of men of reading and of solid parts  no whisperingno caballingno private business gentlemen said the unfortunate preses who reminded us somewhat of a highland drover engaged in gathering and keeping in the straight road his excursive black cattle  i have not yet heard he continued a single reasonable objection to applying for the act of parliament of which the draught lies on the table you must be aware that the extremes of rude and of civilized society are in these our days on the point of approaching to each other in the patriarchal period a man is his own weaver tailor butcher shoemaker and so forth and in the age of stockcompanies as the present may be called an individual may be said in one sense to exercise the same plurality of trades in fact a man who has dipt largely into these speculations may combine his own expenditure with the improvement of his own income just like the ingenious hydraulic machine which by its very waste raises its own supplies of water such a person buys his bread from his own baking company his milk and cheese from his own dairy company takes off a new coat for the benefit of his own clothing company illuminates his house to advance his own gas establishment and drinks an additional bottle of wine for the benefit of the general wine importation company of which he is himself a member every act which would otherwise be one of mere extravagance is to such a person seasoned with the odor lucri and reconciled to prudence even if the price of the article consumed be extravagant and the quality indifferent the person who is in a manner his own customer is only imposed upon for his own benefit nay if the jointstock company of undertakers shall unite with the medical faculty as proposed by the late facetious doctor g under the firm of death and the doctor the shareholder might contrive to secure to his heirs a handsome slice of his own death bed and funeral expenses in short stockcompanies are the fashion of the age and an incorporating act will i think be particularly useful in bringing back the body over whom i have the honour to preside to a spirit of subordination highly necessary to success in every enterprise where joint wisdom talent and labour are to be employed it is with regret that i state that besides several differences amongst yourselves i have not myself for some time been treated with that deference among you which circumstances entitled me to expect  hinc illa lachryma muttered mr oldbuck  but continued the chairman i see other gentlemen impatient to deliver their opinions and i desire to stand in no mans way i thereforemy place in this chair forbidding me to originate the motionbeg some gentleman may move a committee for revising the draught of the bill now upon the table and which has been duly circulated among those having interest and take the necessary measures to bring it before the house early next session  there was a short murmur in the meeting and at length mr oldbuck again rose it seems sir he said addressing the chair that no one present is willing to make the motion you point at i am sorry no more qualified person has taken upon him to show any reasons in the contrair and that it has fallen on me as we scotsmen say to bellthecat with you anent whilk phrase pitscottie hath a pleasant jest of the great earl of angus  here a gentleman whispered to the speaker have a care of pitscottie and mr oldbuck as if taking the hint went on  but thats neither here nor therewell gentlemen to be short i think it unnecessary to enter into the general reasonings whilk have this day been delivered as i may say ex cathedra nor will i charge our worthy preses with an attempt to obtain over us per ambages and under colour of an act of parliament a despotic authority inconsistent with our freedom but this i will say that times are so much changed above stairs that whereas last year you might have obtained an act incorporating a stock company for riddling ashes you will not be able to procure one this year for gathering pearls what signifies then wasting the time of the meeting by inquiring whether or not we ought to go in at a door which we know to be bolted and barred in our face and in the face of all the companies for fire or air land or water which we have of late seen blighted  here there was a general clamour seemingly of approbation in which the words might be distinguished needless to think of it money thrown awaylost before the committee c c c but above the tumult the voices of two gentlemen in different corners of the room answered each other clear and loud like the blows of the two figures on saint dunstans clock and although the chairman in much agitation endeavoured to silence them his interruption had only the effect of cutting their words up into syllables thus     first voice the lord chan    second voice the lord lau    chairman loudly scandalum magnatum    first voice the lord chancel    second voice the lord lauder    chairman louder yet breach of privilege    first voice the lord chancellor    second voice my lord lauderdale    chairman at the highest pitch of his voice             called before the house    both voices together will never consent to such a bill  a general assent seemed to follow this last proposition which was propounded with as much emphasis as could be contributed by the united clappers of the whole meeting joined to those of the voices already mentioned  several persons present seemed to consider the business of the meeting as ended and were beginning to handle their hats and canes with a view to departure when the chairman who had thrown himself back in his chair with an air of manifest mortification and displeasure again drew himself up and commanded attention all stopped though some shrugged their shoulders as if under the predominating influence of a bore but the tenor of his discourse soon excited anxious attention  i perceive gentlemen he said that you are like the young birds who are impatient to leave their mothers nesttake care your own penfeathers are strong enough to support you since as for my part i am tired of supporting on my wing such a set of ungrateful gulls but it signifies nothing speakingi will no longer avail myself of such weak ministers as youi will discard youi will unbeget you as sir anthony absolute saysi will leave you and your whole hacked stock in tradeyour caverns and your castlesyour modern antiques and your antiquated moderns your confusion of times manners and circumstancesyour properties as playerfolk say of scenery and dressesthe whole of your exhausted

detected the following expressionsthe devil you willyou my dear sir youthe old gentleman forgets that he is the greatest liar since sir john mandeville  not the worse historian for that said oldbuck

generation once tingled and which shall be read by our children with an admiration approaching to incredulity such shall be the life of napoleon bonaparte by the author of waverley  in the general start and exclamation which followed this annunciation mr oldbuck dropped his snuffbox and the scottish rappee which dispersed itself in consequence had effects upon the nasal organs of our reporter ensconced as he was under the secretarys table which occasioned his being discovered and extruded in the illiberal and unhandsome manner we have mentioned with threats of farther damage to his nose ears and other portions of his body on the part especially of captain clutterbuck undismayed by these threats which indeed those of his profession are accustomed to hold at defiance our young man hovered about the door of the tavern but could only bring us the farther intelligence that the meeting had broken up in about a quarter of an hour after his expulsion in muchadmired disorder     chapter the first      now in these days were hotte wars upon the marches of wales    lewiss history   the chronicles from which this narrative is extracted assure us that during the long period when the welsh princes maintained their independence the year 1187 was peculiarly marked as favourable to peace betwixt them and their warlike neighbours the lords marchers who inhabited those formidable castles on the frontiers of the ancient british on the ruins of which the traveller gazes with wonder this was the time when baldwin archbishop of canterbury accompanied by the learned giraldus de barri afterwards bishop of saint davids preached the crusade from castle to castle from town to town awakened the inmost valleys of his native cambria with the call to arms for recovery of the holy sepulchre and while he deprecated the feuds and wars of christian men against each other held out to the martial spirit of the age a general object of ambition and a scene of adventure where the favour of heaven as well as earthy renown was to reward the successful champions  yet the british chieftains among the thousands whom this spirit stirring summons called from their native land to a distant and perilous expedition had perhaps the best excuse for declining the summons the superior skill of the anglonorman knights who were engaged in constant inroads on the welsh frontier and who were frequently detaching from it large portions which they fortified with castles thus making good what they had won was avenged indeed but not compensated by the furious inroads of the british who like the billows of a retiring tide rolled on successively with noise fury and devastation but on each retreat yielded ground insensibly to their invaders  a union among the native princes might have opposed a strong and permanent barrier to the encroachments of the strangers but they were unhappily as much at discord among themselves as they were with the normans and were constantly engaged in private war with each other of which the common enemy had the sole advantage  the invitation to the crusade promised something at least of novelty to a nation peculiarly ardent in their temper and it was accepted by many regardless of the consequences which must ensue to the country which they left defenceless even the most celebrated enemies of the saxon and norman race laid aside their enmity against the invaders of their country to enrol themselves under the banners of the crusade  amongst these was reckoned gwenwyn or more properly gwenwynwen though we retain the briefer appellative a british prince who continued exercising a precarious sovereignty over such parts of powysland as had not been subjugated by the mortimers guarines latimers fitzalans and other norman nobles who under various pretexts and sometimes contemning all other save the open avowal of superior force had severed and appropriated large portions of that once extensive and independent principality which when wales was unhappily divided into three parts on the death of roderick mawr fell to the lot of his youngest son mervyn the undaunted resolution and stubborn ferocity of gwenwyn descendant of that prince had long made him beloved among the tall men or champions of wales and he was enabled more by the number of those who served under him attracted by his reputation than by the natural strength of his dilapidated principality to retaliate the encroachments of the english by the most wasteful inroads  yet even gwenwyn on the present occasion seemed to forget his deeply sworn hatred against his dangerous neighbours the torch of pengwern for so gwenwyn was called from his frequently laying the province of shrewsbury in conflagration seemed at present to burn as calmly as a taper in the bower of a lady and the wolf of plinlimmon another name with which the bards had graced gwenwyn now slumbered as peacefully as the shepherds dog on the domestic hearth  but it was not alone the eloquence of baldwin or of girald which had lulled into peace a spirit so restless and fierce it is true their exhortations had done more towards it than gwenwyns followers had thought possible the archbishop had induced the british chief to break bread and to mingle in silvan sports with his nearest and hitherto one of his most determined enemies the old norman warrior sir raymond berenger who sometimes beaten sometimes victorious but never subdued had in spite of gwenwyns hottest incursions maintained his castle of garde doloureuse upon the marches of wales a place strong by nature and well fortified by art which the welsh prince had found it impossible to conquer either by open force or by stratagem and which remaining with a strong garrison in his rear often checked his incursions by rendering his retreat precarious on this account gwenwyn of powysland had an hundred times vowed the death of raymond berenger and the demolition of his castle but the policy of the sagacious old warrior and his long experience in all warlike practice were such as with the aid of his more powerful countrymen enabled him to defy the attempts of his fiery neighbour if there was a man therefore throughout england whom gwenwyn hated more than another it was raymond berenger and yet the good archbishop baldwin could prevail on the welsh prince to meet him as a friend and ally in the cause of the cross he even invited raymond to the autumn festivities of his welsh palace where the old knight in all honourable courtesy feasted and hunted for more than a week in the dominions of his hereditary foe  to requite this hospitality raymond invited the prince of powys with a chosen but limited train during the ensuing christmas to the garde doloureuse which some antiquaries have endeavoured to identify with the castle of colune on the river of the same name but the length of time and some geographical difficulties throw doubts upon this ingenious conjecture  as the welshman crossed the drawbridge he was observed by his faithful bard to shudder with involuntary emotion nor did cadwallon experienced as he was in life and well acquainted with the character of his master make any doubt that he was at that moment strongly urged by the apparent opportunity to seize upon the strong fortress which had been so long the object of his cupidity even at the expense of violating his good faith  dreading lest the struggle of his masters conscience and his ambition should terminate unfavourably for his fame the bard arrested his attention by whispering in their native language that the teeth which bite hardest are those which are out of sight and gwenwyn looking around him became aware that though only unarmed squires and pages appeared in the courtyard yet the towers and battlements connecting them were garnished with archers and menatarms  they proceeded to the banquet at which gwenwyn for the first time beheld eveline berenger the sole child of the norman castellane the inheritor of his domains and of his supposed wealth aged only sixteen and the most beautiful damsel upon the welsh marches many a spear had already been shivered in maintenance of her charms and the gallant hugo de lacy constable of chester one of the most redoubted warriors of the time had laid at evelines feet the prize which his chivalry had gained in a great tournament held near that ancient town gwenwyn considered these triumphs as so many additional recommendations to eveline her beauty was incontestable and she was heiress of the fortress which he so much longed to possess and which he began now to think might be acquired by means more smooth than those with which he was in the use of working out his will  again the hatred which subsisted between the british and their saxon and norman invaders his long and illextinguished feud with this very raymond berenger a general recollection that alliances between the welsh and english had rarely been happy and a consciousness that the measure which he meditated would be unpopular among his followers and appear a dereliction of the systematic principles on which he had hitherto acted restrained him from speaking his wishes to raymond or his daughter the idea of the rejection of his suit did not for a moment occur to him he was convinced he had but to speak his wishes and that the daughter of a norman castellane whose rank or power were not of the highest order among the nobles of the frontiers must be delighted and honoured by a proposal for allying his family with that of the sovereign of a hundred mountains  there was indeed another objection which in later times would have been of considerable weightgwenwyn was already married but brengwain was a childless bride sovereigns and among sovereigns the welsh prince ranked himself marry for lineage and the pope was not likely to be scrupulous where the question was to oblige a prince who had assumed the cross with such ready zeal even although in fact his thoughts had been much more on the garde doloureuse than on jerusalem in the meanwhile if raymond berenger as was suspected was not liberal enough in his opinions to permit eveline to hold the temporary rank of concubine which the manners of wales warranted gwenwyn to offer as an interim arrangement he had only to wait for a few months and sue for a divorce through the bishop of saint davids or some other intercessor at the court of rome  agitating these thoughts in his mind gwenwyn prolonged his residence at the castle of berenger from christmas till twelfthday and endured the presence of the norman cavaliers who resorted to raymonds festal halls although regarding themselves in virtue of their rank of knighthood equal to the most potent sovereigns they made small account of the long descent of the welsh prince who in their eyes was but the chief of a semibarbarous province while he on his part considered them little better than a sort of privileged robbers and with the utmost difficulty restrained himself from manifesting his open hatred when he beheld them careering in the exercises of chivalry the habitual use of which rendered them such formidable enemies to his country at length the term of feasting was ended and knight and squire departed from the castle which once more assumed the aspect of a solitary and guarded frontier fort  but the prince of powysland while pursuing his sports on his own mountains and valleys found that even the abundance of the game as well as his release from the society of the norman chivalry who affected to treat him as an equal profited him nothing so long as the light and beautiful form of eveline on her white palfrey was banished from the train of sportsmen in short he hesitated no longer but took into his confidence his chaplain an able and sagacious man whose pride was flattered by his patrons communication and who besides saw in the proposed scheme some contingent advantages for himself and his order by his counsel the proceedings for gwenwyns divorce were prosecuted under favourable auspices and the unfortunate brengwain was removed to a nunnery which perhaps she found a more cheerful habitation than the lonely retreat in which she had led a neglected life ever since gwenwyn had despaired of her bed being blessed with issue father einion also dealt with the chiefs and elders of the land and represented to them the advantage which in future wars they were certain to obtain by the possession of the garde doloureuse which had for more than a century covered and protected a considerable tract of country rendered their advance difficult and their retreat perilous and in a word prevented their carrying their incursions as far as the gates of shrewsbury as for the union with the saxon damsel the fetters which it was to form might not the good father hinted be found more permanent than those which had bound gwenwyn to her predecessor brengwain  these arguments mingled with others adapted to the views and wishes of different individuals were so prevailing that the chaplain in the course of a few weeks was able to report to his princely patron that this proposed match would meet with no opposition from the elders and nobles of his dominions a golden bracelet six ounces in weight was the instant reward of the priests dexterity in negotiation and he was appointed by gwenwyn to commit to paper those proposals which he doubted not were to throw the castle of garde doloureuse notwithstanding its melancholy name into an ecstasy of joy with some difficulty the chaplain prevailed on his patron to say nothing in this letter upon his temporary plan of concubinage which he wisely judged might be considered as an affront both by eveline and her father the matter of the divorce he represented as almost entirely settled and wound up his letter with a moral application in which were many allusions to vashti esther and ahasuerus  having despatched this letter by a swift and trusty messenger the british prince opened in all solemnity the feast of easter which had come round during the course of these external and internal negotiations  upon the approaching holytide to propitiate the minds of his subjects and vassals they were invited in large numbers to partake of a princely festivity at castellcoch or the red castle as it was then called since better known by the name of powyscastle and in latter times the princely seat of the duke of beaufort the architectural magnificence of this noble residence is of a much later period than that of gwenwyn whose palace at the time we speak of was a low longroofed edifice of red stone whence the castle derived its name while a ditch and palisade were in addition to the commanding situation its most important defences     chapter the second       in madocs tent the clarion sounds     with rapid clangor hurried far     each hill and dale the note rebounds     but when return the sons of war     thou born of stern necessity     dull peace the valley yields to thee     and owns thy melancholy sway      welsh poem   the feasts of the ancient british princes usually exhibited all the rude splendour and liberal indulgence of mountain hospitality and gwenwyn was on the present occasion anxious to purchase popularity by even an unusual display of profusion for he was sensible that the alliance which he meditated might indeed be tolerated but could not be approved by his subjects and followers  the following incident trifling in itself confirmed his apprehensions passing one evening when it was become nearly dark by the open window of a guardroom usually occupied by some few of his most celebrated soldiers who relieved each other in watching his palace he heard morgan a man distinguished for strength courage and ferocity say to the companion with whom he was sitting by the watchfire gwenwyn is turned to a priest or a woman when was it before these last months that a follower of his was obliged to gnaw the meat from the bone so closely as i am now peeling the morsel which i hold in my hand footnote it is said in highland tradition that one of the macdonalds of the isles who had suffered his broadsword to remain sheathed for some months after his marriage with a beautiful woman was stirred to a sudden and furious expedition against the mainland by hearing conversation to the above purpose among his bodyguard  wait but awhile replied his comrade till the norman match be accomplished and so small will be the prey we shall then drive from the saxon churls that we may be glad to swallow like hungry dogs the very bones themselves  gwenwyn heard no more of their conversation but this was enough to alarm his pride as a soldier and his jealousy as a prince he was sensible that the people over whom he ruled were at once fickle in their disposition impatient of long repose and full of hatred against their neighbours and he almost dreaded the consequences of the inactivity to which a long truce might reduce them the risk was now incurred however and to display even more than his wonted splendour and liberality seemed the best way of reconciling the wavering affections of his subjects  a norman would have despised the barbarous magnificence of an entertainment consisting of kine and sheep roasted whole of goats flesh and deers flesh seethed in the skins of the animals themselves for the normans piqued themselves on the quality rather than the quantity of their food and eating rather delicately than largely ridiculed the coarser taste of the britons although the last were in their banquets much more moderate than were the saxons nor would the oceans of crw and hydromel which overwhelmed the guests like a deluge have made up in their opinion for the absence of the more elegant and costly beverage which they had learnt to love in the south of europe milk prepared in various ways was another material of the british entertainment which would not have received their approbation although a nutriment which on ordinary occasions often supplied the avant of all others among the ancient inhabitants whose country was rich in flocks and herds but poor in agricultural produce  the banquet was spread in a long low hall built of rough wood lined with shingles having a fire at each end the smoke of which unable to find its way through the imperfect chimneys in the roof rolled in cloudy billows above the heads of the revellers who sat on low seats purposely to avoid its stifling fumes footnote the welsh houses like those of the cognate tribes in ireland and in the highlands of scotland were very imperfectly supplied with chimneys hence in the history of the gwydir family the striking expression of a welsh chieftain who the house being assaulted and set on fire by his enemies exhorted his friends to stand to their defence saying he had seen as much smoke in the hall upon a christmas even the mien and appearance of the company assembled was wild and even in their social hours almost terrific their prince himself had the gigantic port and fiery eye fitted to sway an unruly people whose delight was in the field of battle and the long mustaches which he and most of his champions wore added to the formidable dignity of his presence like most of those present gwenwyn was clad in a simple tunic of white linen cloth a remnant of the dress which the romans had introduced into provincial britain and he was distinguished by the eudorchawg or chain of twisted gold links with which the celtic tribes always decorated their chiefs the collar indeed representing in form the species of links made by children out of rushes was common to chieftains of inferior rank many of whom bore it in virtue of their birth or had won it by military exploits but a ring of gold bent around the head intermingled with gwenwyns hairfor he claimed the rank of one of three diademed princes of wales and his armlets and anklets of the same metal were peculiar to the prince of powys as an independent sovereign two squires of his body who dedicated their whole attention to his service stood at the princes back and at his feet sat a page whose duty it was to keep them warm by chafing and by wrapping them in his mantle the same right of sovereignty which assigned to gwenwyn his golden crownlet gave him a title to the attendance of the footbearer or youth who lay on the rushes and whose duty it was to cherish the princes feet in his lap or bosom footnote see madoc for this literal foot pages office and duties mr southeys notes inform us the footbearer shall hold the feet of the king in his lap from the time he reclines at the board till he goes to rest and he shall chafe them with a towel and during all that time shall watch that no harm befalls the king he shall eat of the shame dish from which the king takes his food he shall light the first candle before the king such are the instructions given for this part of royal ceremonial in the laws of howell dha it may be added that probably upon this celtic custom was founded one of those absurd and incredible representations which were propagated at the time of the french revolution to stir up the peasants against their feudal superiors it was pretended that some feudal seigneurs asserted their right to kill and disembowel a peasant in order to put their own feet within the expiring body and so recover them from the chill  notwithstanding the military disposition of the guests and the danger arising from the feuds into which they were divided few of the feasters wore any defensive armour except the light goatskin buckler which hung behind each mans seat on the other hand they were well provided with offensive weapons for the broad sharp short twoedged sword was another legacy of the romans most added a woodknife or poniard and there were store of javelins darts bows and arrows pikes halberds danish axes and welsh hooks and bills so in case of illblood arising during the banquet there was no lack of weapons to work mischief  but although the form of the feast was somewhat disorderly and that the revellers were unrestrained by the stricter rules of goodbreeding which the laws of chivalry imposed the easter banquet of gwenwyn possessed in the attendance of twelve eminent bards one source of the most exalted pleasure in a much higher degree than the proud normans could themselves boast the latter it is true had their minstrels a race of men trained to the profession of poetry song and music but although those arts were highly honoured and the individual professors when they attained to eminence were often richly rewarded and treated with distinction the order of minstrels as such was held in low esteem being composed chiefly of worthless and dissolute strollers by whom the art was assumed in order to escape from the necessity of labour and to have the means of pursuing a wandering and dissipated course of life such in all times has been the censure upon the calling of those who dedicate themselves to the public amusement among whom those distinguished by individual excellence are sometimes raised high in the social circle while far the more numerous professors who only reach mediocrity are sunk into the lower scale but such was not the case with the order of bards in wales who succeeding to the dignity of the druids under whom they had originally formed a subordinate fraternity had many immunities were held in the highest reverence and esteem and exercised much influence with their countrymen their power over the public mind even rivalled that of the priests themselves to whom indeed they bore some resemblance for they never wore arms were initiated into their order by secret and mystic solemnities and homage was rendered to their awen or flow of poetic inspiration as if it had been indeed marked with a divine character thus possessed of power and consequence the bards were not unwilling to exercise their privileges and sometimes in doing so their manners frequently savoured of caprice  this was perhaps the case with cadwallon the chief bard of gwenwyn and who as such was expected to have poured forth the tide of song in the banquetinghall of his prince but neither the anxious and breathless expectation of the assembled chiefs and championsneither the dead silence which stilled the roaring hall when his harp was reverently placed before him by his attendantnor even the commands or entreaties of the prince himselfcould extract from cadwallon more than a short and interrupted prelude upon the instrument the notes of which arranged themselves into an air inexpressibly mournful and died away in silence the prince frowned darkly on the bard who was himself far too deeply lost in gloomy thought to offer any apology or even to observe his displeasure again he touched a few wild notes and raising his looks upward seemed to be on the very point of bursting forth into a tide of song similar to those with which this master of his art was wont to enchant his hearers but the effort was in vainhe declared that his right hand was withered and pushed the instrument from him  a murmur went round the company and gwenwyn read in their aspects that they received the unusual silence of cadwallon on this high occasion as a bad omen he called hastily on a young and ambitious bard named caradoc of menwygent whose rising fame was likely soon to vie with the established reputation of cadwallon and summoned him to sing something which might command the applause of his sovereign and the gratitude of the company the young man was ambitious and understood the arts of a courtier he commenced a poem in which although under a feigned name he drew such a poetic picture of eveline berenger that gwenwyn was enraptured and while all who had seen the beautiful original at once recognized the resemblance the eyes of the prince confessed at once his passion for the subject and his admiration of the poet the figures of celtic poetry in themselves highly imaginative were scarce sufficient for the enthusiasm of the ambitious bard rising in his tone as he perceived the feelings which he was exciting the praises of the prince mingled with those of the norman beauty and as a lion said the poet can only be led by the hand of a chaste and beautiful maiden so a chief can only acknowledge the empire of the most virtuous the most lovely of her sex who asks of the noonday sun in what quarter of the world he was born and who shall ask of such charms as hers to what country they owe their birth  enthusiasts in pleasure as in war and possessed of imaginations which answered readily to the summons of their poets the welsh chiefs and leaders united in acclamations of applause and the song of the bard went farther to render popular the intended alliance of the prince than had all the graver arguments of his priestly precursor in the same topic  gwenwyn himself in a transport of delight tore off the golden bracelets which he wore to bestow them upon a bard whose song had produced an effect so desirable and said as he looked at the silent and sullen cadwallon the silent harp was never strung with golden wires  prince answered the bard whose pride was at least equal to that of gwenwyn himself you pervert the proverb of taliessinit is the flattering harp which never lacked golden strings  gwenwyn turning sternly towards him was about to make an angry answer when the sudden appearance of jorworth the messenger whom he had despatched to raymond berenger arrested his purpose this rude envoy entered the hall barelegged excepting the sandals of goatskin which he wore and having on his shoulder a cloak of the same and a short javelin in his hand the dust on his garments and the flush on his brow showed with what hasty zeal his errand had been executed gwenwyn demanded of him eagerly what news from garde doloureuse jorworth ap jevan  i bear them in my bosom said the son of jevan and with much reverence he delivered to the prince a packet bound with silk and sealed with the impression of a swan the ancient cognizance of the house of berenger himself ignorant of writing or reading gwenwyn in anxious haste delivered the letter to cadwallon who usually acted as secretary when the chaplain was not in presence as chanced then to be the case cadwallon looking at the letter said briefly i read no latin ill betide the norman who writes to a prince of powys in other language than that of britain and well was the hour when that noble tongue alone was spoken from tintadgel to cairleoil  gwenwyn only replied to him with an angry glance  where is father einion said the impatient prince  he assists in the church replied one of his attendants for it is the feast of saint  were it the feast of saint david said gwenwyn and were the pyx between his hands he must come hither to me instantly  one of the chief henchmen sprung off to command his attendance and in the meantime gwenwyn eyed the letter containing the secret of his fate but which it required an interpreter to read with such eagerness and anxiety that caradoc elated by his former success threw in a few notes to divert if possible the tenor of his patrons thoughts during the interval a light and lively air touched by a hand which seemed to hesitate like the submissive voice of an inferior fearing to interrupt his masters meditations introduced a stanza or two applicable to the subject  and what though thou o scroll he said apostrophizing the letter which lay on the table before his master dost speak with the tongue of the stranger hath not the cuckoo a harsh note and yet she tells us of green buds and springing flowers what if thy language be that of the stoled priest is it not the same which binds hearts and hands together at the altar and what though thou delayest to render up thy treasures are not all pleasures most sweet when enhanced by expectation what were the chase if the deer dropped at our feet the instant he started from the coveror what value were there in the love of the maiden were it yielded without coy delay  the song of the bard was here broken short by the entrance of the priest who hasty in obeying the summons of his impatient master had not tarried to lay aside even the stole which he had worn in the holy service and many of the elders thought it was no good omen that so habited a priest should appear in a festive assembly and amid profane minstrelsy  the priest opened the letter of the norman baron and struck with surprise at the contents lifted his eyes in silence  read it exclaimed the fierce gwenwyn  so please you replied the more prudent chaplain a smaller company were a fitter audience  read it aloud repeated the prince in a still higher tone there sit none here who respect not the honour of their prince or who deserve not his confidence read it i say aloud and by saint david if raymond the norman hath dared  he stopped short and reclining on his seat composed himself to an attitude of attention but it was easy for his followers to fill up the breach in his exclamation which prudence had recommended  the voice of the chaplain was low and illassured as he read the following epistle     raymond berenger the noble norman knight seneschal    of the garde doloureuse to gwenwyn prince of powys    may peace be between them sendeth health  your letter craving the hand of our daughter eveline berenger was safely delivered to us by your servant jorworth ap jevan and we thank you heartily for the good meaning therein expressed to us and to ours but considering within ourselves the difference of blood and lineage with the impediments and causes of offence which have often arisen in like cases we hold it fitter to match our daughter among our own people and this by no case in disparagement of you but solely for the weal of you of ourselves and of our mutual dependants who will be the more safe from the risk of quarrel betwixt us that we essay not to draw the bonds of our intimacy more close than beseemeth the sheep and the goats feed together in peace on the same pastures but they mingle not in blood or race the one with the other moreover our daughter eveline hath been sought in marriage by a noble and potent lord of the marches hugo de lacy the constable of chester to which most honourable suit we have returned a favourable answer it is therefore impossible that we should in this matter grant to you the boon you seek nevertheless you shall at all times find us in other matters willing to pleasure you and hereunto we call god and our lady and saint mary magdalene of quatford to witness to whose keeping we heartily recommend you  written by our command at our castle of garde doloureuse within the marches of wales by a reverend priest father aldrovand a black monk of the house of wenlock and to which we have appended our seal upon the eve of the blessed martyr saint alphegius to whom be honour and glory  the voice of father einion faltered and the scroll which he held in his hand trembled in his grasp as he arrived at the conclusion of this epistle for well he knew that insults more slight than gwenwyn would hold the least word it contained were sure to put every drop of his british blood into the most vehement commotion nor did it fail to do so the prince had gradually drawn himself up from the posture of repose in which he had prepared to listen to the epistle and when it concluded he sprung on his feet like a startled lion spurning from him as he rose the footbearer who rolled at some distance on the floor priest he said hast thou read that accursed scroll fairly for if thou hast added or diminished one word or one letter i will have thine eyes so handled that thou shalt never read letter more  the monk replied trembling for he was well aware that the sacerdotal character was not uniformly respected among the irascible welshmen by the oath of my order mighty prince i have read word for word and letter for letter  there was a momentary pause while the fury of gwenwyn at this unexpected affront offered to him in the presence of all his uckelwyr ie noble chiefs literally men of high stature seemed too big for utterance when the silence was broken by a few notes from the hitherto mute harp of cadwallon the prince looked round at first with displeasure at the interruption for he was himself about to speak but when he beheld the bard bending over his harp with an air of inspiration and blending together with unexampled skill the wildest and most exalted tones of his art he himself became an auditor instead of a speaker and cadwallon not the prince seemed to become the central point of the assembly on whom all eyes were bent and to whom each ear was turned with breathless eagerness as if his strains were the responses of an oracle  we wed not with the strangerthus burst the song from the lips of the poet vortigern

cyverliockmay thy plume be the topmost of its waves  all thoughts of peace thoughts which in themselves were foreign to the hearts of the warlike british passed before the song of cadwallon like dust before the whirlwind and the unanimous shout of the assembly declared for instant war the prince himself spoke not but looking proudly around him flung abroad his arm as one who cheers his followers to the attack  the priest had he dared might have reminded gwenwyn that the cross which he had assumed on his shoulder had consecrated his arm to the holy war and precluded his engaging in any civil strife but the task was too dangerous for father einions courage and he shrunk from the hall to the seclusion of his own convent caradoc whose brief hour of popularity was past also retired with humbled and dejected looks and not without a glance of indignation at his triumphant rival who had so judiciously reserved his display of art for the theme of war that was ever most popular with the audience  the chiefs resumed their seats no longer for the purpose of festivity but to fix in the hasty manner customary among these prompt warriors where they were to assemble their forces which upon such occasions comprehended almost all the ablebodied males of the countryfor all excepting the priests and the bards were soldiersand to settle the order of their descent upon the devoted marches where they proposed to signalize by general ravage their sense of the insult which their prince had received by the rejection of his suit     chapter the third     the sands are numberd that make up my life   here must i stay and here my life must end      henry vi act i scene iv   when raymond berenger had despatched his mission to the prince of powys he was not unsuspicious though altogether fearless of the result he sent messengers to the several dependants who held their fiefs by the tenure of cornage and warned them to be on the alert that he might receive instant notice of the approach of the enemy these vassals as is well known occupied the numerous towers which like so many falconnests had been built on the points most convenient to defend the frontiers and were bound to give signal of any incursion of the welsh by blowing their horns which sounds answered from tower to tower and from station to station gave the alarm for general defence but although raymond considered these precautions as necessary from the fickle and precarious temper of his neighbours and for maintaining his own credit as a soldier he was far from believing the danger to be imminent for the preparations of the welsh though on a much more extensive scale than had lately been usual were as secret as their resolution of war had been suddenly adopted  it was upon the second morning after the memorable festival of castellcoch that the tempest broke on the norman frontier at first a single long and keen bugleblast announced the approach of the enemy presently the signals of alarm were echoed from every castle and tower on the borders of shropshire where every place of habitation was then a fortress beacons were lighted upon crags and eminences the bells were rung backward in the churches and towns while the general and earnest summons to arms announced an extremity of danger which even the inhabitants of that unsettled country had not hitherto experienced  amid this general alarm raymond berenger having busied himself in arranging his few but gallant followers and adherents and taken such modes of procuring intelligence of the enemys strength and motions as were in his power at length ascended the watch tower of the castle to observe in person the country around already obscured in several places by the clouds of smoke which announced the progress and the ravages of the invaders he was speedily joined by his favourite squire to whom the unusual heaviness of his masters looks was cause of much surprise for till now they had ever been blithest at the hour of battle the squire held in his hand his masters helmet for sir raymond was all armed saving the head  dennis morolt said the veteran soldier are our vassals and liegemen all mustered  all noble sir but the flemings who are not yet come in  the lazy hounds why tarry they said raymond ill policy it is to plant such sluggish natures in our borders they are like their own steers fitter to tug a plough than for aught that requires mettle  with your favour said dennis the knaves can do good service notwithstanding that wilkin flammock of the green can strike like the hammers of his own fullingmill  he will fight i believe when he cannot help it said raymond but he has no stomach for such exercise and is as slow and as stubborn as a mule  and therefore are his countrymen rightly matched against the welsh replied dennis morolt that their solid and unyielding temper may be a fit foil to the fiery and headlong dispositions of our dangerous neighbours just as restless waves are best opposed by steadfast rockshark sir i hear wilkin flammocks step ascending the turretstair as deliberately as ever monk mounted to matins  step by step the heavy sound approached until the form of the huge and substantial fleming at length issued from the turretdoor to the platform where they were conversing wilkin flammock was cased in bright armour of unusual weight and thickness and cleaned with exceeding care which marked the neatness of his nation but contrary to the custom of the normans entirely plain and void of carving gilding or any sort of ornament the basenet or steelcap had no visor and left exposed a broad countenance with heavy and unpliable features which announced the character of his temper and understanding he carried in his hand a heavy mace  so sir fleming said the castellane you are in no hurry methinks to repair to the rendezvous  so please you answered the fleming we were compelled to tarry that we might load our wains with our bales of cloth and other property  ha wainshow many wains have you brought with you  six noble sir replied wilkin  and how many men demanded raymond berenger  twelve valiant sir answered flammock  only two men to each baggagewain i wonder you would thus encumber yourself said berenger  under your favour sir once more replied wilkin it is only the value which i and my comrades set upon our goods that inclines us to defend them with our bodies and had we been obliged to leave our cloth to the plundering clutches of yonder vagabonds i should have seen small policy in stopping here to give them the opportunity of adding murder to robbery gloucester should have been my first haltingplace  the norman knight gazed on the flemish artisan for such was wilkin flammock with such a mixture of surprise and contempt as excluded indignation i have heard much he said but this is the first time that i have heard one with a beard on his lip avouch himself a coward  nor do you hear it now answered flammock with the utmost composurei am always ready to fight for life and property and my coming to this country where they are both in constant danger shows that i care not much how often i do so but a sound skin is better than a slashed one for all that  well said raymond berenger fight after thine own fashion so thou wilt but fight stoutly with that long body of thine we are like to have need for all that we can dosaw you aught of these rascaille welshhave they gwenwyns banner amongst them  i saw it with the white dragon displayed replied wilkin i could not but know it since it was broidered in my own loom  raymond looked so grave upon this intelligence that dennis morolt unwilling the fleming should mark it thought it necessary to withdraw his attention i can tell thee he said to flammock that when the constable of chester joins us with his lances you shall see your handiwork the dragon fly faster homeward than ever flew the shuttle which wove it  it must fly before the constable comes up dennis morolt said berenger else it will fly triumphant over all our bodies  in the name of god and the holy virgin said dennis what may you mean sir knightnot that we should fight with the welsh before the constable joins ushe paused and then well understanding the firm yet melancholy glance with which his master answered the question he proceeded with yet more vehement earnestnessyou cannot mean ityou cannot intend that we shall quit this castle which we have so often made good against them and contend in the field with two hundred men against thousands think better of it my beloved master and let not the rashness of your old age blemish that character for wisdom and warlike skill which your former life has so nobly won  i am not angry with you for blaming my purpose dennis answered the norman for i know you do it in love to me and mine but dennis morolt this thing must bewe must fight the welshmen within these three hours or the name of raymond berenger must be blotted from the genealogy of his house  and so we willwe will fight them my noble master said the esquire fear not cold counsel from dennis morolt where battle is the theme but we will fight them under the walls of the castle with honest wilkin flammock and his crossbows on the wall to protect our flanks and afford us some balance against the numerous odds  not so dennis answered his masterin the open field we must fight them or thy master must rank but as a mansworn knight know that when i feasted yonder wily savage in my halls at christmas and when the wine was flowing fastest around gwenwyn threw out some praises of the fastness and strength of my castle in a manner which intimated it was these advantages alone that had secured me in former wars from defeat and captivity i spoke in answer when i had far better been silent for what availed my idle boast but as a fetter to bind me to a deed next to madness if i said a prince of the cymry shall come in hostile fashion before the garde doloureuse let him pitch his standard down in yonder plain by the bridge and by the word of a good knight and the faith of a christian man raymond berenger will meet him as willingly be he many or be he few as ever welshman was met withal  dennis was struck speechless when he heard of a promise so rash so fatal but his was not the casuistry which could release his master from the fetters with which his unwary confidence had bound him it was otherwise with wilkin flammock he staredhe almost laughed notwithstanding the reverence due to the castellane and his own insensibility to risible emotions and is this all he said if your honour had pledged yourself to pay one hundred florins to a jew or to a lombard no doubt you must have kept the day or forfeited your pledge but surely one day is as good as another to keep a promise for fighting and that day is best in which the promiser is strongest but indeed after all what signifies any promise over a wine flagon  it signifies as much as a promise can do that is given elsewhere the promiser said berenger escapes not the sin of a word breaker because he hath been a drunken braggart  for the sin said dennis sure i am that rather than you should do such a deed of dole the abbot of glastonbury would absolve you for a florin  but what shall wipe out the shame demanded berengerhow shall i dare to show myself again among press of knights who have broken my word of battle pledged for fear of a welshman and his naked savages no dennis morolt speak on it no more be it for weal or wo we fight them today and upon yonder fair field  it may be said flammock that gwenwyn may have forgotten the promise and so fail to appear to claim it in the appointed space for as we heard your wines of france flooded his welsh brains deeply  he again alluded to it on the morning after it was made said the castellanetrust me he will not forget what will give him such a chance of removing me from his path for ever  as he spoke they observed that large clouds of dust which had been seen at different points of the landscape were drawing down towards the opposite side of the river over which an ancient bridge extended itself to the appointed place of combat they were at no loss to conjecture the cause it was evident that gwenwyn recalling the parties who had been engaged in partial devastation was bending with his whole forces towards the bridge and the plain beyond it  let us rush down and secure the pass said dennis morolt we may debate with them with some equality by the advantage of defending the bridge your word bound you to the plain as to a field of battle but it did not oblige you to forego such advantages as the passage of the bridge would afford our men our horses are readylet our bowmen secure the banks and my life on the issue  when i promised to meet him in yonder field i meant replied raymond berenger to give the welshman the full advantage of equality of ground i so meant ithe so understood it and what avails keeping my word in the letter if i break it in the sense we move not till the last welshman has crossed the bridge and then  and then said dennis we move to our deathmay god forgive our sinsbut  but what said berenger something sticks in thy mind that should have vent  my young lady your daughter the lady eveline  i have told her what is to be she shall remain in the castle where i will leave a few chosen veterans with you dennis to command them in twentyfour hours the siege will be relieved and we have defended it longer with a slighter garrison then to her aunt the abbess of the benedictine sistersthou dennis wilt see her placed there in honour and safety and my sister will care for her future provision as her wisdom shall determine i leave you at this pinch said dennis morolt bursting into tears i shut myself up within walls when my master rides to his last of battlesi become esquire to a lady even though it be to the lady eveline when he lies dead under his shieldraymond berenger is it for this that i have buckled thy armour so often  the tears gushed from the old warriors eyes as fast as from those of a girl who weeps for her lover and raymond taking him kindly by the hand said in a soothing tone do not think my good old servant that were honour to be won i would drive thee from my side but this is a wild and an inconsiderate deed to which my fate or my folly has bound me i die to save my name from dishonour but alas i must leave on my memory the charge of imprudence  let me share your imprudence my dearest master said dennis morolt earnestlythe poor esquire has no business to be thought wiser than his master in many a battle my valour derived some little fame from partaking in thee deeds which won your renown deny me not the right to share in that blame which your temerity may incur let them not say that so rash was his action even his old esquire was not permitted to partake in it i am part of yourselfit is murder to every man whom you take with you if you leave me behind  dennis said berenger you make me feel yet more bitterly the folly i have yielded to i would grant you the boon you ask sad as it isbut my daughter  sir knight said the fleming who had listened to this dialogue with somewhat less than his usual apathy it is not my purpose this day to leave this castle now if you could trust my troth to do what a plain man may for the protection of my lady eveline  how sirrah said raymond you do not propose to leave the castle who gives you right to propose or dispose in the case until my pleasure is known  i shall be sorry to have words with you sir castellane said the imperturbable flemingbut i hold here in this township certain mills tenements clothyards and so forth for which i am to pay manservice in defending this castle of the garde doloureuse and in this i am ready but if you call on me to march from hence leaving the same castle defenceless and to offer up my life in a battle which you acknowledge to be desperate i must needs say my tenure binds me not to obey thee  base mechanic said morolt laying his hand on his dagger and menacing the fleming  but raymond berenger interfered with voice and handharm him not morolt and blame him not he hath a sense of duty though not after our manner and he and his knaves will fight best behind stone walls they are taught also these flemings by the practice of their own country the attack and defence of walled cities and fortresses and are especially skilful in working of mangonels and military engines there are several of his countrymen in the castle besides his own followers these i propose to leave behind and i think they will obey him more readily than any but thyselfhow thinkst thou thou wouldst not i know from a miscontrued point of honour or a blind love to me leave this important place and the safety of eveline in doubtful hands  wilkin flammock is but a flemish clown noble sir answered dennis as much overjoyed as if he had obtained some important advantage but i must needs say he is as stout and true as any whom you might trust and besides his own shrewdness will teach him there is more to be gained by defending such a castle as this than by yielding it to strangers who may not be likely to keep the terms of surrender however fairly they may offer them  it is fixed then said raymond berenger then dennis thou shalt go with me and he shall remain behindwilkin flammock he said addressing the fleming solemnly i speak not to thee the language of chivalry of which thou knowest nothing but as thou art an honest man and a true christian i conjure thee to stand to the defence of this castle let no promise of the enemy draw thee to any base compositionno threat to any surrender relief must speedily arrive if you fulfil your trust to me and to my daughter hugo de lacy will reward you richlyif you fail he will punish you severely  sir knight said flammock i am pleased you have put your trust so far in a plain handicraftsman for the welsh i am come from a land for which we were compelledyearly compelledto struggle with the sea and they who can deal with the waves in a tempest need not fear an undisciplined people in their fury your daughter shall be as dear to me as mine own and in that faith you may prick forthif indeed you will not still like a wiser man shut gate down portcullis up drawbridge and let your archers and my crossbows man the wall and tell the knaves you are not the fool that they take you for  good fellow that must not be said the knight i hear my daughters voice he added hastily i would not again meet her again to part from her to heavens keeping i commit thee honest flemingfollow me dennis morolt  the old castellane descended the stair of the southern tower hastily just as his daughter eveline ascended that of the eastern turret to throw herself at his feet once more she was followed by the father aldrovand chaplain of her father by an old and almost invalid huntsman whose more active services in the field and the chase had been for some time chiefly limited to the superintendence of the knights kennels and the charge especially of his more favourite hounds and by rose flammock the daughter of wilkin a blueeyed flemish maiden round plump and shy as a partridge who had been for some time permitted to keep company with the highborn norman damsel in a doubtful station betwixt that of an humble friend and a superior domestic eveline rushed upon the battlements her hair dishevelled and her eyes drowned in tears and eagerly demanded of the fleming where her father was  flammock made a clumsy reverence and attempted some answer but his voice seemed to fail him he turned his back upon eveline without ceremony and totally disregarding the anxious inquiries of the huntsman and the chaplain he said hastily to his daughter in his own language mad work mad work look to the poor maiden roschender alter herr ist verruckt footnote the old lord is frantic  without farther speech he descended the stairs and never paused till he reached the buttery here he called like a lion for the controller of these regions by the various names of kammerer kellermaster and so forth to which the old reinold an ancient norman esquire answered not until the netherlander fortunately recollected his anglonorman title of butler this his regular name of office was the key to the butteryhatch and the old man instantly appeared with his gray cassock and high rolled hose a ponderous bunch of keys suspended by a silver chain to his broad leathern girdle which in consideration of the emergency of the time he had thought it right to balance on the left side with a huge falchion which seemed much too weighty for his old arm to wield  what is your will he said master flammock or what are your commands since it is my lords pleasure that they shall be laws to me for a time  only a cup of wine good meister kellermasterbutler i mean  i am glad you remember the name of mine office said reinold with some of the petty resentment of a spoiled domestic who thinks that a stranger has been irregularly put in command over him  a flagon of rhenish if you love me answered the fleming for my heart is low and poor within me and i must needs drink of the best  and drink you shall said reinold if drink will give you the courage which perhaps you wanthe descended to the secret crypts of which he was the guardian and returned with a silver flagon which might contain about a quarthere is such wine said reinold as thou hast seldom tasted and was about to pour it out into a cup  nay the flagonthe flagon friend reinold i love a deep and solemn draught when the business is weighty said wilkin he seized on the flagon accordingly and drinking a preparatory mouthful paused as if to estimate the strength and flavour of the generous liquor apparently he was pleased with both for he nodded in approbation to the butler and raising the flagon to his mouth once more he slowly and gradually brought the bottom of the vessel parallel with the roof of the apartment without suffering one drop of the contents to escape him  that hath savour herr kellermaster said he while he was recovering his breath by intervals after so long a suspense of respiration but may heaven forgive you for thinking it the best i have ever tasted you little know the cellars of ghent and of ypres  and i care not for them said reinold those of gentle norman blood hold the wines of gascony and france generous light and cordial worth all the acid potations of the rhine and the neckar  all is matter of taste said the fleming but hark yeis there much of this wine in the cellar  methought but now it pleased not your dainty palate said reinold  nay nay my friend said wilkin i said it had savouri may have drunk betterbut this is right good where better may not be hadagain how much of it hast thou  the whole butt man answered the butler i have broached a fresh piece for you  good replied flammock get the quartpot of christian measure heave the cask up into this same buttery and let each soldier of this castle be served with

defend not castles on thin liquors  i must do as you will good wilkin flammock said the butler but i pray you remember all men are not alike that which will but warm your flemish hearts will put wildfire into norman brains and what may only encourage your countrymen to man the walls will make ours fly over the battlements  well you know the conditions of your own countrymen best serve out to them what wines and measure you listonly let each fleming have a solemn quart of rhenishbut what will you do for the english churls of whom there are a right many left with us  the old butler paused and rubbed his browthere will be a strange waste of liquor he said and yet i may not deny that the emergency may defend the expenditure but for the english they are as you wot a mixed breed having much of your german sullenness together with a plentiful touch of the hot blood of yonder welsh furies light wines stir them not strong heavy draughts would madden them what think you of ale an invigorating strengthening liquor that warms the heart without inflaming the brain  ale said the fleminghumhais your ale mighty sir butleris it double ale  do you doubt my skill said the butlermarch and october have witnessed me ever as they came round for thirty years deal with the best barley in shropshireyou shall judge  he filled from a large hogshead in the corner of the buttery the flagon which the fleming had just emptied and which was no sooner replenished than wilkin again drained it to the bottom  good ware he said master butler strong stinging ware the english churls will fight like devils upon itlet them be furnished with mighty ale along with their beef and brown bread and now having given you your charge master reinold it is time i should look after mine own  wilkin flammock left the buttery and with a mien and judgment alike undisturbed by the deep potations in which he had so recently indulged undisturbed also by the various rumours concerning what was passing without doors he made the round of the castle and its outworks mustered the little garrison and assigned to each their posts reserving to his own countrymen the management of the arblasts or crossbows and of the military engines which were contrived by the proud normans and were incomprehensible to the ignorant english or more properly anglosaxons of the period but which his more adroit countrymen managed with great address the jealousies entertained by both the normans and english at being placed under the temporary command of a fleming gradually yielded to the military and mechanical skill which he displayed as well as to a sense of the emergency which became greater with every moment     chapter the fourth     beside yon brigg out ower yon burn   where the water bickereth bright and sheen   shall many a falling courser spurn   and knights shall die in battle keen      prophecy of thomas the rhymer   the daughter of raymond berenger with the attendants whom we have mentioned continued to remain upon the battlements of the garde doloureuse in spite of the exhortations of the priest that she would rather await the issue of this terrible interval in the chapel and amid the rites of religion he perceived at length that she was incapable from grief and fear of attending to or understanding his advice and sitting down beside her while the huntsman and rose flammock stood by endeavoured to suggest such comfort as perhaps he scarcely felt himself  this is but a sally of your noble fathers he said and though it may seem it is made on great hazard yet who ever questioned sir raymond berengers policy of warshe is close and secret in his purposes i guess right well he had not marched out as he proposes unless he knew that the noble earl of arundel or the mighty constable of chester were close at hand  think you this assuredly good fathergo raoulgo my dearest roselook to the eastsee if you cannot descry banners or clouds of dustlistenlistenhear you no trumpets from that quarter  alas my lady said raoul the thunder of heaven could scarce be heard amid the howling of yonder welsh wolves eveline turned as he spoke and looking towards the bridge she beheld an appalling spectacle the river whose stream washes on three sides the base of the proud eminence on which the castle is situated curves away from the fortress and its corresponding village on the west and the hill sinks downward to an extensive plain so extremely level as to indicate its alluvial origin lower down at the extremity of this plain where the banks again close on the river were situated the manufacturing houses of the stout flemings which were now burning in a bright flame the bridge a high narrow combination of arches of unequal size was about half a mile distant from the castle in the very centre of the plain the river itself ran in a deep rocky channel was often unfordable and at all times difficult of passage giving considerable advantage to the defenders of the castle who had spent on other occasions many a dear drop of blood to defend the pass which raymond berengers fantastic scruples now induced him to abandon the welshmen seizing the opportunity with the avidity with which men grasp an unexpected benefit were fast crowding over the high and steep arches while new bands collecting from different points upon the farther bank increased the continued stream of warriors who passing leisurely and uninterrupted formed their line of battle on the plain opposite to the castle  at first father aldrovand viewed their motions without anxiety nay with the scornful smile of one who observes an enemy in the act of falling into the snare spread for them by superior skill raymond berenger with his little body of infantry and cavalry were drawn up on the easy hill which is betwixt the castle and the plain ascending from the former towards the fortress and it seemed clear to the dominican who had not entirely forgotten in the cloister his ancient military experience that it was the knights purpose to attack the disordered enemy when a certain number had crossed the river and the others were partly on the farther side and partly engaged in the slow and perilous manoeuvre of effecting their passage but when large bodies of the whitemantled welshmen were permitted without interruption to take such order on the plain as their habits of fighting recommended the monks countenance though he still endeavoured to speak encouragement to the terrified eveline assumed a different and an anxious expression and his acquired habits of resignation contended strenuously with his ancient military ardour be patient he said my daughter and be of good comfort thine eyes shall behold the dismay of yonder barbarous enemy let but a minute elapse and thou shalt see them scattered like dustsaint george they will surely cry thy name now or never  the monks beads passed meanwhile rapidly through his hands but many an expression of military impatience mingled itself with his orisons he could not conceive the cause why each successive throng of mountaineers led under their different banners and headed by their respective chieftains was permitted without interruption to pass the difficult defile and extend themselves in battle array on the near side of the bridge while the english or rather anglonorman cavalry remained stationary without so much as laying their lances in rest there remained as he thought but one hopeone only rational explanation of this unaccountable inactivitythis voluntary surrender of every advantage of ground when that of numbers was so tremendously on the side of the enemy father aldrovand concluded that the succours of the constable of chester and other lord marchers must be in the immediate vicinity and that the welsh were only permitted to pass the river without opposition that their retreat might be the more effectually cut off and their defeat with a deep river in their rear rendered the more signally calamitous but even while he clung to this hope the monks heart sunk within him as looking in every direction from which the expected succours might arrive he could neither see nor hear the slightest token which announced their approach in a frame of mind approaching more nearly to despair than to hope the old man continued alternately to tell his beads to gaze anxiously around and to address some words of consolation in broken phrases to the young lady until the general shout of the welsh ringing from the bank of the river to the battlements of the castle warned him in a note of exultation that the very last of the british had defiled through the pass and that their whole formidable array stood prompt for action upon the hither side of the river  this thrilling and astounding clamour to which each welshman lent his voice with all the energy of defiance thirst of battle and hope of conquest was at length answered by the blast of the norman trumpetsthe first sign of activity which had been exhibited on the part of raymond berenger but cheerily as they rang the trumpets in comparison of the shout which they answered sounded like the silver whistle of the stout boatswain amid the howling of the tempest  at the same moment when the trumpets were blown berenger gave signal to the archers to discharge their arrows and the menat arms to advance under a hailstorm of shafts javelins and stones shot darted and slung by the welsh against their steel clad assailants  the veterans of raymond on the other hand stimulated by so many victorious recollections confident in the talents of their accomplished leader and undismayed even by the desperation of their circumstances charged the mass of the welshmen with their usual determined valour it was a gallant sight to see this little body of cavalry advance to the onset their plumes floating above their helmets their lances in rest and projecting six feet in length before the breasts of their coursers their shields hanging from their necks that their left hands might have freedom to guide their horses and the whole body rushing on with an equal front and a momentum of speed which increased with every second such an onset might have startled naked men for such were the welsh in respect of the mailsheathed normans but it brought no terrors to the ancient british who had long made it their boast that they exposed their bare bosoms and white tunics to the lances and swords of the menatarms with as much confidence as if they had been born invulnerable it was not indeed in their power to withstand the weight of the first shock which breaking their ranks densely as they were arranged carried the barbed horses into the very centre of their host and wellnigh up to the fatal standard to which raymond berenger bound by his fatal vow had that day conceded so much vantageground but they yielded like the billows which give way indeed to the gallant ship but only to assail her sides and to unite in her wake with wild and horrible clamours they closed their tumultuous ranks around berenger and his devoted followers and a deadly scene of strife ensued  the best warriors of wales had on this occasion joined the standard of gwenwyn the arrows of the men of gwentland whose skill in archery almost equalled that of the normans themselves rattled on the helmets of the menatarms and the spears of the people of deheubarth renowned for the sharpness and temper of their steel heads were employed against the cuirasses not without fatal effect notwithstanding the protection which these afforded to the rider  it was in vain that the archery belonging to raymonds little band stout yeomen who for the most part held possession by military tenure exhausted their quivers on the broad mark afforded them by the welsh army it is probable that every shaft carried a welshmans life on its point yet to have afforded important relief to the cavalry now closely and inextricably engaged the slaughter ought to have been twentyfold at least meantime the welsh galled by this incessant discharge answered it by volleys from their own archers whose numbers made some amends for their inferiority and who were supported by numerous bodies of darters and slingers so that the norman archers who had more than once attempted to descend from their position to operate a diversion in favour of raymond and his devoted band were now so closely engaged in front as obliged them to abandon all thoughts of such a movement  meanwhile that chivalrous leader who from the first had hoped for no more than an honourable death laboured with all his power to render his fate signal by involving in it that of the welsh prince the author of the war he cautiously avoided the expenditure of his strength by hewing among the british but with the shock of his managed horse repelled the numbers who pressed on him and leaving the plebeians to the swords of his companions shouted his warcry and made his way towards the fatal standard of gwenwyn beside which discharging at once the duties of a skilful leader and a brave soldier the prince had stationed himself raymonds experience of the welsh disposition subject equally to the highest flood and most sudden ebb of passion gave him some hope that a successful attack upon this point followed by the death or capture of the prince and the downfall of his standard might even yet strike such a panic as should change the fortunes of the day otherwise so nearly desperate the veteran therefore animated his comrades to the charge by voice and example and in spite of all opposition forced his way gradually onward but gwenwyn in person surrounded by his best and noblest champions offered a defence as obstinate as the assault was intrepid in vain they were borne to the earth by the barbed horses or hewed down by the invulnerable riders wounded and overthrown the britons continued their resistance clung round the legs of the norman steeds and cumbered their advance while their brethren thrusting with pikes proved every joint and crevice of the plate and mail or grappling with the menatarms strove to pull them from their horses by main force or beat them down with their bills and welsh hooks and wo betide those who were by these various means dismounted for the long sharp knives worn by the welsh soon pierced them with a hundred wounds and were then only merciful when the first inflicted was deadly  the combat was at this point and had raged for more than half an hour when berenger having forced his horse within two spears length of the british standard he and gwenwyn were so near to each other as to exchange tokens of mutual defiance  turn thee wolf of wales said berenger and abide if thou darest one blow of a good knights sword raymond berenger spits at thee and thy banner  false norman churl said gwenwyn swinging around his head a mace of prodigious weight and already clottered with blood thy iron headpiece shall ill protect thy lying tongue with which i will this day feed the ravens  raymond made no farther answer but pushed his horse towards the prince who advanced to meet him with equal readiness but ere they came within reach of each others weapons a welsh champion devoted like the romans who opposed the elephants of pyrrhus finding that the armour of raymonds horse resisted the repeated thrusts of his spear threw himself under the animal and stabbed him in the belly with his long knife the noble horse reared and fell crushing with his weight the briton who had wounded him the helmet of the rider burst its clasps in the fall and rolled away from his head giving to view his noble features and gray hairs he made more than one effort to extricate himself from the fallen horse but ere he could succeed received his deathwound from the hand of gwenwyn who hesitated not to strike him down with his mace while in the act of extricating himself  during the whole of this bloody day dennis morolts horse had kept pace for pace and his arm blow for blow with his masters it seemed as if two different bodies had been moving under one act of volition he husbanded his strength or put it forth exactly as he observed his knight did and was close by his side when he made the last deadly effort at that fatal moment when raymond berenger rushed on the chief the brave squire forced his way up to the standard and grasping it firmly struggled for possession of it with a gigantic briton to whose care it had been confided and who now exerted his utmost strength to defend it but even while engaged in this mortal struggle the eye of morolt scarcely left his master and when he saw him fall his own force seemed by sympathy to abandon him and the british champion had no longer any trouble in laying him prostrate among the slain  the victory of the british was now complete upon the fall of their leader the followers of raymond berenger would willingly have fled or surrendered but the first was impossible so closely had they been enveloped and in the cruel wars maintained by the welsh upon their frontiers quarter to the vanquished was out of question a few of the menatarms were lucky enough to disentangle themselves from the tumult and not even attempting to enter the castle fled in various directions to carry their own fears among the inhabitants of the marches by announcing the loss of the battle and the fate of the farrenowned raymond berenger  the archers of the fallen leader as they had never been so deeply involved in the combat which had been chiefly maintained by the cavalry became now in their turn the sole object of the enemys attack but when they saw the multitude come roaring towards them like a sea with all its waves they abandoned the bank which they had hitherto bravely defended and began a regular retreat to the castle in the best order which they could as the only remaining means of securing their lives a few of their lightfooted enemies attempted to intercept them during the execution of this prudent manoeuvre by outstripping them in their march and throwing themselves into the hollow way which led to the castle to oppose their retreat but the coolness of the english archers accustomed to extremities of every kind supported them on the present occasion while a part of them armed with glaives and bills dislodged the welsh from the hollow way the others facing in the opposite direction and parted into divisions which alternately halted and retreated maintained such a countenance as to check pursuit and exchange a severe discharge of missiles with the welsh by which both parties were considerable sufferers  at length having left more than twothirds of their brave companions behind them the yeomanry attained the point which being commanded by arrows and engines from the battlements might be considered as that of comparative safety a volley of large stones and squareheaded bolts of great size and thickness effectually stopped the farther progress of the pursuit and those who had led it drew back their desultory forces to the plain where with shouts of jubilee and exultation their countrymen were employed in securing the plunder of the field while some impelled by hatred and revenge mangled and mutilated the limbs of the dead normans in a manner unworthy of their national cause and their own courage the fearful yells with which this dreadful work was consummated while it struck horror into the minds of the slender garrison of the garde doloureuse inspired them at the same time with the resolution rather to defend the fortress to the last extremity than to submit to the mercy of so vengeful an enemy footnote this is by no means exaggerated in the text a very honourable testimony was given to their valour by king henry ii in a letter to the greek emperor emanuel commenus this prince having desired that an account might be sent him of all that was remarkable in the island of great britain henry in answer to that request was pleased to take notice among other particulars of the extraordinary courage and fierceness of the welsh who were not afraid to fight unarmed with enemies armed at all points valiantly shedding their blood in the cause of their country and purchasing glory at the expense of their lives     chapter the fifth     that baron he to his castle fled   to barnard castle then fled he   the uttermost walls were eathe to win   the earls have won them speedilie   the uttermost walls were stone and brick   but though they won them soon anon   long ere they won the inmost walls   for they were hewn in rock of stone      percys relics of ancient poetry   the unhappy fate of the battle was soon evident to the anxious spectators upon the watchtowers of the garde doloureuse which name the castle that day too well deserved with difficulty the confessor mastered his own emotions to control those of the females on whom he attended and who were now joined in their lamentation by many otherswomen children and infirm old men the relatives of those whom they saw engaged in this unavailing contest these helpless beings had been admitted to the castle for securitys sake and they had now thronged to the battlements from which father aldrovand found difficulty in making them descend aware that the sight of them on the towers that should have appeared lined with armed men would be an additional encouragement to the exertions of the assailants he urged the lady eveline to set an example to this group of helpless yet intractable mourners  preserving at least endeavouring to preserve even in the extremity of grief that composure which the manners of the times enjoinedfor chivalry had its stoicism as well as philosophy eveline replied in a voice which she would fain have rendered firm and which was tremulous in her despiteyes father you say wellhere is no longer aught left for maidens to look upon warlike meed and honoured deed sunk when yonder white plume touched the bloody groundcome maidens there is no longer aught left us to seeto mass to massthe tourney is over  there was wildness in her tone and when she rose with the air of one who would lead out a procession she staggered and would have fallen but for the support of the confessor hastily wrapping her head in her mantle as if ashamed of the agony of grief which she could not restrain and of which her sobs and the low moaning sounds that issued from under the folds enveloping her face declared the excess she suffered father aldrovand to conduct her whither he would  our gold he said has changed to brass our silver to dross our wisdom to follyit is his will who confounds the counsels of the wise and shortens the arm of the mighty to the chapelto the chapel lady eveline and instead of vain repining let us pray to god and the saints to turn away their displeasure and to save the feeble remnant from the jaws of the devouring wolf  thus speaking he half led half supported eveline who was at the moment almost incapable of thought and action to the castle chapel where sinking before the altar she assumed the attitude at least of devotion though her thoughts despite the pious words which her tongue faltered out mechanically were upon the field of battle beside the body of her slaughtered parent the rest of the mourners imitated their young lady in her devotional posture and in the absence of her thoughts the consciousness that so many of the garrison had been cut off in raymonds incautious sally added to their sorrows the sense of personal insecurity which was exaggerated by the cruelties which were too often exercised by the enemy who in the heat of victory were accustomed to spare neither sex nor age  the monk however assumed among them the tone of authority which his character warranted rebuked their wailing and ineffectual complaints and having as he thought brought them to such a state of mind as better became their condition he left them to their private devotions to indulge his own anxious curiosity by inquiring into the defences of the castle upon the outward walls he found wilkin flammock who having done the office of a good and skilful captain in the mode of managing his artillery and beating back as we have already seen the advanced guard of the enemy was now with his own hand measuring out to his little garrison no stinted allowance of wine  have a care good wilkin said the father that thou dost not exceed in this matter wine is thou knowest like fire and water an excellent servant but a very bad master  it will be long ere it overflow the deep and solid skulls of my countrymen said wilkin flammock our flemish courage is like our flanders horsesthe one needs the spur and the other must have a taste of the winepot but credit me father they are of an enduring generation and will not shrink in the washingbut indeed if i were to give the knaves a cup more than enough it were not altogether amiss since they are like to have a platter the less  how do you mean cried the monk starting i trust in the saints the provisions have been cared for  not so well as in your convent good father replied wilkin with the same immoveable stolidity of countenance we had kept as you know too jolly a christmas to have a very fat easter yon welsh hounds who helped to eat up our victuals are now like to get into our hold for the lack of them  thou talkest mere folly answered the monk orders were last evening given by our lord whose soul god assoilzie to fetch in the necessary supplies from the country around  ay but the welsh were too sharp set to permit us to do that at our ease this morning which should have been done weeks and months since our lord deceased if deceased he be was one of those who trusted to the edge of the sword and even so hath come of it commend me to a crossbow and a wellvictualled castle if i must needs fight at allyou look pale my good father a cup of wine will revive you  the monk motioned away from him the untasted cup which wilkin pressed him to with clownish civility we have now indeed he said no refuge save in prayer  most true good father again replied the impassible fleming pray therefore as much as you will i will content myself with fasting which will come whether i will or noat this moment a horn was heard before the gatelook to the portcullis and the gate ye knaveswhat news neil hansen  a messenger from the welsh tarries at the millhill just within shot of the crossbows he has a white flag and demands admittance  admit him not upon thy life till we be prepared for him said wilkin bend the bonny mangonel upon the place and shoot him if he dare to stir from the spot where he stands till we get all prepared to receive him said flammock in his native language and neil thou houndsfoot bestir thyselflet every pike lance and pole in the castle be ranged along the battlements and pointed through the shotholescut up some tapestry into the shape of banners and show them from the highest towersbe ready when i give a signal to strike naker footnote nakerdrum  and blow trumpets if we have any if not some cowhornsanything for a noise and hark ye neil hansen do you and four or five of your fellows go to the armoury and slip on coatsofmail our netherlandish corslets do not appal them so much then let the welsh thief be blindfolded and brought in amongst usdo you hold up your heads and keep silenceleave me to deal with himonly have a care there be no english among us  the monk who in his travels had acquired some slight knowledge of the flemish language had wellnigh started when he heard the last article in wilkins instructions to his countryman but commanded himself although a little surprised both at this suspicious circumstance and at the readiness and dexterity with which the roughhewn fleming seemed to adapt his preparations to the rules of war and of sound policy  wilkin on his part was not very certain whether the monk had not heard and understood more of what he said to his countryman than what he had intended as if to lull asleep any suspicion which father aldrovand might entertain he repeated to him in english most of the directions which he had given adding well good father what think you of it  excellent well answered the father and done as if you had practised war from the cradle instead of weaving broadcloth  nay spare not your jibes father answered wilkini know full well that you english think that flemings have nought in their brainpan but sodden beef and cabbage yet you see there goes wisdom to weaving of webs  right master wilkin flammock answered the father but good fleming wilt thou tell me what answer thou wilt make to the welsh princes summons  reverend father first tell me what the summons will be replied the fleming  to surrender this castle upon the instant answered the monk what will be your reply  my answer will be nayunless upon good composition  how sir fleming dare you mention composition and the castle of the garde doloureuse in one sentence said the monk  not if i may do better answered the fleming but would your reverence have me dally until the question amongst the garrison be whether a plump priest or a fat fleming will be the better flesh to furnish their shambles  pshaw replied father aldrovand thou canst not mean such folly relief must arrive within twentyfour hours at farthest raymond berenger expected it for certain within such a space  raymond berenger has been deceived this morning in more matters than one answered the fleming  hark thee flanderkin answered the monk whose retreat from the world had not altogether quenched his military habits and propensities i counsel thee to deal uprightly in this matter as thou dost regard thine own life for here are as many english left alive notwithstanding the slaughter of today as may well suffice to fling the flemish bullfrogs into the castleditch should they have cause to think thou meanest falsely in the keeping of this castle and the defence of the lady eveline  let not your reverence be moved with unnecessary and idle fears replied wilkin flammocki am castellane in this house by command of its lord and what i hold for the advantage of mine service that will i do  but i said the angry monk i am the servant of the popethe chaplain of this castle with power to bind and unloose i fear me thou art no true christian wilkin flammock but dost lean to the heresy of the mountaineers thou hast refused to take the blessed crossthou hast breakfasted and drunk both ale and wine ere thou hast heard mass thou art not to be trusted man and i will not trust theei demand to be present at the conference betwixt thee and the welshman  it may not be good father said wilkin with the same smiling heavy countenance which he maintained on all occasions of life however urgent it is true as thou sayest good father that i have mine own reasons for not marching quite so far as the gates of jericho at present and lucky i have such reasons since i had not else been here to defend the gate of the garde doloureuse it is also true that i may have been sometimes obliged to visit my mills earlier than the chaplain was called by his zeal to the altar and that my stomach brooks not working ere i break my fast but for this father i have paid a mulet even to your worshipful reverence and methinks since you are pleased to remember the confession so exactly you should not forget the penance and the absolution  the monk in alluding to the secrets of the confessional had gone a step beyond what the rules of his order and of the church permitted he was baffled by the flemings reply and finding him unmoved by the charge of heresy he could only answer in some confusion you refuse then to admit me to the conference with the welshman  reverend father said wilkin it altogether respecteth secular matters if aught of religious tenor should intervene you shall be summoned without delay  i will be there in spite of thee thou flemish ox muttered the monk to himself but in a tone not to be heard by the bystanders and so speaking he left the battlements  wilkin flammock a few minutes afterwards having first seen that all was arranged on the battlements so as to give an imposing idea of a strength which did not exist descended to a small guardroom betwixt the outer and inner gate where he was attended by halfadozen of his own people disguised in the norman armour which they had found in the armoury of the castle their strong tall and bulky forms and motionless postures causing them to look rather like trophies of some past age than living and existing soldiers surrounded by these huge and inanimate figures in a little vaulted room which almost excluded daylight flammock received the welsh envoy who was led in blindfolded betwixt two flemings yet not so carefully watched but that they permitted him to have a glimpse of the preparations on the battlements which had in fact been made chiefly for the purpose of imposing on him for the same purpose an occasional clatter of arms was made without voices were heard as if officers were going their rounds and other sounds of active preparation seemed to announce that a numerous and regular garrison was preparing to receive an attack  when the bandage was removed from jorworths eyesfor the same individual who had formerly brought gwenwyns offer of alliance now bare his summons of surrenderhe looked haughtily around him and demanded to whom he was to deliver the commands of his master the gwenwyn son of cyvelioc prince of powys  his highness answered flammock with his usual smiling indifference of manner must be contented to treat with wilkin flammock of the fullingmills deputed governor of the garde doloureuse  thou deputed governor exclaimed jorworth thoua lowcountry weaverit is impossible low as they are the english crogan footnote this is a somewhat contumelious epithet applied by the welsh to the english cannot have sunk to a point so low as to be commanded by theethese men seem english to them i will deliver my message  you may if you will replied wilkin but if they return you any answer save by signs you shall call me schelm  is this true said the welsh envoy looking towards the menat arms as they seemed by whom flammock was attended are you really come to this pass i thought that the mere having been born on british earth though the children of spoilers and invaders had inspired you with too much pride to brook the yoke of a base mechanic or if you are not courageous should you not be cautiouswell speaks the proverb wo to him that will trust a stranger still mutestill silentanswer me by word or signdo you really call and acknowledge him as your leader  the men in armour with one accord nodded their casques in reply to jorworths question and then remained motionless as before  the welshman with the acute genius of his country suspected there was something in this which he could not entirely comprehend but preparing himself to be upon his guard he proceeded as follows be it as it may i care not who hears the message of my sovereign since it brings pardon and mercy to the inhabitants of this castell an carrig footnote castle of the craig which you have called the garde doloureuse to cover the usurpation of the territory by the change of the name upon surrender of the same to the prince of powys with its dependencies and with the arms which it contains and with the maiden eveline berenger all within the castle shall depart unmolested and have safeconduct wheresoever they will to go beyond the marches of the cymry  and how if we obey not this summons said the imperturbable wilkin flammock  then shall your portion be with raymond berenger your late leader replied jorworth his eyes while he was speaking glancing with the vindictive ferocity which dictated his answer so many strangers as be here amongst ye so many bodies to the ravens so many heads to the gibbetit is long since the kites have had such a banquet of lurdane flemings and false saxons  friend jorworth said wilkin if such be thy only message bear mine answer back to thy master that wise men trust not to the words of others that safety which they can secure by their own deeds we have walls high and strong enough deep moats and plenty of munition both longbow and arblast we will keep the castle trusting the castle will keep us till god shall send us succour  do not peril your lives on such an issue said the welsh emissary changing his language to the flemish which from occasional communication with those of that nation in pembrokeshire he spoke fluently and which he now adopted as if to conceal the purport of his discourse from the supposed english in the apartment hark thee hither he proceeded good fleming knowest thou not that he in whom is your trust the constable de lacy hath bound himself by his vow to engage in no quarrel till he crosses the sea and cannot come to your aid without perjury he and the other lords marchers have drawn their forces far northward to join the host of crusaders what will it avail you to put us to the toil and trouble of a long siege when you can hope no rescue  and what will it avail me more said wilkin answering in his native language and looking at the welshman fixedly yet with a countenance from which all expression seemed studiously banished and which exhibited upon features otherwise tolerable a remarkable compound of dulness and simplicity what will it avail me whether your trouble be great or small  come friend flammock said the welshman frame not thyself more unapprehensive than nature hath formed thee the glen is dark but a sunbeam can light the side of it thy utmost efforts cannot prevent the fall of this castle but thou mayst hasten it and the doing so shall avail thee much thus speaking he drew close up to wilkin and sunk his voice to an insinuating whisper as he said never did the withdrawing of a bar or the raising of a portcullis bring such vantage to fleming as they may to thee if thou wilt  i only know said wilkin that the drawing the one and the dropping the other have cost me my whole worldly subsistence  fleming it shall be compensated to thee with an overflowing measure the liberality of gwenwyn is as the summer rain  my whole mills and buildings have been this morning burnt to the earth  thou shalt have a thousand marks of silver man in the place of thy goods said the welshman but the fleming continued without seeming to hear him to number up his losses  my lands are forayed twenty kine driven off and  threescore shall replace them interrupted jorworth chosen from the most brightskinned of the spoil  but my daughterbut the lady evelinesaid the fleming with some slight change in his monotonous voice which seemed to express doubt and perplexityyou are cruel conquerors and  to those who resist us we are fearful said jorworth but not to such as shall deserve clemency by surrender gwenwyn will forget the contumelies of raymond and raise his daughter to high honour among the daughters of the cymry for thine own child form but a wish for her advantage and it shall be fulfilled to the uttermost now fleming we understand each other  i understand thee at least said flammock  and i thee i trust said jorworth bending his keen wild blue eye on the stolid and unexpressive face of the netherlander like an eager student who seeks to discover some hidden and mysterious meaning in a passage of a classic author the direct import of which seems trite and trivial  you believe that you understand me said wilkin but here lies the difficultywhich of us shall trust the other  darest thou ask answered jorworth is it for thee or such as thee to express doubt of the purposes of the prince of powys  i know them not good jorworth but through thee and well i wot thou art not one who will let thy traffic miscarry for want of aid from the breath of thy mouth  as i am a christian man said jorworth hurrying asseveration on asseverationby the soul of my fatherby the faith of my motherby the black rood of  stop good jorworththou heapest thine oaths too thickly on each other for me to value them to the right estimate said flammock that which is so lightly pledged is sometimes not thought worth redeeming some part of the promised guerdon in hand the whilst were worth an hundred oaths  thou suspicious churl darest thou doubt my word  noby no means answered wilkinnevertheless i will believe thy deed more readily  to the point fleming said jorworthwhat wouldst thou have of me  let me have some present sight of the money thou didst promise and i will think of the rest of thy proposal  base silverbroker answered jorworth thinkest thou the prince of powys has as many moneybags as the merchants of thy land of sale and barter he gathers treasures by his conquests as the waterspout sucks up water by its strength but it is to disperse them among his followers as the cloudy column restores its contents to earth and ocean the silver that i promise thee has yet to be gathered out of the saxon chestsnay the casket of berenger himself must be ransacked to make up the tale  methinks i could do that myself having full power in the castle and so save you a labour said the fleming  true answered jorworth but it would be at the expense of a cord and a noose whether the welsh took the place or the normans relieved itthe one would expect their booty entirethe other their countrymans treasures to be delivered undiminished  i may not gainsay that said the fleming well say i were content to trust you thus far why not return my cattle which are in your own hands and at your disposal if you do not pleasure me in something beforehand what can i expect of you afterwards  i would pleasure you in a greater matter answered the equally suspicious welshman but what would it avail thee to have thy cattle within the fortress they can be better cared for on the plain beneath  in faith replied the fleming thou sayst truththey will be but a trouble to us here where we have so many already provided for the use of the garrisonand yet when i consider it more closely we have enough of forage to maintain all we have and more now my cattle are of a peculiar stock brought from the rich pastures of flanders and i desire to have them restored ere your axes and welsh hooks be busy with their hides  you shall have them this night hide and horn said jorworth it is but a small earnest of a great boon  thanks to your munificence said the fleming i am a simple minded man and bound my wishes to the recovery of my own property  thou wilt be ready then to deliver the castle said jorworth  of that we will talk farther tomorrow said wilkin flammock if these english and normans should suspect such a purpose we should have wild workthey must be fully dispersed ere i can hold farther communication on the subject meanwhile i pray thee depart suddenly and as if offended with the tenor of our discourse  yet would i fain know something more fixed and absolute said jorworth  impossibleimpossible said the fleming see you not yonder tall fellow begins already to handle his daggergo hence in haste and angrilyand forget not the cattle  i will not forget them said jorworth but if thou keep not faith with us  so speaking he left the apartment with a gesture of menace partly really directed to wilkin himself partly assumed in consequence of his advice flammock replied in english as if that all around might understand what he said  do thy worst sir welshman i am a true man i defy the proposals of rendition and will hold out this castle to thy shame and thy mastersherelet him be blindfolded once more and returned in safety to his attendants without the next welshman who appears before the gate of the garde doloureuse shall be more sharply received  the welshman was blindfolded and withdrawn when as wilkin flammock himself left the guardroom one of the seeming menat arms who had been present at this interview said in his ear in english thou art a false traitor flammock and shalt die a traitors death  startled at this the fleming would have questioned the man farther but he had disappeared so soon as the words were uttered flammock was disconcerted by this circumstance which showed him that his interview with jorworth had been observed and its purpose known or conjectured by some one who was a stranger to his confidence and might thwart his intentions and he quickly after learned that this was the case     chapter the sixth     blessed mary mother dear   to a maiden bend thine ear   virgin undefiled to thee   a wretched virgin bends the knee     hymn to the virgin   the daughter of the slaughtered raymond had descended from the elevated station whence she had beheld the field of battle in the agony of grief natural to a child whose eyes have beheld the death of an honoured and beloved father but her station and the principles of chivalry in which she had been trained up did not permit any prolonged or needless indulgence of inactive sorrow in raising the young and beautiful of the female sex to the rank of princesses or rather goddesses the spirit of that singular system exacted from them in requital a tone of character and a line of conduct superior and something contradictory to that of natural or merely human feeling its heroines frequently resembled portraits shown by an artificial lightstrong and luminous and which placed in high relief the objects on which it was turned but having still something of adventitious splendour which compared with that of the natural day seemed glaring and exaggerated  it was not permitted to the orphan of the garde doloureuse the daughter of a line of heroes whose stem was to be found in the race of thor balder odin and other deified warriors of the north whose beauty was the theme of a hundred minstrels and her eyes the leading star of half the chivalry of the warlike marches of wales to mourn her sire with the ineffectual tears of a village maiden young as she was and horrible as was the incident which she had but that instant witnessed it was not altogether so appalling to her as to a maiden whose eye had not been accustomed to the rough and often fatal sports of chivalry and whose residence had not been among scenes and men where war and death had been the unceasing theme of every tongue whose imagination had not been familiarized with wild and bloody events or finally who had not been trained up to consider an honourable death under shield as that of a field of battle was termed as a more desirable termination to the life of a warrior than that lingering and unhonoured fate which comes slowly on to conclude the listless and helpless inactivity of prolonged old age eveline while she wept for her father felt her bosom glow when she recollected that he died in the blaze of his fame and amidst heaps of his slaughtered enemies and when she thought of the exigencies of her own situation it was with the determination to defend her own liberty and to avenge her fathers death by every means which heaven had left within her power  the aids of religion were not forgotten and according to the custom of the times and the doctrines of the roman church she endeavoured to propitiate the favour of heaven by vows as well as prayers in a small crypt or oratory adjoining to the chapel was hung over an altarpiece on which a lamp constantly burned a small picture of the virgin mary revered as a household and peculiar deity by the family of berenger one of whose ancestors had brought it from the holy land whither he had gone upon pilgrimage it was of the period of the lower empire a grecian painting not unlike those which in catholic countries are often imputed to the evangelist luke the crypt in which it was placed was accounted a shrine of uncommon sanctitynay supposed to have displayed miraculous powers and eveline by the daily garland of flowers which she offered before the painting and by the constant prayers with which they were accompanied had constituted herself the peculiar votaress of our lady of the garde doloureuse for so the picture was named  now apart from others alone and in secrecy sinking in the extremity of her sorrow before the shrine of her patroness she besought the protection of kindred purity for the defence of her freedom and honour and invoked vengeance on the wild and treacherous chieftain who had slain her father and was now beleaguering her place of strength not only did she vow a large donative in lands to the shrine of the protectress whose aid she implored but the oath passed her lips even though they faltered and though something within her remonstrated against the vow that whatsoever favoured knight our lady of the garde doloureuse might employ for her rescue should obtain from her in guerdon whatever boon she might honourably grant were it that of her virgin hand at the holy altar taught as she was to believe by the assurances of many a knight that such a surrender was the highest boon which heaven could bestow she felt as discharging a debt of gratitude when she placed herself entirely at the disposal of the pure and blessed patroness in whose aid she confided perhaps there lurked in this devotion some earthly hope of which she was herself scarce conscious and which reconciled her to the indefinite sacrifice thus freely offered the virgin this flattering hope might insinuate kindest and most benevolent of patronesses will use compassionately the power resigned to her and he will be the favoured champion of maria upon whom her votaress would most willingly confer favour  but if there was such a hope as something selfish will often mingle with our noblest and purest emotions it arose unconscious of eveline herself who in the full assurance of implicit faith and fixing on the representative of her adoration eyes in which the most earnest supplication the most humble confidence struggled with unbidden tears was perhaps more beautiful than when young as she was she was selected to bestow the prize of chivalry in the lists of chester it was no wonder that in such a moment of high excitation when prostrated in devotion before a being of whose power to protect her and to make her protection assured by a visible sign she doubted nothing the lady eveline conceived she saw with her own eyes the acceptance of her vow as she gazed on the picture with an overstrained eye and an imagination heated with enthusiasm the expression seemed to alter from the hard outline fashioned by the greek painter the eyes appeared to become animated and to return with looks of compassion the suppliant entreaties of the votaress and the mouth visibly arranged itself into a smile of inexpressible sweetness it even seemed to her that the head made a gentle inclination  overpowered by supernatural awe at appearances of which her faith permitted her not to question the reality the lady eveline folded her arms on her bosom and prostrated her forehead on the pavement as the posture most fitting to listen to divine communication  but her vision went not so far there was neither sound nor voice and when after stealing her eyes all around the crypt in which she knelt she again raised them to the figure of our lady the features seemed to be in the form in which the limner had sketched them saving that to evelines imagination they still retained an august and yet gracious expression which she had not before remarked upon the countenance with awful reverence almost amounting to fear yet comforted and even elated with the visitation she had witnessed the maiden repeated again and again the orisons which she thought most grateful to the ear of her benefactress and rising at length retired backwards as from the presence of a sovereign until she attained the outer chapel  here one or two females still knelt before the saints which the walls and niches presented for adoration but the rest of the terrified suppliants too anxious to prolong their devotions had dispersed through the castle to learn tidings of their friends and to obtain some refreshment or at least some place of repose for themselves and their families  bowing her head and muttering an ave to each saint as she passed his image for impending danger makes men observant of the rites of devotion the lady eveline had almost reached the door of the chapel when a manatarms as he seemed entered hastily and with a louder voice than suited the holy place unless when need was most urgent demanded the lady eveline impressed with the feelings of veneration which the late scene had produced she was about to rebuke his military rudeness when he spoke again and in anxious haste daughter we are betrayed and though the form and the coatofmail which covered it were those of a soldier the voice was that of father aldrovand who eager and anxious at the same time disengaged himself from the mail hood and showed his countenance  father she said what means this have you forgotten the confidence in heaven which you are wont to recommend that you bear other arms than your order assigns to you  it may come to that ere long said father aldrovand for i was a soldier ere i was a monk but now i have donnd this harness to discover treachery not to resist force ah my beloved daughter we are dreadfully besetfoemen withouttraitors withinthe false fleming wilkin flammock is treating for the surrender of the castle  who dares say so said a veiled female who had been kneeling unnoticed in a sequestered corner of the chapel but who now started up and came boldly betwixt lady eveline and the monk  go hence thou saucy minion said the monk surprised at this bold interruption this concerns not thee  but it doth concern me said the damsel throwing back her veil and discovering the juvenile countenance of rose the daughter of wilkin flammock her eyes sparkling and her cheeks blushing with anger the vehemence of which made a singular contrast with the very fair complexion and almost infantine features of the speaker whose whole form and figure was that of a girl who has scarce emerged from childhood and indeed whose general manners were as gentle and bashful as they now seemed bold impassioned and undaunteddoth it not concern me she said that my fathers honest name should be tainted with treason doth it not concern the stream when the fountain is troubled it doth concern me and i will know the author of the calumny  damsel said eveline restrain thy useless passion the good father though he cannot intentionally calumniate thy father speaks it may be from false report  as i am an unworthy priest said the father i speak from the report of my own ears upon the oath of my order myself heard this wilkin flammock chaffering with the welshman for the surrender of the garde doloureuse by help of this hauberk and mail hood i gained admittance to a conference where he thought there were no english ears they spoke flemish too but i knew the jargon of old  the flemish said the angry maiden whose headstrong passion led her to speak first in answer to the last insult offered is no jargon like your piebald english half norman half saxon but a noble gothic tongue spoken by the brave warriors who fought against the roman kaisars when britain bent the neck to themand as for this he has said of wilkin flammock she continued collecting her ideas into more order as she went on believe it not my dearest lady but as you value the honour of your own noble father confide as in the evangelists in the honesty of mine this she spoke with an imploring tone of voice mingled with sobs as if her heart had been breaking  eveline endeavoured to soothe her attendant rose she said in this evil time suspicions will light on the best men and misunderstandings will arise among the best friendslet us hear the good father state what he hath to charge upon your parent fear not but that wilkin shall be heard in his defence thou wert wont to be quiet and reasonable  i am neither quiet nor reasonable on this matter said rose with redoubled indignation and it is ill of you lady to listen to the falsehoods of that reverend mummer who is neither true priest nor true soldier but i will fetch one who shall confront him either in casque or cowl so saying she went hastily out of the chapel while the monk after some pedantic circumlocution acquainted the lady eveline with what he had overheard betwixt jorworth and wilkin and proposed to her to draw together the few english who were in the castle and take possession of the innermost square tower a keep which as usual in gothic fortresses of the norman period was situated so as to make considerable defence even after the exterior works of the castle which it commanded were in the hand of the enemy  father said eveline still confident in the vision she had lately witnessed this were good counsel in extremity but otherwise it were to create the very evil we fear by seating our garrison at odds amongst themselves i have a strong and not unwarranted confidence good father in our blessed lady of the garde doloureuse that we shall attain at once vengeance on our barbarous enemies and escape from our present jeopardy and i call you to witness the vow i have made that to him whom our lady should employ to work us succour i will refuse nothing were it my fathers inheritance or the hand of his daughter  ave maria ave regina coeli said the priest on a rock more sure you could not have founded your trustbut daughter he continued after the proper ejaculation had been made have you never heard even by a hint that there was a treaty for your hand betwixt our much honoured lord of whom we are cruelly bereft may god assoilzie his soul and the great house of lacy  something i may have heard said eveline dropping her eyes while a slight tinge suffused her cheek but i refer me to the disposal of our lady of succour and consolation  as she spoke rose entered the chapel with the same vivacity she had shown in leaving it leading by the hand her father whose sluggish though firm step vacant countenance and heavy demeanour formed the strongest contrast to the rapidity of her motions and the anxious animation of her address her task of dragging him forward might have reminded the spectator of some of those ancient monuments on which a small cherub singularly inadequate to the task is often represented as hoisting upward towards the empyrean the fleshy bulk of some ponderous tenant of the tomb whose disproportioned weight bids fair to render ineffectual the benevolent and spirited exertions of its fluttering guide and assistant  roschenmy childwhat grieves thee said the netherlander as he yielded to his daughters violence with a smile which being on the countenance of a father had more of expression and feeling than those which seemed to have made their constant dwelling upon his lips  here stands my father said the impatient maiden impeach him with treason who can or dare there stands wilkin flammock son of dieterick the cramer of antwerplet those accuse him to his face who slandered him behind his back  speak father aldrovand said the lady eveline we are young in our lordship and alas the duty hath descended upon us in an evil hour yet we will so may god and our lady help us hear and judge of your accusation to the utmost of our power  this wilkin flammock said the monk however bold he hath made himself in villany dares not deny that i heard him with my own ears treat for the surrender of the castle  strike him father said the indignant rosestrike the disguised mummer the steel hauberk may be struck though not the monks frockstrike him or tell him that he lies foully  peace roschen thou art mad said her father angrily the monk hath more truth than sense about him and i would his ears had been farther off when he thrust them into what concerned him not  roses countenance fell when she heard her father bluntly avow the treasonable communication of which she had thought him incapable she dropt the hand by which she had dragged him into the chapel and stared on the lady eveline with eyes which seemed starting from their sockets and a countenance from which the blood with which it was so lately highly coloured had retreated to garrison the heart  eveline looked upon the culprit with a countenance in which sweetness and dignity were mingled with sorrow wilkin she said i could not have believed this what on the very day of thy confiding benefactors death canst thou have been tampering with his murderers to deliver up the castle and betray thy trustbut i will not upbraid theei deprive thee of the trust reposed in so unworthy a person and appoint thee to be kept in ward in the western tower till god send us relief when it may be thy daughters merits shall atone for thy offences and save farther punishmentsee that our commands be presently obeyed  yesyesyes exclaimed rose hurrying one word on the other as fast and vehemently as she could articulatelet us golet us go to the darkest dungeondarkness befits us better than light  the monk on the other hand perceiving that the fleming made no motion to obey the mandate of arrest came forward in a manner more suiting his ancient profession and present disguise than his spiritual character and with the words i attach thee wilkin flammock of acknowledged treason to your liege lady would have laid hand upon him had not the fleming stepped back and warned him off with a menacing and determined gesture while he saidye are madall of you english are mad when the moon is full and my silly girl hath caught the maladylady your honoured father gave me a charge which i propose to execute to the best for all parties and you cannot being a minor deprive me of it at your idle pleasurefather aldrovand a monk makes no lawful arrestsdaughter roschen hold your peace and dry your eyesyou are a fool  i am i am said rose drying her eyes and regaining her elasticity of manneri am indeed a fool and worse than a fool for a moment to doubt my fathers probityconfide in him dearest lady he is wise though he is grave and kind though he is plain and homely in his speech should he prove false he will fare the worse for i will plunge myself from the pinnacle of the warders tower to the bottom of the moat and he shall lose his own daughter for betraying his masters  this is all frenzy said the monkwho trusts avowed traitors here normans english to the rescue of your liege ladybows and billsbows and bills  you may spare your throat for your next homily good father said the netherlander or call in good flemish since you understand it for to no other language will those within hearing reply  he then approached the lady eveline with a real or affected air of clumsy kindness and something as nearly approaching to courtesy as his manners and features could assume he bade her goodnight and assuring her that he would act for the best left the chapel the monk was about to break forth into revilings but eveline with more prudence checked his zeal  i cannot she said but hope that this mans intentions are honest  now gods blessing on you lady for that very word said rose eagerly interrupting her and kissing her hand  but if unhappily they are doubtful continued eveline it is not by reproach that we can bring him to a better purpose good father give an eye to the preparations for resistance and see nought omitted that our means furnish for the defence of the castle  fear nothing my dearest daughter said aldrovand there are still some english hearts amongst us and we will rather kill and eat the flemings themselves than surrender the castle  that were food as dangerous to come by as bears venison father answered rose bitterly still on fire with the idea that the monk treated her nation with suspicion and contumely  on these terms they separatedthe women to indulge their fears and sorrows in private grief or alleviate them by private devotion the monk to try to discover what were the real purposes of wilkin flammock and to counteract them if possible should they seem to indicate treachery his eye however though sharpened by strong suspicion saw nothing to strengthen his fears excepting that the fleming had with considerable military skill placed the principal posts of the castle in the charge of his own countrymen which must make any attempt to dispossess him of his present authority both difficult and dangerous the monk at length retired summoned by the duties of the evening service and with the determination to be stirring with the light the next morning     chapter the seventh     oh sadly shines the morning sun   on leaguerd castle wall   when bastion tower and battlement   seemed nodding to their fall       old ballad   true to his resolution and telling his beads as he went that he might lose no time father aldrovand began his rounds in the castle so soon as daylight had touched the top of the eastern horizon a natural instinct led him first to those stalls which had the fortress been properly victualled for a siege ought to have been tenanted by cattle and great was his delight to see more than a score of fat kine and bullocks in the place which had last night been empty one of them had already been carried to the shambles and a fleming or two who played butchers on the occasion were dividing the carcass for the cooks use the good father had wellnigh cried out a miracle but not to be too precipitate he limited his transport to a private exclamation in honour of our lady of the garde doloureuse  who talks of lack of provenderwho speaks of surrender now he said here is enough to maintain us till hugo de lacy arrives were he to sail back from cyprus to our relief i did purpose to have fasted this morning as well to save victuals as on a religious score but the blessings of the saints must not be slightedsir cook let me have half a yard or so of broiled beef presently bid the pantler send me a manchet and the butler a cup of wine i will take a running breakfast on the western battlements footnote old henry jenkins in his recollections of the abbacies before their dissolution has preserved the fact that roastbeef was delivered out to the guests not by weight but by measure  at this place which was rather the weakest point of the garde doloureuse the good father found wilkin flammock anxiously superintending the necessary measures of defence he greeted him courteously congratulated him on the stock of provisions with which the castle had been supplied during the night and was inquiring how they had been so happily introduced through the welsh besiegers when wilkin took the first occasion to interrupt him  of all this another time good father but i wish at present and before other discourse to consult thee on a matter which presses my conscience and moreover deeply concerns my worldly estate  speak on my excellent son said the father conceiving that he should thus gain the key to wilkins real intentions oh a tender conscience is a jewel and he that will not listen when it saith pour out thy doubts into the ear of the priest shall one day have his own dolorous outcries choked with fire and brimstone thou wert ever of a tender conscience son wilkin though thou hast but a rough and borrel bearing  well then said wilkin you are to know good father that i have had some dealings with my neighbour jan vanwelt concerning my daughter rose and that he has paid me certain gilders on condition i will match her to him  pshaw pshaw my good son said the disappointed confessor this gear can lie overthis is no time for marrying or giving in marriage when we are all like to be murdered  nay but hear me good father said the fleming for this point of conscience concerns the present case more nearly than you wot ofyou must know i have no will to bestow rose on this same jan vanwelt who is old and of ill conditions and i would know of you whether i may in conscience refuse him my consent  truly said father aldrovand rose is a pretty lass though somewhat hasty and i think you may honestly withdraw your consent always on paying back the gilders you have received  but there lies the pinch good father said the flemingthe refunding this money will reduce me to utter poverty the welsh have destroyed my substance and this handful of money is all god help me on which i must begin the world again  nevertheless son wilkin said aldrovand thou must keep thy word or pay the forfeit for what saith the text quis habitabit in tabernaculo quis requiescet in monte sancta who shall ascend to the tabernacle and dwell in the holy mountain is it not answered again qui jurat proximo et non decipitgo to my sonbreak not thy plighted word for a little filthy lucrebetter is an empty stomach and an hungry heart with a clear conscience than a fatted ox with iniquity and wordbreakingsawest thou not our late noble lord who may his soul be happy chose rather to die in unequal battle like a true knight than live a perjured man though he had but spoken a rash word to a welshman over a wine flask  alas then said the fleming this is even what i feared we must een render up the castle or restore to the welshman jorworth the cattle by means of which i had schemed to victual and defend it  howwhereforewhat dost thou mean said the monk in astonishment i speak to thee of rose flammock and jan van devil or whatever you call him and you reply with talk about cattle and castles and i wot not what  so please you holy father i did but speak in parables this castle was the daughter i had promised to deliver overthe welshman is jan vanwelt and the gilders were the cattle he has sent in as a partpayment beforehand of my guerdon  parables said the monk colouring with anger at the trick put on him what has a boor like thee to do with parablesbut i forgive theei forgive thee  i am therefore to yield the castle to the welshman or restore him his cattle said the impenetrable dutchman  sooner yield thy soul to satan replied the monk  i fear it must be the alternative said the fleming for the example of thy honourable lord  the example of an honourable foolanswered the monk then presently subjoined our lady be with her servantthis belgic brained boor makes me forget what i would say  nay but the holy text which your reverence cited to me even now continued the fleming  go to said the monk what hast thou to do to presume to think of textsknowest thou not the letter of the scripture slayeth and that it is the exposition which maketh to liveart thou not like one who coming to a physician conceals from him half the symptoms of the diseasei tell thee thou foolish fleming the text speaketh but of promises made unto christians and there is in the rubric a special exception of such as are made to welshmen at this commentary the fleming grinned so broadly as to show his whole case of broad strong white teeth father aldrovand himself grinned in sympathy and then proceeded to saycome come i see how it is thou hast studied some small revenge on me for doubting of thy truth and in verity i think thou hast taken it wittily enough but wherefore didst thou not let me into the secret from the beginning i promise thee i had foul suspicions of thee  what said the fleming is it possible i could ever think of involving your reverence in a little matter of deceit surely heaven hath sent me more grace and mannershark i hear jorworths horn at the gate  he blows like a town swineherd said aldrovand in disdain  it is not your reverences pleasure that i should restore the cattle unto them then said flammock  yes thus far prithee deliver him straightway over the walls such a tub of boiling water as shall scald the hair from his goatskin cloak and hark thee do thou in the first place try the temperature of the kettle with thy forefinger and that shall be thy penance for the trick thou hast played me  the fleming answered this with another broad grin of intelligence and they proceeded to the outer gate to which jorworth had come alone placing himself at the wicket which however he kept carefully barred and speaking through a small opening contrived for such purpose wilkin flammock demanded of the welshman his business  to receive rendition of the castle agreeable to promise said jorworth  ay and art thou come on such errand alone said wilkin  no truly answered jorworth i have some two score of men concealed among yonder bushes  then thou hadst best lead them away quickly answered wilkin before our archers let fly a sheaf of arrows among them  how villain dost thou not mean to keep thy promise said the welshman  i gave thee none said the fleming i promised but to think on what thou didst say i have done so and have communicated with my ghostly father who will in no respect hear of my listening to thy proposal  and wilt thou said jorworth keep the cattle which i simply sent into the castle on the faith of our agreement  i will excommunicate and deliver him over to satan said the monk unable to wait the phlegmatic and lingering answer of the fleming if he give horn hoof or hair of them to such an uncircumcised philistine as thou or thy master  it is well shorn priest answered jorworth in great anger but mark mereckon not on your frock for ransom when gwenwyn hath taken this castle as it shall not longer shelter such a pair of faithless traitors i will have you sewed up each into the carcass of one of these kine for which your penitent has forsworn himself and lay you where wolf and eagle shall be your only companions  thou wilt work thy will when it is matched with thy power said the sedate netherlander  false welshman we defy thee to thy teeth answered in the same breath the more irascible monk i trust to see hounds gnaw thy joints ere that day come that ye talk of so proudly  by way of answer to both jorworth drew back his arm with his levelled javelin and shaking the shaft till it acquired a vibratory motion he hurled it with equal strength and dexterity right against the aperture in the wicket it whizzed through the opening at which it was aimed and flew harmlessly however between the heads of the monk and the fleming the former of whom started back while the latter only said as he looked at the javelin which stood quivering in the door of the guardroom that was well aimed and happily baulked  jorworth the instant he had flung his dart hastened to the ambush which he had prepared and gave them at once the signal and the example of a rapid retreat down the hill father aldrovand would willingly have followed them with a volley of arrows but the fleming observed that ammunition was too precious with them to be wasted on a few runaways perhaps the honest man remembered that they had come within the danger of such a salutation in some measure on his own assurance when the noise of the hasty retreat of jorworth and his followers had died away there ensued a dead silence well corresponding with the coolness and calmness of that early hour in the morning  this will not last long said wilkin to the monk in a tone of foreboding seriousness which found an echo in the good fathers bosom  it will not and it cannot answered aldrovand and we must expect a shrewd attack which i should mind little but that their numbers are great ours few the extent of the walls considerable and the obstinacy of these welsh fiends almost equal to their fury but we will do the best i will to the lady evelineshe must show herself upon the battlementsshe is fairer in feature than becometh a man of my order to speak of and she has withal a breathing of her fathers lofty spirit the look and the word of such a lady will give a man double strength in the hour of need  it may be said the fleming and i will go see that the good breakfast which i have appointed be presently served forth it will give my flemings more strength than the sight of the ten thousand virginsmay their help be with uswere they all arranged on a fair field     chapter the eighth     twas when ye raised mid sap and siege   the banner of your rightful liege   at your she captains call   who miracle of womankind   lent mettle to the meanest hind   that mannd her castle wall      william stewart rose   the morning light was scarce fully spread abroad when eveline berenger in compliance with her confessors advice commenced her progress around the walls and battlements of the beleaguered castle to confirm by her personal entreaties the minds of the valiant and to rouse the more timid to hope and to exertion she wore a rich collar and bracelets as ornaments which indicated her rankand high descent and her under tunic in the manner of the times was gathered around her slender waist by a girdle embroidered with precious stones and secured by a large buckle of gold from one side of the girdle was suspended a pouch or purse splendidly adorned with needlework and on the left side it sustained a small dagger of exquisite workmanship a darkcoloured mantle chosen as emblematic of her clouded fortunes was flung loosely around her and its hood was brought forward so as to shadow but not hide her beautiful countenance her looks had lost the high and ecstatic expression which had been inspired by supposed revelation but they retained a sorrowful and mild yet determined characterand in addressing the soldiers she used a mixture of entreaty and commandnow throwing herself upon their protectionnow demanding in her aid the just tribute of their allegiance  the garrison was divided as military skill dictated in groups on the points most liable to attack or from which an assailing enemy might be best annoyed and it was this unavoidable separation of their force into small detachments which showed to disadvantage the extent of walls compared with the number of the defenders and though wilkin flammock had contrived several means of concealing this deficiency of force from the enemy he could not disguise it from the defenders of the castle who cast mournful glances on the length of battlements which were unoccupied save by sentinels and then looked out to the fatal field of battle loaded with the bodies of those who ought to have been their comrades in this hour of peril  the presence of eveline did much to rouse the garrison from this state of discouragement she glided from post to post from tower to tower of the old gray fortress as a gleam of light passes over a clouded landscape and touching its various points in succession calls them out to beauty and effect sorrow and fear sometimes make sufferers eloquent she addressed the various nations who composed her little garrison each in appropriate language to the english she spoke as children of the soilto the flemings as men who had become denizens by the right of hospitalityto the normans as descendants of that victorious race whose sword had made them the nobles and sovereigns of every land where its edge had been tried to them she used the language of chivalry by whose rules the meanest of that nation regulated or affected to regulate his actions the english she reminded of their good faith and honesty of heart and to the flemings she spoke of the destruction of their property the fruits of their honest industry to all she proposed vengeance for the death of their leader and his followersto all she recommended confidence in god and our lady of the garde doloureuse and she ventured to assure all of the strong and victorious bands that were already in march to their relief  will the gallant champions of the cross she said think of leaving their native land while the wail of women and of orphans is in their earsit were to convert their pious purpose into mortal sin and to derogate from the high fame they have so well won yesfight but valiantly and perhaps before the very sun that is now slowly rising shall sink in the sea you will see it shining on the ranks of shrewsbury and chester when did the welshmen wait to hear the clangour of their trumpets or the rustling of their silken banners fight bravelyfight freely but awhileour castle is strongour munition ampleyour hearts are goodyour arms are powerfulgod is nigh to us and our friends are not far distant fight then in the name of all that is good and holyfight for yourselves for your wives for your children and for your propertyand oh fight for an orphan maiden who hath no other defenders but what a sense of her sorrows and the remembrance of her father may raise up among you  such speeches as these made a powerful impression on the men to whom they were addressed already hardened by habits and sentiments against a sense of danger the chivalrous normans swore on the cross of their swords they would die to a man ere they would surrender their poststhe blunter anglosaxons cried shame on him who would render up such a lamb as eveline to a welsh wolf while he could make her a bulwark with his body even the cold flemings caught a spark of the enthusiasm with which the others were animated and muttered to each other praises of the young ladys beauty and short but honest resolves to do the best they might in her defence  rose flammock who accompanied her lady with one or two attendants upon her circuit around the castle seemed to have relapsed into her natural character of a shy and timid girl out of the excited state into which she had been brought by the suspicions which in the evening before had attached to her fathers character she tripped closely but respectfully after eveline and listened to what she said from time to time with the awe and admiration of a child listening to its tutor while only her moistened eye expressed how far she felt or comprehended the extent of the danger or the force of the exhortations there was however a moment when the youthful maidens eye became more bright her step more confident her looks more elevated this was when they approached the spot where her father having discharged the duties of commander of the garrison was now exercising those of engineer and displaying great skill as well as wonderful personal strength in directing and assisting the establishment of a large mangonel a military engine used for casting stones upon a station commanding an exposed postern gate which led from the western side of the castle down to the plain and where a severe assault was naturally to be expected the greater part of his armour lay beside him but covered with his cassock to screen it from morning dew while in his leathern doublet with arms bare to the shoulder and a huge sledgehammer in his hand he set an example to the mechanics who worked under his direction  in slow and solid natures there is usually a touch of shamefacedness and a sensitiveness to the breach of petty observances wilkin flammock had been unmoved even to insensibility at the imputation of treason so lately cast upon him but he coloured high and was confused while hastily throwing on his cassock he endeavoured to conceal the dishabille in which he had been surprised by the lady eveline not so his daughter proud of her fathers zeal her eye gleamed from him to her mistress with a look of triumph which seemed to say and this faithful follower is he who was suspected of treachery  evelines own bosom made her the same reproach and anxious to atone for her momentary doubt of his fidelity she offered for his acceptance a ring of value in small amends she said of a momentary misconstruction it needs not lady said flammock with his usual bluntness unless i have the freedom to bestow the gaud on rose for i think she was grieved enough at that which moved me littleas why should it  dispose of it as thou wilt said eveline the stone it bears is as true as thine own faith  here eveline paused and looking on the broad expanded plain which extended between the site of the castle and the river observed how silent and still the morning was rising over what had so lately been a scene of such extensive slaughter  it will not be so long answered flammock we shall have noise enough and that nearer to our ears than yesterday  which way lie the enemy said eveline methinks i can spy neither tents nor pavilions  they use none lady answered wilkin flammock heaven has denied them the grace and knowledge to weave linen enough for such a purposeyonder they lie on both sides of the river covered with nought but their white mantles would one think that a host of thieves and cutthroats could look so like the finest object in naturea wellspread bleachingfieldharkharkthe wasps are beginning to buzz they will soon be plying their stings  in fact there was heard among the welsh army a low and indistinct murmur like that of    bees alarmed and arming in their hives  terrified at the hollow menacing sound which grew louder every moment rose who had all the irritability of a sensitive temperament clung to her fathers arm saying in a terrified whisper it is like the sound of the sea the night before the great inundation  and it betokens too rough weather for woman to be abroad in said flammock go to your chamber lady eveline if it be your willand go you too roschengod bless you bothye do but keep us idle here  and indeed conscious that she had done all that was incumbent upon her and fearful lest the chill which she felt creeping over her own heart should infect others eveline took her vassals advice and withdrew slowly to her own apartment often casting back her eye to the place where the welsh now drawn out and under arms were advancing their ridgy battalions like the waves of an approaching tide  the prince of powys had with considerable military skill adopted a plan of attack suitable to the fiery genius of his followers and calculated to alarm on every point the feeble garrison  the three sides of the castle which were defended by the river were watched each by a numerous body of the british with instructions to confine themselves to the discharge of arrows unless they should observe that some favourable opportunity of close attack should occur but far the greater part of gwenwyns forces consisting of three columns of great strength advanced along the plain on the western side of the castle and menaced with a desperate assault the walls which in that direction were deprived of the defence of the river the first of these formidable bodies consisted entirely of archers who dispersed themselves in front of the beleaguered place and took advantage of every bush and rising ground which could afford them shelter and then began to bend their bows and shower their arrows on the battlements and loopholes suffering however a great deal more damage than they were able to inflict as the garrison returned their shot in comparative safety and with more secure and deliberate aim footnote the welsh were excellent bowmen but under favour of lord lyttleton they probably did not use the long bow the formidable weapon of the normans and afterwards of the english yeomen that of the welsh most likely rather resembled the bow of the cognate celtic tribes of ireland and of the highlanders of scotland it was shorter than the norman long bow as being drawn to the breast not to the ear more loosely strung and the arrow having a heavy iron head altogether in short a less effective weapon it appears from the following anecdote that there was a difference between the welsh arrow and those of the english  in 1122 henry the ii marching into powysland to chastise meredith ap blethyn and certain rebels in passing a defile was struck by an arrow on the breast repelled by the excellence of his breastplate the shaft fell to the ground when the king felt the blow and saw the shaft he swore his usual oath by the death of our lord that the arrow came not from a welsh but an english bow and influenced by this belief hastily put an end to the war under cover however of their discharge of arrows two very strong bodies of welsh attempted to carry the outer defences of the castle by storm they had axes to destroy the palisades then called barriers faggots to fill up the external ditches torches to set fire to aught combustible which they might find and above all ladders to scale the walls  these detachments rushed with incredible fury towards the point of attack despite a most obstinate defence and the great loss which they sustained by missiles of every kind and continued the assault for nearly an hour supplied by reinforcements which more than recruited their diminished numbers when they were at last compelled to retreat they seemed to adopt a new and yet more harassing species of attack a large body assaulted one exposed point of the fortress with such fury as to draw thither as many of the besieged as could possibly be spared from other defended posts and when there appeared a point less strongly manned than was adequate to defence that in its turn was furiously assailed by a separate body of the enemy  thus the defenders of the garde doloureuse resembled the embarrassed traveller engaged in repelling a swarm of hornets which while he brushes them from one part fix in swarms upon another and drive him to despair by their numbers and the boldness and multiplicity of their attacks the postern being of course a principal point of attack father aldrovand whose anxiety would not permit him to be absent from the walls and who indeed where decency would permit took an occasional share in the active defence of the place hasted thither as the point chiefly in danger  here he found the fleming like a second ajax grim with dust and blood working with his own hands the great engine which he had lately helped to erect and at the same time giving heedful eye to all the exigencies around  how thinkest thou of this days work said the monk in a whisper  what skills it talking of it father replied flammock thou art no soldier and i have no time for words  nay take thy breath said the monk tucking up the sleeves of his frock i will try to help thee the whilstalthough our lady pity me i know nothing of these strange devicesnot even the names but our rule commands us to labour there can be no harm therefore in turning this winchor in placing this steelheaded piece of wood opposite to the chord suiting his actions to his words nor see i aught uncanonical in adjusting the lever thus or in touching the spring  the large bolt whizzed through the air as he spoke and was so successfully aimed that it struck down a welsh chief of eminence to which gwenwyn himself was in the act of giving some important charge  well driven trebuchetwell flown quarrel cried the monk unable to contain his delight and giving in his triumph the true technical names to the engine and the javelin which it discharged  and well aimed monk added wilkin flammock i think thou knowest more than is in thy breviary  care not thou for that said the father and now that thou seest i can work an engine and that the welsh knaves seem something low in stomach what thinkst thou of our estate  well enoughfor a bad oneif we may hope for speedy succour but mens bodies are of flesh not of iron and we may be at last wearied out by numbers only one soldier to four yards of wall is a fearful odds and the villains are aware of it and keep us to sharp work  the renewal of the assault here broke off their conversation nor did the active enemy permit them to enjoy much repose until sunset for alarming them with repeated menaces of attack upon different points besides making two or three formidable and furious assaults they left them scarce time to breathe or to take a moments refreshment yet the welsh paid a severe price for their temerity for while nothing could exceed the bravery with which their men repeatedly advanced to the attack those which were made latest in the day had less of animated desperation than their first onset and it is probable that the sense of having sustained great loss and apprehension of its effects on the spirits of his people made nightfall and the interruption of the contest as acceptable to gwenwyn as to the exhausted garrison of the garde doloureuse  but in the camp or leaguer of the welsh there was glee and triumph for the loss of the past day was forgotten in recollection of the signal victory which had preceded this siege and the dispirited garrison could hear from their walls the laugh and the song the sound of harping and gaiety which triumphed by anticipation over their surrender  the sun was for some time sunk the twilight deepened and night closed with a blue and cloudless sky in which the thousand spangles that deck the firmament received double brilliancy from some slight touch of frost although the paler planet their mistress was but in her first quarter the necessities of the garrison were considerably aggravated by that of keeping a very strong and watchful guard ill according with the weakness of their numbers at a time which appeared favourable to any sudden nocturnal alarm and so urgent was this duty that those who had been more slightly wounded on the preceding day were obliged to take their share in it notwithstanding their hurts the monk and fleming who now perfectly understood each other went in company around the walls at midnight exhorting the warders to be watchful and examining with their own eyes the state of the fortress it was in the course of these rounds and as they were ascending an elevated platform by a range of narrow and uneven steps something galling to the monks tread that they perceived on the summit to which they were ascending instead of the black corslet of the flemish sentinel who had been placed there two white forms the appearance of which struck wilkin flammock with more dismay than he had shown during any of the doubtful events of the preceding days fight  father he said betake yourself to your toolses spucktthere are hobgoblins here  the good father had not learned as a priest to defy the spiritual host whom as a soldier he had dreaded more than any mortal enemy but he began to recite with chattering teeth the exorcism of the church conjuro vos omnes spiritus maligni magni atque parviwhen he was interrupted by the voice of eveline who called out is it you father aldrovand  much lightened at heart by finding they had no ghost to deal with wilkin flammock and the priest advanced hastily to the platform where they found the lady with her faithful rose the former with a halfpike in her hand like a sentinel on duty  how is this daughter said the monk how came you here and thus armed and where is the sentinelthe lazy flemish hound that should have kept the post  may he not be a lazy hound yet not a flemish one father said rose who was ever awakened by anything which seemed a reflection upon her country methinks i have heard of such curs of english breed  go to rose you are too malapert for a young maiden said her father once more where is peterkin vorst who should have kept this post  let him not be blamed for my fault said eveline pointing to a place where the flemish sentinel lay in the shade of the battlement fast asleephe was overcome with toilhad fought hard through the day and when i saw him asleep as i came hither like a wandering spirit that cannot take slumber or repose i would not disturb the rest which i envied as he had fought for me i might i thought watch an hour for him so i took his weapon with the purpose of remaining here till some one should come to relieve him  i will relieve the schelm with a vengeance said wilkin flammock and saluted the slumbering and prostrate warder with two kicks which made his corslet clatter the man started to his feet in no small alarm which he would have communicated to the next sentinels and to the whole garrison by crying out that the welsh were upon the walls had not the monk covered his broad mouth with his hand just as the roar was issuing forthpeace and get thee down to the under bayley said hethou deservest death by all the policies of warbut look ye varlet and see who has saved your worthless neck by watching while you were dreaming of swines flesh and beerpots  the fleming although as yet but half awake was sufficiently conscious of his situation to sneak off without reply after two or three awkward congees as well to eveline as to those by whom his repose had been so unceremoniously interrupted  he deserves to be tied neck and heel the houndsfoot said wilkin but what would you have lady my countrymen cannot live without rest or sleep so saying he gave a yawn so wide as if he had proposed to swallow one of the turrets at an angle of the platform on which he stood as if it had only garnished a christmas pasty  true good wilkin said eveline and do you therefore take some rest and trust to my watchfulness at least till the guards are relieved i cannot sleep if i would and i would not if i could  thanks lady said flammock and in truth as this is a centrical place and the rounds must pass in an hour at farthest i will een close my eyes for such a space for the lids feel as heavy as floodgates  oh father father exclaimed rose alive to her sires unceremonious neglect of decorumthink where you are and in whose presence  ay ay good flammock said the monk remember the presence of a noble norman maiden is no place for folding of cloaks and donning of nightcaps  let him alone father said eveline who in another moment might have smiled at the readiness with which wilkin flammock folded himself in his huge cloak extended his substantial form on the stone bench and gave the most decided tokens of profound repose long ere the monk had done speakingforms and fashions of respect she continued are for times of ease and nicetywhen in danger the soldiers bedchamber is wherever he can find leisure for an hours sleephis eatinghall wherever he can obtain food sit thou down by rose and me good father and tell us of some holy lesson which may pass away these hours of weariness and calamity  the father obeyed but however willing to afford consolation his ingenuity and theological skill suggested nothing better than a recitation of the penitentiary psalms in which task he continued until fatigue became too powerful for him also when he committed the same breach of decorum for which he had upbraided wilkin flammock and fell fast asleep in the midst of his devotions     chapter the ninth     oh night of wo she said and wept   oh night foreboding sorrow   oh night of wo she said and wept   but more i dread the morrow      sir gilbert elliot   the fatigue which had exhausted flammock and the monk was unfelt by the two anxious maidens who remained with their eyes bent now upon the dim landscape now on the stars by which it was lighted as if they could have read there the events which the morrow was to bring forth it was a placid and melancholy scene tree and field and hill and plain lay before them in doubtful light while at greater distance their eye could with difficulty trace one or two places where the river hidden in general by banks and trees spread its more expanded bosom to the stars and the pale crescent all was still excepting the solemn rush of the waters and now and then the shrill tinkle of a harp which heard from more than a miles distance through the midnight silence announced that some of the welshmen still protracted their most beloved amusement the wild notes partially heard seemed like the voice of some passing spirit and connected as they were with ideas of fierce and unrelenting hostility thrilled on evelines ear as if prophetic of war and wo captivity and death the only other sounds which disturbed the extreme stillness of the night were the occasional step of a sentinel upon his post or the hooting of the owls which seemed to wail the approaching downfall of the moonlight turrets in which they had established their ancient habitations  the calmness of all around seemed to press like a weight on the bosom of the unhappy eveline and brought to her mind a deeper sense of present grief and keener apprehension of future horrors than had reigned there during the bustle blood and confusion of the preceding day she rose upshe sat downshe moved to and fro on the platformshe remained fixed like a statue to a single spot as if she were trying by variety of posture to divert her internal sense of fear and sorrow  at length looking at the monk and the fleming as they slept soundly under the shade of the battlement she could no longer forbear breaking silence men are happy she said my beloved rose their anxious thoughts are either diverted by toilsome exertion or drowned in the insensibility which follows it they may encounter wounds and death but it is we who feel in the spirit a more keen anguish than the body knows and in the gnawing sense of present ill and fear of future misery suffer a living death more cruel than that which ends our woes at once  do not be thus downcast my noble lady said rose be rather what you were yesterday caring for the wounded for the aged for every one but yourselfexposing even your dear life among the showers of the welsh arrows when doing so could give courage to others while ishame on mecould but tremble sob and weep and needed all the little wit i have to prevent my shouting with the wild cries of the welsh or screaming and groaning with those of our friends who fell around me  alas rose answered her mistress you may at pleasure indulge your fears to the verge of distraction itselfyou have a father to fight and watch for you minemy kind noble and honoured parent lies dead on yonder field and all which remains for me is to act as may best become his memory but this moment is at least mine to think upon and to mourn for him  so saying and overpowered by the longrepressed burst of filial sorrow she sunk down on the banquette which ran along the inside of the embattled parapet of the platform and murmuring to herself he is gone for ever abandoned herself to the extremity of grief one hand grasped unconsciously the weapon which she held and served at the same time to prop her forehead while the tears by which she was now for the first time relieved flowed in torrents from her eyes and her sobs seemed so convulsive that rose almost feared her heart was bursting her affection and sympathy dictated at once the kindest course which evelines condition permitted without attempting to control the torrent of grief in its full current she gently sat her down beside the mourner and possessing herself of the hand which had sunk motionless by her side she alternately pressed it to her lips her bosom and her brownow covered it with kisses now bedewed it with tears and amid these tokens of the most devoted and humble sympathy waited a more composed moment to offer her little stock of consolation in such deep silence and stillness that as the pale light fell upon the two beautiful young women it seemed rather to show a group of statuary the work of some eminent sculptor than beings whose eyes still wept and whose hearts still throbbed at a little distance the gleaming corslet of the fleming and the dark garments of father aldrovand as they lay prostrate on the stone steps might represent the bodies of those for whom the principal figures were mourning  after a deep agony of many minutes it seemed that the sorrows of eveline were assuming a more composed character her convulsive sobs were changed for long low profound sighs and the course of her tears though they still flowed was milder and less violent her kind attendant availing herself of these gentler symptoms tried softly to win the spear from her ladys grasp let me be sentinel for a while she said my sweet ladyi will at least scream louder than you if any danger should approach she ventured to kiss her cheek and throw her arms around evelines neck while she spoke but a mute caress which expressed her sense of the faithful girls kind intentions to minister if possible to her repose was the only answer returned they remained for many minutes silent in the same postureeveline like an upright and tender poplarrose who encircled her lady in her arms like the woodbine which twines around it  at length rose suddenly felt her young mistress shiver in her embrace and then evelines hand grasped her arm rigidly as she whispered do you hear nothing  nonothing but the hooting of the owl answered rose timorously  i heard a distant sound said evelinei thought i heard it hark it comes againlook from the battlements rose while i awaken the priest and thy father  dearest lady said rose i dare notwhat can this sound be that is heard by one onlyyou are deceived by the rush of the river  i would not alarm the castle unnecessarily said eveline pausing or even break your fathers needful slumbers by a fancy of minebut harki hear it againdistinct amidst the intermitting sounds of the rushing watera low tremulous sound mingled with a tinkling like smiths or armourers at work upon their anvils  rose had by this time sprung up on the banquette and flinging back her rich tresses of fair hair had applied her hand behind her ear to collect the distant sound i hear it she cried and it increasesawake them for heavens sake and without a moments delay  eveline accordingly stirred the sleepers with the reversed end of the lance and as they started to their feet in haste she whispered in a hasty but cautious voice to armsthe welsh are upon us whatwhere said wilkin flammockwhere be they  listen and you will hear them arming she replied  the noise is but in thine own fancy lady said the fleming whose organs were of the same heavy character with his form and his disposition i would i had not gone to sleep at all since i was to be awakened so soon  nay but listen good flammockthe sound of armour comes from the northeast  the welsh lie not in that quarter lady said wilkin and besides they wear no armour  i hear iti hear it said father aldrovand who had been listening for some time all praise to st benedictour lady of the garde doloureuse has been gracious to her servants as ever it is the tramp of horsesit is the clash of armourthe chivalry of the marches are coming to our reliefkyrie eleison  i hear something too said flammocksomething like the hollow sound of the great sea when it burst into my neighbour klinkermans warehouse and rolled his pots and pans against each other but it were an evil mistake father to take foes for friendswe were best rouse the people  tush said the priest talk to me of pots and kettleswas i squire of the body to count stephen mauleverer for twenty years and do i not know the tramp of a warhorse or the clash of a mailcoatbut call the men to the walls at any rate and have me the best drawn up at the basecourtwe may help them by a sally  that will not be rashly undertaken with my consent murmured the fleming but to the wall if you will and 111 good time but keep your normans and english silent sir priest else their unruly and noisy joy will awaken the welsh camp and prepare them for their unwelcome visitors  the monk laid his finger on his lip in sign of obedience and they parted in opposite directions each to rouse the defenders of the castle who were soon heard drawing from all quarters to their posts upon the walls with hearts in a very different mood from that in which they had descended from them the utmost caution being used to prevent noise the manning of the walls was accomplished in silence and the garrison awaited in breathless expectation the success of the forces who were rapidly advancing to their relief  the character of the sounds which now loudly awakened the silence of this eventful night could no longer be mistaken they were distinguishable from the rushing of a mighty river or from the muttering sound of distant thunder by the sharp and angry notes which the clashing of the riders arms mingled with the deep bass of the horses rapid tread from the long continuance of the sounds their loudness and the extent of horizon from which they seemed to come all in the castle were satisfied that the approaching relief consisted of several very strong bodies of horse footnote even the sharp and angry clang made by the iron scabbards of modern cavalry ringing against the steeltippd saddles and stirrup betrays their approach from a distance the clash of the armour of knights armed capapie must have been much more easily discernible at once this mighty sound ceased as if the earth on which they trod had either devoured the armed squadrons or had become incapable of resounding to their tramp the defenders of the garde doloureuse concluded that their friends had made a sudden halt to give their horses breath examine the leaguer of the enemy and settle the order of attack upon them the pause however was but momentary  the british so alert at surprising their enemies were themselves on many occasions liable to surprise their men were undisciplined and sometimes negligent of the patient duties of the sentinel and besides their foragers and flying parties who scoured the country during the preceding day had brought back tidings which had lulled them into fatal security their camp had been therefore carelessly guarded and confident in the smallness of the garrison they had altogether neglected the important military duty of establishing patrols and outposts at a proper distance from their main body thus the cavalry of the lords marchers notwithstanding the noise which accompanied their advance had approached very near the british camp without exciting the least alarm but while they were arranging their forces into separate columns in order to commence the assault a loud and increasing clamour among the welsh announced that they were at length aware of their danger the shrill and discordant cries by which they endeavoured to assemble their men each under the banner of his chief resounded from their leaguer but these rallying shouts were soon converted into screams and clamours of horror and dismay when the thundering charge of the barbed horses and heavily armed cavalry of the anglonormans surprised their undefended camp  yet not even under circumstances so adverse did the descendants of the ancient britons renounce their defence or forfeit their old hereditary privilege to be called the bravest of mankind their cries of defiance and resistance were heard resounding above the groans of the wounded the shouts of the triumphant assailants and the universal tumult of the nightbattle it was not until the morning light began to peep forth that the slaughter or dispersion of gwenwyns forces was complete and that the earthquake voice of victory arose in uncontrolled and unmingled energy of exultation  then the besieged if they could be still so termed looking from their towers over the expanded country beneath witnessed nothing but one widespread scene of desultory flight and unrelaxed pursuit that the welsh had been permitted to encamp in fancied security upon the hither side of the river now rendered their discomfiture more dreadfully fatal the single pass by which they could cross to the other side was soon completely choked by fugitives on whose rear raged the swords of the victorious normans many threw themselves into the river upon the precarious chance of gaining the farther side and except a few who were uncommonly strong skilful and active perished among the rocks and in the currents others more fortunate escaped by fords with which they had accidentally been made acquainted many dispersed or in small bands fled in reckless despair towards the castle as if the fortress which had beat them off when victorious could be a place of refuge to them in their present forlorn condition while others roamed wildly over the plain seeking only escape from immediate and instant danger without knowing whither they ran  the normans meanwhile divided into small parties followed and slaughtered them at pleasure while as a rallying point for the victors the banner of hugo de lacy streamed from a small mount on which gwenwyn had lately pitched his own and surrounded by a competent force both of infantry and horsemen which the experienced baron permitted on no account to wander far from it  the rest as we have already said followed the chase with shouts of exultation and of vengeance ringing around the battlements which resounded with the cries ha saint edwardha saint dennisstrikeslayno quarter to the welsh wolvesthink on raymond berenger  the soldiers on the walls joined in these vengeful and victorious clamours and discharged several sheaves of arrows upon such fugitives as in their extremity approached too near the castle they would fain have sallied to give more active assistance in the work of destruction but the communication being now open with the constable of chesters forces wilkin flammock considered himself and the garrison to be under the orders of that renowned chief and refused to listen to the eager admonitions of father aldrovand who would notwithstanding his sacerdotal character have willingly himself taken charge of the sally which he proposed  at length the scene of slaughter seemed at an end the retreat was blown on many a bugle and knights halted on the plain to collect their personal followers muster them under their proper pennon and then march them slowly back to the great standard of their leader around which the main body were again to be assembled like the clouds which gather around the evening suna fanciful simile which might yet be drawn farther in respect of the level rays of strong lurid light which shot from those dark battalions as the beams were flung back from their polished armour  the plain was in this manner soon cleared of the horsemen and remained occupied only by the dead bodies of the slaughtered welshmen the bands who had followed the pursuit to a greater distance were also now seen returning driving before them or dragging after them dejected and unhappy captives to whom they had given quarter when their thirst of blood was satiated  it was then that desirous to attract the attention of his liberators wilkin flammock commanded all the banners of the castle to be displayed under a general shout of acclamation from those who had fought under them it was answered by a universal cry of joy from de lacys army which rung so wide as might even yet have startled such of the welsh fugitives as far distant from this disastrous field of flight might have ventured to halt for a moments repose  presently after this greeting had been exchanged a single rider advanced from the constables army towards the castle showing even at a distance an unusual dexterity of horsemanship and grace of deportment he arrived at the drawbridge which was instantly lowered to receive him whilst flammock and the monk for the latter as far as he could associated himself with the former in all acts of authority hastened to receive the envoy of their liberator they found him just alighted from the ravencoloured horse which was slightly flecked with blood as well as foam and still panted with the exertions of the evening though answering to the caressing hand of its youthful rider he arched his neck shook his steel caparison and snorted to announce his unabated mettle and unwearied love of combat the young mans eagle look bore the same token of unabated vigour mingled with the signs of recent exertion his helmet hanging at his saddlebow showed a gallant countenance coloured highly but not inflamed which looked out from a rich profusion of short chestnutcurls and although his armour was of a massive and simple form he moved under it with such elasticity and ease that it seemed a graceful attire not a burden or encumbrance a furred mantle had not sat on him with more easy grace than the heavy hauberk which complied with every gesture of his noble form yet his countenance was so juvenile that only the down on the upper lip announced decisively the approach to manhood the females who thronged into the court to see the first envoy of their deliverers could not forbear mixing praises of his beauty with blessings on his valour and one comely middleaged dame in particular distinguished by the tightness with which her scarlet hose sat on a wellshaped leg and ankle and by the cleanness of her coif pressed close up to the young squire and more forward than the rest doubled the crimson hue of his cheek by crying aloud that our lady of the garde doloureuse had sent them news of their redemption by an angel from the sanctuarya speech which although father aldrovand shook his head was received by her companions with such general acclamation as greatly embarrassed the young mans modesty  peace all of ye said wilkin flammockknow you no respects you women or have you never seen a young gentleman before that you hang on him like flies on a honeycomb stand back i say and let us hear in peace what are the commands of the noble lord of lacy  these said the young man i can only deliver in the presence of the right noble demoiselle eveline berenger if i may be thought worthy of such honour  that thou art noble sir said the same forward dame who had before expressed her admiration so energetically i will uphold thee worthy of her presence and whatever other grace a lady can do thee  now hold thy tongue with a wanion said the monk while in the same breath the fleming exclaimed beware the cuckingstool dame scantograce while he conducted the noble youth across the court let my good horse be cared for said the cavalier as he put the bridle into the hand of a menial and in doing so got rid of some part of his female retinue who began to pat and praise the steed as much as they had done the rider and some in the enthusiasm of their joy hardly abstained from kissing the stirrups and horse furniture  but dame gillian was not so easily diverted from her own point as were some of her companions she continued to repeat the word cuckingstool till the fleming was out of hearing and then became more specific in her objurgationand why cuckingstool i pray sir wilkin butterfirkin you are the man would stop an english mouth with a flemish damask napkin i trow marry quep my cousin the weaver and why the cuckingstool i praybecause my young lady is comely and the young squire is a man of mettle reverence to his beard that is to come yet have we not eyes to see and have we not a mouth and a tongue  in troth dame gillian they do you wrong who doubt it said evelines nurse who stood by but i prithee keep it shut now were it but for womanhood  how now mannerly mrs margery replied the incorrigible gillian is your heart so high because you dandled our young lady on your knee fifteen years sincelet me tell you the cat will find its way to the cream though it was brought up on an abbesss lap  home housewifehome exclaimed her husband the old huntsman who was weary of this public exhibition of his domestic termagant home or i will give you a taste of my dog lashhere are both the confessor and wilkin flammock wondering at your impudence  indeed replied gillian and are not two fools enough for wonderment that you must come with your grave pate to make up the number three  there was a general laugh at the huntsmans expense under cover of which he prudently withdrew his spouse without attempting to continue the war of tongues in which she had shown such a decided superiority this controversy so light is the change in human spirits especially among the lower class awakened bursts of idle mirth among beings who had so lately been in the jaws of danger if not of absolute despair     chapter the tenth     they bore him barefaced on his bier     six proper youths and tall   and many a tear bedewd his grave     within yon kirkyard wall     the friar of orders gray   while these matters took place in the castleyard the young squire damian lacy obtained the audience which he had requested of eveline berenger who received him in the great hall of the castle seated beneath the dais or canopy and waited upon by rose and other female attendants of whom the first alone was permitted to use a tabouret or small stool in her presence so strict were the norman maidens of quality in maintaining their claims to high rank and observance  the youth was introduced by the confessor and flammock as the spiritual character of the one and the trust reposed by her late father in the other authorized them to be present upon the occasion eveline naturally blushed as she advanced two steps to receive the handsome youthful envoy and her bashfulness seemed infectious for it was with some confusion that damian went through the ceremony of saluting the hand which she extended towards him in token of welcome eveline was under the necessity of speaking first  we advance as far as our limits will permit us she said to greet with our thanks the messenger who brings us tidings of safety we speakunless we errto the noble damian of lacy  to the humblest of your servants answered damian falling with some difficulty into the tone of courtesy which his errand and character required who approaches you on behalf of his noble uncle hugo de lacy constable of chester  will not our noble deliverer in person honour with his presence the poor dwelling which he has saved  my noble kinsman answered damian is now gods soldier and bound by a vow not to come beneath a roof until he embark for the holy land but by my voice he congratulates you on the defeat of your savage enemies and sends you these tokens that the comrade and friend of your noble father hath not left his lamentable death many hours unavenged so saying he drew forth and laid before eveline the gold bracelets the coronet and the eudorchawg or chain of linked gold which had distinguished the rank of the welsh prince footnote eudorchawg or gold chains of the welsh these were the distinguished marks of rank and valour among the numerous tribes of celtic extraction manlius the roman champion gained the name of torquatus or he of the chain on account of an ornament of this kind won in single combat from a gigantic gaul aneurin the welsh bard mentions in his poem on the battle of catterath that no less than three hundred of the british who fell there had their necks wreathed with the eudorchawg this seems to infer that the chain was a badge of distinction and valour perhaps but not of royalty otherwise there would scarce have been so many kings present in one battle this chain has been found accordingly in ireland and wales and sometimes though more rarely in scotland doubtless it was of too precious materials not to be usually converted into money by the enemy into whose hands it fell  gwenwyn hath then fallen said eveline a natural shudder combating with the feelings of gratified vengeance as she beheld that the trophies were speckled with bloodthe slayer of my father is no more  my kinsmans lance transfixed the briton as he endeavoured to rally his flying peoplehe died grimly on the weapon which had passed more than a fathom through his body and exerted his last strength in a furious but ineffectual blow with his mace heaven is just said eveline may his sins be forgiven to the man of blood since he hath fallen by a death so bloodyone question i would ask you noble sir my fathers remains she paused unable to proceed an hour will place them at your disposal most honoured lady replied the squire in the tone of sympathy which the sorrows of so young and so fair an orphan called irresistibly forth such preparations as time admitted were making even when i left the host to transport what was mortal of the noble berenger from the field on which we found him amid a monument of slain which his own sword had raised my kinsmans vow will not allow him to pass your portcullis but with your permission i will represent him if such be your pleasure at these honoured obsequies having charge to that effect  my brave and noble father said eveline making an effort to restrain her tears will be best mourned by the noble and the brave she would have continued but her voice failed her and she was obliged to withdraw abruptly in order to give vent to her sorrow and prepare for the funeral rites with such ceremony as circumstances should permit damian bowed to the departing mourner as reverently as he would have done to a divinity and taking his horse returned to his uncles host which had encamped hastily on the recent field of battle  the sun was now high and the whole plain presented the appearance of a bustle equally different from the solitude of the early morning and from the roar and fury of the subsequent engagement the news of hugo de lacys victory every where spread abroad with all alacrity of triumph and had induced many of the inhabitants of the country who had fled before the fury of the wolf of plinlimmon to return to their desolate habitations numbers also of the loose and profligate characters which abound in a country subject to the frequent changes of war had flocked thither in quest of spoil or to gratify a spirit of restless curiosity the jew and the lombard despising danger where there was a chance of gain might be already seen bartering liquors and wares with the victorious menatarms for the bloodstained ornaments of gold lately worn by the defeated british others acted as brokers betwixt the welsh captives and their captors and where they could trust the means and good faith of the former sometimes became bound for or even advanced in ready money the sums necessary for their ransom whilst a more numerous class became themselves the purchasers of those prisoners who had no immediate means of settling with their conquerors  that the spoil thus acquired might not long encumber the soldier or blunt his ardour for farther enterprise the usual means of dissipating military spoils were already at hand courtezans mimes jugglers minstrels and taletellers of every description had accompanied the nightmarch and secure in the military reputation of the celebrated de lacy had rested fearlessly at some little distance until the battle was fought and won these now approached in many a joyous group to congratulate the victors close to the parties which they formed for the dance the song or the tale upon the yet bloody field the countrymen summoned in for the purpose were opening large trenches for depositing the deadleeches were seen tending the wounded priests and monks confessing those in extremitysoldiers transporting from the field the bodies of the more honoured among the slainpeasants mourning over their trampled crops and plundered habitationsand widows and orphans searching for the bodies of husbands and parents amid the promiscuous carnage of two combats thus wo mingled her wildest notes with those of jubilee and bacchanal triumph and the plain of the garde doloureuse formed a singular parallel to the varied maze of human life where joy and grief are so strangely mixed and where the confines of mirth and pleasure often border on those of sorrow and of death  about noon these various noises were at once silenced and the attention alike of those who rejoiced or grieved was arrested by the loud and mournful sound of six trumpets which uplifting and uniting their thrilling tones in a wild and melancholy deathnote apprised all that the obsequies of the valiant raymond berenger were about to commence from a tent which had been hastily pitched for the immediate reception of the body twelve black monks the inhabitants of a neighbouring convent began to file out in pairs headed by their abbot who bore a large cross and thundered forth the sublime notes of the catholic miserere me domine then came a chosen body of menatarms trailing their lances with their points reversed and pointed to the earth and after them the body of the valiant berenger wrapped in his own knightly banner which regained from the hands of the welsh now served its noble owner instead of a funeral pall the most gallant knights of the constables household for like other great nobles of that period he had formed it upon a scale which approached to that of royalty walked as mourners and supporters of the corpse which was borne upon lances and the constable of chester himself alone and fully armed excepting the head followed as chief mourner a chosen body of squires menatarms and pages of noble descent brought up the rear of the procession while their nakers and trumpets echoed back from time to time the melancholy song of the monks by replying in a note as lugubrious as their own  the course of pleasure was arrested and even that of sorrow was for a moment turned from her own griefs to witness the last honours bestowed on him who had been in life the father and guardian of his people  the mournful procession traversed slowly the plain which had been within a few hours the scene of such varied events and pausing before the outer gate of the barricades of the castle invited by a prolonged and solemn flourish the fortress to receive the remains of its late gallant defender the melancholy summons was answered by the warders hornthe drawbridge sunkthe portcullis roseand father aldrovand appeared in the middle of the gateway arrayed in his sacerdotal habit whilst a little way behind him stood the orphaned damsel in such weeds of mourning as time admitted supported by her attendant rose and followed by the females of the household  the constable of chester paused upon the threshold of the outer gate and pointing to the cross signed in white cloth upon his left shoulder with a lowly reverence resigned to his nephew damian the task of attending the remains of raymond berenger to the chapel within the castle the soldiers of hugo de lacy most of whom were bound by the same vow with himself also halted without the castle gate and remained under arms while the death peal of the chapel bell announced from within the progress of the procession  it winded on through those narrow entrances which were skilfully contrived to interrupt the progress of an enemy even should he succeed in forcing the outer gate and arrived at length in the great courtyard where most of the inhabitants of the fortress and those who under recent circumstances had taken refuge there were drawn up in order to look for the last time on their departed lord among these were mingled a few of the motley crowd from without whom curiosity or the expectation of a dole had brought to the castle gate and who by one argument or another had obtained from the warder permission to enter the interior  the body was here set down before the door of the chapel the ancient gothic front of which formed one side of the courtyard until certain prayers were recited by the priests in which the crowd around were supposed to join with becoming reverence  it was during this interval that a man whose peaked beard embroidered girdle and highcrowned hat of gray felt gave him the air of a lombard merchant addressed margery the nurse of eveline in a whispering tone and with a foreign accenti am a travelling merchant good sister and am come hither in quest of gaincan you tell me whether i can have any custom in this castle  you are come at an evil time sir strangeryou may yourself see that this is a place for mourning and not for merchandise  yet mourning times have their own commerce said the stranger approaching still closer to the side of margery and lowering his voice to a tone yet more confidential i have sable scarfs of persian silkblack bugles in which a princess might mourn for a deceased monarchcyprus such as the east hath seldom sent forth black cloth for mourning hangingsall that may express sorrow and reverence in fashion and attire and i know how to be grateful to those who help me to custom come bethink you good damesuch things must be hadi will sell as good ware and as cheap as another and a kirtle to yourself or at your pleasure a purse with five florins shall be the meed of your kindness  i prithee peace friend said margery and choose a better time for vaunting your waresyou neglect both place and season and if you be farther importunate i must speak to those who will show you the outward side of the castle gate i marvel the warders would admit pedlars upon a day such as thisthey would drive a gainful bargain by the bedside of their mother were she dying i trow so saying she turned scornfully from him  while thus angrily rejected on the one side the merchant felt his cloak receive an intelligent twitch upon the other and looking round upon the signal he saw a dame whose black kerchief was affectedly disposed so as to give an appearance of solemnity to a set of light laughing features which must have been captivating when young since they retained so many good points when at least forty years had passed over them she winked to the merchant touching at the same time her under lip with her forefinger to announce the propriety of silence and secrecy then gliding from the crowd retreated to a small recess formed by a projecting buttress of the chapel as if to avoid the pressure likely to take place at the moment when the bier should be lifted the merchant failed not to follow her example and was soon by her side when she did not give him the trouble of opening his affairs but commenced the conversation herself  i have heard what you said to our dame margerymannerly margery as i call herheard as much at least as led me to guess the rest for i have got an eye in my head i promise you  a pair of them my pretty dame and as bright as drops of dew in a may morning  oh you say so because i have been weeping said the scarlet hosed gillian for it was even herself who spoke and to be sure i have good cause for our lord was always my very good lord and would sometimes chuck me under the chin and call me buxom gillian of croydonnot that the good gentleman was ever uncivil for he would thrust a silver twopennies into my hand at the same time oh the friend that i have lostand i have had anger on his account tooi have seen old raoul as sour as vinegar and fit for no place but the kennel for a whole day about it but as i said to him it was not for the like of me to be affronting our master and a great baron about a chuck under the chin or a kiss or such like  no wonder you are so sorry for so kind a master dame said the merchant  no wonder indeed replied the dame with a sigh and then what is to become of usit is like my young mistress will go to her auntor she will marry one of these lacys that they talk so much ofor at any rate she will leave the castle and its like old raoul and i will be turned to grass with the lords old chargers the lord knows they may as well hang him up with the old hounds for he is both footless and fangless and fit for nothing on earth that i know of  your young mistress is that lady in the mourning mantle said the merchant who so nearly sunk down upon the body just now  in good troth is she sirand much cause she has to sink down i am sure she will be to seek for such another father  i see you are a most discerning woman gossip gillian answered the merchant and yonder youth that supported her is her bridegroom  much need she has for some one to support her said gillian and so have i for that matter for what can poor old rusty raoul do  but as to your young ladys marriage said the merchant  no one knows more than that such a thing was in treaty between our late lord and the great constable of chester that came today but just in time to prevent the welsh from cutting all our throats and doing the lord knoweth what mischief beside but there is a marriage talked of that is certainand most folk think it must be for this smoothcheeked boy damian as they call him for though the constable has gotten a beard which his nephew hath not it is something too grizzled for a bridegrooms chin besides he goes to the holy warsfittest place for all elderly warriorsi wish he would take raoul with himbut what is all this to what you were saying about your mourning wares even now it is a sad truth that my poor lord is gonebut what then welladay you know the good old saw    cloth must be wear   eat beef and drink beer   though the dead go to bier  and for your merchandising i am as like to help you with my good word as mannerly margery provided you bid fair for it since if the lady loves me not so much i can turn the steward round my finger  take this in part of your bargain pretty mistress gillian said the merchant and when my wains come up i will consider you amply if i get good sale by your favourable reportbut how shall i get into the castle again for i would wish to consult you being a sensible woman before i come in with my luggage  why answered the complaisant dame if our english be on guard you have only to ask for gillian and they will open the wicket to any single man at once for we english stick all together were it but to spite the normansbut if a norman be on duty you must ask for old raoul and say you come to speak of dogs and hawks for sale and i warrant you come to speech of me that way if the sentinel be a fleming you have but to say you are a merchant and he will let you in for the love of trade  the merchant repeated his thankful acknowledgment glided from her side and mixed among the spectators leaving her to congratulate herself on having gained a brace of florins by the indulgence of her natural talkative humour for which on other occasions she had sometimes dearly paid  the ceasing of the heavy toll of the castle bell now gave intimation that the noble raymond berenger had been laid in the vault with his fathers that part of the funeral attendants who had come from the host of de lacy now proceeded to the castle hall where they partook but with temperance of some refreshments which were offered as a deathmeal and presently after left the castle headed by young damian in the same slow and melancholy form in which they had entered the monks remained within the castle to sing repeated services for the soul of the deceased and for those of his faithful menatarms who had fallen around him and who had been so much mangled during and after the contest with the welsh that it was scarce possible to know one individual from another otherwise the body of dennis morolt would have obtained as his faith well deserved the honours of a separate funeral footnote the welsh a fierce and barbarous people were often accused of mangling the bodies of their slain antagonists every one must remember shakspeares account how    the noble mortimer   leading the men of herefordshire to fight   against the irregular and wild glendower   was by the rude hands of that welshman taken   and a thousand of his people butchered    upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse   such beastly shameless transformation   by these welshwomen done as may not be   without much shame retold or spoken of     chapter the eleventh     the funeral baked meats   did coldly furnish forth the marriage table       hamlet   the religious rites which followed the funeral of raymond berenger endured without interruption for the period of six days during which alms were distributed to the poor and relief administered at the expense of the lady eveline to all those who had suffered by the late inroad deathmeals as they were termed were also spread in honour of the deceased but the lady herself and most of her attendants observed a stern course of vigil discipline and fasts which appeared to the normans a more decorous manner of testifying their respect for the dead than the saxon and flemish custom of banqueting and drinking inordinately upon such occasions  meanwhile the constable de lacy retained a large body of his men encamped under the walls of the garde doloureuse for protection against some new irruption of the welsh while with the rest he took advantage of his victory and struck terror into the british by many wellconducted forays marked with ravages scarcely less hurtful than their own among the enemy the evils of discord were added to those of defeat and invasion for two distant relations of gwenwyn contended for the throne he had lately occupied and on this as on many other occasions the britons suffered as much from internal dissension as from the sword of the normans a worse politician and a less celebrated soldier than the sagacious and successful de lacy could not have failed under such circumstances to negotiate as he did an advantageous peace which while it deprived powys of a part of its frontier and the command of some important passes in which it was the constables purpose to build castles rendered the garde doloureuse more secure than formerly from any sudden attack on the part of their fiery and restless neighbours de lacys care also went to reestablishing those settlers who had fled from their possessions and putting the whole lordship which now descended upon an unprotected female into a state of defence as perfect as its situation on a hostile frontier could possibly permit  whilst thus anxiously provident in the affairs of the orphan of the garde doloureuse de lacy during the space we have mentioned sought not to disturb her filial grief by any personal intercourse his nephew indeed was despatched by times every morning to lay before her his uncles devoirs in the high flown language of the day and acquaint her with the steps which he had taken in her affairs as a meed due to his relatives high services damian was always admitted to see eveline on such occasions and returned charged with her grateful thanks and her implicit acquiescence in whatever the constable proposed for her consideration  but when the days of rigid mourning were elapsed the young de lacy stated on the part of his kinsman that his treaty with the welsh being concluded and all things in the district arranged as well as circumstances would permit the constable of chester now proposed to return into his own territory in order to resume his instant preparations for the holy land which the duty of chastising her enemies had for some days interrupted  and will not the noble constable before he departs from this place said eveline with a burst of gratitude which the occasion well merited receive the personal thanks of her that was ready to perish when he so valiantly came to her aid  it was even on that point that i was commissioned to speak replied damian but my noble kinsman feels diffident to propose to you that which he most earnestly desiresthe privilege of speaking to your own ear certain matters of high import and with which he judges it fit to intrust no third party  surely said the maiden blushing there can be nought beyond the bounds of maidenhood in my seeing the noble constable whenever such is his pleasure  but his vow replied damian binds my kinsman not to come beneath a roof until he sets sail for palestine and in order to meet him you must grace him so far as to visit his paviliona condescension which as a knight and norman noble he can scarcely ask of a damsel of high degree  and is that all said eveline who educated in a remote situation was a stranger to some of the nice points of etiquette which the damsels of the time observed in keeping their state towards the other sex shall i not she said go to render my thanks to my deliverer since he cannot come hither to receive them tell the noble hugo de lacy that next to my gratitude to heaven it is due to him and to his brave companions in arms i will come to his tent as to a holy shrine and could such homage please him i would come barefooted were the road strewed with flints and with thorns  my uncle will be equally honoured and delighted with your resolve said damian but it will be his study to save you all unnecessary trouble and with that view a pavilion shall be instantly planted before your castle gate which if it please you to grace it with your presence may be the place for the desired interview  eveline readily acquiesced in what was proposed as the expedient agreeable to the constable and recommended by damian but in the simplicity of her heart she saw no good reason why under the guardianship of the latter she should not instantly and without farther form have traversed the little familiar plain on which when a child she used to chase butterflies and gather kings cups and where of later years she was wont to exercise her palfrey on this wellknown plain being the only space and that of small extent which separated her from the camp of the constable  the youthful emissary with whose presence she had now become familiar retired to acquaint his kinsman and lord with the success of his commission and eveline experienced the first sensation of anxiety upon her own account which had agitated her bosom since the defeat and death of gwenwyn gave her permission to dedicate her thoughts exclusively to grief for the loss which she had sustained in the person of her noble father but now when that grief though not satiated was blunted by solitary indulgencenow that she was to appear before the person of whose fame she had heard so much of whose powerful protection she had received such recent proofs her mind insensibly turned upon the nature and consequences of that important interview she had seen hugo de lacy indeed at the great tournament at chester where his valour and skill were the theme of every tongue and she had received the homage which he rendered her beauty when he assigned to her the prize with all the gay flutterings of youthful vanity but of his person and figure she had no distinct idea excepting that he was a middlesized man dressed in peculiarly rich armour and that the countenance which looked out from under the shade of his raised visor seemed to her juvenile estimate very nearly as old as that of her father this person of whom she had such slight recollection had been the chosen instrument employed by her tutelar protectress in rescuing her from captivity and in avenging the loss of a father and she was bound by her vow to consider him as the arbiter of her fate if indeed he should deem it worth his while to become so she wearied her memory with vain efforts to recollect so much of his features as might give her some means of guessing at his disposition and her judgment toiled in conjecturing what line of conduct he was likely to pursue towards her  the great baron himself seemed to attach to their meeting a degree of consequence which was intimated by the formal preparations which he made for it eveline had imagined that he might have ridden to the gate of the castle in five minutes and that if a pavilion were actually necessary to the decorum of their interview a tent could have been transferred from his leaguer to the castle gate and pitched there in ten minutes more but it was plain that the constable considered much more form and ceremony as essential to their meeting for in about half an hour after damian de lacy had left the castle not fewer than twenty soldiers and artificers under the direction of a pursuivant whose tabard was decorated with the armorial bearings of the house of lacy were employed in erecting before the gate of the garde doloureuse one of those splendid pavilions which were employed at tournaments and other occasions of public state it was of purple silk valanced with gold embroidery having the chords of the same rich materials the doorway was formed by six lances the staves of which were plaited with silver and the blades composed of the same precious metal these were pitched into the ground by couples and crossed at the top so as to form a sort of succession of arches which were covered by drapery of seagreen silk forming a pleasing contrast with the purple and gold  the interior of the tent was declared by dame gillian and others whose curiosity induced them to visit it to be of a splendour agreeing with the outside there were oriental carpets and there were tapestries of ghent and bruges mingled in gay profusion while the top of the pavilion covered with skyblue silk was arranged so as to resemble the firmament and richly studded with a sun moon and stars composed of solid silver this gorgeous pavilion had been made for the use of the celebrated william of ypres who acquired such great wealth as general of the mercenaries of king stephen and was by him created earl of albemarle but the chance of war had assigned it to de lacy after one of the dreadful engagements so many of which occurred during the civil wars betwixt stephen and the empress maude or matilda the constable had never before been known to use it for although wealthy and powerful hugo de lacy was on most occasions plain and unostentatious which to those who knew him made his present conduct seem the more remarkable at the hour of noon he arrived nobly mounted at the gate of the castle and drawing up a small body of servants pages and equerries who attended him in their richest liveries placed himself at their head and directed his nephew to intimate to the lady of the garde doloureuse that the humblest of her servants awaited the honour of her presence at the castle gate  among the spectators who witnessed his arrival there were many who thought that some part of the state and splendour attached to his pavilion and his retinue had been better applied to set forth the person of the constable himself as his attire was simple even to meanness and his person by no means of such distinguished bearing as might altogether dispense with the advantages of dress and ornament the opinion became yet more prevalent when he descended from horseback until which time his masterly management of the noble animal he bestrode gave a dignity to his person and figure which he lost upon dismounting from his steel saddle in height the celebrated constable scarce attained the middle size and his limbs though strongly built and well knit were deficient in grace and ease of movement his legs were slightly curved outwards which gave him advantage as a horseman but showed unfavourably when he was upon foot he halted though very slightly in consequence of one of his legs having been broken by the fall of a charger and inartificially set by an inexperienced surgeon this also was a blemish in his deportment and though his broad shoulders sinewy arms and expanded chest betokened the strength which he often displayed it was strength of a clumsy and ungraceful character his language and gestures were those of one seldom used to converse with equals more seldom still with superiors short abrupt and decisive almost to the verge of sternness in the judgment of those who were habitually acquainted with the constable there was both dignity and kindness in his keen eye and expanded brow but such as saw him for the first time judged less favourably and pretended to discover a harsh and passionate expression although they allowed his countenance to have on the whole a bold and martial character his age was in reality not more than fiveandforty but the fatigues of war and of climate had added in appearance ten years to that period of time by far the plainest dressed man of his train he wore only a short norman mantle over the close dress of shamoisleather which almost always covered by his armour was in some places slightly soiled by its pressure a brown hat in which he wore a sprig of rosemary in memory of his vow served for his headgear his good sword and dagger hung at a belt made of sealskin  thus accoutred and at the head of a glittering and gilded band of retainers who watched his lightest glance the constable of chester awaited the arrival of the lady eveline berenger at the gate of her castle of garde doloureuse  the trumpets from within announced her presencethe bridge fell and led by damian de lacy in his gayest habit and followed by her train of females and menial or vassal attendants she came forth in her loveliness from under the massive and antique portal of her paternal fortress she was dressed without ornaments of any kind and in deep mourning weeds as best befitted her recent loss forming in this respect a strong contrast with the rich attire of her conductor whose costly dress gleamed with jewels and embroidery while their age and personal beauty made them in every other respect the fair counterpart of each other a circumstance which probably gave rise to the delighted murmur and buzz which passed through the bystanders on their appearance and which only respect for the deep mourning of eveline prevented from breaking out into shouts of applause  the instant that the fair foot of eveline had made a step beyond the palisades which formed the outward barrier of the castle the constable de lacy stepped forward to meet her and bending his right knee to the earth craved pardon for the discourtesy which his vow had imposed on him while he expressed his sense of the honour with which she now graced him as one for which his life devoted to her service would be an inadequate acknowledgment  the action and speech though both in consistence with the romantic gallantry of the times embarrassed eveline and the rather that this homage was so publicly rendered she entreated the constable to stand up and not to add to the confusion of one who was already sufficiently at a loss how to acquit herself of the heavy debt of gratitude which she owed him the constable arose accordingly after saluting her hand which she extended to him and prayed her since she was so far condescending to deign to enter the poor hut he had prepared for her shelter and to grant him the honour of the audience he had solicited eveline without farther answer than a bow yielded him her hand and desiring the rest of her train to remain where they were commanded the attendance of rose flammock  lady said the constable the matters of which i am compelled thus hastily to speak are of a nature the most private  this maiden replied eveline is my bowerwoman and acquainted with my most inward thoughts i beseech you to permit her presence at our conference  it were better otherwise said hugo de lacy with some embarrassment but your pleasure shall be obeyed  he led the lady eveline into the tent and entreated her to be seated on a large pile of cushions covered with rich venetian silk rose placed herself behind her mistress half kneeling upon the same cushions and watched the motions of the allaccomplished soldier and statesman whom the voice of fame lauded so loudly enjoying his embarrassment as a triumph of her sex and scarcely of opinion that his shamois doublet and square form accorded with the splendour of the scene or the almost angelic beauty of eveline the other actor therein  lady said the constable after some hesitation i would willingly say what it is my lot to tell you in such terms as ladies love to listen to and which surely your excellent beauty more especially deserves but i have been too long trained in camps and councils to express my meaning otherwise than simply and plainly  i shall the more easily understand you my lord said eveline trembling though she scarce knew why  my story then must be a blunt one something there passed between your honourable father and myself touching a union of our houseshe paused as if he wished or expected eveline to say something but as she was silent he proceeded i would to god that as he was at the beginning of this treaty it had pleased heaven he should have conducted and concluded it with his usual wisdom but what remedyhe has gone the path which we must all tread  your lordship said eveline has nobly avenged the death of your noble friend  i have but done my devoir lady as a good knight in defence of an endangered maidena lord marcher in protection of the frontierand a friend in avenging his friend but to the point our long and noble line draws near to a close of my remote kinsman randal lacy i will not speak for in him i see nothing that is good or hopeful nor have we been at one for many years my nephew damian gives hopeful promise to be a worthy branch of our ancient treebut he is scarce twenty years old and hath a long career of adventure and peril to encounter ere he can honourably propose to himself the duties of domestic privacy or matrimonial engagements his mother also is english some abatentent perhaps in the escutcheon of his arms yet had ten years more passed over him with the honours of chivalry i should have proposed damian de lacy for the happiness to which i at present myself aspire  youyou my lordit is impossible said eveline endeavouring at the same time to suppress all that could be offensive in the surprise which she could not help exhibiting  i do not wonder replied the constable calmlyfor the ice being now broken he resumed the natural steadiness of his manner and characterthat you express surprise at this daring proposal i have not perhaps the form that pleases a ladys eye and i have forgottenthat is if i ever knew themthe terms and phrases which please a ladys ear but noble eveline the lady of hugh de lacy will be one of the foremost among the matronage of england  it will the better become the individual to whom so high a dignity is offered said eveline to consider how far she is capable of discharging its duties  of that i fear nothing said de lacy she who hath been so excellent a daughter cannot be less estimable in every other relation in life  i do not find that confidence in myself my lord replied the embarrassed maiden with which you are so willing to load meand iforgive memust crave time for other inquiries as well as those which respect myself  your father noble lady had this union warmly at heart this scroll signed with his own hand will show it he bent his knee as he gave the paper the wife of de lacy will have as the daughter of raymond berenger merits the rank of a princess his widow the dowry of a queen  mock me not with your knee my lord while you plead to me the paternal commands which joined to other circumstancesshe paused and sighed deeplyleave me perhaps but little room for free will  imboldened by this answer de lacy who had hitherto remained on his knee rose gently and assuming a seat beside the lady eveline continued to press his suitnot indeed in the language of passion but of a plainspoken man eagerly urging a proposal on which his happiness depended the vision of the miraculous image was it may be supposed uppermost in the mind of eveline who tied down by the solemn vow she had made on that occasion felt herself constrained to return evasive answers where she might perhaps have given a direct negative had her own wishes alone been to decide her reply  you cannot she said expect from me my lord in this my so recent orphan state that i should come to a speedy determination upon an affair of such deep importance give me leisure of your nobleness for consideration with myselffor consultation with my friends  alas fair eveline said the baron do not be offended at my urgency i cannot long delay setting forward on a distant and perilous expedition and the short time left me for soliciting your favour must be an apology for my importunity  and is it in these circumstances noble de lacy that you would encumber yourself with family ties asked the maiden timidly  i am gods soldier said the constable and he in whose cause i fight in palestine will defend my wife in england  hear then my present answer my lord said eveline berenger rising from her seat tomorrow i proceed to the benedictine nunnery at gloucester where resides my honoured fathers sister who is abbess of that reverend house to her guidance i will commit myself in this matter  a fair and maidenly resolution answered de lacy who seemed on his part rather glad that the conference was abridged and as i trust not altogether unfavourable to the suit of your humble suppliant since the good lady abbess hath been long my honoured friend he then turned to rose who was about to attend her ladypretty maiden he said offering a chain of gold let this carcanet encircle thy neck and buy thy good will  my good will cannot be purchased my lord said rose putting back the gift which he proffered  your fair word then said the constable again pressing it upon her  fair words are easily bought said rose still rejecting the chain but they are seldom worth the purchasemoney  do you scorn my proffer damsel said de lacy it has graced the neck of a norman count  give it to a norman countess then my lord said the damsel i am plain rose flammock the weavers daughter i keep my good word to go with my good will and a latten chain will become me as well as beaten gold  peace rose said her lady you are over malapert to talk thus to the lord constableand you my lord she continued permit me now to depart since you are possessed of my answer to your present proposal i regret it had not been of some less delicate nature that by granting it at once and without delay i might have shown my sense of your services  the lady was handed forth by the constable of chester with the same ceremony which had been observed at their entrance and she returned to her own castle sad and anxious in mind for the event of this important conference she gathered closely round her the great mourning veil that the alteration of her countenance might not be observed and without pausing to speak even to father aldrovand she instantly withdrew to the privacy of her own bower     chapter the twelfth     now all ye ladies of fair scotland     and ladies of england that happy would prove   marry never for houses nor marry for land     nor marry for nothing but only love      family quarrels   when the lady eveline had retired into her own private chamber rose flammock followed her unbidden and proffered her assistance in removing the large veil which she had worn while she was abroad but the lady refused her permission saying you are forward with service maiden when it is not required of you  you are displeased with me lady said rose  and if i am i have cause replied eveline you know my difficultiesyou know what my duty demands yet instead of aiding me to make the sacrifice you render it more difficult  would i had influence to guide your path said rose you should find it a smooth oneay an honest and straight one to boot  how mean you maiden said eveline  i would have you answered rose recall the encouragementthe consent i may almost call it you have yielded to this proud baron he is too great to be loved himselftoo haughty to love you as you deserve if you wed him you wed gilded misery and it may be dishonour as well as discontent  remember damsel answered eveline berenger his services towards us  his services answered rose he ventured his life for us indeed but so did every soldier in his host and am i bound to wed any ruffling blade among them because he fought when the trumpet sounded i wonder what is the meaning of their devoir as they call it when it shames them not to claim the highest reward woman can bestow merely for discharging the duty of a gentleman by a distressed creature a gentleman said ithe coarsest boor in flanders would hardly expect thanks for doing the duty of a man by women in such a case  but my fathers wishes said the young lady  they had reference without doubt to the inclination of your fathers daughter answered the attendant i will not do my late noble lordmay god assoilzie himthe injustice to suppose he would have urged aught in this matter which squared not with your free choice  then my vowmy fatal vow as i had well nigh called it said eveline may heaven forgive me my ingratitude to my patroness  even this shakes me not said rose i will never believe our lady of mercy would exact such a penalty for her protection as to desire me to wed the man i could not love she smiled you say upon your prayer golay at her feet these difficulties which oppress you and see if she will not smile again or seek a dispensation from your vowseek it at the expense of the half of your estateseek it at the expense of your whole property go a pilgrimage barefooted to romedo any thing but give your hand where you cannot give your heart  you speak warmly rose said eveline still sighing as she spoke  alas my sweet lady i have cause have i not seen a household where love was notwhere although there was worth and good will and enough of the means of life all was imbittered by regrets which were not only vain but criminal  yet methinks rose a sense of what is due to ourselves and to others may if listened to guide and comfort us under such feelings even as thou hast described  it will save us from sin lady but not from sorrow answered rose and wherefore should we with our eyes open rush into circumstances where duty must war with inclination why row against wind and tide when you may as easily take advantage of the breeze  because the voyage of my life lies where winds and currents oppose me answered eveline it is my fate rose  not unless you make it such by choice answered rose oh could you but have seen the pale cheek sunken eye and dejected bearing of my poor motheri have said too much  it was then your mother said her young lady of whose unhappy wedlock you have spoken  it wasit was said rose bursting into tears i have exposed my own shame to save you from sorrow unhappy she was though most guiltlessso unhappy that the breach of the dike and the inundation in which she perished were but for my sake to her welcome as night to the weary labourer she had a heart like yours formed to love and be loved and it would be doing honour to yonder proud baron to say he had such worth as my fathers yet was she most unhappy oh my sweet lady be warned and break off this illomened match  eveline returned the pressure with which the affectionate girl as she clung to her hand enforced her wellmeant advice and then muttered with a profound sighrose it is too late  nevernever said rose looking eagerly round the room where are those writing materialslet me bring father aldrovand and instruct him of your pleasureor stay the good father hath himself an eye on the splendours of the world which he thinks he has abandonedhe will be no safe secretaryi will go myself to the lord constableme his rank cannot dazzle or his wealth bribe or his power overawe i will tell him he doth no knightly part towards you to press his contract with your father in such an hour of helpless sorrowno pious part in delaying the execution of his vows for the purpose of marrying or giving in marriageno honest part to press himself on a maiden whose heart has not decided in his favourno wise part to marry one whom he must presently abandon either to solitude or to the dangers of a profligate court  you have not courage for such an embassy rose said her mistress sadly smiling through her tears at her youthful attendants zeal  not courage for itand wherefore nottry me answered the flemish maiden in return i am neither saracen nor welshmanhis lance and sword scare me not i follow not his bannerhis voice of command concerns me not i could with your leave boldly tell him he is a selfish man veiling with fair and honourable pretexts his pursuit of objects which concern his own pride and gratification and founding high claims on having rendered the services which common humanity demanded and all for what forsooth the great de lacy must have an heir to his noble house and his fair nephew is not good enough to be his representative because his mother was of anglosaxon strain and the real heir must be pure unmixed norman and for this lady eveline berenger in the first bloom of youth must be wedded to a man who might be her father and who after leaving her unprotected for years will return in such guise as might beseem her grandfather  since he is thus scrupulous concerning purity of lineage said eveline perhaps he may call to mind what so good a herald as he is cannot fail to knowthat i am of saxon strain by my fathers mother  oh replied rose he will forgive that blot in the heiress of the garde doloureuse  fie rose answered her mistress thou dost him wrong in taxing him with avarice  perhaps so answered rose but he is undeniably ambitious and avarice i have heard is ambitions bastard brother though ambition be sometimes ashamed of the relationship  you speak too boldly damsel said eveline and while i acknowledge your affection it becomes me to check your mode of expression  nay take that tone and i have done said roseto eveline whom i love and who loves me i can speak freelybut to the lady of the garde doloureuse the proud norman damsel which when you choose to be you can be i can curtsy as low as my station demands and speak as little truth as she cares to hear  thou art a wild but a kind girl said eveline no one who did not know thee would think that soft and childish exterior covered such a soul of fire thy mother must indeed have been the being of feeling and passion you paint her for thy fathernay nay never arm in his defence until he be attackedi only meant to say that his solid sense and sound judgment are his most distinguished qualities  and i would you would avail yourself of them lady said rose  in fitting things i will but he were rather an unmeet counsellor in that which we now treat of said eveline  you mistake him answered rose flammock and underrate his value sound judgment is like to the graduated measuringwand which though usually applied only to coarser cloths will give with equal truth the dimensions of indian silk or of cloth of gold  wellwellthis affair presses not instantly at least said the young lady leave me now rose and send gillian the tirewoman hitheri have directions to give about the packing and removal of my wardrobe  that gillian the tirewoman hath been a mighty favourite of late said rose time was when it was otherwise  i like her manners as little as thou dost said eveline but she is old raouls wifeshe was a sort of half favourite with my dear fatherwho like other men was perhaps taken by that very freedom which we think unseemly in persons of our sex and then there is no other woman in the castle that hath such skill in empacketing clothes without the risk of their being injured  that last reason alone said rose smiling is i admit an irresistible pretension to favour and dame gillian shall presently attend youbut take my advice ladykeep her to her bales and her mails and let her not prate to you on what concerns her not  so saying rose left the apartment and her young lady looked after her in silencethen murmured to herselfrose loves me truly but she would willingly be more of the mistress than the maiden and then she is somewhat jealous of every other person that approaches meit is strange that i have not seen damian de lacy since my interview with the constable he anticipates i suppose the chance of his finding in me a severe aunt  but the domestics who crowded for orders with reference to her removal early on the morrow began now to divert the current of their ladys thoughts from the consideration of her own particular situation which as the prospect presented nothing pleasant with the elastic spirit of youth she willingly postponed till farther leisure     chapter the thirteenth     too much rest is rust     theres ever cheer in changing   we tyne by too much trust   so well be up and ranging      old song   early on the subsequent morning a gallant company saddened indeed by the deep mourning which their principals wore left the welldefended castle of the garde doloureuse which had been so lately the scene of such remarkable events  the sun was just beginning to exhale the heavy dews which had fallen during the night and to disperse the thin gray mist which eddied around towers and battlements when wilkin flammock with six crossbowmen on horseback and as many spearmen on foot sallied forth from under the gothic gateway and crossed the sounding drawbridge after this advanced guard came four household servants well mounted and after them as many inferior female attendants all in mourning then rode forth the young lady eveline herself occupying the centre of the little procession and her long black robes formed a striking contrast to the colour of her milkwhite palfrey beside her on a spanish jennet the gift of her affectionate fatherwho had procured it at a high rate and who would have given half his substance to gratify his daughtersat the girlish form of rose flammock who had so much of juvenile shyness in her manner so much of feeling and of judgment in her thoughts and actions dame margery followed mixed in the party escorted by father aldrovand whose company she chiefly frequented for margery affected a little the character of the devotee and her influence in the family as having been evelines nurse was so great as to render her no improper companion for the chaplain when her lady did not require her attendance on her own person then came old raoul the huntsman his wife and two or three other officers of raymond berengers household the steward with his golden chain velvet cassock and white wand bringing up the rear which was closed by a small band of archers and four menatarms the guards and indeed the greater part of the attendants were only designed to give the necessary degree of honour to the young ladys movements by accompanying her a short space from the castle where they were met by the constable of chester who with a retinue of thirty lances proposed himself to escort eveline as far as gloucester the place of her destination under his protection no danger was to be apprehended even if the severe defeat so lately sustained by the welsh had not of itself been likely to prevent any attempt on the part of those hostile mountaineers to disturb the safety of the marches for some time to come in pursuance of this arrangement which permitted the armed part of evelines retinue to return for the protection of the castle and the restoration of order in the district around the constable awaited her at the fatal bridge at the head of the gallant band of selected horsemen whom he had ordered to attend upon him the parties halted as if to salute each other but the constable observing that eveline drew her veil more closely around her and recollecting the loss she had so lately sustained on that luckless spot had the judgment to confine his greeting to a mute reverence so low that the lofty plume which he wore for he was now in complete armour mingled with the flowing mane of his gallant horse wilkin flammock next halted to ask the lady if she had any farther commands  none good wilkin said eveline but to be as ever true and watchful  the properties of a good mastiff said flammock some rude sagacity and a stout hand instead of a sharp case of teeth are all that i can claim to be added to themi will do my bestfare thee well roschen thou art going among strangersforget not the qualities which made thee loved at home the saints bless thee farewell  the steward next approached to take his leave but in doing so had nearly met with a fatal accident it had been the pleasure of raoul who was in his own disposition crossgrained and in person rheumatic to accommodate himself with an old arab horse which had been kept for the sake of the breed as lean and almost as lame as himself and with a temper as vicious as that of a fiend betwixt the rider and the horse was a constant misunderstanding testified on raouls part by oaths rough checks with the curb and severe digging with the spurs which mahound so paganishly was the horse named answered by plunging bounding and endeavouring by all expedients to unseat his rider as well as striking and lashing out furiously at whatever else approached him it was thought by many of the household that raoul preferred this vicious crosstempered animal upon all occasions when he travelled in company with his wife in order to take advantage by the chance that amongst the various kicks plunges gambades lashings out and other eccentricities of mahound his heels might come in contact with dame gillians ribs and now when as the important steward spurred up his palfrey to kiss his young ladys hand and to take his leave it seemed to the bystanders as if raoul so managed his bridle and spur that mahound jerked out his hoofs at the same moment one of which coming in contact with the stewards thigh would have splintered it like a rotten reed had the parties been a couple of inches nearer to each other as it was the steward sustained considerable damage and they that observed the grin upon raouls vinegar countenance entertained little doubt that mahounds heels then and there avenged certain nods and winks and wreathed smiles which had passed betwixt the goldchained functionary and the coquettish tirewoman since the party left the castle  this incident abridged the painful solemnity of parting betwixt the lady eveline and her dependents and lessened at the same time the formality of her meeting with the constable and as it were resigning herself to his protection  hugo de lacy having commanded six of his menatarms to proceed as an advancedguard remained himself to see the steward properly deposited on a litter and then with the rest of his followers marched in military fashion about one hundred yards in the rear of lady eveline and her retinue judiciously forbearing to present himself to her society while she was engaged in the orisons which the place where they met naturally suggested and waiting patiently until the elasticity of youthful temper should require some diversion of the gloomy thoughts which the scene inspired  guided by this policy the constable did not approach the ladies until the advance of the morning rendered it politeness to remind them that a pleasant spot for breaking their fast occurred in the neighbourhood where he had ventured to make some preparations for rest and refreshment immediately after the lady eveline had intimated her acceptance of this courtesy they came in sight of the spot he alluded to marked by an ancient oak which spreading its broad branches far and wide reminded the traveller of that of mamre under which celestial beings accepted the hospitality of the patriarch across two of these huge projecting arms was flung a piece of rosecoloured sarsanet as a canopy to keep off the morning beams which were already rising high cushions of silk interchanged with others covered with the furs of animals of the chase were arranged round a repast which a norman cook had done his utmost to distinguish by the superior delicacy of his art from the gross meals of the saxons and the penurious simplicity of the welsh tables a fountain which bubbled from under a large mossy stone at some distance refreshed the air with its sound and the taste with its liquid crystal while at the same time it formed a cistern for cooling two or three flasks of gascon wine and hippocras which were at that time the necessary accompaniments of the morning meal  when eveline with rose the confessor and at some farther distance her faithful nurse was seated at this silvan banquet the leaves rustling to a gentle breeze the water bubbling in the background the birds twittering around while the halfheard sounds of conversation and laughter at a distance announced that their guard was in the vicinity she could not avoid making the constable some natural compliment on his happy selection of a place of repose  you do me more than justice replied the baron the spot was selected by my nephew who hath a fancy like a minstrel myself am but slow in imagining such devices  rose looked full at her mistress as if she endeavoured to look into her very inmost soul but eveline answered with the utmost simplicityand wherefore hath not the noble damian waited to join us at the entertainment which he hath directed  he prefers riding onward said the baron with some light horsemen for notwithstanding there are now no welsh knaves stirring yet the marches are never free from robbers and outlaws and though there is nothing to fear for a band like ours yet you should not be alarmed even by the approach of danger  i have indeed seen but too much of it lately said eveline and relapsed into the melancholy mood from which the novelty of the scene had for a moment awakened her  meanwhile the constable removing with the assistance of his squire his mailed hood and its steel crest as well as his gauntlets remained in his flexible coat of mail composed entirely of rings of steel curiously interwoven his hands bare and his brows covered with a velvet bonnet of a peculiar fashion appropriated to the use of knights and called a mortier which permitted him both to converse and to eat more easily than when he wore the full defensive armour his discourse was plain sensible and manly and turning upon the state of the country and the precautions to be observed for governing and defending so disorderly a frontier it became gradually interesting to eveline one of whose warmest wishes was to be the protectress of her fathers vassals de lacy on his part seemed much pleased for young as eveline was her questions showed intelligence and her mode of answering both apprehension and docility in short familiarity was so far established betwixt them that in the nest stage of their journey the constable seemed to think his appropriate place was at the lady evelines bridlerein and although she certainly did not countenance his attendance yet neither did she seem willing to discourage it himself no ardent lover although captivated both by the beauty and the amiable qualities of the fair orphan de lacy was satisfied with being endured as a companion and made no efforts to improve the opportunity which this familiarity afforded him by recurring to any of the topics of the preceding day  a halt was made at noon in a small village where the same purveyor had made preparations for their accommodation and particularly for that of the lady eveline but something to her surprise he himself remained invisible the conversation of the constable of chester was doubtless in the highest degree instructive but at evelines years a maiden might be excused for wishing some addition to the society in the person of a younger and less serious attendant and when she recollected the regularity with which damian lacy had hitherto made his respects to her she rather wondered at his continued absence but her reflection went no deeper than the passing thought of one who was not quite so much delighted with her present company as not to believe it capable of an agreeable addition she was lending a patient ear to the account which the constable gave her of the descent and pedigree of a gallant knight of the distinguished family of herbert at whose castle he proposed to repose during the night when one of the retinue announced a messenger from the lady of baldringham  my honoured fathers aunt said eveline arising to testify that respect for age and relationship which the manners of the time required  i knew not said the constable that my gallant friend had such a relative  she was my grandmothers sister answered eveline a noble saxon lady but she disliked the match formed with a norman house and never saw her sister after the period of her marriage  she broke off as the messenger who had the appearance of the steward of a person of consequence entered the presence and bending his knee reverently delivered a letter which being examined by father aldrovand was found to contain the following invitation expressed not in french then the general language of communication amongst the gentry but in the old saxon language modified as it now was by some intermixture of french  if the granddaughter of aelfried of baldringham hath so much of the old saxon strain as to desire to see an ancient relation who still dwells in the house of her forefathers and lives after their manner she is thus invited to repose for the night in the dwelling of ermengarde of baldringham  your pleasure will be doubtless to decline the present hospitality said the constable de lacy the noble herbert expects us and has made great preparation  your presence my lord said eveline will more than console him for my absence it is fitting and proper that i should meet my aunts advances to reconciliation since she has condescended to make them  de lacys brow was slightly clouded for seldom had he met with anything approaching to contradiction of his pleasure i pray you to reflect lady eveline he said that your aunts house is probably defenceless or at least very imperfectly guardedwould it not be your pleasure that i should continue my dutiful attendance  of that my lord mine aunt can in her own house be the sole judge and methinks as she has not deemed it necessary to request the honour of your lordships company it were unbecoming in me to permit you to take the trouble of attendanceyou have already had but too much on my account  but for the sake of your own safety madam said de lacy unwilling to leave his charge  my safety my lord cannot be endangered in the house of so near a relative whatever precautions she may take on her own behalf will doubtless be amply sufficient for mine  i hope it will be found so said de lacy and i will at least add to them the security of a patrol around the castle during your abode in it he stopped and then proceeded with some hesitation to express his hope that eveline now about to visit a kinswoman whose prejudices against the norman race were generally known would be on her guard against what she might hear upon that subject  eveline answered with dignity that the daughter of raymond berenger was unlikely to listen to any opinions which would affect the dignity of that good knights nation and descent and with this assurance the constable finding it impossible to obtain any which had more special reference to himself and his suit was compelled to remain satisfied he recollected also that the castle of herbert was within two miles of the habitation of the lady of baldringham and that his separation from eveline was but for one night yet a sense of the difference betwixt their years and perhaps of his own deficiency in those lighter qualifications by which the female heart is supposed to be most frequently won rendered even this temporary absence matter of anxious thought and apprehension so that during their afternoon journey he rode in silence by evelines side rather meditating what might chance to morrow than endeavouring to avail himself of present opportunity in this unsocial manner they travelled on until the point was reached where they were to separate for the evening  this was an elevated spot from which they could see on the right hand the castle of amelot herbert rising high upon an eminence with all its gothic pinnacles and turrets and on the left low embowered amongst oaken woods the rude and lonely dwelling in which the lady of baldringham still maintained the customs of the anglosaxons and looked with contempt and hatred on all innovations that had been introduced since the battle of hastings  here the constable de lacy having charged a part of his men to attend the lady eveline to the house of her relation and to keep watch around it with the utmost vigilance but at such a distance as might not give offence or inconvenience to the family kissed her hand and took a reluctant leave eveline proceeded onwards by a path so little trodden as to show the solitary condition of the mansion to which it led large kine of an uncommon and valuable breed were feeding in the rich pastures around and now and then fallow deer which appeared to have lost the shyness of their nature tripped across the glades of the woodland or stood and lay in small groups under some great oak the transient pleasure which such a scene of rural quiet was calculated to afford changed to more serious feelings when a sudden turn brought her at once in front of the mansionhouse of which she had seen nothing since she first beheld it from the point where she parted with the constable and which she had more than one reason for regarding with some apprehension  the house for it could not be termed a castle was only two stories high low and massively built with doors and windows forming the heavy round arch which is usually called saxonthe walls were mantled with various creeping plants which had crept along them undisturbedgrass grew up to the very threshold at which hung a buffalos horn suspended by a brass chain a massive door of black oak closed a gate which much resembled the ancient entrance to a ruined sepulchre and not a soul appeared to acknowledge or greet their arrival  were i you my lady eveline said the officious dame gillian i would turn bridle yet for this old dungeon seems little likely to afford food or shelter to christian folk  eveline imposed silence on her indiscreet attendant though herself exchanging a look with rose which confessed something like timidity as she commanded raoul to blow the horn at the gate i have heard she said that my aunt loves the ancient customs so well that she is loath to admit into her halls any thing younger than the time of edward the confessor  raoul in the meantime cursing the rude instrument which baffled his skill in sounding a regular call and gave voice only to a tremulous and discordant roar which seemed to shake the old walls thick as they were repeated his summons three times before they obtained admittance on the third sounding the gate opened and a numerous retinue of servants of both sexes appeared in the dark and narrow hall at the upper end of which a great fire of wood was sending its furnaceblast up an antique chimney whose front as extensive as that of a modern kitchen was carved over with ornaments of massive stone and garnished on the top with a long range of niches from each of which frowned the image of some saxon saint whose barbarous name was scarce to be found in the romish calendar  the same officer who had brought the invitation from his lady to eveline now stepped forward as she supposed to assist her from her palfrey but it was in reality to lead it by the bridlerein into the paved hall itself and up to a raised platform or dais at the upper end of which she was at length permitted to dismount two matrons of advanced years and four young women of gentle birth educated by the bounty of ermengarde attended with reverence the arrival of her kinswoman eveline would have inquired of them for her grandaunt but the matrons with much respect laid their fingers on their mouths as if to enjoin her silence a gesture which united to the singularity of her reception in other respects still farther excited her curiosity to see her venerable relative  it was soon gratified for through a pair of folding doors which opened not far from the platform on which she stood she was ushered into a large low apartment hung with arras at the upper end of which under a species of canopy was seated the ancient lady of baldringham fourscore years had not quenched the brightness of her eyes or bent an inch of her stately height her gray hair was still so profuse as to form a tier combined as it was with a chaplet of ivy leaves her long darkcoloured gown fell in ample folds and the broidered girdle which gathered it around her was fastened by a buckle of gold studded with precious stones which were worth an earls ransom her features which had once been beautiful or rather majestic bore still though faded and wrinkled an air of melancholy and stern grandeur that assorted well with her garb and deportment she had a staff of ebony in her hand at her feet rested a large aged wolfdog who pricked his ears and bristled up his neck as the step of a stranger a sound so seldom heard in those halls approached the chair in which his aged mistress sat motionless  peace thryme said the venerable dame and thou daughter of the house of baldringham approach and fear not their ancient servant  the hound sunk down to his couchant posture when she spoke and excepting the red glare of his eyes might have seemed a hieroglyphical emblem lying at the feet of some ancient priestess of woden or freya so strongly did the appearance of ermengarde with her rod and her chaplet correspond with the ideas of the days of paganism yet he who had thus deemed of her would have done therein much injustice to a venerable christian matron who had given many a hide of land to holy church in honour of god and saint dunstan  ermengardes reception of eveline was of the same antiquated and formal cast with her mansion and her exterior she did not at first arise from her seat when the noble maiden approached her nor did she even admit her to the salute which she advanced to offer but laying her hand on evelines arm stopped her as she advanced and perused her countenance with an earnest and unsparing eye of minute observation  berwine she said to the most favoured of the two attendants our niece hath the skin and eyes of the saxon hue but the hue of her eyebrows and hair is from the foreigner and alienthou art neverthelesswelcome to my house maiden she added addressing eveline especially if thou canst bear to hear that thou art not absolutely a perfect creature as doubtless these flatterers around thee have taught thee to believe  so saying she at length arose and saluted her niece with a kiss on the forehead she released her not however from her grasp but proceeded to give the attention to her garments which she had hitherto bestowed upon her features  saint dunstan keep us from vanity she said and so this is the new guiseand modest maidens wear such tunics as these showing the shape of their persons as plain as if saint mary defend us they were altogether without garments and see berwine these gauds on the neck and that neck itself uncovered as low as the shoulderthese be the guises which strangers have brought into merry england and this pouch like a players placket hath but little to do with housewifery i wot and that dagger too like a gleemans wife that rides a mumming in masculine appareldost thou ever go to the wars maiden that thou wearest steel at thy girdle  eveline equally surprised and disobliged by the depreciating catalogue of her apparel replied to the last question with some spiritthe mode may have altered madam but i only wear such garments as are now worn by those of my age and condition for the poniard may it please you it is not many days since i regarded it as the last resource betwixt me and dishonour  the maiden speaks well and boldly berwine said dame ermengarde and in truth pass we but over some of these vain fripperies is attired in a comely fashion thy father i hear fell knightlike in the field of battle  he did so answered eveline her eyes filling with tears at the recollection of her recent loss  i never saw him continued dame ermengarde he carried the old norman scorn towards the saxon stock whom they wed but for what they can make by them as the bramble clings to the elmnay never seek to vindicate him she continued observing that eveline was about to speak i have known the norman spirit for many a year ere thou wert born  at this moment the steward appeared in the chamber and after a long genuflection asked his ladys pleasure concerning the guard of norman soldiers who remained without the mansion  norman soldiers so near the house of baldringham said the old lady fiercely who brings them hither and for what purpose  they came as i think said the sewer to wait on and guard this gracious young lady  what my daughter said ermengarde in a tone of melancholy reproach darest thou not trust thyself unguarded for one night in the castle of thy forefathers  god forbid else said eveline but these men are not mine nor under my authority they are part of the train of the constable de lacy who left them to watch around the castle thinking there might be danger from robbers  robbers said ermengarde have never harmed the house of baldringham since a norman robber stole from it its best treasure in the person of thy grandmotherand so poor bird thou art already captiveunhappy flutterer but it is thy lot and wherefore should i wonder or repine when was there fair maiden with a wealthy dower but she was ere maturity destined to be the slave of some of those petty kings who allow us to call nothing ours that their passions can covet welli cannot aid theei am but a poor and neglected woman feeble both from sex and ageand to which of these de lacys art thou the destined household drudge  a question so asked and by one whose prejudices were of such a determined character was not likely to draw from eveline any confession of the real circumstances in which she was placed since it was but too plain her saxon relation could have afforded her neither sound counsel nor useful assistance she replied therefore briefly that as the lacys and the normans in general were unwelcome to her kinswoman she would entreat of the commander of the patrol to withdraw it from the neighbourhood of baldringham  not so my niece said the old lady as we cannot escape the norman neighbourhood or get beyond the sound of their curfew it signifies not whether they be near our walls or more far off so that they enter them not and berwine bid hundwolf drench the normans with liquor and gorge them with foodthe food of the best and liquor of the strongest let them not say the old saxon hag is churlish of her hospitality broach a piece of wine for i warrant their gentle stomachs brook no ale  berwine her huge bunch of keys jangling at her girdle withdrew to give the necessary directions and presently returned meanwhile ermengarde proceeded to question her niece more closely is it that thou wilt not or canst not tell me to which of the de lacys thou art to be bondswomanto the overweening constable who sheathed in impenetrable armour and mounted on a swift and strong horse as invulnerable as himself takes pride that he rides down and stabs at his ease and with perfect safety the naked welshmenor is it to his nephew the beardless damianor must thy possessions go to mend a breach in the fortunes of that other cousin randal lacy the decayed reveller who they say can no longer ruffle it among the debauched crusaders for want of means  my honoured aunt replied eveline naturally displeased with this discourse to none of the lacys and i trust to none other saxon or norman will your kinswoman become a household drudge  there was before the death of my honoured father some treaty betwixt him and the constable on which account i cannot at present decline his attendance but what may be the issue of it fate must determine  but i can show thee niece how the balance of fate inclines said ermengarde in a low and mysterious voice those united with us by blood have in some sort the privilege of looking forward beyond the points of present time and seeing in their very bud the thorns or flowers which are one day to encircle their head  for my own sake noble kinswoman answered eveline i would decline such foreknowledge even were it possible to acquire it without transgressing the rules of the church could i have foreseen what has befallen me within these last unhappy days i had lost the enjoyment of every happy moment before that time  nevertheless daughter said the lady of baldringham thou like others of thy race must within this house conform to the rule of passing one night within the chamber of the redfinger berwine see that it be prepared for my nieces reception  iihave heard speak of that chamber gracious aunt said eveline timidly and if it may consist with your good pleasure i would not now choose to pass the night there my health has suffered by my late perils and fatigues and with your goodwill i will delay to another time the usage which i have heard is peculiar to the daughters of the house of baldringham  and which notwithstanding you would willingly avoid said the old saxon lady bending her brows angrily has not such disobedience cost your house enough already  indeed honoured and gracious lady said berwine unable to forbear interference though well knowing the obstinacy of her patroness that chamber is in disrepair and cannot easily on a sudden be made fit for the lady eveline and the noble damsel looks so pale and hath lately suffered so much that might i have the permission to advise this were better delayed  thou art a fool berwine said the old lady sternly thinkest thou i will bring anger and misfortune on my house by suffering this girl to leave it without rendering the usual homage to the redfinger go tolet the room be made readysmall preparation may serve if she cherish not the norman nicety about bed and lodging do not reply but do as i command theeand you evelineare you so far degenerated from the brave spirit of your ancestry that you dare not pass a few hours in an ancient apartment  you are my hostess gracious madam said eveline and must assign my apartment where you judge propermy courage is such as innocence and some pride of blood and birth have given me it has been of late severely tried but since such is your pleasure and the custom of your house my heart is yet strong enough to encounter what you propose to subject me to  she paused here in displeasure for she resented in some measure her aunts conduct as unkind and inhospitable and yet when she reflected upon the foundation of the legend of the chamber to which she was consigned she could not but regard the lady of baldringham as having considerable reason for her conduct according to the traditions of the family and the belief of the times in which eveline herself was devout     chapter the fourteenth     sometimes methinks i hear the groans of ghosts   then hollow sounds and lamentable screams   then like a dying echo from afar   my mothers voice that cries wed not almeyda   forewanvd almeyda marriage is thy crime   don sebastian   the evening at baldringham would have seemed of portentous and unendurable length had it not been that apprehended danger makes times pass quickly betwixt us and the dreaded hour and that if eveline felt little interested or amused by the conversation of her aunt and berwine which turned upon the long deduction of their ancestors from the warlike horsa and the feats of saxon champions and the miracles of saxon monks she was still better pleased to listen to these legends than to anticipate her retreat to the destined and dreaded apartment where she was to pass the night there lacked not however such amusement as the house of baldringham could afford to pass away the evening blessed by a grave old saxon monk the chaplain of the house a sumptuous entertainment which might have sufficed twenty hungry men was served up before ermengarde and her niece whose sole assistants beside the reverend man were berwine and rose flammock eveline was the less inclined to do justice to this excess of hospitality that the dishes were all of the gross and substantial nature which the saxons admired but which contrasted disadvantageously with the refined and delicate cookery of the normans as did the moderate cup of light and highflavoured gascon wine tempered with more than half its quantity of the purest water with the mighty ale the highspiced pigment and hippocras and the other potent liquors which one after another were in vain proffered for her acceptance by the steward hundwolf in honour of the hospitality of baldringham  neither were the stated amusements of evening more congenial to evelines taste than the profusion of her aunts solid refection when the boards and tresses on which the viands had been served were withdrawn from the apartment the menials under direction of the steward proceeded to light several long waxen torches one of which was graduated for the purpose of marking the passing time and dividing it into portions these were announced by means of brazen balls suspended by threads from the torch the spaces betwixt them being calculated to occupy a certain time in burning so that when the flame reached the thread and the balls fell each in succession into a brazen basin placed for its reception the office of a modern clock was in some degree discharged by this light the party was arranged for the evening  the ancient ermengardes lofty and ample chair was removed according to ancient custom from the middle of the apartment to the warmest side of a large grate filled with charcoal and her guest was placed on her right as the seat of honour berwine then arranged in due order the females of the household and having seen that each was engaged with her own proper task sat herself down to ply the spindle and distaff the men in a more remote circle betook themselves to the repairing of their implements of husbandry or new furbishing weapons of the chase under the direction of the steward hundwolf for the amusement of the family thus assembled an old gleeman sung to a harp which had but four strings a long and apparently interminable legend upon some religious subject which was rendered almost unintelligible to eveline by the extreme and complicated affectation of the poet who in order to indulge in the alliteration which was accounted one great ornament of saxon poetry had sacrificed sense to sound and used words in the most forced and remote sense provided they could be compelled into his service there was also all the obscurity arising from elision and from the most extravagant and hyperbolical epithets  eveline though well acquainted with the saxon language soon left off listening to the singer to reflect for a moment on the gay fabliaux and imaginative lais of the norman minstrels and then to anticipate with anxious apprehension what nature of visitation she might be exposed to in the mysterious chamber in which she was doomed to pass the night  the hour of parting at length approached at half an hour before midnight a period ascertained by the consumption of the huge waxen torch the ball which was secured to it fell clanging into the brazen basin placed beneath and announced to all the hour of rest the old gleeman paused in his song instantaneously and in the middle of a stanza and the household were all on foot at the signal some retiring to their own apartments others lighting torches or bearing lamps to conduct the visitors to their places of repose among these last was a bevy of bowerwomen to whom the duty was assigned of conveying the lady eveline to her chamber for the night her aunt took a solemn leave of her crossed her forehead kissed it and whispered in her ear be courageous and be fortunate  may not my bowermaiden rose flammock or my tirewoman dame gillian raouls wife remain in the apartment with me for this night said eveline  flammockraoul repeated ermengarde angrily is thy household thus made up the flemings are the cold palsy to britain the normans the burning fever  and the poor welsh will add said rose whose resentment began to surpass her awe for the ancient saxon dame that the anglo saxons were the original disease and resemble a wasting pestilence  thou art too bold sweetheart said the lady ermengarde looking at the flemish maiden from under her dark brows and yet there is wit in thy words saxon dane and norman have rolled like successive billows over the land each having strength to subdue what they lacked wisdom to keep when shall it be otherwise  when saxon and briton and norman and fleming answered rose boldly shall learn to call themselves by one name and think themselves alike children of the land they were born in  ha exclaimed the lady of baldringham in the tone of one half surprised halfpleased then turning to her relation she said there are words and wit in this maiden see that she use but do not abuse them  she is as kind and faithful as she is prompt and readywitted said eveline i pray you dearest aunt let me use her company for this night  it may not beit were dangerous to both alone you must learn your destiny as have all the females of our race excepting your grandmother and what have been the consequences of her neglecting the rules of our house lo her descendant stands before me an orphan in the very bloom of youth  i will go then said eveline with a sigh of resignation and it shall never be said i incurred future wo to shun present terror  your attendants said the lady ermengarde may occupy the anteroom and be almost within your call berwine will show you the apartmenti cannot for we thou knowest who have once entered it return not thither again farewell my child and may heaven bless thee  with more of human emotion and sympathy than she had yet shown the lady again saluted eveline and signed to her to follow berwine who attended by two damsels bearing torches waited to conduct her to the dreaded apartment  their torches glared along the rudely built walls and dark arched roofs of one or two long winding passages these by their light enabled them to descend the steps of a winding stair whose inequality and ruggedness showed its antiquity and finally led into a tolerably large chamber on the lower story of the edifice to which some old hangings a lively fire on the hearth the moonbeams stealing through a latticed window and the boughs of a myrtle plant which grew around the casement gave no uncomfortable appearance this said berwine is the restingplace of your attendants and she pointed to the couches which had been prepared for rose and dame gillian we she added proceed farther  she then took a torch from the attendant maidens both of whom seemed to shrink back with fear which was readily caught by dame gillian although she was not probably aware of the cause but rose flammock unbidden followed her mistress without hesitation as berwine conducted her through a small wicket at the upper end of the apartment clenched with many an iron nail into a second but smaller anteroom or wardrobe at the end of which was a similar door this wardrobe had also its casement mantled with evergreens and like the former it was faintly enlightened by the moonbeams  berwine paused here and pointing to rose demanded of eveline why does she follow  to share my mistresss danger be it what it may answered rose with her characteristic readiness of speech and resolution  speak she said my dearest lady grasping evelines hand while she addressed her you will not drive your rose from you if i am less highminded than one of your boasted race i am bold and quickwitted in all honest serviceyou tremble like the aspen do not go into this apartmentdo not be gulled by all this pomp and mystery of terrible preparation bid defiance to this antiquated and i think halfpagan superstition  the lady eveline must go minion replied berwine sternly and she must go without any malapert adviser or companion  must gomust go repeated rose is this language to a free and noble maidensweet lady give me once but the least hint that you wish it and their must go shall be put to the trial i will call from the casement on the norman cavaliers and tell them we have fallen into a den of witches instead of a house of hospitality  silence madwoman said berwine her voice quivering with anger and fear you know not who dwells in the next chamber  i will call those who will soon see to that said rose flying to the casement when eveline seizing her arm in her turn compelled her to stop  i thank thy kindness rose she said but it cannot help me in this matter she who enters yonder door must do so alone  then i will enter it in your stead my dearest lady said rose you are paleyou are coldyou will die with terror if you go on there may be as much of trick as of supernatural agency in this matterme they shall not deceiveor if some stern spirit craves a victimbetter rose than her lady  forbear forbear said eveline rousing up her own spirits you make me ashamed of myself this is an ancient ordeal which regards the females descended from the house of baldringham as far as in the third degree and them only i did not indeed expect in my present circumstances to have been called upon to undergo it but since the hour summons me i will meet it as freely as any of my ancestors  so saying she took the torch from the hand of berwine and wishing goodnight to her and rose gently disengaged herself from the hold of the latter and advanced into the mysterious chamber rose pressed after her so far as to see that it was an apartment of moderate dimensions resembling that through which they had last passed and lighted by the moonbeams which came through a window lying on the same range with those of the anterooms more she could not see for eveline turned on the threshold and kissing her at the same time thrust her gently back into the smaller apartment which she had just left shut the door of communication and barred and bolted it as if in security against her wellmeant intrusion  berwine now exhorted rose as she valued her life to retire into the first anteroom where the beds were prepared and betake herself if not to rest at least to silence and devotion but the faithful flemish girl stoutly refused her entreaties and resisted her commands  talk not to me of danger she said here i remain that i may be at least within hearing of my mistresss danger and wo betide those who shall offer her injurytake notice that twenty norman spears surround this inhospitable dwelling prompt to avenge whatsoever injury shall be offered to the daughter of raymond berenger  reserve your threats for those who are mortal said berwine in a low but piercing whisper the owner of yonder chamber fears them not farewellthy danger be on thine own head  she departed leaving rose strangely agitated by what had passed and somewhat appalled at her last words these saxons said the maiden within herself are but half converted after all and hold many of their old hellish rites in the worship of elementary spirits their very saints are unlike to the saints of any christian country and have as it were a look of something savage and fiendishtheir very names sound pagan and diabolical it is fearful being alone hereand all is silent as death in the apartment into which my lady has been thus strangely compelled shall i call up gillianbut noshe has neither sense nor courage nor principle to aid me on such an occasionbetter alone than have a false friend for company i will see if the normans are on their post since it is to them i must trust if a moment of need should arrive  thus reflecting rose flammock went to the window of the little apartment in order to satisfy herself of the vigilance of the sentinels and to ascertain the exact situation of the corps de garde the moon was at the full and enabled her to see with accuracy the nature of the ground without in the first place she was rather disappointed to find that instead of being so near the earth as she supposed the range of windows which gave light as well to the two anterooms as to the mysterious chamber itself looked down upon an ancient moat by which they were divided from the level ground on the farther side the defence which this fosse afforded seemed to have been long neglected and the bottom entirely dry was choked in many places with bushes and low trees which rose up against the wall of the castle and by means of which it seemed to rose the windows might be easily scaled and the mansion entered from the level plain beyond the space adjoining to the castle was in a considerable degree clear and the moonbeams slumbered on its close and beautiful turf mixed with long shadows of the towers and trees beyond this esplanade lay the forest ground with a few gigantic oaks scattered individually along the skirt of its dark and ample domain like champions who take their ground of defiance in front of a line of arrayed battle  the calm beauty and repose of a scene so lovely the stillness of all around and the more matured reflections which the whole suggested quieted in some measure the apprehensions which the events of the evening had inspired after all she reflected why should i be so anxious on account of the lady eveline there is among the proud normans and the dogged saxons scarce a single family of note but must needs be held distinguished from others by some superstitious observance peculiar to their race as if they thought it scorn to go to heaven like a poor simple fleming such as i amcould i but see the norman sentinel i would hold myself satisfied with my mistresss securityand yonder one stalks along the gloom wrapt in his long white mantle and the moon tipping the point of his lance with silverwhat ho sir cavalier  the norman turned his steps and approached the ditch as she spoke what is your pleasure damsel he demanded  the window next to mine is that of the lady eveline berenger whom you are appointed to guard please to give heedful watch upon this side of the castle  doubt it not lady answered the cavalier and enveloping himself in his long chappe or military watchcloak he withdrew to a large oak tree at some distance and stood there with folded arms and leaning on his lance more like a trophy of armour than a living warrior  imboldened by the consciousness that in case of need succour was close at hand rose drew back into her little chamber and having ascertained by listening that there was no noise or stirring in that of eveline she began to make some preparations for her own repose for this purpose she went into the outward anteroom where dame gillian whose fears had given way to the soporiferous effects of a copious draught of lithealos mild ale of the first strength and quality slept as sound a sleep as that generous saxon beverage could procure  muttering an indignant censure on her sloth and indifference rose caught from the empty couch which had been destined for her own use the upper covering and dragging it with her into the inner anteroom disposed it so as with the assistance of the rushes which strewed that apartment to form a sort of couch upon which half seated half reclined she resolved to pass the night in as close attendance upon her mistress as circumstances permitted thus seated her eye on the pale planet which sailed in full glory through the blue sky of midnight she proposed to herself that sleep should not visit her eyelids till the dawn of morning should assure her of evelines safety  her thoughts meanwhile rested on the boundless and shadowy world beyond the grave and on the great and perhaps yet undecided question whether the separation of its inhabitants from those of this temporal sphere is absolute and decided or whether influenced by motives which we cannot appreciate they continue to hold shadowy communication with those yet existing in earthly reality of flesh and blood to have denied this would in the age of crusades and of miracles have incurred the guilt of heresy but roses firm good sense led her to doubt at least the frequency of supernatural interference and she comforted herself with an opinion contradicted however by her own involuntary starts and shudderings at every leaf which moved that in submitting to the performance of the rite imposed on her eveline incurred no real danger and only sacrificed to an obsolete family superstition  as this conviction strengthened on roses mind her purpose of vigilance began to declineher thoughts wandered to objects towards which they were not directed like sheep which stray beyond the charge of their shepherdher eyes no longer brought back to her a distinct apprehension of the broad round silvery orb on which they continued to gaze at length they closed and seated on the folded mantle her back resting against the wall of the apartment and her white arms folded on her bosom rose flammock fell fast asleep  her repose was fearfully broken by a shrill and piercing shriek from the apartment where her lady reposed to start up and fly to the door was the work of a moment with the generous girl who never permitted fear to struggle with love or duty the door was secured with both bar and bolt and another fainter scream or rather groan seemed to say aid must be instant or in vain rose next rushed to the window and screamed rather than called to the norman soldier who distinguished by the white folds of his watchcloak still retained his position under the old oaktree  at the cry of help helpthe lady eveline is murdered the seeming statue starting at once into active exertion sped with the swiftness of a racehorse to the brink of the moat and was about to cross it opposite to the spot where rose stood at the open casement urging him to speed by voice and gesture  not herenot here she exclaimed with breathless precipitation as she saw him make towards herthe window to the rightscale it for gods sake and undo the door of communication  the soldier seemed to comprehend herhe dashed into the moat without hesitation securing himself by catching at the boughs of trees as he descended in one moment he vanished among the underwood and in another availing himself of the branches of a dwarf oak rose saw him upon her right and close to the window of the fatal apartment one fear remainedthe casement might be secured against entrance from withoutbut no at the thrust of the norman it yielded and its clasps or fastenings being worn with time fell inward with a crash which even dame gillians slumbers were unable to resist  echoing scream upon scream in the usual fashion of fools and cowards she entered the cabinet from the anteroom just as the door of evelines chamber opened and the soldier appeared bearing in his arms the halfundressed and lifeless form of the norman maiden herself without speaking a word he placed her in roses arms and with the same precipitation with which he had entered threw himself out of the opened window from which rose had summoned him  gillian half distracted with fear and wonder heaped exclamations on questions and mingled questions with cries for help till rose sternly rebuked her in a tone which seemed to recall her scattered senses she became then composed enough to fetch a lamp which remained lighted in the room she had left and to render herself at least partly useful in suggesting and applying the usual modes for recalling the suspended sense in this they at length succeeded for eveline fetched a fuller sigh and opened her eyes but presently shut them again and letting her head drop on roses bosom fell into a strong shuddering fit while her faithful damsel chafing her hands and her temples alternately with affectionate assiduity and mingling caresses with these efforts exclaimed aloud she livesshe is recoveringpraised be god  praised be god was echoed in a solemn tone from the window of the apartment and turning towards it in terror rose beheld the armed and plumed head of the soldier who had come so opportunely to their assistance and who supported by his arms had raised himself so high as to be able to look into the interior of the cabinet  rose immediately ran towards him gogogood friend she said the lady recoversyour reward shall await you another time go begoneyet staykeep on your post and i will call you if there is farther need begonebe faithful and be secret  the soldier obeyed without answering a word and she presently saw him descend into the moat rose then returned back to her mistress whom she found supported by gillian moaning feebly and muttering hurried and unintelligible ejaculations all intimating that she had laboured under a violent shock sustained from some alarming cause  dame gillian had no sooner recovered some degree of self possession than her curiosity became active in proportion what means all this she said to rose what has been doing among you  i do not know replied rose  if you do not said gillian who shouldshall i call the other women and raise the house  not for your life said rose till my lady is able to give her own orders and for this apartment so help me heaven as i will do my best to discover the secrets it containssupport my mistress the whilst  so saying she took the lamp in her hand and crossing her brow stepped boldly across the mysterious threshold and holding up the light surveyed the apartment  it was merely an old vaulted chamber of very moderate dimensions in one corner was an image of the virgin rudely cut and placed above a saxon font of curious workmanship there were two seats and a couch covered with coarse tapestry on which it seemed that eveline had been reposing the fragments of the shattered casement lay on the floor but that opening had been only made when the soldier forced it in and she saw no other access by which a stranger could have entered an apartment the ordinary access to which was barred and bolted  rose felt the influence of those terrors which she had hitherto surmounted she cast her mantle hastily around her head as if to shroud her sight from some blighting vision and tripping back to the cabinet with more speed and a less firm step than when she left it she directed gillian to lend her assistance in conveying eveline to the next room and having done so carefully secured the door of communication as if to put a barrier betwixt them and the suspected danger  the lady eveline was now so far recovered that she could sit up and was trying to speak though but faintly rose she said at length i have seen hermy doom is sealed  rose immediately recollected the imprudence of suffering gillian to hear what her mistress might say at such an awful moment and hastily adopting the proposal she had before declined desired her to go and call other two maidens of their mistresss household  and where am i to find them in this house said dame gillian where strange men run about one chamber at midnight and devils for aught i know frequent the rest of the habitation  find them where you can said rose sharply but begone presently  gillian withdrew lingeringly and muttering at the same time something which could not distinctly be understood no sooner was she gone than rose giving way to the enthusiastic affection which she felt for her mistress implored her in the most tender terms to open her eyes for she had again closed them and speak to rose her own rose who was ready if necessary to die by her mistresss side  tomorrowtomorrow rose murmured evelinei cannot speak at present  only disburden your mind with one wordtell what has thus alarmed youwhat danger you apprehend  i have seen her answered evelinei have seen the tenant of yonder chamberthe vision fatal to my raceurge me no moreto morrow you shall know all footnote the idea of the bahrgeist was taken from a passage in the memoirs of lady fanshaw which have since been given to the public and received with deserved approbation  the original runs as follows lady fanshaw shifting among her friends in ireland like other sound loyalists of the period tells her story thus  from thence we went to the lady honor obriens a lady that went for a maid but few believed it she was the youngest daughter of the earl of thomond there we staid three nightsthe first of which i was surprised at being laid in a chamber where when about one oclock i heard a voice that awakened me i drew the curtain and in the casement of the window i saw by the light of the moon a woman leaning through the casement into the room in white with red hair and pale and ghastly complexion she spoke loud and in a tone i had never heard thrice a horse and then with a sigh more like the wind than breath she vanished and to me her body looked more like a thick cloud than substance i was so much frightened that my hair stood on end and my night clothes fell off i pulled and pinched your father who never awoke during the disorder i was in but at last was much surprised to see me in this fright and more so when i related the story and showed him the window opened neither of us slept any more that night but he entertained me by telling me how much more these apparitions were common in this country than in england and we concluded the cause to be the great superstition of the irish and the want of that knowing faith which should defend them from the power of the devil which he exercises among them very much about five oclock the lady of the house came to see us saying she had not been in bed all night because a cousin obrien of hers whose ancestors had owned that house had desired her to stay with him in his chamber and that he died at two oclock and she said i wish you to have had no disturbance for tis the custom of the place that when any of the family are dying the shape of a woman appears every night in the window until they be dead this woman was many ages ago got with child by the owner of this place who murdered her in his garden and flung her into the river under the window but truly i thought not of it when i lodged you here it being the best room in the house we made little reply to her speech but disposed ourselves to be gone suddenly  as gillian entered with two of the maidens of her mistresss household they removed the lady eveline by roses directions into a chamber at some distance which the latter had occupied and placed her in one of their beds where rose dismissing the others gillian excepted to seek repose where they could find it continued to watch her mistress for some time she continued very much disturbed but gradually fatigue and the influence of some narcotic which gillian had sense enough to recommend and prepare seemed to compose her spirits she fell into a deep slumber from which she did not awaken until the sun was high over the distant hills     chapter the fifteenth     i see a hand you cannot see     which beckons me away   i hear a voice you cannot hear     which says i must not stay      mallet   when eveline first opened her eyes it seemed to be without any recollection of what had passed on the night preceding she looked round the apartment which was coarsely and scantily furnished as one destined for the use of domestics and menials and said to rose with a smile our good kinswoman maintains the ancient saxon hospitality at a homely rate so far as lodging is concerned i could have willingly parted with last nights profuse supper to have obtained a bed of a softer texture methinks my limbs feel as if i had been under all the flails of a franklins barnyard  i am glad to see you so pleasant madam answered rose discreetly avoiding any reference to the events of the night before  dame gillian was not so scrupulous your ladyship last night lay down on a better bed than this she said unless i am much mistaken and rose flammock and yourself know best why you left it  if a look could have killed dame gillian would have been in deadly peril from that which rose shot at her by way of rebuke for this illadvised communication it had instantly the effect which was to be apprehended for lady eveline seemed at first surprised and confused then as recollections of the past arranged themselves in her memory she folded her hands looked on the ground and wept bitterly with much agitation  rose entreated her to be comforted and offered to fetch the old saxon chaplain of the house to administer spiritual consolation if her grief rejected temporal comfort  nocall him not said eveline raising her head and drying her eyesi have had enough of saxon kindness what a fool was i to expect in that hard and unfeeling woman any commiseration for my youthmy late sufferingsmy orphan condition i will not permit her a poor triumph over the norman blood of berenger by letting her see how much i have suffered under her inhuman infliction but first rose answer me truly was any inmate of baldringham witness to my distress last night  rose assured her that she had been tended exclusively by her own retinue herself and gillian blanche and ternotte she seemed to receive satisfaction from this assurance hear me both of you she said and observe my words as you love and as you fear me let no syllable be breathed from your lips of what has happened this night carry the same charge to my maidens lend me thine instant aid gillian and thine my dearest rose to change these disordered garments and arrange this dishevelled hair it was a poor vengeance she sought and all because of my country i am resolved she shall not see the slightest trace of the sufferings she has inflicted  as she spoke thus her eyes flashed with indignation which seemed to dry up the tears that had before filled them rose saw the change of her manner with a mixture of pleasure and concern being aware that her mistresss predominant failing was incident to her as a spoiled child who accustomed to be treated with kindness deference and indulgence by all around her was apt to resent warmly whatever resembled neglect or contradiction  god knows said the faithful bowermaiden i would hold my hand out to catch drops of molten lead rather than endure your tears and yet my sweet mistress i would rather at present see you grieved than angry this ancient lady hath it would seem but acted according to some old superstitious rite of her family which is in part yours her name is respectable both from her conduct and possessions and hard pressed as you are by the normans with whom your kinswoman the prioress is sure to take part i was in hope you might have had some shelter and countenance from the lady of baldringham  never rose never answered eveline you know notyou cannot fuess what she has made me sufferexposing me to witchcraft and fiends thyself said it and said it trulythe saxons are still half pagans void of christianity as of nurture and kindliness  ay but replied rose i spoke then to dissuade you from a danger now that the danger is passed and over i may judge of it otherwise  speak not for them rose replied eveline angrily no innocent victim was ever offered up at the altar of a fiend with more indifference than my fathers kinswoman delivered up meme an orphan bereaved of my natural and powerful support i hate her crueltyi hate her housei hate the thought of all that has happened hereof all rose except thy matchless faith and fearless attachment go bid our train saddle directlyi will be gone instantlyi will not attire myself she added rejecting the assistance she had at first requiredi will have no ceremony tarry for no leavetaking  in the hurried and agitated manner of her mistress rose recognized with anxiety another mood of the same irritable and excited temperament which had before discharged itself in tears and fits but perceiving at the same time that remonstrance was in vain she gave the necessary orders for collecting their company saddling and preparing for departure hoping that as her mistress removed to a farther distance from the scene where her mind had received so severe a shock her equanimity might by degrees be restored  dame gillian accordingly was busied with arranging the packages of her lady and all the rest of lady evelines retinue in preparing for instant departure when preceded by her steward who acted also as a sort of gentlemanusher leaning upon her confidential berwine and followed by two or three more of the most distinguished of her household with looks of displeasure on her ancient yet lofty brow the lady ermengarde entered the apartment  eveline with a trembling and hurried hand a burning cheek and other signs of agitation was herself busied about the arrangement of some baggage when her relation made her appearance at once to roses great surprise she exerted a strong command over herself and repressing every external appearance of disorder she advanced to meet her relation with a calm and haughty stateliness equal to her own  i come to give you good morning our niece said ermengarde haughtily indeed yet with more deference than she seemed at first to have intended so much did the bearing of eveline impose respect upon heri find that you have been pleased to shift that chamber which was assigned you in conformity with the ancient custom of this household and betake yourself to the apartment of a menial  are you surprised at that lady demanded eveline in her turn or are you disappointed that you find me not a corpse within the limits of the chamber which your hospitality and affection allotted to me  your sleep then has been broken said ermengarde looking fixedly at the lady eveline as she spoke  if i complain not madam the evil must be deemed of little consequence what has happened is over and passed and it is not my intention to trouble you with the recital  she of the ruddy finger replied ermengarde triumphantly loves not the blood of the stranger  she had less reason while she walked the earth to love that of the saxon said eveline unless her legend speaks false in that matter and unless as i well suspect your house is haunted not by the soul of the dead who suffered within its walls but by evil spirits such as the descendants of hengist and horsa are said still in secret to worship  you are pleasant maiden replied the old lady scornfully or if your words are meant in earnest the shaft of your censure has glanced aside a house blessed by the holy saint dunstan and by the royal and holy confessor is no abode for evil spirits  the house of baldringham replied eveline is no abode for those who fear such spirits and as i will with all humility avow myself of the number i shall presently leave it to the custody of saint dunstan  not till you have broken your fast i trust said the lady of baldringham you will not i hope do my years and our relationship such foul disgrace  pardon me madam replied the lady eveline those who have experienced your hospitality at night have little occasion for breakfast in the morningrose are not those loitering knaves assembled in the courtyard or are they yet on their couches making up for the slumber they have lost by midnight disturbances  rose announced that her train was in the court and mounted when with a low reverence eveline endeavoured to pass her relation and leave the apartment without farther ceremony ermengarde at first confronted her with a grim and furious glance which seemed to show a soul fraught with more rage than the thin blood and rigid features of extreme old age had the power of expressing and raised her ebony staff as if about even to proceed to some act of personal violence but she changed her purpose and suddenly made way for eveline who passed without farther parley and as she descended the staircase which conducted from the apartment to the gateway she heard the voice of her aunt behind her like that of an aged and offended sibyl denouncing wrath and wo upon her insolence and presumption  pride she exclaimed goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall she who scorneth the house of her forefathers a stone from its battlements shall crush her she who mocks the gray hairs of a parent never shall one of her own locks be silvered with age she who weds with a man of war and of blood her end shall neither be peaceful nor bloodless  hurrying to escape from these and other ominous denunciations eveline rushed from the house mounted her palfrey with the precipitation of a fugitive and surrounded by her attendants who had caught a part of her alarm though without conjecturing the cause rode hastily into the forest old raoul who was well acquainted with the country acting as their guide  agitated more than she was willing to confess to herself by thus leaving the habitation of so near a relation loaded with maledictions instead of the blessings which are usually bestowed on a departing kinswoman eveline hastened forward until the huge oaktrees with intervening arms had hidden from her view the fatal mansion  the trampling and galloping of horse was soon after heard announcing the approach of the patrol left by the constable for the protection of the mansion and who now collecting from their different stations came prepared to attend the lady eveline on her farther road to gloucester great part of which lay through the extensive forest of deane then a silvan region of large extent though now much denuded of trees for the service of the iron mines the cavaliers came up to join the retinue of lady eveline with armour glittering in the morning rays trumpets sounding horses prancing neighing and thrown each by his chivalrous rider into the attitude best qualified to exhibit the beauty of the steed and dexterity of the horseman while their lances streaming with long penoncelles were brandished in every manner which could display elation of heart and readiness of hand the sense of the military character of her countrymen of normandy gave to eveline a feeling at once of security and of triumph which operated towards the dispelling of her gloomy thoughts and of the feverish disorder which affected her nerves the rising sun alsothe song of the birds among the bowersthe lowing of the cattle as they were driven to pasturethe sight of the hind who with her fawn trotting by her side often crossed some forest glade within view of the travellersall contributed to dispel the terror of evelines nocturnal visions and soothe to rest the more angry passions which had agitated her bosom at her departure from baldringham she suffered her palfrey to slacken his pace and with female attention to propriety began to adjust her riding robes and compose her headdress disordered in her hasty departure rose saw her cheek assume a paler but more settled hue instead of the angry hectic which had coloured itsaw her eye become more steady as she looked with a sort of triumph upon her military attendants and pardoned what on other occasions she would probably have made some reply to her enthusiastic exclamations in praise of her countrymen  we journey safe said eveline under the care of the princely and victorious normans theirs is the noble wrath of the lion which destroys or is appeased at oncethere is no guile in their romantic affection no sullenness mixed with their generous indignationthey know the duties of the hall as well as those of battle and were they to be surpassed in the arts of war which will only be when plinlimmon is removed from its base they would still remain superior to every other people in generosity and courtesy  if i do not feel all their merits so strongly as if i shared their blood said rose i am at least glad to see them around us in woods which are said to abound with dangers of various kinds and i confess my heart is the lighter that i can now no longer observe the least vestige of that ancient mansion in which we passed so unpleasant a night and the recollection of which will always be odious to me  eveline looked sharply at her confess the truth rose thou wouldst give thy best kirtle to know all of my horrible adventure  it is but confessing that i am a woman answered rose and did i say a man i dare say the difference of sex would imply but a small abatement of curiosity  thou makest no parade of other feelings which prompt thee to inquire into my fortunes said eveline but sweet rose i give thee not the less credit for them believe me thou shalt know allbut i think not now  at your pleasure said rose and yet methinks the bearing in your solitary bosom such a fearful secret will only render the weight more intolerable on my silence you may rely as on that of the holy image which hears us confess what it never reveals besides such things become familiar to the imagination when they have been spoken of and that which is familiar gradually becomes stripped of its terrors  thou speakest with reason my prudent rose and surely in this gallant troop borne like a flower on a bush by my good palfrey yseultefresh gales blowing round us flowers opening and birds singing and having thee by my bridlerein i ought to feel this a fitting time to communicate what thou hast so good a title to know andyesthou shalt know allthou art not i presume ignorant of the qualities of what the saxons of this land call a bahrgeist  pardon me lady answered rose my father discouraged my listening to such discourses i might see evil spirits enough he said without my imagination being taught to form such as were fantastical the word bahrgeist i have heard used by gillian and other saxons but to me it only conveys some idea of indefinite terror of which i never asked nor received an explanation  know then said eveline it is a spectre usually the image of a departed person who either for wrong sustained in some particular place during life or through treasure hidden there or from some such other cause haunts the spot from time to time becomes familiar to those who dwell there takes an interest in their fate occasionally for good in other instances or times for evil the bahrgeist is therefore sometimes regarded as the good genius sometimes as the avenging fiend attached to particular families and classes of men it is the lot of the family of baldringham of no mean note in other respects to be subject to the visits of such a being  may i ask the cause if it be known of such visitation said rose desirous to avail herself to the uttermost of the communicative mood of her young lady which might not perhaps last very long  i know the legend but imperfectly replied eveline proceeding with a degree of calmness the result of strong exertion over her mental anxiety but in general it runs thusbaldrick the saxon hero who first possessed yonder dwelling became enamoured of a fair briton said to have been descended from those druids of whom the welsh speak so much and deemed not unacquainted with the arts of sorcery which they practised when they offered up human sacrifices amid those circles of unhewn and living rock of which thou hast seen so many after more than two years wedlock baldrick became weary of his wife to such a point that he formed the cruel resolution of putting her to death some say he doubted her fidelitysome that the matter was pressed on him by the church as she was suspected of heresysome that he removed her to make way for a more wealthy marriagebut all agree in the result he sent two of his cnichts to the house of baldringham to put to death the unfortunate vanda and commanded them to bring him the ring which had circled her finger on the day of wedlock in token that his orders were accomplished the men were ruthless in their office they strangled vanda in yonder apartment and as the hand was so swollen that no effort could draw off the ring they obtained possession of it by severing the finger but long before the return of those cruel perpetrators of her death the shadow of vanda had appeared before her appalled husband and holding up to him her bloody hand made him fearfully sensible how well his savage commands had been obeyed after haunting him in peace and war in desert court and camp until he died despairingly on a pilgrimage to the holy land the bahrgeist or ghost of the murdered vanda became so terrible in the house of baldringham that the succour of saint dunstan was itself scarcely sufficient to put bounds to her visitation yea the blessed saint when he had succeeded in his exorcism did in requital of baldricks crime impose a strong and enduring penalty upon every female descendant of the house in the third degree namely that once in their lives and before their twentyfirst year they should each spend a solitary night in the chamber of the murdered vanda saying therein certain prayers as well for her repose as for the suffering soul of her murderer during that awful space it is generally believed that the spirit of the murdered person appears to the female who observes the vigil and shows some sign of her future good or bad fortune if favourable she appears with a smiling aspect and crosses them with her unbloodied hand but she announces evil fortune by showing the hand from which the finger was severed with a stern countenance as if resenting upon the descendant of her husband his inhuman cruelty sometimes she is said to speak these particulars i learned long since from an old saxon dame the mother of our margery who had been an attendant on my grandmother and left the house of baldringham when she made her escape from it with my fathers father  did your grandmother ever render this homage said rose which seems to meunder favour of st dunstanto bring humanity into too close intercourse with a being of a doubtful nature  my grandfather thought so and never permitted my grandmother to revisit the house of baldringham after her marriage hence disunion betwixt him and his son on the one part and the members of that family on the other they laid sundry misfortunes and particularly the loss of male heirs which at that time befell them to my parents not having done the hereditary homage to the bloodyfingered bahrgeist  and how could you my dearest lady said rose knowing that they held among them a usage so hideous think of accepting the invitation of lady ermengarde  i can hardly answer you the question answered eveline partly i feared my fathers recent calamity to be slain as i have heard him say his aunt once prophesied of him by the enemy he most despised might be the result of this rite having been neglected and partly i hoped that if my mind should be appalled at the danger when it presented itself closer to my eye it could not be urged on me in courtesy and humanity you saw how soon my cruel hearted relative pounced upon the opportunity and how impossible it became for me bearing the name and i trust the spirit of berenger to escape from the net in which i had involved myself  no regard for name or rank should have engaged me replied rose to place myself where apprehension alone even without the terrors of a real visitation might have punished my presumption with insanity but what in the name of heaven did you see at this horrible rendezvous  ay there is the question said eveline raising her hand to her browhow i could witness that which i distinctly saw yet be able to retain command of thought and intellecti had recited the prescribed devotions for the murderer and his victim and sitting down on the couch which was assigned me had laid aside such of my clothes as might impede my resti had surmounted in short the first shock which i experienced in committing myself to this mysterious chamber and i hoped to pass the night in slumber as sound as my thoughts were innocent but i was fearfully disappointed i cannot judge how long i had slept when my bosom was oppressed by an unusual weight which seemed at once to stifle my voice stop the beating of my heart and prevent me from drawing my breath and when i looked up to discover the cause of this horrible suffocation the form of the murdered british matron stood over my couch taller than life shadowy and with a countenance where traits of dignity and beauty were mingled with a fierce expression of vengeful exultation she held over me the hand which bore the bloody marks of her husbands cruelty and seemed as if she signed the cross devoting me to destruction while with an unearthly tone she uttered these words     widowd wife and married maid     betrothed betrayer and betrayd  the phantom stooped over me as she spoke and lowered her gory fingers as if to touch my face when terror giving me the power of which it at first deprived me i screamed aloudthe casement of the apartment was thrown open with a loud noiseandbut what signifies my telling all this to thee rose who show so plainly by the movement of eye and lip that you consider me as a silly and childish dreamer  be not angry my dear lady said rose i do indeed believe that the witch we call mara footnote ephialtes or nightmare has been dealing with you but she you know is by leeches considered as no real phantom but solely the creation of our own imagination disordered by causes which arise from bodily indisposition  thou art learned maiden said eveline rather peevishly but when i assure thee that my better angel came to my assistance in a human formthat at his appearance the fiend vanishedand that he transported me in his arms out of the chamber of terror i think thou wilt as a good christian put more faith in that which i tell you  indeed indeed my sweetest mistress i cannot replied rose it is even that circumstance of the guardian angel which makes me consider the whole as a dream a norman sentinel whom i myself called from his post on purpose did indeed come to your assistance and breaking into your apartment transported you to that where i myself received you from his arms in a lifeless condition  a norman soldier ha said eveline colouring extremely and to whom maiden did you dare give commission to break into my sleeping chamber  your eyes flash anger madam but is it reasonable they should did i not hear your screams of agony and was i to stand fettered by ceremony at such a momentno more than if the castle had been on fire  i ask you again rose said her mistress still with discomposure though less angrily than at first whom you directed to break into my apartment  indeed i know not lady said rose for beside that he was muffled in his mantle little chance was there of my knowing his features even had i seen them fully but i can soon discover the cavalier and i will set about it that i may give him the reward i promised and warn him to be silent and discreet in this matter  do so said eveline and if you find him among those soldiers who attend us i will indeed lean to thine opinion and think that fantasy had the chief share in the evils i have endured the last night  rose struck her palfrey with the rod and accompanied by her mistress rode up to philip guarine the constables squire who for the present commanded their little escort good guarine she said i had talk with one of these sentinels last night from my window and he did me some service for which i promised him recompensewill you inquire for the man that i may pay him his guerdon  truly i will owe him a guerdon also pretty maiden answered the squire for if a lance of them approached near enough the house to hold speech from the windows he transgressed the precise orders of his watch  tush you must forgive that for my sake said rose i warrant had i called on yourself stout guarine i should have had influence to bring you under my chamber window  guarine laughed and shrugged his shoulders true it is he said when women are in place discipline is in danger  he then went to make the necessary inquiries among his band and returned with the assurance that his soldiers generally and severally denied having approached the mansion of the lady ermengarde on the preceding night  thou seest rose said eveline with a significant look to her attendant  the poor rogues are afraid of guarines severity said rose and dare not tell the truthi shall have some one in private claiming the reward of me  i would i had the privilege myself damsel said guarine but for these fellows they are not so timorous as you suppose them being even too ready to avouch their roguery when it hath less excusebesides i promised them impunityhave you any thing farther to order  nothing good guarine said eveline only this small donative to procure wine for thy soldiers that they may spend the next night more merrily than the lastand now he is gonemaiden thou must i think be now well aware that what thou sawest was no earthly being  i must believe mine own ears and eyes madam replied rose  dobut allow me the same privilege answered eveline believe me that my deliverer for so i must call him bore the features of one who neither was nor could be in the neighbourhood of baldringham tell me but one thingwhat dost thou think of this extraordinary prediction     widowd wife and wedded maid    betrothed betrayer and betrayd  thou wilt say it is an idle invention of my brainbut think it for a moment the speech of a true diviner and what wouldst thou say of it  that you may be betrayed my dearest lady but never can be a betrayer answered rose with animation  eveline reached her hand out to her friend and as she pressed affectionately that which rose gave in return she whispered to her with energy i thank thee for the judgment which my own heart confirms  a cloud of dust now announced the approach of the constable of chester and his retinue augmented by the attendance of his host sir william herbert and some of his neighbours and kinsmen who came to pay their respects to the orphan of the garde doloureuse by which appellation eveline was known upon her passage through their territory  eveline remarked that at their greeting de lacy looked with displeased surprise at the disarrangement of her dress and equipage which her hasty departure from baldringham had necessarily occasioned and she was on her part struck with an expression of countenance which seemed to say i am not to be treated as an ordinary person who may be received with negligence and treated slightly with impunity for the first time she thought that though always deficient in grace and beauty the constables countenance was formed to express the more angry passions with force and vivacity and that she who shared his rank and name must lay her account with the implicit surrender of her will and wishes to those of an arbitrary lord and master  but the cloud soon passed from the constables brow and in the conversation which he afterwards maintained with herbert and the other knights and gentlemen who from time to time came to greet and accompany them for a little way on their journey eveline had occasion to admire his superiority both of sense and expression and to remark the attention and deference with which his words were listened to by men too high in rank and too proud readily to admit any preeminence that was not founded on acknowledged merit the regard of women is generally much influenced by the estimation which an individual maintains in the opinion of men and eveline when she concluded her journey in the benedictine nunnery in gloucester could not think without respect upon the renowned warrior and celebrated politician whose acknowledged abilities appeared to place him above every one whom she had seen approach him his wife eveline thought and she was not without ambition if relinquishing some of those qualities in a husband which are in youth most captivating to the female imagination must be still generally honoured and respected and have contentment if not romantic felicity within her reach     chapter the sixteenth   the lady eveline remained nearly four months with her aunt the abbess of the benedictine nunnery under whose auspices the constable of chester saw his suit advance and prosper as it would probably have done under that of the deceased raymond berenger her brother it is probable however that but for the supposed vision of the virgin and the vow of gratitude which that supposed vision had called forth the natural dislike of so young a person to a match so unequal in years might have effectually opposed his success indeed eveline while honouring the constables virtues doing justice to his high character and admiring his talents could never altogether divest herself of a secret fear of him which while it prevented her from expressing any direct disapprobation of his addresses caused her sometimes to shudder she scarce knew why at the idea of their becoming successful  the ominous words betraying and betrayed would then occur to her memory and when her aunt the period of the deepest mourning being elapsed had fixed a period for her betrothal she looked forward to it with a feeling of terror for which she was unable to account to herself and which as well as the particulars of her dream she concealed even from father aldrovand in the hours of confession it was not aversion to the constableit was far less preference to any other suitorit was one of those instinctive movements and emotions by which nature seems to warn us of approaching danger though furnishing no information respecting its nature and suggesting no means of escaping from it  so strong were these intervals of apprehension that if they had been seconded by the remonstrances of rose flammock as formerly they might perhaps have led to evelines yet forming some resolution unfavourable to the suit of the constable but still more zealous for her ladys honour than even for her happiness rose had strictly forborne every effort which could affect evelines purpose when she had once expressed her approbation of de lacys addresses and whatever she thought or anticipated concerning the proposed marriage she seemed from that moment to consider it as an event which must necessarily take place  de lacy himself as he learned more intimately to know the merit of the prize which he was desirous of possessing looked forward with different feelings towards the union than those with which he had first proposed the measure to raymond berenger it was then a mere match of interest and convenience which had occurred to the mind of a proud and politic feudal lord as the best mode of consolidating the power and perpetuating the line of his family nor did even the splendour of evelines beauty make that impression upon de lacy which it was calculated to do on the fiery and impassioned chivalry of the age he was past that period of life when the wise are captivated by outward form and might have said with truth as well as with discretion that he could have wished his beautiful bride several years older and possessed of a more moderate portion of personal charms in order to have rendered the match more fitted for his own age and disposition this stoicism however vanished when on repeated interviews with his destined bride he found that she was indeed inexperienced in life but desirous to be guided by superior wisdom and that although gifted with high spirit and a disposition which began to recover its natural elastic gaiety she was gentle docile and above all endowed with a firmness of principle which seemed to give assurance that she would tread uprightly and without spot the slippery paths in which youth rank and beauty are doomed to move  as feelings of a warmer and more impassioned kind towards eveline began to glow in de lacys bosom his engagements as a crusader became more and more burdensome to him the benedictine abbess the natural guardian of evelines happiness added to these feelings by her reasoning and remonstrances although a nun and a devotee she held in reverence the holy state of matrimony and comprehended so much of it as to be aware that its important purposes could not be accomplished while the whole continent of europe was interposed betwixt the married pair for as to a hint from the constable that his young spouse might accompany him into the dangerous and dissolute precincts of the crusaders camp the good lady crossed herself with horror at the proposal and never permitted it to be a second time mentioned in her presence  it was not however uncommon for kings princes and other persons of high consequence who had taken upon them the vow to rescue jerusalem to obtain delays and even a total remission of their engagement by proper application to the church of rome the constable was sure to possess the full advantage of his sovereigns interest and countenance in seeking permission to remain in england for he was the noble to whose valour and policy henry had chiefly intrusted the defence of the disorderly welsh marches and it was by no means with his goodwill that so useful a subject had ever assumed the cross  it was settled therefore in private betwixt the abbess and the constable that the latter should solicit at rome and with the popes legate in england a remission of his vow for at least two years a favour which it was thought could scarce be refused to one of his wealth and influence backed as it was with the most liberal offers of assistance towards the redemption of the holy land his offers were indeed munificent for he proposed if his own personal attendance were dispensed with to send an hundred lances at his own cost each lance accompanied by two squires three archers and a varlet or horseboy being double the retinue by which his own person was to have been accompanied he offered besides to deposit the sum of two thousand bezants to the general expenses of the expedition to surrender to the use of the christian armament those equipped vessels which he had provided and which even now awaited the embarkation of himself and his followers  yet while making these magnificent proffers the constable could not help feeling they would be inadequate to the expectations of the rigid prelate baldwin who as he had himself preached the crusade and brought the constable and many others into that holy engagement must needs see with displeasure the work of his eloquence endangered by the retreat of so important an associate from his favourite enterprise to soften therefore his disappointment as much as possible the constable offered to the archbishop that in the event of his obtaining license to remain in britain his forces should be led by his nephew danxian lacy already renowned for his early feats of chivalry the present hope of his house and failing heirs of his own body its future head and support  the constable took the most prudent method of communicating this proposal to the archbishop baldwin through a mutual friend on whose good offices he could depend and whose interest with the prelate was regarded as great but notwithstanding the splendour of the proposal the prelate heard it with sullen and obstinate silence and referred for answer to a personal conference with the constable at an appointed day when concerns of the church would call the archbishop to the city of gloucester the report of the mediator was such as induced the constable to expect a severe struggle with the proud and powerful churchman but himself proud and powerful and backed by the favour of his sovereign he did not expect to be foiled in the contest  the necessity that this point should be previously adjusted as well as the recent loss of evelines father gave an air of privacy to de lacys courtship and prevented its being signalized by tournaments and feats of military skill in which he would have been otherwise desirous to display his address in the eyes of his mistress the rules of the convent prevented his giving entertainments of dancing music or other more pacific revels and although the constable displayed his affection by the most splendid gifts to his future bride and her attendants the whole affair in the opinion of the experienced dame gillian proceeded more with the solemnity of a funeral than the light pace of an approaching bridal  the bride herself felt something of this and thought occasionally it might have been lightened by the visits of young damian in whose age so nearly corresponding to her own she might have expected some relief from the formal courtship of his graver uncle but he came not and from what the constable said concerning him she was led to imagine that the relations had for a time at least exchanged occupations and character the elder de lacy continued indeed in nominal observance of his vow to dwell in a pavilion by the gates of gloucester but he seldom donned his armour substituted costly damask and silk for his warworn shamois doublet and affected at his advanced time of life more gaiety of attire than his contemporaries remembered as distinguishing his early youth his nephew on the contrary resided almost constantly on the marches of wales occupied in settling by prudence or subduing by main force the various disturbances by which these provinces were continually agitated and eveline learned with surprise that it was with difficulty his uncle had prevailed on him to be present at the ceremony of their being betrothed to each other or as the normans entitled the ceremony their fiancailles this engagement which preceded the actual marriage for a space more or less according to circumstances was usually celebrated with a solemnity corresponding to the rank of the contracting parties  the constable added with expressions of regret that damian gave himself too little rest considering his early youth slept too little and indulged in too restless a dispositionthat his health was sufferingand that a learned jewish leech whose opinion had been taken had given his advice that the warmth of a more genial climate was necessary to restore his constitution to its general and natural vigour  eveline heard this with much regret for she remembered damian as the angel of good tidings who first brought her news of deliverance from the forces of the welsh and the occasions on which they had met though mournful brought a sort of pleasure in recollection so gentle had been the youths deportment and so consoling his expressions of sympathy she wished she could see him that she might herself judge of the nature of his illness for like other damsels of that age she was not entirely ignorant of the art of healing and had been taught by father aldrovand himself no mean physician how to extract healing essences from plants and herbs gathered under planetary hours she thought it possible that her talents in this art slight as they were might perhaps be of service to one already her friend and liberator and soon about to become her very near relation  it was therefore with a sensation of pleasure mingled with some confusion at the idea doubtless of assuming the part of medical adviser to so young a patient that one evening while the convent was assembled about some business of their chapter she heard gillian announce that the kinsman of the lord constable desired to speak with her she snatched up the veil which she wore in compliance with the customs of the house and hastily descended to the parlour commanding the attendance of gillian who nevertheless did not think proper to obey the signal  when she entered the apartment a man whom she had never seen before advanced kneeling on one knee and taking up the hem of her veil saluted it with an air of the most profound respect she stepped back surprised and alarmed although there was nothing in the appearance of the stranger to justify her apprehension he seemed to be about thirty years of age tall of stature and bearing a noble though wasted form and a countenance on which disease or perhaps youthful indulgence had anticipated the traces of age his demeanour seemed courteous and respectful even in a degree which approached to excess he observed evelines surprise and said in a tone of pride mingled with emotion i fear that i have been mistaken and that my visit is regarded as an unwelcome intrusion  arise sir answered eveline and let me know your name and business i was summoned to a kinsman of the constable of chester  and you expected the stripling damian answered the stranger but the match with which england rings will connect you with others of the house besides that young person and amongst these with the luckless randal de lacy perhaps continued he the fair eveline berenger may not even have heard his name breathed by his more fortunate kinsmanmore fortunate in every respect but most fortunate in his present prospects  this compliment was accompanied by a deep reverence and eveline stood much embarrassed how to reply to his civilities for although she now remembered to have heard this randal slightly mentioned by the constable when speaking of his family it was in terms which implied there was no good understanding betwixt them she therefore only returned his courtesy by general thanks for the honour of his visit trusting he would then retire but such was not his purpose  i comprehend he said from the coldness with which the lady eveline berenger receives me that what she has heard of me from my kinsman if indeed he thought me worthy of being mentioned to her at all has been to say the least unfavourable and yet my name once stood as high in fields and courts as that of the constable nor is it aught more disgraceful than what is indeed often esteemed the worst of disgracespoverty which prevents my still aspiring to places of honour and fame if my youthful follies have been numerous i have paid for them by the loss of my fortune and the degradation of my condition and therein my happy kinsman might if he pleased do me some aidi mean not with his purse or estate for poor as i am i would not live on alms extorted from the reluctant hand of an estranged friend but his countenance would put him to no cost and in so far i might expect some favour  in that my lord constable said eveline must judge for himself i haveas yet at leastno right to interfere in his family affairs and if i should ever have such right it will well become me to be cautious how i use it  it is prudently answered replied randal but what i ask of you is merely that you in your gentleness would please to convey to my cousin a suit which i find it hard to bring my ruder tongue to utter with sufficient submission the usurers whose claims have eaten like a canker into my means now menace me with a dungeona threat which they dared not mutter far less attempt to execute were it not that they see me an outcast unprotected by the natural head of my family and regard me rather as they would some unfriended vagrant than as a descendant of the powerful house of lacy  it is a sad necessity replied eveline but i see not how i can help you in such extremity  easily replied randal de lacy the day of your betrothal is fixed as i hear reported and it is your right to select what witnesses you please to the solemnity which may the saints bless to every one but myself presence or absence upon that occasion is a matter of mere ceremonyto me it is almost life or death so an i situated that the marked instance of slight or contempt implied by my exclusion from this meeting of our family will be held for the signal of my final expulsion from the house of the de lacys and for a thousand bloodhounds to assail me without mercy or forbearance whom cowards as they are even the slightest show of countenance from my powerful kinsman would compel to stand at bay but why should i occupy your time in talking thusfarewell madambe happyand do not think of me the more harshly that for a few minutes i have broken the tenor of your happy thoughts by forcing my misfortunes on your notice  stay sir said eveline affected by the tone and manner of the noble suppliant you shall not have it to say that you have told your distress to eveline berenger without receiving such aid as is in her power to give i will mention your request to the constable of chester  you must do more if you really mean to assist me said randal de lacy you must make that request your own you do not know said he continuing to bend on her a fixed and expressive look how hard it is to change the fixed purpose of a de lacya twelvemonth hence you will probably be better acquainted with the firm texture of our resolutions but at present what can withstand your wish should you deign to express it  your suit sir shall not be lost for want of my advancing it with my good word and good wishes replied eveline but you must be well aware that its success or failure must rest with the constable himself  randal de lacy took his leave with the same air of deep reverence which had marked his entrance only that as he then saluted the skirt of evelines robe he now rendered the same homage by touching her hand with his lip she saw him depart with a mixture of emotions in which compassion was predominant although in his complaints of the constables unkindness to him there was something offensive and his avowal of follies and excess seemed uttered rather in the spirit of wounded pride than in that of contrition  when eveline next saw the constable she told him of the visit of randal and of his request and strictly observing his countenance while she spoke she saw that at the first mention of his kinsmans name a gleam of anger shot along his features he soon subdued it however and fixing his eyes on the ground listened to evelines detailed account of the visit and her request that randal might be one of the invited witnesses to their fiancailles  the constable paused for a moment as if he were considering how to elude the solicitation at length he replied you do not know for whom you ask this or you would perhaps have forborne your request neither are you apprized of its full import though my crafty cousin well knows that when i do him this grace which he asks i bind myself as it were in the eye of the world once moreand it will be for the third timeto interfere in his affairs and place them on such a footing as may afford him the means of reestablishing his fallen consequence and repairing his numerous errors  and wherefore not my lord said the generous eveline if he has been ruined only through follies he is now of an age when these are no longer tempting snares and if his heart and hand be good he may yet be an honour to the house of de lacy  the constable shook his head he hath indeed he said a heart and hand fit for service god knoweth whether in good or evil but never shall it be said that you my fair eveline made request of hugh de lacy which he was not to his uttermost willing to comply with randal shall attend at our fiancailles there is indeed the more cause for his attendance as i somewhat fear we may lack that of our valued nephew damian whose malady rather increases than declines and as i hear with strange symptoms of unwonted disturbance of mind and starts of temper to which the youth had not hitherto been subject     chapter the seventeenth      ring out the merry bell the bride approaches    the blush upon her cheek has shamed the morning    for that is dawning palely grant good saints    these clouds betoken nought of evil omen      old play   the day of the fiancailles or espousals was now approaching and it seems that neither the profession of the abbess nor her practice at least were so rigid as to prevent her selecting the great parlour of the convent for that holy rite although necessarily introducing many male guests within those vestal precincts and notwithstanding that the rite itself was the preliminary to a state which the inmates of the cloister had renounced for ever  the abbesss norman pride of birth and the real interest which she took in her nieces advancement overcame all scruples and the venerable mother might be seen in unwonted bustle now giving orders to the gardener for decking the apartment with flowersnow to her cellaress her precentrix and the laysisters of the kitchen for preparing a splendid banquet mingling her commands on these worldly subjects with an occasional ejaculation on their vanity and worthlessness and every now and then converting the busy and anxious looks which she threw upon her preparations into a solemn turning upward of eyes and folding of hands as one who sighed over the mere earthly pomp which she took such trouble in superintending at another time the good lady might have been seen in close consultation with father aldrovand upon the ceremonial civil and religious which was to accompany a solemnity of such consequence to her family  meanwhile the reins of discipline although relaxed for a season were not entirely thrown loose the outer court of the convent was indeed for the time opened for the reception of the male sex but the younger sisters and novices of the house being carefully secluded in the more inner apartments of the extensive building under the immediate eye of a grim old nun or as the conventual rule designed her an ancient sad and virtuous person termed mistress of the novices were not permitted to pollute their eyes by looking on waving plumes and rustling mantles a few sisters indeed of the abbesss own standing were left at liberty being such goods as it was thought could not in shopmans phrase take harm from the air and which are therefore left lying on the counter these antiquated dames went mumping about with much affected indifference and a great deal of real curiosity endeavouring indirectly to get information concerning names and dresses and decorations without daring to show such interest in these vanities as actual questions on the subject might have implied  a stout band of the constables spearmen guarded the gate of the nunnery admitting within the hallowed precinct the few only who were to be present at the solemnity with their principal attendants and while the former were ushered with all due ceremony into the apartments dressed out for the occasion the attendants although detained in the outer court were liberally supplied with refreshments of the most substantial kind and had the amusement so dear to the menial classes of examining and criticising their masters and mistresses as they passed into the interior apartments prepared for their reception  amongst the domestics who were thus employed were old raoul the huntsman and his jolly damehe gay and glorious in a new cassock of green velvet she gracious and comely in a kirtle of yellow silk fringed with minivair and that at no mean cost were equally busied in beholding the gay spectacle the most inveterate wars have their occasional terms of truce the most bitter and boisterous weather its hours of warmth and of calmness and so was it with the matrimonial horizon of this amiable pair which usually cloudy had now for brief space cleared up the splendour of their new apparel the mirth of the spectacle around them with the aid perhaps of a bowl of muscadine quaffed by raoul and a cup of hippocras sipped by his wife had rendered them rather more agreeable in each others eyes than was their wont good cheer being in such cases as oil is to a rusty lock the means of making those valves move smoothly and glibly which otherwise work not together at all or by shrieks and groans express their reluctance to move in union the pair had stuck themselves into a kind of niche three or four steps from the ground which contained a small stone bench whence their curious eyes could scrutinize with advantage every guest who entered the court  thus placed and in their present state of temporary concord raoul with his frosty visage formed no unapt representative of january the bitter father of the year and though gillian was past the delicate bloom of youthful may yet the melting fire of a full black eye and the genial glow of a ripe and crimson cheek made her a lively type of the fruitful and jovial august dame gillian used to make it her boast that she could please every body with her gossip when she chose it from raymond berenger down to robin the horseboy and like a good housewife who to keep her hand in use will sometimes even condescend to dress a dish for her husbands sole eating she now thought proper to practise her powers of pleasing on old raoul fairly conquering in her successful sallies of mirth and satire not only his cynical temperament towards all human kind but his peculiar and special disposition to be testy with his spouse her jokes such as they were and the coquetry with which they were enforced had such an effect on this timon of the woods that he curled up his cynical nose displayed his few straggling teeth like a cur about to bite broke out into a barking laugh which was more like the cry of one of his own houndsstopped short in the explosion as if he had suddenly recollected that it was out of character yet ere he resumed his acrimonious gravity shot such a glance at gillian as made his nutcracker jaws pinched eyes and convolved nose bear no small resemblance to one of those fantastic faces which decorate the upper end of old bass viols  is not this better than laying your dogleash on your loving wife as if she were a brach of the kennel said august to january  in troth is it answered january in a frostbitten toneand so it is also better than doing the brachtricks which bring the leash into exercise  humph said gillian in the tone of one who thought her husbands proposition might bear being disputed but instantly changing the note to that of tender complaint ah raoul she said do you not remember how you once beat me because our late lordour lady assoilzie himtook my crimson breastknot for a peony rose  ay ay said the huntsman i remember our old master would make such mistakesour lady assoilzie him as you saythe best hound will hunt counter  and how could you think dearest raoul to let the wife of thy bosom go so long without a new kirtle said his helpmate  why thou hast got one from our young lady that might serve a countess said raoul his concord jarred by her touching this chordhow many kirtles wouldst thou have  only two kind raoul just that folk may not count their childrens age by the date of dame gillians last new gown  well wellit is hard that a man cannot be in goodhumour once and away without being made to pay for it but thou shalt have a new kirtle at michaelmas when i sell the bucks hides for the season the very antlers should bring a good penny this year  ay ay said gillian i ever tell thee husband the horns would be worth the hide in a fair market  raoul turned briskly round as if a wasp had stung him and there is no guessing what his reply might have been to this seemingly innocent observation had not a gallant horseman at that instant entered the court and dismounting like the others gave his horse to the charge of a squire or equerry whose attire blazed with embroidery  by saint hubert a proper horseman and a destrier for an earl said raoul and my lord constables liveries withalyet i know not the gallant  but i do said gillian it is randal de lacy the constables kinsman and as good a man as ever came of the name  oh by saint hubert i have heard of himmen say he is a reveller and a jangler and a waster of his goods  men lie now and then said gillian dryly  and women also replied raoulwhy methinks he winked on thee just now  that right eye of thine saw never true since our good lordsaint mary rest himflung a cup of wine in thy face for pressing over boldly into his withdrawingroom  i marvel said raoul as if he heard her not that yonder ruffler comes hither i have heard that he is suspected to have attempted the constables life and that they have not spoken together for five years  he comes on my young ladys invitation and that i know full well said dame gillian and he is less like to do the constable wrong than to have wrong at his hand poor gentleman as indeed he has had enough of that already  and who told thee so said raoul bitterly  no matter it was one who knew all about it very well said the dame who began to fear that in displaying her triumph of superior information she had been rather overcommunicative  it must have been the devil or randal himself said raoul for no other mouth is large enough for such a liebut hark ye dame gillian who is he that presses forward next like a man that scarce sees how he goes  even your angel of grace my young squire damian said dame gillian  it is impossible answered raoulcall me blind if thou wilt but i have never seen man so changed in a few weeksand his attire is flung on him so wildly as if he wore a horsecloth round him instead of a mantlewhat can ail the youthhe has made a dead pause at the door as if he saw something on the threshold that debarred his entrancesaint hubert but he looks as if he were elfstricken  you ever thought him such a treasure said gillian and now look at him as he stands by the side of a real gentleman how he stares and trembles as if he were distraught  i will speak to him said raoul forgetting his lameness and springing from his elevated stationi will speak to him and if he be unwell i have my lancets and fleams to bleed man as well as brute  and a fit physician for such a patient muttered gilliana dogleech for a dreamy madman that neither knows his own disease nor the way to cure it  meanwhile the old huntsman made his way towards the entrance before which damian remained standing in apparent uncertainty whether he should enter or not regardless of the crowd around and at the same time attracting their attention by the singularity of his deportment  raoul had a private regard for damiah for which perhaps it was a chief reason that of late his wife had been in the habit of speaking of him in a tone more disrespectful than she usually applied to handsome young men besides he understood the youth was a second sir tristrem in silvan sports by wood and river and there needed no more to fetter raouls soul to him with bands of steel he saw with great concern his conduct attract general notice mixed with some ridicule  he stands said the townjester who had crowded into the gay throng before the gate like balaams ass in the mystery when the animal sees so much more than can be seen by any one else  a cut from raouls ready leash rewarded the felicity of this application and sent the fool howling off to seek a more favourable audience for his pleasantry at the same time raoul pressed up to damian and with an earnestness very different from his usual dry causticity of manner begged him for gods sake not to make himself the general spectacle by standing there as if the devil sat on the doorway but either to enter or what might be as becoming to retire and make himself more fit in apparel for attending on a solemnity so nearly concerning his house  and what ails my apparel old man said damian turning sternly on the huntsman as one who has been hastily and uncivilly roused from a reverie  only with respect to your valour answered the huntsman men do not usually put old mantles over new doublets and methinks with submission that of yours neither accords with your dress nor is fitted for this noble presence  thou art a fool answered damian and as green in wit as gray in years know you not that in these days the young and old consort togethercontract togetherwed together and should we take more care to make our apparel consistent than our actions  for gods sake my lord said raoul forbear these wild and dangerous words they may be heard by other ears than mine and construed by worse interpreters there may be here those who will pretend to track mischief from light words as i would find a buck from his frayings your cheek is pale my lord your eye is blood shot for heavens sake retire  i will not retire said damian with yet more distemperature of manner till i have seen the lady eveline  for the sake of all the saints ejaculated raoul not nowyou will do my lady incredible injury by forcing yourself into her presence in this condition  do you think so said damian the remark seeming to operate as a sedative which enabled him to collect his scattered thoughtsdo you really think soi thought that to have looked upon her once morebut noyou are in the right old man  he turned from the door as if to withdraw but ere he could accomplish his purpose he turned yet more pale than before staggered and fell on the pavement ere raoul could afford him his support useless as that might have proved those who raised him were surprised to observe that his garments were soiled with blood and that the stains upon his cloak which had been criticised by raoul were of the same complexion a gravelooking personage wrapped in a sadcoloured mantle came forth from the crowd  i knew how it would be he said i made venesection this morning and commanded repose and sleep according to the aphorisms of hippocrates but if young gentlemen will neglect the ordinance of their physician medicine will avenge herself it is impossible that my bandage or ligature knit by these fingers should have started but to avenge the neglect of the precepts of art  what means this prate said the voice of the constable before which all others were silent he had been summoned forth just as the rite of espousal or betrothing was concluded on the confusion occasioned by damians situation and now sternly commanded the physician to replace the bandages which had slipped from his nephews arm himself assisting in the task of supporting the patient with the anxious and deeply agitated feelings of one who saw a near and justly valued relativeas yet the heir of his fame and familystretched before him in a condition so dangerous  but the griefs of the powerful and the fortunate are often mingled with impatience of interrupted prosperity what means this he demanded sternly of the leech i sent you this morning to attend my nephew on the first tidings of his illness and commanded that he should make no attempt to be present on this days solemnity yet i find him in this state and in this place  so please your lordship replied the leech with a conscious selfimportance which even the presence of the constable could not subduecuratio est canonica non coacta which signifieth my lord that the physician acteth his cure by rules of art and scienceby advice and prescription but not by force or violence upon the patient who cannot be at all benefited unless he be voluntarily amenable to the orders of his medicum  tell me not of your jargon said de lacy if my nephew was lightheaded enough to attempt to come hither in the heat of a delirious distemper you should have had sense to prevent him had it been by actual force  it may be said randal de lacy joining the crowd who forgetting the cause which had brought them together were now assembled about damian that more powerful was the magnet which drew our kinsman hither than aught the leech could do to withhold him  the constable still busied about his nephew looked up as randal spoke and when he was done asked with formal coldness of manner ha fair kinsman of what magnet do you speak  surely of your nephews love and regard to your lordship answered randal which not to mention his respect for the lady eveline must have compelled him hither if his limbs were able to bear himand here the bride comes i think in charity to thank him for his zeal  what unhappy case is this said the lady eveline pressing forward much disordered with the intelligence of damians danger which had been suddenly conveyed to her is there nothing in which my poor service may avail  nothing lady said the constable rising from beside his nephew and taking her hand your kindness is here mistimed this motley assembly this unseeming confusion become not your presence  unless it could be helpful my lord said eveline eagerly it is your nephew who is in dangermy delivererone of my deliverers i would say  he is fitly attended by his chirurgeon said the constable leading back his reluctant bride to the convent while the medical attendant triumphantly exclaimed  well judgeth my lord constable to withdraw his noble lady from the host of petticoated empirics who like so many amazons break in upon and derange the regular course of physical practice with their petulant prognostics their rash recipes their mithridate their febrifuges their amulets and their charms well speaketh the ethnic poet    non audet nisi qua didicit dare quod medicorum est    promittunt medicitractant fabrilia fabri  as he repeated these lines with much emphasis the doctor permitted his patients arm to drop from his hand that he might aid the cadence with a flourish of his own there said he to the spectators is what none of you understandno by saint luke nor the constable himself  but he knows how to whip in a hound that babbles when he should be busy said raoul and silenced by this hint the chirurgeon betook himself to his proper duty of superintending the removal of young damian to an apartment in the neighbouring street where the symptoms of his disorder seemed rather to increase than diminish and speedily required all the skill and attention which the leech could bestow  the subscription of the contract of marriage had as already noticed been just concluded when the company assembled on the occasion were interrupted by the news of damians illness when the constable led his bride from the courtyard into the apartment where the company was assembled there was discomposure and uneasiness on the countenance of both and it was not a little increased by the bride pulling her hand hastily from the hold of the bridegroom on observing that the latter was stained with recent blood and had in truth left the same stamp upon her own with a faint exclamation she showed the marks to rose saying at the same time what bodes thisis this the revenge of the bloodyfinger already commencing  it bodes nothing my dearest lady said roseit is our fears that are prophets not those trifles which we take for augury for gods sake speak to my lord he is surprised at your agitation  let him ask me the cause himself said eveline fitter it should be told at his bidding than be offered by me unasked  the constable while his bride stood thus conversing with her maiden had also observed that in his anxiety to assist his nephew he had transferred part of his blood from his own hands to evelines dress he came forward to apologize for what at such a moment seemed almost ominous fair lady said he the blood of a true de lacy can never bode aught but peace and happiness to you  eveline seemed as if she would have answered but could not immediately find words the faithful rose at the risk of incurring the censure of being over forward hastened to reply to the compliment every damsel is bound to believe what you say my noble lord was her answer knowing how readily that blood hath ever flowed for protecting the distressed and so lately for our own relief  it is well spoken little one answered the constable and the lady eveline is happy in a maiden who so well knows how to speak when it is her own pleasure to be silentcome lady he added let us hope this mishap of my kinsman is but like a sacrifice to fortune which permits not the brightest hour to pass without some intervening shadow damian i trust will speedily recover and be we mindful that the blooddrops which alarm you have been drawn by a friendly steel and are symptoms rather of recovery than of illnesscome dearest lady your silence discourages our friends and wakes in them doubts whether we be sincere in the welcome due to them let me be your sewer he said and taking a silver ewer and napkin from the standing cupboard which was loaded with plate he presented them on his knee to his bride  exerting herself to shake off the alarm into which she had been thrown by some supposed coincidence of the present accident with the apparition at baldringham eveline entering into her betrothed husbands humour was about to raise him from the ground when she was interrupted by the arrival of a hasty messenger who coming into the room without ceremony informed the constable that his nephew was so extremely ill that if he hoped to see him alive it would be necessary he should come to his lodgings instantly  the constable started up made a brief adieu to eveline and to the guests who dismayed at this new and disastrous intelligence were preparing to disperse themselves when as he advanced towards the door he was met by a paritor or summoner of the ecclesiastical court whose official dress had procured him unobstructed entrance into the precincts of the abbey  deus vobiscum said the paritor i would know which of this fair company is the constable of chester  i am he answered the elder de lacy but if thy business be not the more hasty i cannot now speak with theei am bound on matters of life and death  i take all christian people to witness that i have discharged my duty said the paritor putting into the hand of the constable a slip of parchment  how is this fellow said the constable in great indignation for whom or what does your master the archbishop take me that he deals with me in this uncourteous fashion citing me to compear before him more like a delinquent than a friend or a nobleman  my gracious lord answered the paritor haughtily is accountable to no one but our holy father the pope for the exercise of the power which is intrusted to him by the canons of the church your lordships answer to my citation  is the archbishop present in this city said the constable after a moments reflectioni knew not of his purpose to travel hither still less of his purpose to exercise authority within these bounds  my gracious lord the archbishop said the paritor is but now arrived in this city of which he is metropolitan and besides by his apostolical commission a legate a latere hath plenary jurisdiction throughout all england as those may find whatsoever be their degree who may dare to disobey his summons  hark thee fellow said the constable regarding the paritor with a grim and angry countenance were it not for certain respects which i promise thee thy tawny hood hath little to do with thou wert better have swallowed thy citation seal and all than delivered it to me with the addition of such saucy terms go hence and tell your master i will see him within the space of an hour during which time i am delayed by the necessity of attending a sick relation  the paritor left the apartment with more humility in his manner than when he had entered and left the assembled guests to look upon each other in silence and dismay  the reader cannot fail to remember how severely the yoke of the roman supremacy pressed both on the clergy and laity of england during the reign of henry ii even the attempt of that wise and courageous monarch to make a stand for the independence of his throne in the memorable case of thomas a becket had such an unhappy issue that like a suppressed rebellion it was found to add new strength to the domination of the church since the submission of the king in that illfated struggle the voice of rome had double potency whenever it was heard and the boldest peers of england held it more wise to submit to her imperious dictates than to provoke a spiritual censure which had so many secular consequences hence the slight and scornful manner in which the constable was treated by the prelate baldwin struck a chill of astonishment into the assembly of friends whom he had collected to witness his espousals and as he glanced his haughty eye around he saw that many who would have stood by him through life and death in any other quarrel had it even been with his sovereign were turning pale at the very thought of a collision with the church embarrassed and at the same time incensed at their timidity the constable hasted to dismiss them with the general assurance that all would be wellthat his nephews indisposition was a trifling complaint exaggerated by a conceited physician and by his own want of careand that the message of the archbishop so unceremoniously delivered was but the consequence of their mutual and friendly familiarity which induced them sometimes for the jests sake to reverse or neglect the ordinary forms of intercourseif i wanted to speak with the prelate baldwin on express business and in haste such is the humility and indifference to form of that worthy pillar of the church that i should not fear offence said the constable did i send the meanest horseboy in my troop to ask an audience of him  so he spokebut there was something in his countenance which contradicted his words and his friends and relations retired from the splendid and joyful ceremony of his espousals as from a funeral feast with anxious thoughts and with downcast eyes  randal was the only person who having attentively watched the whole progress of the affair during the evening ventured to approach his cousin as he left the house and asked him in the name of their reunited friendship whether he had nothing to command him assuring him with a look more expressive than his words that he would not find him cold in his service  i have nought which can exercise your zeal fair cousin replied the constable with the air of one who partly questioned the speakers sincerity and the parting reverence with which he accompanied his words left randal no pretext for continuing his attendance as he seemed to have designed     chapter the eighteenth     oh were i seated high as my ambition   id place this naked foot on necks of monarchs      mysterious mother   the most anxious and unhappy moment of hugo de lacys life was unquestionably that in which by espousing eveline with all civil and religious solemnity he seemed to approach to what for some time he had considered as the prime object of his wishes he was assured of the early possession of a beautiful and amiable wife endowed with such advantage of worldly goods as gratified his ambition as well as his affectionsyet even in this fortunate moment the horizon darkened around him in a manner which presaged nought but storm and calamity at his nephews lodging he learned that the pulse of the patient had risen and his delirium had augmented and all around him spoke very doubtfully of his chance of recovery or surviving a crisis which seemed speedily approaching the constable stole towards the door of the apartment which his feelings permitted him not to enter and listened to the raving which the fever gave rise to nothing can be more melancholy than to hear the mind at work concerning its ordinary occupations when the body is stretched in pain and danger upon the couch of severe sickness the contrast betwixt the ordinary state of health its joys or its labours renders doubly affecting the actual helplessness of the patient before whom these visions are rising and we feel a corresponding degree of compassion for the sufferer whose thoughts are wandering so far from his real condition  the constable felt this acutely as he heard his nephew shout the warcry of the family repeatedly appearing by the words of command and direction which he uttered from time to time to be actively engaged in leading his menatarms against the welsh at another time he uttered various terms of the manege of falconry and of the chasehe mentioned his uncles name repeatedly on these occasions as if the idea of his kinsman had been connected alike with his martial encounters and with his sports by wood and river other sounds there were which he muttered so low as to be altogether undistinguishable  with a heart even still more softened towards his kinsmans sufferings from hearing the points on which his mind wandered the constable twice applied his hand to the latch of the door in order to enter the bedroom and twice forebore his eyes running faster with tears than he chose should be witnessed by the attendants at length relinquishing his purpose he hastily left the house mounted his horse and followed only by four of his personal attendants rode towards the palace of the bishop where as he learned from public rumour the archprelate baldwin had taken up his temporary residence  the train of riders and of ledhorses of sumpter mules and of menials and attendants both lay and ecclesiastical which thronged around the gate of the episcopal mansion together with the gaping crowd of inhabitants who had gathered around some to gaze upon the splendid show some to have the chance of receiving the benediction of the holy prelate was so great as to impede the constables approach to the palacedoor and when this obstacle was surmounted he found another in the obstinacy of the archbishops attendants who permitted him not though announced by name and title to cross the threshold of the mansion until they should receive the express command of their master to that effect  the constable felt the full effect of this slighting reception he had dismounted from his horse in full confidence of being instantly admitted into the palace at least if not into the prelates presence and as he now stood on foot among the squires grooms and horseboys of the spiritual lord he was so much disgusted that his first impulse was to remount his horse and return to his pavilion pitched for the time before the city walls leaving it to the bishop to seek him there if he really desired an interview but the necessity of conciliation almost immediately rushed on his mind and subdued the first haughty impulse of his offended pride if our wise king he said to himself hath held the stirrup of one prelate of canterbury when living and submitted to the most degrading observances before his shrine when dead surely i need not be more scrupulous towards his priestly successor in the same overgrown authority another thought which he dared hardly to acknowledge recommended the same humble and submissive course he could not but feel that in endeavouring to evade his vows as a crusader he was incurring some just censure from the church and he was not unwilling to hope that his present cold and scornful reception on baldwins part might be meant as a part of the penance which his conscience informed him his conduct was about to receive  after a short interval de lacy was at length invited to enter the palace of the bishop of gloucester in which he was to meet the primate of england but there was more than one brief pause in hall and anteroom ere he at length was admitted to baldwins presence  the successor of the celebrated becket had neither the extensive views nor the aspiring spirit of that redoubted personage but on the other hand saint as the latter had become it may be questioned whether in his professions for the weal of christendom he was half so sincere as was the present archbishop baldwin was in truth a man well qualified to defend the powers which the church had gained though perhaps of a character too sincere and candid to be active in extending them the advancement of the crusade was the chief business of his life his success the principal cause of his pride and if the sense of possessing the powers of eloquent persuasion and skill to bend the minds of men to his purpose was blended with his religious zeal still the tenor of his life and afterwards his death before ptolemais showed that the liberation of the holy sepulchre from the infidels was the unfeigned object of all his exertions hugo de lacy well knew this and the difficulty of managing such a temper appeared much greater to him on the eve of the interview in which the attempt was to be made than he had suffered himself to suppose when the crisis was yet distant  the prelate a man of a handsome and stately form with features rather too severe to be pleasing received the constable in all the pomp of ecclesiastical dignity he was seated on a chair of oak richly carved with gothic ornaments and placed above the rest of the floor under a niche of the same workmanship his dress was the rich episcopal robe ornamented with costly embroidery and fringed around the neck and cuffs it opened from the throat and in the middle and showed an under vestment of embroidery betwixt the folds of which as if imperfectly concealed peeped the close shirt of haircloth which the prelate constantly wore under all his pompous attire his mitre was placed beside him on an oaken table of the same workmanship with his throne against which also rested his pastoral staff representing a shepherds crook of the simplest form yet which had proved more powerful and fearful than lance or scimetar when wielded by the hand of thomas a becket a chaplain in a white surplice kneeled at a little distance before a desk and read forth from an illuminated volume some portion of a theological treatise in which baldwin appeared so deeply interested that he did not appear to notice the entrance of the constable who highly displeased at this additional slight stood on the floor of the hall undetermined whether to interrupt the reader and address the prelate at once or to withdraw without saluting him at all ere he had formed a resolution the chaplain had arrived at some convenient pause in the lecture where the archbishop stopped him with satis est mi fili  it was in vain that the proud secular baron strove to conceal the embarrassment with which he approached the prelate whose attitude was plainly assumed for the purpose of impressing him with awe and solicitude he tried indeed to exhibit a demeanour of such ease as might characterize their old friendship or at least of such indifference as might infer the possession of perfect tranquillity but he failed in both and his address expressed mortified pride mixed with no ordinary degree of embarrassment the genius of the catholic church was on such occasions sure to predominate over the haughtiest of the laity  i perceive said de lacy collecting his thoughts and ashamed to find he had difficulty in doing soi perceive that an old friendship is here dissolved methinks hugo de lacy might have expected another messenger to summon him to this reverend presence and that another welcome should wait him on his arrival  the archbishop raised himself slowly in his seat and made a half inclination towards the constable who by an instinctive desire of conciliation returned it lower than he had intended or than the scanty courtesy merited the prelate at the same time signing to his chaplain the latter rose to withdraw and receiving permission in the phrase do veniam retreated reverentially without either turning his back or looking upwards his eyes fixed on the ground his hands still folded in his habit and crossed over his bosom  when this mute attendant had disappeared the prelates brow became more open yet retained a dark shade of grave displeasure and he replied to the address of de lacy but still without rising from his seat it skills not now my lord to say what the brave constable of chester has been to the poor priest baldwin or with what love and pride we beheld him assume the holy sign of salvation and to honour him by whom he has himself been raised to honour vow himself to the deliverance of the holy land if i still see that noble lord before me in the same holy resolution let me know the joyful truth and i will lay aside rochet and mitre and tend his horse like a groom if it be necessary by such menial service to show the cordial respect i bear to him  reverend father answered de lacy with hesitation i had hoped that the propositions which were made to you on my part by the dean of hereford might have seemed more satisfactory in your eyes then regaining his native confidence he proceeded with more assurance in speech and manner for the cold inflexible looks of the archbishop irritated him if these proposals can be amended my lord let me know in what points and if possible your pleasure shall be done even if it should prove somewhat unreasonable i would have peace my lord with holy church and am the last who would despise her mandates this has been known by my deeds in field and counsels in the state nor can i think my services have merited cold looks and cold language from the primate of england  do you upbraid the church with your services vain man said baldwin i tell thee hugo de lacy that what heaven hath wrought for the church by thy hand could had it been the divine pleasure have been achieved with as much ease by the meanest horseboy in thy host it is thou that art honoured in being the chosen instrument by which great things have been wrought in israelnay interrupt me noti tell thee proud baron that in the sight of heaven thy wisdom is but as folly thy courage which thou dost boast but the cowardice of a village maidenthy strength weaknessthy spear an osier and thy sword a bulrush  all this i know good father said the constable and have ever heard it repeated when such poor services as i may have rendered are gone and past marry when there was need for my helping hand i was the very good lord of priest and prelate and one who should be honoured and prayed for with patrons and founders who sleep in the choir and under the high altar there was no thought i trow of osier or of bulrush when i have been prayed to couch my lance or draw my weapon it is only when they are needless that they and their owner are undervalued well my reverend father be it so if the church can cast the saracens from the holy land by grooms and horseboys wherefore do you preach knights and nobles from the homes and the countries which they are born to protect and defend  the archbishop looked steadily on him as he replied not for the sake of their fleshly arm do we disturb your knights and barons in their prosecution of barbarous festivities and murderous feuds which you call enjoying their homes and protecting their domains not that omnipotence requires their arm of flesh to execute the great predestined work of liberationbut for the weal of their immortal souls these last words he pronounced with great emphasis  the constable paced the floor impatiently and muttered to himself such is the airy guerdon for which hosts on hosts have been drawn from europe to drench the sands of palestine with their goresuch the vain promises for which we are called upon to barter our country our lands and our lives  is it hugo de lacy speaks thus said the archbishop arising from his seat and qualifying his tone of censure with the appearance of shame and of regretis it he who underprizes the renown of a knightthe virtue of a christianthe advancement of his earthly honourthe more incalculable profit of his immortal soulis it he who desires a solid and substantial recompense in lands or treasures to be won by warring on his less powerful neighbours at home while knightly honour and religious faith his vow as a knight and his baptism as a christian call him to a more glorious and more dangerous strifecan it be indeed hugo de lacy the mirror of the anglonorman chivalry whose thoughts can conceive such sentiments whose words can utter them  flattery and fair speech suitably mixed with taunts and reproaches my lord answered the constable colouring and biting his lip may carry your point with others but i am of a temper too solid to be either wheedled or goaded into measures of importance forbear therefore this strain of affected amazement and believe me that whether he goes to the crusade or abides at home the character of hugo de lacy will remain as unimpeached in point of courage as that of the archbishop baldwin in point of sanctitude  may it stand much higher said the archbishop than the reputation with which you vouchsafe to compare it but a blaze may be extinguished as well as a spark and i tell the constable of chester that the fame which has set on his basnet for so many years may flit from it in one moment never to be recalled  who dares to say so said the constable tremblingly alive to the honour for which he had encountered so many dangers  a friend said the prelate whose stripes should be received as benefits you think of pay sir constable and of guerdon as if you still stood in the market free to chaffer on the terms of your service i tell you you are no longer your own masteryou are by the blessed badge you have voluntarily assumed the soldier of god himself nor can you fly from your standard without such infamy as even coistrels or grooms are unwilling to incur  you deal all too hardly with us my lord said hugo de lacy stopping short in his troubled walk you of the spirituality make us laymen the packhorses of your own concerns and climb to ambitious heights by the help of our overburdened shoulders but all hath its limitsbecket transgressed it and  a gloomy and expressive look corresponded with the tone in which he spoke this broken sentence and the prelate at no loss to comprehend his meaning replied in a firm and determined voice and he was murderedthat is what you dare to hint to me even to me the successor of that glorified saintas a motive for complying with your fickle and selfish wish to withdraw your hand from the plough you know not to whom you address such a threat true becket from a saint militant on earth arrived by the bloody path of martyrdom to the dignity of a saint in heaven and no less true is it that to attain a seat a thousand degrees beneath that of his blessed predecessor the unworthy baldwin were willing to submit under our ladys protection to whatever the worst of wicked men can inflict on his earthly frame  there needs not this show of courage reverend father said lacy recollecting himself where there neither is nor can be danger i pray you let us debate this matter more deliberately i have never meant to break off my purpose for the holy land but only to postpone it methinks the offers that i have made are fair and ought to obtain for me what has been granted to others in the like casea slight delay in the time of my departure  a slight delay on the part of such a leader as you noble de lacy answered the prelate were a deathblow to our holy and most gallant enterprise to meaner men we might have granted the privilege of marrying and giving in marriage even although they care not for the sorrows of jacob but you my lord are a main prop of our enterprise and being withdrawn the whole fabric may fall to the ground who in england will deem himself obliged to press forward when hugo de lacy falls back think my lord less upon your plighted bride and more on your plighted word and believe not that a union can ever come to good which shakes your purpose towards our blessed undertaking for the honour of christendom  the constable was embarrassed by the pertinacity of the prelate and began to give way to his arguments though most reluctantly and only because the habits and opinions of the time left him no means of combating his arguments otherwise than by solicitation i admit he said my engagements for the crusade nor have ii repeat itfarther desire than that brief interval which may be necessary to place my important affairs in order meanwhile my vassals led by my nephew  promise that which is within thy power said the prelate who knows whether in resentment of thy seeking after other things than his most holy cause thy nephew may not be called hence even while we speak together  god forbid said the baron starting up as if about to fly to his nephews assistance then suddenly pausing he turned on the prelate a keen and investigating glance it is not well he said that your reverence should thus trifle with the dangers which threaten my house damian is dear to me for his own good qualitiesdear for the sake of my only brothermay god forgive us both he died when we were in unkindness with each othermy lord your words import that my beloved nephew suffers pain and incurs danger on account of my offences the archbishop perceived he had at length touched the chord to which his refractory penitents heartstrings must needs vibrate he replied with circumspection as well knowing with whom he had to dealfar be it from me to presume to interpret the counsels of heaven but we read in scripture that when the fathers eat sour grapes the teeth of the children are set on edge what so reasonable as that we should be punished for our pride and contumacy by a judgment specially calculated to abate and bend that spirit of surquedry footnote selfimportance or assumption you yourself best know if this disease clung to thy nephew before you had meditated defection from the banner of the cross  hugo de lacy hastily recollected himself and found that it was indeed true that until he thought of his union with eveline there had appeared no change in his nephews health his silence and confusion did not escape the artful prelate he took the hand of the warrior as he stood before him overwhelmed in doubt lest his preference of the continuance of his own house to the rescue of the holy sepulchre should have been punished by the disease which threatened his nephews life come he said noble de lacythe judgment provoked by a moments presumption may be even yet averted by prayer and penitence the dial went back at the prayer of the good king hezekiahdown down upon thy knees and doubt not that with confession and penance and absolution thou mayst yet atone for thy falling away from the cause of heaven  borne down by the dictates of the religion in which he had been educated and by the fears lest his delay was punished by his nephews indisposition and danger the constable sunk on his knees before the prelate whom he had shortly before wellnigh braved confessed as a sin to be deeply repented of his purpose of delaying his departure for palestine and received with patience at least if not with willing acquiescence the penance inflicted by the archbishop which consisted in a prohibition to proceed farther in his proposed wedlock with the lady eveline until he was returned from palestine where he was bound by his vow to abide for the term of three years  and now noble de lacy said the prelate once more my best beloved and most honoured friendis not thy bosom lighter since thou hast thus nobly acquitted thee of thy debt to heaven and cleansed thy gallant spirit from those selfish and earthly stains which dimmed its brightness  the constable sighed my happiest thoughts at this moment he said would arise from knowledge that my nephews health is amended  be not discomforted on the score of the noble damian your hopeful and valorous kinsman said the archbishop for well i trust shortly ye shall hear of his recovery or that if it shall please god to remove him to a better world the passage shall be so easy and his arrival in yonder haven of bliss so speedy that it were better for him to have died than to have lived  the constable looked at him as if to gather from his countenance more certainty of his nephews fate than his words seemed to imply and the prelate to escape being farther pressed on the subject on which he was perhaps conscious he had ventured too far rung a silver bell which stood before him on the table and commanded the chaplain who entered at the summons that he should despatch a careful messenger to the lodging of damian lacy to bring particular accounts of his health  a stranger answered the chaplain just come from the sick chamber of the noble damian lacy waits here even now to have speech of my lord constable  admit him instantly said the archbishopmy mind tells me he brings us joyful tidingsnever knew i such humble penitence such willing resignation of natural affections and desires to the doing of heavens service but it was rewarded with a guerdon either temporal or spiritual  as he spoke a man singularly dressed entered the apartment his garments of various colours and showily disposed were none of the newest or cleanest neither were they altogether fitting for the presence in which he now stood  how now sirrah said the prelate when was it that jugglers and minstrels pressed into the company of such as we without permission  so please you said the man my instant business was not with your reverend lordship but with my lord the constable to whom i will hope that my good news may atone for my evil apparel  speak sirrah does my kinsman live said the constable eagerly  and is like to live my lord answered the mana favourable crisis so the leeches call it hath taken place in his disorder and they are no longer under any apprehensions for his life  now god be praised that hath granted me so much mercy said the constable  amen amen replied the archbishop solemnlyabout what period did this blessed change take place  scarcely a quarter of an hour since said the messenger a soft sleep fell on the sick youth like dew upon a parched field in summerhe breathed freelythe burning heat abatedand as i said the leeches no longer fear for his life  marked you the hour my lord constable said the bishop with exultationeven then you stooped to those counsels which heaven suggested through the meanest of its servants but two words avouching penitencebut one brief prayerand some kind saint has interceded for an instant hearing and a liberal granting of thy petition noble hugo he continued grasping his hand in a species of enthusiasm surely heaven designs to work high things by the hand of him whose faults are thus readily forgivenwhose prayer is thus instantly heard for this shall te deum laudamus be said in each church and each convent in gloucester ere the world be a day older  the constable no less joyful though perhaps less able to perceive an especial providence in his nephews recovery expressed his gratitude to the messenger of the good tidings by throwing him his purse  i thank you noble lord said the man but if i stoop to pick up this taste of your bounty it is only to restore it again to the donor  how now sir said the constable methinks thy coat seems not so well lined as needs make thee spurn at such a guerdon  he that designs to catch larks my lord replied the messenger must not close his net upon sparrowsi have a greater boon to ask of your lordship and therefore i decline your present gratuity  a greater boon ha said the constablei am no knighterrant to bind myself by promise to grant it ere i know its import but do thou come to my pavilion tomorrow and thou wilt not find me unwilling to do what is reason  so saying he took leave of the prelate and returned homeward failing not to visit his nephews lodging as he passed where he received the same pleasant assurances which had been communicated by the messenger of the particoloured mantle     chapter the nineteenth     he was a minstrelin his mood     was wisdom mixd with folly   a tame companion to the good   but wild and fierce among the rude     and jovial with the jolly     archibald armstrong   the events of the preceding day had been of a nature so interesting and latterly so harassing that the constable felt weary as after a severely contested battlefield and slept soundly until the earliest beams of dawn saluted him through the opening of the tent it was then that with a mingled feeling of pain and satisfaction he began to review the change which had taken place in his condition since the preceding morning he had then risen an ardent bridegroom anxious to find favour in the eyes of his fair bride and scrupulous about his dress and appointments as if he had been as young in years as in hopes and wishes this was over and he had now before him the painful task of leaving his betrothed for a term of years even before wedlock had united them indissolubly and of reflecting that she was exposed to all the dangers which assail female constancy in a situation thus critical when the immediate anxiety for his nephew was removed he was tempted to think that he had been something hasty in listening to the arguments of the archbishop and in believing that damians death or recovery depended upon his own accomplishing to the letter and without delay his vow for the holy land how many princes and kings he thought to himself have assumed the cross and delayed or renounced it yet lived and died in wealth and honour without sustaining such a visitation as that with which baldwin threatened me and in what case or particular did such men deserve more indulgence than i but the die is now cast and it signifies little to inquire whether my obedience to the mandates of the church has saved the life of my nephew or whether i have not fallen as laymen are wont to fall whenever there is an encounter of wits betwixt them and those of the spirituality i would to god it may prove otherwise since girding on my sword as heavens champion i might the better expect heavens protection for her whom i must unhappily leave behind me  as these reflections passed through his mind he heard the warders at the entrance of his tent challenge some one whose footsteps were heard approaching it the person stopped on their challenge and presently after was heard the sound of a rote a small species of lute the strings of which were managed by means of a small wheel after a short prelude a manly voice of good compass sung verses which translated into modern language might run nearly thus      i

  up up and arm thee son of terror   be thy bright shield the mornings mirror  when the song was finished the constable heard some talking without and presently philip guarine entered the pavilion to tell that a person come hither as he said by the constables appointment waited permission to speak with him  by my appointment said de lacy admit him immediately  the messenger of the preceding evening entered the tent holding in one hand his small cap and feather in the other the rote on which he had been just playing his attire was fantastic consisting of more than one inner dress of various colours all of the brightest and richest dyes and disposed so as to contrast with each otherthe upper garment was a very short norman cloak in bright green an embroidered girdle sustained in lieu of offensive weapons an inkhorn with its appurtenances on the one side on the other a knife for the purposes of the table his hair was cut in imitation of the clerical tonsure which was designed to intimate that he had arrived to a certain rank in his profession for the joyous science as the profession of minstrelsy was termed had its various ranks like the degrees in the church and in chivalry the features and the manners of the man seemed to be at variance with his profession and habit for as the latter was gay and fantastic the former had a cast of gravity and almost of sternness which unless when kindled by the enthusiasm of his poetical and musical exertions seemed rather to indicate deep reflection than the thoughtless vivacity of observation which characterized most of his brethren his countenance though not handsome had therefore something in it striking and impressive even from its very contrast with the particoloured hues and fluttering shape of his vestments and the constable felt something inclined to patronize him as he said goodmorrow friend and i thank thee for thy morning greeting it was well sung and well meant for when we call forth any one to bethink him how time passes we do him the credit of supposing that he can employ to advantage that flitting treasure  the man who had listened in silence seemed to pause and make an effort ere he replied my intentions at least were good when i ventured to disturb my lord thus early and i am glad to learn that my boldness hath not been evil received at his hand  true said the constable you had a boon to ask of me be speedy and say thy requestmy leisure is short  it is for permission to follow you to the holy land my lord said the man  thou hast asked what i can hardly grant my friend answered de lacythou art a minstrel art thou not  an unworthy graduate of the gay science my lord said the musician yet let me say for myself that i will not yield to the king of minstrels geoffrey rudel though the king of england hath given him four manors for one song i would be willing to contend with him in romance lay or fable were the judge to be king henry himself  you have your own good word doubtless said de lacy nevertheless sir minstrel thou goest not with me the crusade has been already too much encumbered by men of thy idle profession and if thou dost add to the number it shall not be under my protection i am too old to be charmed by thy art charm thou never so wisely  he that is young enough to seek for and to win the love of beauty said the minstrel but in a submissive tone as if fearing his freedom might give offence should not term himself too old to feel the charms of minstrelsy  the constable smiled not insensible to the flattery which assigned to him the character of a younger gallant thou art a jester he said i warrant me in addition to thy other qualities  no replied the minstrel it is a branch of our profession which i have for some time renouncedmy fortunes have put me out of tune for jesting  nay comrade said the constable if thou hast been hardly dealt within the world and canst comply with the rules of a family so strictly ordered as mine it is possible we may agree together better than i thought what is thy name and country thy speech methinks sounds somewhat foreign  i am an armorican my lord from the merry shores of morbihan and hence my tongue hath some touch of my country speech my name is renault vidal  such being the case renault said the constable thou shalt follow me and i will give orders to the master of my household to have thee attired something according to thy function but in more orderly guise than thou now appearest in dost thou understand the use of a weapon  indifferently my lord said the armorican at the same time taking a sword from the wall he drew and made a pass with it so close to the constables body as he sat on the couch that he started up crying villain forbear  la you noble sir replied vidal lowering with all submission the point of his weaponi have already given you a proof of sleight which has alarmed even your experiencei have an hundred other besides  it may be so said de lacy somewhat ashamed at having shown himself moved by the sudden and lively action of the juggler but i love not jesting with edgetools and have too much to do with sword and swordblows in earnest to toy with them so i pray you let us have no more of this but call me my squire and my chamberlain for i am about to array me and go to mass  the religious duties of the morning performed it was the constables intention to visit the lady abbess and communicate with the necessary precautions and qualifications the altered relations in which he was placed towards her niece by the resolution he had been compelled to adopt of departing for the crusade before accomplishing his marriage in the terms of the precontract already entered into he was conscious that it would be difficult to reconcile the good lady to this change of measures and he delayed some time ere he could think of the best mode of communicating and softening the unpleasant intelligence an interval was also spent in a visit to his nephew whose state of convalescence continued to be as favourable as if in truth it had been a miraculous consequence of the constables having complied with the advice of the archbishop  from the lodging of damian the constable proceeded to the convent of the benedictine abbess but she had been already made acquainted with the circumstances which he came to communicate by a still earlier visit from the archbishop baldwin himself the primate had undertaken the office of mediator on this occasion conscious that his success of the evening before must have placed the constable in a delicate situation with the relations of his betrothed bride and willing by his countenance and authority to reconcile the disputes which might ensue perhaps he had better have left hugo de lacy to plead his own cause for the abbess though she listened to the communication with all the respect due to the highest dignitary of the english church drew consequences from the constables change of resolution which the primate had not expected she ventured to oppose no obstacle to de lacys accomplishment of his vows but strongly argued that the contract with her niece should be entirely set aside and each party left at liberty to form a new choice  it was in vain that the archbishop endeavoured to dazzle the abbess with the future honours to be won by the constable in the holy land the splendour of which would attach not to his lady alone but to all in the remotest degree allied to or connected with her all his eloquence was to no purpose though upon so favourite a topic he exerted it to the utmost the abbess it is true remained silent for a moment after his arguments had been exhausted but it was only to consider how she should intimate in a suitable and reverent manner that children the usual attendants of a happy union and the existence of which she looked to for the continuation of the house of her father and brother could not be hoped for with any probability unless the precontract was followed by marriage and the residence of the married parties in the same country she therefore insisted that the constable having altered his intentions in this most important particular the fiancailles should be entirely abrogated and set aside and she demanded of the primate as an act of justice that as he had interfered to prevent the bridegrooms execution of his original purpose he should now assist with his influence wholly to dissolve an engagement which had been thus materially innovated upon  the primate who was sensible he had himself occasioned de lacys breach of contract felt himself bound in honour and reputation to prevent consequences so disagreeable to his friend as the dissolution of an engagement in which his interest and inclinations were alike concerned he reproved the lady abbess for the carnal and secular views which she a dignitary of the church entertained upon the subject of matrimony and concerning the interest of her house he even upbraided her with selfishly preferring the continuation of the line of berenger to the recovery of the holy sepulchre and denounced to her that heaven would be avenged of the shortsighted and merely human policy which postponed the interests of christendom to those of an individual family  after this severe homily the prelate took his departure leaving the abbess highly incensed though she prudently forbore returning any irreverent answer to his paternal admonition  in this humour the venerable lady was found by the constable himself when with some embarrassment he proceeded to explain to her the necessity of his present departure for palestine  she received the communication with sullen dignity her ample black robe and scapular seeming as it were to swell out in yet prouder folds as she listened to the reasons and the emergencies which compelled the constable of chester to defer the marriage which he avowed was the dearest wish of his heart until after his return from the crusade for which he was about to set forth  methinks replied the abbess with much coldness if this communication is meant for earnestand it were no fit business i myself no fit personfor jesting withmethinks the constables resolution should have been proclaimed to us yesterday before the fiancailles had united his troth with that of eveline berenger under expectations very different from those which he now announces  on the word of a knight and a gentleman reverend lady said the constable i had not then the slightest thought that i should be called upon to take a step no less distressing to me than as i see with pain it is unpleasing to you  i can scarcely conceive replied the abbess the cogent reasons which existing as they must have done yesterday have nevertheless delayed their operation until today  i own said de lacy reluctantly that i entertained too ready hopes of obtaining a remission from my vow which my lord of canterbury hath in his zeal for heavens service deemed it necessary to refuse me  at least then said the abbess veiling her resentment under the appearance of extreme coldness your lordship will do us the justice to place us in the same situation in which we stood yesterday morning and by joining with my niece and her friends in desiring the abrogation of a marriage contract entered into with very different views from those which you now entertain put a young person in that state of liberty of which she is at present deprived by her contract with you  ah madam said the constable what do you ask of me and in a tone how cold and indifferent do you demand me to resign hopes the dearest which my bosom ever entertained since the lifeblood warmed it  i am unacquainted with language belonging to such feelings my lord replied the abbess but methinks the prospects which could be so easily adjourned for years might by a little and a very little farther selfcontrol be altogether abandoned  hugo de lacy paced the room in agitation nor did he answer until after a considerable pause if your niece madam shares the sentiments which you have expressed i could not indeed with justice to her or perhaps to myself desire to retain that interest in her which our solemn espousals have given me but i must know my doom from her own lips and if it is as severe as that which your expressions lead me to fear i will go to palestine the better soldier of heaven that i shall have little left on earth that can interest me  the abbess without farther answer called on her praecentrix and desired her to command her nieces attendance immediately the praecentrix bowed reverently and withdrew  may i presume to inquire said de lacy whether the lady eveline hath been possessed of the circumstances which have occasioned this unhappy alteration in my purpose  i have communicated the whole to her from point to point said the abbess even as it was explained to me this morning by my lord of canterbury for with him i have already spoken upon the subject and confirmed but now by your lordships own mouth  i am little obliged to the archbishop said the constable for having forestalled my excuses in the quarter where it was most important for me that they should be accurately stated and favourably received  that said the abbess is but an item of the account betwixt you and the prelateit concerns not us  dare i venture to hope continued de lacy without taking offence at the dryness of the abbesss manner that lady eveline has heard this most unhappy change of circumstances without emotioni would say without displeasure  she is the daughter of a berenger my lord answered the abbess and it is our custom to punish a breach of faith or to contemn itnever to grieve over it what my niece may do in this case i know not i am a woman of religion sequestered from the world and would advise peace and christian forgiveness with a proper sense of contempt for the unworthy treatment which she has received she has followers and vassals and friends doubtless and advisers who may not in blinded zeal for worldly honour recommend to her to sit down slightly with this injury but desire she should rather appeal to the king or to the arms of her fathers followers unless her liberty is restored to her by the surrender of the contract into which she has been enticedbut she comes to answer for herself  eveline entered at the moment leaning on roses arm she had laid aside mourning since the ceremony of the fiancailles and was dressed in a kirtle of white with an upper robe of pale blue her head was covered with a veil of white gauze so thin as to float about her like the misty cloud usually painted around the countenance of a seraph but the face of eveline though in beauty not unworthy one of that angelic order was at present far from resembling that of a seraph in tranquillity of expression her limbs trembled her cheeks were pale the tinge of red around the eyelids expressed recent tears yet amidst these natural signs of distress and uncertainty there was an air of profound resignationa resolution to discharge her duty in every emergence reigning in the solemn expression of her eye and eyebrow and showing her prepared to govern the agitation which she could not entirely subdue and so well were these opposing qualities of timidity and resolution mingled on her cheek that eveline in the utmost pride of her beauty never looked more fascinating than at that instant and hugo de lacy hitherto rather an unimpassioned lover stood in her presence with feelings as if all the exaggerations of romance were realized and his mistress were a being of a higher sphere from whose doom he was to receive happiness or misery life or death  it was under the influence of such a feeling that the warrior dropped on one knee before eveline took the hand which she rather resigned than gave to him pressed it to his lips fervently and ere he parted with it moistened it with one of the few tears which he was ever known to shed but although surprised and carried out of his character by a sudden impulse he regained his composure on observing that the abbess regarded his humiliation if it can be so termed with an air of triumph and he entered on his defence before eveline with a manly earnestness not devoid of fervour nor free from agitation yet made in a tone of firmness and pride which seemed assumed to meet and control that of the offended abbess  lady he said addressing eveline you have heard from the venerable abbess in what unhappy position i have been placed since yesterday by the rigour of the archbishopperhaps i should rather say by his just though severe interpretation of my engagement in the crusade i cannot doubt that all this has been stated with accurate truth by the venerable lady but as i must no longer call her my friend let me fear whether she has done me justice in her commentary upon the unhappy necessity which must presently compel me to leave my country and with my country to foregoat best to postponethe fairest hopes which man ever entertained the venerable lady hath upbraided me that being myself the cause that the execution of yesterdays contract is postponed i would fain keep it suspended over your head for an indefinite term of years no one resigns willingly such rights as yesterday gave me and let me speak a boastful word sooner than yield them up to man of woman born i would hold a fair field against all comers with grinded sword and sharp spear from sunrise to sunset for three days space but what i would retain at the price of a thousand lives i am willing to renounce if it would cost you a single sigh if therefore you think you cannot remain happy as the betrothed of de lacy you may command my assistance to have the contract annulled and make some more fortunate man happy  he would have gone on but felt the danger of being overpowered again by those feelings of tenderness so new to his steady nature that he blushed to give way to them  eveline remained silent the abbess took the word kinswoman she said you hear that the generosityor the justiceof the constable of chester proposes in consequence of his departure upon a distant and perilous expedition to cancel a contract entered into upon the specific and precise understanding that he was to remain in england for its fulfilment you cannot methinks hesitate to accept of the freedom which he offers you with thanks for his bounty for my part i will reserve mine own until i shall see that your joint application is sufficient to win to your purpose his grace of canterbury who may again interfere with the actions of his friend the lord constable over whom he has already exerted so much influencefor the weal doubtless of his spiritual concerns  if it is meant by your words venerable lady said the constable that i have any purpose of sheltering myself behind the prelates authority to avoid doing that which i proclaim my readiness though not my willingness to do i can only say that you are the first who has doubted the faith of hugo de lacyand while the proud baron thus addressed a female and a recluse he could not prevent his eye from sparkling and his cheek from flushing  my gracious and venerable kinswoman said eveline summoning together her resolution and you my kind lord be not offended if i pray you not to increase by groundless suspicions and hasty resentments your difficulties and mine my lord the obligations which i lie under to you are such as i can never discharge since they comprehend fortune life and honour know that in my anguish of mind when besieged by the welsh in my castle of the garde doloureuse i vowed to the virgin that my honour safe i would place myself at the disposal of him whom our lady should employ as her instrument to relieve me from yonder hour of agony in giving me a deliverer she gave me a master nor could i desire a more noble one than hugo de lacy  god forbid lady said the constable speaking eagerly as if he was afraid his resolution should fail ere he could get the renunciation uttered that i should by such a tie to which you subjected yourself in the extremity of your distress bind you to any resolution in my favour which can put force on your own inclinations  the abbess herself could not help expressing her applause of this sentiment declaring it was spoken like a norman gentleman but at the same time her eyes turned towards her niece seemed to exhort her to beware how she declined to profit by the candour of de lacy  but eveline proceeded with her eyes fixed on the ground and a slight colour overspreading her face to state her own sentiments without listening to the suggestions of any one i will own noble sir she said that when your valour had rescued me from approaching destruction i could have wishedhonouring and respecting you as i had done your late friend my excellent fatherthat you could have accepted a daughters service from me i do not pretend entirely to have surmounted these sentiments although i have combated them as being unworthy of me and ungrateful to you but from the moment you were pleased to honour me by a claim on this poor hand i have studiously examined my sentiments towards you and taught myself so far to make them coincide with my duty that i may call myself assured that de lacy would not find in eveline berenger an indifferent far less an unworthy bride in this sir you may boldly confide whether the union you have sought for takes place instantly or is delayed till a longer season still farther i must acknowledge that the postponement of these nuptials will be more agreeable to me than their immediate accomplishment i am at present very young and totally inexperienced two or three years will i trust render me yet more worthy the regard of a man of honour  at this declaration in his favour however cold and qualified de lacy had as much difficulty to restrain his transports as formerly to moderate his agitation  angel of bounty and of kindness he said kneeling once more and again possessing himself of her hand perhaps i ought in honour to resign voluntarily those hopes which you decline to ravish from me forcibly but who could be capable of such unrelenting magnanimitylet me hope that my devoted attachment that which you shall hear of me when at a distancethat which you shall know of me when near youmay give to your sentiments a more tender warmth than they now express and in the meanwhile blame me not that i accept your plighted faith anew under the conditions which you attach to it i am conscious my wooing has been too late in life to expect the animated returns proper to youthful passionblame me not if i remain satisfied with those calmer sentiments which make life happy though they cannot make possession rapturous your hand remains in my grasp but it acknowledges not my pressurecan it be that it refuses to ratify what your lips have said  never noble de lacy said eveline with more animation than she had yet expressed and it appeared that the tone was at length sufficiently encouraging since her lover was emboldened to take the lips themselves for guarantee  it was with an air of pride mingled with respect that after having received this pledge of fidelity he turned to conciliate and to appease the offended abbess i trust venerable mother he said that you will resume your former kind thoughts of me which i am aware were only interrupted by your tender anxiety for the interest of her who should be dearest to us both let me hope that i may leave this fair flower under protection of the honoured lady who is her nest in blood happy and secure as she must ever be while listening to your counsels and residing within these sacred walls  but the abbess was too deeply displeased to be propitiated by a compliment which perhaps it had been better policy to have delayed till a calmer season my lord she said and you fair kinswoman you ought needs to be aware how little my counselsnot frequently given where they are unwillingly listened tocan be of avail to those embarked in worldly affairs i am a woman dedicated to religion to solitude and seclusionto the service in brief of our lady and saint benedict i have been already censured by my superior because i have for love of you fair niece mixed more deeply in secular affairs than became the head of a convent of reclusesi will merit no farther blame on such an account nor can you expect it of me my brothers daughter unfettered by worldly ties had been the welcome sharer of my poor solicitude but this house is too mean for the residence of the vowed bride of a mighty baron nor do i in my lowliness and inexperience feel fitness to exercise over such an one that authority which must belong to me over every one whom this roof protects the grave tenor of our devotions and the serener contemplation to which the females of this house are devoted continued the abbess with increasing heat and vehemence shall not for the sake of my worldly connections be disturbed by the intrusion of one whose thoughts must needs be on the worldly toys of love and marriage  i do indeed believe reverend mother said the constable in his turn giving way to displeasure that a richlydowered maiden unwedded and unlikely to wed were a fitter and more welcome inmate to the convent than one who cannot be separated from the world and whose wealth is not likely to increase the houses revenues  the constable did the abbess great injury in this hasty insinuation and it only went to confirm her purpose of rejecting all charge of her niece during his absence she was in truth as disinterested as haughty and her only reason for anger against her niece was that her advice had not been adopted without hesitation although the matter regarded evelines happiness exclusively  the illtimed reflection of the constable confirmed her in the resolution which she had already and hastily adopted may heaven forgive you sir knight she replied your injurious thoughts of his servants it is indeed time for your souls sake that you do penance in the holy land having such rash judgments to repent offor you my niece you cannot want that hospitality which without verifying or seeming to verify unjust suspicions i cannot now grant to you while you have in your kinswoman of baldringham a secular relation whose nearness of blood approaches mine and who may open her gates to you without incurring the unworthy censure that she means to enrich herself at your cost  the constable saw the deadly paleness which came over evelines cheek at this proposal and without knowing the cause of her repugnance he hastened to relieve her from the apprehensions which she seemed evidently to entertain no reverend mother he said since you so harshly reject the care of your kinswoman she shall not be a burden to any of her other relatives while hugo de lacy hath six gallant castles and many a manor besides to maintain fire upon their hearths his betrothed bride shall burden no one with her society who may regard it as otherwise than a great honour and methinks i were much poorer than heaven hath made me could i not furnish friends and followers sufficient to serve obey and protect her  no my lord said eveline recovering from the dejection into which she had been thrown by the unkindness of her relative since some unhappy destiny separates me from the protection of my fathers sister to whom i could so securely have resigned myself i will neither apply for shelter to any more distant relation nor accept of that which you my lord so generously offer since my doing so might excite harsh and i am sure undeserved reproaches against her by whom i was driven to choose a less advisable dwellingplace i have made my resolution i have it is true only one friend left but she is a powerful one and is able to protect me against the particular evil fate which seems to follow me as well as against the ordinary evils of human life  the queen i suppose said the abbess interrupting her impatiently  the queen of heaven venerable kinswoman answered eveline our lady of the garde doloureuse ever gracious to our house and so lately my especial guardian and protectress methinks since the vowed votaress of the virgin rejects me it is to her holy patroness whom i ought to apply for succour  the venerable dame taken somewhat at unawares by this answer pronounced the interjection umph in a tone better befitting a lollard or an iconoclast than a catholic abbess and a daughter of the house of berenger truth is the lady abbesss hereditary devotion to the lady of the garde doloureuse was much decayed since she had known the full merits of another gifted image the property of her own convent  recollecting herself however she remained silent while the constable alleged the vicinity of the welsh as what might possibly again render the abode of his betrothed bride at the garde doloureuse as perilous as she had on a former occasion found it to this eveline replied by reminding him of the great strength of her native fortressthe various sieges which it had withstoodand the important circumstance that upon the late occasion it was only endangered because in compliance with a point of honour her father raymond had sallied out with the garrison and fought at disadvantage a battle under the walls she farther suggested that it was easy for the constable to name from among his own vassals or hers a seneschal of such approved prudence and valour as might ensure the safety of the place and of its lady  ere de lacy could reply to her arguments the abbess rose and pleading her total inability to give counsel in secular affairs and the rules of her order which called her as she said with a heightened colour and raised voice to the simple and peaceful discharge of her conventual duties she left the betrothed parties in the locutory or parlour without any company save rose who prudently remained at some distance  the issue of their private conference seemed agreeable to both and when eveline told rose that they were to return presently to the garde doloureuse under a sufficient escort and were to remain there during the period of the crusade it was in a tone of heartfelt satisfaction which her follower had not heard her make use of for many days she spoke also highly in praise of the kind acquiescence of the constable in her wishes and of his whole conduct with a warmth of gratitude approaching to a more tender feeling  and yet my dearest lady said rose if you will speak unfeignedly you must i am convinced allow that you look upon this interval of years interposed betwixt your contract and your marriage rather as a respite than in any other light  i confess it said eveline nor have i concealed from my future lord that such are my feelings ungracious as they may seem but it is my youth rose my extreme youth which makes me fear the duties of de lacys wife then those evil auguries hang strangely about me devoted to evil by one kinswoman expelled almost from the roof of another i seem to myself at present a creature who must carry distress with her pass where she will this evil hour and what is more the apprehensions of it will give way to time when i shall have attained the age of twenty rose i shall be a fullgrown woman with all the soul of a berenger strong within me to overcome those doubts and tremors which agitate the girl of seventeen  ah my sweet mistress answered rose may god and our lady of the garde doloureuse guide all for the bestbut i would that this contract had not taken place or having taken place that it could have been fulfilled by your immediate union     chapter the twentieth      the kiugr calld down his merry men all    by one and by two and three    earl marshal was wont to be the foremost man    but the hindmost man was he    old ballad   if the lady eveline retired satisfied and pleased from her private interview with de lacy the joy on the part of the constable rose to a higher pitch of rapture than he was in the habit of feeling or expressing and it was augmented by a visit of the leeches who attended his nephew from whom he received a minute and particular account of his present disorder with every assurance of a speedy recovery  the constable caused alms to be distributed to the convents and to the poor masses to be said and tapers to be lighted he visited the archbishop and received from him his full approbation of the course which he proposed to pursue with the promise that out of the plenary power which he held from the pope the prelate was willing in consideration of his instant obedience to limit his stay in the holy land to the term of three years to become current from his leaving britain and to include the space necessary for his return to his native country indeed having succeeded in the main point the archbishop judged it wise to concede every inferior consideration to a person of the constables rank and character whose goodwill to the proposed expedition was perhaps as essential to its success as his bodily presence  in short the constable returned to his pavilion highly satisfied with the manner in which he had extricated himself from those difficulties which in the morning seemed almost insuperable and when his officers assembled to disrobe him for great feudal lords had their levees and couchees in imitation of sovereign princes he distributed gratuities amongst them and jested and laughed in a much gayer humour than they had ever before witnessed  for thee he said turning to vidal the minstrel who sumptuously dressed stood to pay his respects among the other attendants i will give thee nought at present but do thou remain by my bedside until i am asleep and i will next morning reward thy minstrelsy as i like it  my lord said vidal i am already rewarded both by the honour and by the liveries which better befit a royal minstrel than one of my mean fame but assign me a subject and i will do my best not out of greed of future largess but gratitude for past favours  gramercy good fellow said the constable guarine he added addressing his squire let the watch be posted and do thou remain within the tentstretch thyself on the bearhide and sleep or listen to the minstrelsy as thou likest best thou thinkest thyself a judge i have heard of such gear  it was usual in those insecure times for some faithful domestic to sleep at night within the tent of every great baron that if danger arose he might not be unsupported or unprotected guarine accordingly drew his sword and taking it in his hand stretched himself on the ground in such a manner that on the slightest alarm he could spring up sword in hand his broad black eyes in which sleep contended with a desire to listen to the music were fixed on vidal who saw them glittering in the reflection of the silver lamp like those of a dragon or a basilisk  after a few preliminary touches on the chords of his rote the minstrel requested of the constable to name the subject on which he desired the exercise of his powers  the truth of woman answered hugo de lacy as he laid his head upon his pillow  after a short prelude the minstrel obeyed by singing nearly as follows     womans faith and womans trust    write the characters in dust    stamp them on the running stream    print them on the moons pale best    and each evanescent letter    shall be clearer firmer better    and more permanent i ween    than the thing those letters mean     i have straind the spiders thread    gainst the promise of a maid    i have weighd a grain of sand    gainst her plight of heart and hand    i told my true love of the token    how her faith proved light and her word was broken    again her word and truth she plight    and i believed them again ere night  how now sir knave said the constable raising himself on his elbow from what drunken rhymer did you learn that halfwitted satire  from an old ragged crossgrained friend of mine called experience answered vidal i pray heaven he may never take your lordship or any other worthy man under his tuition  go to fellow said the constable in reply thou art one of those wiseacres i warrant me that would fain be thought witty because thou canst make a jest of those things which wiser men hold worthy of most worshipthe honour of men and the truth of women dost thou call thyself a minstrel and hast no tale of female fidelity  i had right many a one noble sir but i laid them aside when i disused my practice of the jesting part of the joyous science nevertheless if it pleases your nobleness to listen i can sing you an established lay upon such a subject  de lacy made a sign of acquiescence and laid himself as if to slumber while vidal began one of those interminable and almost innumerable adventures concerning that paragon of true lovers fair ysolte and of the constant and uninterrupted faith and affection which she displayed in numerous situations of difficulty and peril to her paramour the gallant sir tristrem at the expense of her less favoured husband the luckless king mark of cornwall to whom as all the world knows sir tristrem was nephew  this was not the lay of love and fidelity which de lacy would have chosen but a feeling like shame prevented his interrupting it perhaps because he was unwilling to yield to or acknowledge the unpleasing sensations excited by the tenor of the tale he soon fell asleep or feigned to do so and the harper continuing for a time his monotonous chant began at length himself to feel the influence of slumber his words and the notes which he continued to touch upon the harp were broken and interrupted and seemed to escape drowsily from his fingers and voice at length the sounds ceased entirely and the minstrel seemed to have sunk into profound repose with his head reclining on his breast and one arm dropped down by his side while the other rested on his harp his slumber however was not very long and when he awoke from it and cast his eyes around him reconnoitering by the light of the nightlamp whatever was in the tent he felt a heavy hand which pressed his shoulder as if gently to solicit his attention at the same time the voice of the vigilant philip guarine whispered in his ear thine office for the night is endeddepart to thine own quarters with all the silence thou mayst  the minstrel wrapt himself in his cloak without reply though perhaps not without feeling some resentment at a dismissal so unceremonious     chapter the twentyfirst     oh then i see queen mab has been with you     romeo and juliet   the subject on which the mind has last been engaged at night is apt to occupy our thoughts even during slumber when imagination uncorrected by the organs of sense weaves her own fantastic web out of whatever ideas rise at random in the sleeper it is not surprising therefore that de lacy in his dreams had some confused idea of being identified with the unlucky mark of cornwall and that he awakened from such unpleasant visions with a brow more clouded than when he was preparing for his couch on the evening before he was silent and seemed lost in thought while his squire assisted at his levee with the respect now only paid to sovereigns guarine at length he said know you the stout fleming who was said to have borne him so well at the siege of the garde doloureusea tall big brawny man  surely my lord answered his squire i know wilkin flammocki saw him but yesterday  indeed replied the constablehere meanest thouin this city of gloucester  assuredly my good lord he came hither partly about his merchandise partly i think to see his daughter rose who is in attendance on the gracious young lady eveline  he is a stout soldier is he not  like most of his kinda rampart to a castle but rubbish in the field said the norman squire  faithful also is he not continued the constable  faithful as most flemings while you can pay for their faith replied guarine wondering a little at the unusual interest taken in one whom he esteemed a being of an inferior order when after some farther inquiries the constable ordered the flemings attendance to be presently commanded  other business of the morning now occurred for his speedy departure required many arrangements to be hastily adopted when as the constable was giving audience to several officers of his troops the bulky figure of wilkin flammock was seen at the entrance of the pavilion in jerkin of white cloth and having only a knife by his side  leave the tent my masters said de lacy but continue in attendance in the neighbourhood for here comes one i must speak to in private the officers withdrew and the constable and fleming were left alone you are wilkin mammock who fought well against the welsh at the garde doloureuse  i did my best my lord answered wilkini was bound to it by my bargain and i hope ever to act like a man of credit  methinks said the constable that you so stout of limb and as i hear so bold in spirit might look a little higher than this weaving trade of thine  no one is reluctant to mend his station my lord said wilkin yet i am so far from complaining of mine that i would willingly consent it should never be better on condition i could be assured it were never worse  nay but flammock said the constable i mean higher things for you than your modesty apprehendsi mean to leave thee in a charge of great trust  let it concern bales of drapery my lord and no one will perform it better said the fleming  away thou art too lowly minded said the constable what thinkst thou of being dubbed knight as thy valour well deserves and left as chattelain of the garde doloureuse  for the knighthood my lord i should crave your forgiveness for it would sit on me like a gilded helmet on a hog for any charge whether of castle or cottage i trust i might discharge it as well as another  i fear me thy rank must be in some way mended said the constable surveying the unmilitary dress of the figure before him it is at present too mean to befit the protector and guardian of a young lady of high birth and rank  i the guardian of a young lady of birth and rank said flammock his light large eyes turning larger lighter and rounder as he spoke  even thou said the constable the lady eveline proposes to take up her residence in her castle of the garde doloureuse i have been casting about to whom i may intrust the keeping of her person as well as of the stronghold were i to choose some knight of name as i have many in my household he would be setting about to do deeds of vassalage upon the welsh and engaging himself in turmoils which would render the safety of the castle precarious or he would be absent on feats of chivalry tournaments and hunting parties or he would perchance have shows of that light nature under the walls or even within the courts of the castle turning the secluded and quiet abode which becomes the situation of the lady eveline into the misrule of a dissolute revelthee i can confide inthou wilt fight when it is requisite yet wilt not provoke danger for the sake of danger itselfthy birth thy habits will lead thee to avoid those gaieties which however fascinating to others cannot but be distasteful to theethy management will be as regular as i will take care that it shall be honourable and thy relation to her favourite rose will render thy guardianship more agreeable to the lady eveline than perchance one of her own rankand to speak to thee a language which thy nation readily comprehends the reward fleming for the regular discharge of this most weighty trust shall be beyond thy most flattering hope  the fleming had listened to the first part of this discourse with an expression of surprise which gradually gave way to one of deep and anxious reflection he gazed fixedly on the earth for a minute after the constable had ceased speaking and then raising up his eyes suddenly said it is needless to seek for roundabout excuses this cannot be your earnest my lordbut if it is the scheme is naught  how and wherefore asked the constable with displeased surprise  another man may grasp at your bounty continued wilkin and leave you to take chance of the value you were to receive for it but i am a downright dealer i will not take payment for service i cannot render  but i demand once more wherefore thou canst not or rather wilt not accept this trust said the constable surely if i am willing to confer such confidence it is well thy part to answer it  true my lord said the fleming but methinks the noble lord de lacy should feel and the wise lord de lacy should foresee that a flemish weaver is no fitting guardian for his plighted bride think her shut up in yonder solitary castle under such respectable protection and reflect how long the place will be solitary in this land of love and of adventure we shall have minstrels singing ballads by the threave under our windows and such twangling of harps as would be enough to frighten our walls from their foundations as clerks say happened to those of jerichowe shall have as many knightserrant around us as ever had charlemagne or king arthur mercy on me a less matter than a fine and noble recluse immuredso will they term itin a tower under the guardianship of an old flemish weaver would bring half the chivalry in england round us to break lances vow vows display loveliveries and i know not what follies besidesthink you such gallants with the blood flying through their veins like quicksilver would much mind my bidding them begone  draw bolts up with the drawbridge drop portcullis said the constable with a constrained smile  and thinks your lordship such gallants would mind these impediments such are the very essence of the adventures which they come to seekthe knight of the swan would swim through the moathe of the eagle would fly over the wailshe of the thunderbolt would burst open the gates  ply crossbow and mangonel said de lacy  and be besieged in form said the fleming like the castle of tintadgel in the old hangings all for the love of fair ladyand then those gay dames and demoiselles who go upon adventure from castle to castle from tournament to tournament with bare bosoms flaunting plumes poniards at their sides and javelins in their hands chattering like magpies and fluttering like jays and ever and anon cooing like doveshow am i to exclude such from the lady evelines privacy  by keeping doors shut i tell thee answered the constable still in the same tone of forced jocularity a wooden bar will be thy warrant  ay but answered flammock if the flemish weaver say shut when the norman young lady says open think which has best chance of being obeyed at a word my lord for the matter of guardianship and such like i wash my hands of iti would not undertake to be guardian to the chaste susannah though she lived in an enchanted castle which no living thing could approach  thou holdest the language and thoughts said de lacy of a vulgar debauchee who laughs at female constancy because he has lived only with the most worthless of the sex yet thou shouldst know the contrary having as i know a most virtuous daughter  whose mother was not less so said wilkin breaking in upon the constables speech with somewhat more emotion than he usually displayed but law my lord gave me authority to govern and direct my wife as both law and nature give me power and charge over my daughter that which i can govern i can be answerable for but how to discharge me so well of a delegated trust is another questionstay at home my good lord continued the honest fleming observing that his speech made some impression upon de lacy let a fools advice for once be of avail to change a wise mans purpose taken let me say in no wise hour remain in your own land rule your own vassals and protect your own bride you only can claim her cheerful love and ready obedience and sure i am that without pretending to guess what she may do if separated from you she will under your own eye do the duty of a faithful and a loving spouse  and the holy sepulchre said the constable with a sigh his heart confessing the wisdom of the advice which circumstances prevented him from following  let those who lost the holy sepulchre regain it my lord replied flammock if those latins and greeks as they call them are no better men than i have heard it signifies very little whether they or the heathen have the country that has cost europe so much blood and treasure in good faith said the constable there is sense in what thou sayst but i caution thee to repeat it not lest thou be taken for a heretic or a jew for me my word and oath are pledged beyond retreat and i have only to consider whom i may best name for that important station which thy caution hasnot without some shadow of reasoninduced thee to decline  there is no man to whom your lordship can so naturally or honourably transfer such a charge said wilkin flammock as to the kinsman near to you and possessed of your trust yet much better would it be were there no such trust to be reposed in any one  if said the constable by my near kinsman you mean randal de lacy i care not if i tell you that i consider him as totally worthless and undeserving of honourable confidence  nay i mean another said flammock nearer to you by blood and unless i greatly mistake much nigher also in affectioni had in mind your lordships nephew damian de lacy  the constable started as if a wasp had stung him but instantly replied with forced composure damian was to have gone in my stead to palestineit now seems i must go in his for since this last illness the leeches have totally changed their minds and consider that warmth of the climate as dangerous which they formerly decided to be salutary but our learned doctors like our learned priests must ever be in the right change their counsels as they may and we poor laymen still in the wrong i can it is true rely on damian with the utmost confidence but he is young flammockvery youngand in that particular resembles but too nearly the party who might be otherwise committed to his charge  then once more my lord said the plainspoken fleming remain at home and be yourself the protector of what is naturally so dear to you  once more i repeat that i cannot answered the constable the step which i have adopted as a great duty may perhaps be a great errori only know that it is irretrievable  trust your nephew then my lord replied wilkinhe is honest and true and it is better trusting young lions than old wolves he may err perhaps but it will not be from premeditated treachery  thou art right flammock said the constable and perhaps i ought to wish i had sooner asked thy counsel blunt as it is but let what has passed be a secret betwixt us and bethink thee of something that may advantage thee more than the privilege of speaking about my affairs  that account will be easily settled my lord replied flammock for my object was to ask your lordships favour to obtain certain extensions of our privileges in yonder wild corner where we flemings have made our retreat  thou shalt have them so they be not exorbitant said the constable and the honest fleming among whose good qualities scrupulous delicacy was not the foremost hastened to detail with great minuteness the particulars of his request or petition long pursued in vain but to which this interview was the means of insuring success  the constable eager to execute the resolution which he had formed hastened to the lodging of damian de lacy and to the no small astonishment of his nephew intimated to him his change of destination alleging his own hurried departure damians late and present illness together with the necessary protection to be afforded to the lady eveline as reasons why his nephew must needs remain behind himto represent him during his absenceto protect the family rights and assert the family honour of the house of de lacyabove all to act as the guardian of the young and beautiful bride whom his uncle and patron had been in some measure compelled to abandon for a time  damian yet occupied his bed while the constable communicated this change of purpose perhaps he might think the circumstance fortunate that in this position he could conceal from his uncles observation the various emotions which he could not help feeling while the constable with the eagerness of one who is desirous of hastily finishing what he has to say on an unpleasant subject hurried over an account of the arrangements which he had made in order that his nephew might have the means of discharging with sufficient effect the important trust committed to him  the youth listened as to a voice in a dream which he had not the power of interrupting though there was something within him which whispered there would be both prudence and integrity in remonstrating against his uncles alteration of plan something he accordingly attempted to say when the constable at length paused but it was too feebly spoken to shake a resolution fully though hastily adopted and explicitly announced by one not in the use to speak before his purpose was fixed or to alter it when it was declared  the remonstrance of damian besides if it could be termed such was spoken in terms too contradictory to be intelligible in one moment he professed his regret for the laurels which he had hoped to gather in palestine and implored his uncle not to alter his purpose but permit him to attend his banner thither and in the next sentence he professed his readiness to defend the safety of lady eveline with the last drop of his blood de lacy saw nothing inconsistent in these feelings though they were for the moment contradictory to each other it was natural he thought that a young knight should be desirous to win honournatural also that he should willingly assume a charge so honourable and important as that with which he proposed to invest him and therefore he thought that it was no wonder that assuming his new office willingly the young man should yet feel regret at losing the prospect of honourable adventure which he must abandon he therefore only smiled in reply to the broken expostulations of his nephew and having confirmed his former arrangement left the young man to reflect at leisure on his change of destination while he himself in a second visit to the benedictine abbey communicated the purpose which he had adopted to the abbess and to his brideelect  the displeasure of the former lady was in no measure abated by this communication in which indeed she affected to take very little interest she pleaded her religious duties and her want of knowledge of secular affairs if she should chance to mistake the usages of the world yet she had always she said understood that the guardians of the young and beautiful of her own sex were chosen from the more mature of the other  your own unkindness lady answered the constable leaves me no better choice than i have made since the lady evelines nearest friends deny her the privilege of their roof on account of the claim with which she has honoured me i on my side were worse than ungrateful did i not secure for her the protection of my nearest male heir damian is young but he is true and honourable nor does the chivalry of england afford me a better choice  eveline seemed surprised and even struck with consternation at the resolution which her bridegroom thus suddenly announced and perhaps it was fortunate that the remark of the lady abbess made the answer of the constable necessary and prevented him from observing that her colour shifted more than once from pale to deep red rose who was not excluded from the conference drew close up to her mistress and by affecting to adjust her veil while in secret she strongly pressed her hand gave her time and encouragement to compose her mind for a reply it was brief and decisive and announced with a firmness which showed that the uncertainty of the moment had passed away or been suppressed in case of danger she said she would not fail to apply to damian de lacy to come to her aid as he had once done before but she did not apprehend any danger at present within her own secure castle of the garde doloureuse where it was her purpose to dwell attended only by her own household she was resolved she continued in consideration of her peculiar condition to observe the strictest retirement which she expected would not be violated even by the noble young knight who was to act as her guardian unless some apprehension for her safety made his visit unavoidable  the abbess acquiesced though coldly in a proposal which her ideas of decorum recommended and preparations were hastily made for the lady evelines return to the castle of her father two interviews which intervened before her leaving the convent were in their nature painful the first was when damian was formally presented to her by his uncle as the delegate to whom he had committed the charge of his own property and which was much dearer to him as he affirmed the protection of her person and interest  eveline scarce trusted herself with one glance but that single look comprehended and reported to her the ravage which disease aided by secret grief had made on the manly form and handsome countenance of the youth before her she received his salutation in a manner as embarrassed as that in which it was made and to his hesitating proffer of service answered that she trusted only to be obliged to him for his goodwill during the interval of his uncles absence  her parting with the constable was the next trial which she was to undergo it was not without emotion although she preserved her modest composure and de lacy his calm gravity of deportment his voice faltered however when he came to announce that it were unjust she should be bound by the engagement which she had been graciously contented to abide under three years he had assigned for its term to which space the archbishop baldwin had consented to shorten the period of his absence if i appear not when these are elapsed he said let the lady eveline conclude that the grave holds de lacy and seek out for her mate some happier man she cannot find one more grateful though there are many who better deserve her  on these terms they parted and the constable speedily afterwards embarking ploughed the narrow seas for the shores of flanders where he proposed to unite his forces with the count of that rich and warlike country who had lately taken the cross and to proceed by the route which should be found most practicable on their destination for the holy land the broad pennon with the arms of the lacys streamed forward with a favourable wind from the prow of the vessel as if pointing to the quarter of the horizon where its renown was to be augmented and considering the fame of the leader and the excellence of the soldiers who followed him a more gallant band in proportion to their numbers never went to avenge on the saracens the evils endured by the latins of palestine  meanwhile eveline after a cold parting with the abbess whose offended dignity had not yet forgiven the slight regard which she had paid to her opinion resumed her journey homeward to her paternal castle where her household was to be arranged in a manner suggested by the constable and approved of by herself  the same preparations were made for her accommodation at every halting place which she had experienced upon her journey to gloucester and as before the purveyor was invisible although she could be at little loss to guess his name yet it appeared as if the character of these preparations was in some degree altered all the realities of convenience and accommodation with the most perfect assurances of safety accompanied her every where on the route but they were no longer mingled with that display of tender gallantry and taste which marked that the attentions were paid to a young and beautiful female the clearest fountainhead and the most shady grove were no longer selected for the noontide repast but the house of some franklin or a small abbey afforded the necessary hospitality all seemed to be ordered with the most severe attention to rank and decorumit seemed as if a nun of some strict order rather than a young maiden of high quality and a rich inheritance had been journeying through the land and eveline though pleased with the delicacy which seemed thus to respect her unprotected and peculiar condition would sometimes think it unnecessary that by so many indirect hints it should be forced on her recollection  she thought it strange also that damian to whose care she had been so solemnly committed did not even pay his respects to her on the road something there was which whispered to her that close and frequent intercourse might be unbecomingeven dangerous but surely the ordinary duties of a knight and gentleman enjoined him some personal communication with the maiden under his escort were it only to ask if her accommodations had been made to her satisfaction or if she had any special wish which was ungratified the only intercourse however which took place betwixt them was through means of amelot damian de lacys youthful page who came at morning and evening to receive evelines commands concerning their route and the hours of journey and repose  these formalities rendered the solitude of evelines return less endurable and had it not been for the society of rose she would have found herself under an intolerably irksome degree of constraint she even hazarded to her attendant some remarks upon the singularity of de lacys conduct who authorized as he was by his situation seemed yet as much afraid to approach her as if she had been a basilisk  rose let the first observation of this nature pass as if it had been unheard but when her mistress made a second remark to the same purpose she answered with the truth and freedom of her character though perhaps with less of her usual prudence damian de lacy judges well noble lady he to whom the safe keeping of a royal treasure is intrusted should not indulge himself too often by gazing upon it  eveline blushed wrapt herself closer in her veil nor did she again during their journey mention the name of damian de lacy  when the gray turrets of the garde doloureuse greeted her sight on the evening of the second day and she once more beheld her fathers banner floating from its highest watchtower in honour of her approach her sensations were mingled with pain but upon the whole she looked towards that ancient home as a place of refuge where she might indulge the new train of thoughts which circumstances had opened to her amid the same scenes which had sheltered her infancy and childhood  she pressed forward her palfrey to reach the ancient portal as soon as possible bowed hastily to the wellknown faces which showed themselves on all sides but spoke to no one until dismounting at the chapel door she had penetrated to the crypt in which was preserved the miraculous painting there prostrate on the ground she implored the guidance and protection of the holy virgin through those intricacies in which she had involved herself by the fulfilment of the vow which she had made in her anguish before the same shrine if the prayer was misdirected its purport was virtuous and sincere nor are we disposed to doubt that it attained that heaven towards which it was devoutly addressed     chapter the twentysecond      the virgins image fallsyet some i ween    not unforgiven the suppliant knee might bend    as to a visible power in which might blend    all that was mixd and reconciled in her    of mothers love with maidens purity    of high with low celestial with terrene      wordsworth   the household of the lady eveline though of an establishment becoming her present and future rank was of a solemn and sequestered character corresponding to her place of residence and the privacy connected with her situation retired as she was from the class of maidens who are yet unengaged and yet not united with that of matrons who enjoy the protection of a married name her immediate female attendants with whom the reader is already acquainted constituted almost her whole society the garrison of the castle besides household servants consisted of veterans of tried faith the followers of berenger and of de lacy in many a bloody field to whom the duties of watching and warding were as familiar as any of their more ordinary occupations and whose courage nevertheless tempered by age and experience was not likely to engage in any rash adventure or accidental quarrel these men maintained a constant and watchful guard commanded by the steward but under the eye of father aldrovand who besides discharging his ecclesiastical functions was at times pleased to show some sparkles of his ancient military education  whilst this garrison afforded security against any sudden attempt on the part of the welsh to surprise the castle a strong body of forces were disposed within a few miles of the garde doloureuse ready on the least alarm to advance to defend the place against any more numerous body of invaders who undeterred by the fate of gwenwyn might have the hardihood to form a regular siege to this band which under the eye of damian de lacy himself was kept in constant readiness for action could be added on occasion all the military force of the marches comprising numerous bodies of flemings and other foreigners who held their establishments by military tenure  while the fortress was thus secure from hostile violence the life of its inmates was so unvaried and simple as might have excused youth and beauty for wishing for variety even at the expense of some danger the labours of the needle were only relieved by a walk round the battlements where eveline as she passed arm in arm with rose received a military salute from each sentinel in turn or in the courtyard where the caps and bonnets of the domestics paid her the same respect which she received above from the pikes and javelins of the warders did they wish to extend their airing beyond the castle gate it was not sufficient that doors and bridges were to be opened and lowered there was besides an escort to get under arms who on foot or horseback as the case might require attended for the security of the lady evelines person without this military attendance they could not in safety move even so far as the mills where honest wilkln flammock his warlike deeds forgotten was occupied with his mechanical labours but if a farther disport was intended and the lady of the garde doloureuse proposed to hunt or hawk for a few hours her safety was not confided to a guard so feeble as the garrison of the castle might afford it was necessary that raoul should announce her purpose to damian by a special messenger despatched the evening before that there might be time before daybreak to scour with a body of light cavalry the region in which she intended to take her pleasure and sentinels were placed in all suspicious places while she continued in the field in truth she tried upon one or two occasions to make an excursion without any formal annunciation of her intention but all her purposes seemed to be known to damian as soon as they were formed and she was no sooner abroad than parties of archers and spearmen from his camp were seen scouring the valleys and guarding the mountainpass and damians own plume was usually beheld conspicuous among the distant soldiers  the formality of these preparations so much allayed the pleasure derived from the sport that eveline seldom resorted to amusement which was attended with such bustle and put in motion so many persons  the day being worn out as it best might in the evening father aldrovand was wont to read out of some holy legend or from the homilies of some departed saint such passages as he deemed fit for the hearing of his little congregation sometimes also he read and expounded a chapter of the holy scripture but in such cases the good mans attention was so strangely turned to the military part of the jewish history that he was never able to quit the books of judges and of kings together with the triumphs of judas maccabeus although the manner in which he illustrated the victories of the children of israel was much more amusing to himself than edifying to his female audience  sometimes but rarely rose obtained permission for a strolling minstrel to entertain an hour with his ditty of love and chivalry sometimes a pilgrim from a distant shrine repaid by long tales of the wonders which he had seen in other lands the hospitality which the garde doloureuse afforded and sometimes also it happened that the interest and intercession of the tiringwoman obtained admission for travelling merchants or pedlars who at the risk of their lives found profit by carrying from castle to castle the materials of rich dresses and female ornaments  the usual visits of mendicants of jugglers of travelling jesters are not to be forgotten in this list of amusements and though his nation subjected him to close watch and observation even the welsh bard with his huge harp strung with horsehair was sometimes admitted to vary the uniformity of their secluded life but saving such amusements and saving also the regular attendance upon the religious duties at the chapel it was impossible for life to glide away in more wearisome monotony than at the castle of the garde doloureuse since the death of its brave owner to whom feasting and hospitality seemed as natural as thoughts of honour and deeds of chivalry the gloom of a convent might be said to have enveloped the ancient mansion of raymond berenger were it not that the presence of so many armed warders stalking in solemn state on the battlements gave it rather the aspect of a stateprison and the temper of the inhabitants gradually became infected by the character of their dwelling  the spirits of eveline in particular felt a depression which her naturally lively temper was quite inadequate to resist and as her ruminations became graver had caught that calm and contemplative manner which is so often united with an ardent and enthusiastical temperament she meditated deeply upon the former accidents of her life nor can it be wondered that her thoughts repeatedly wandered back to the two several periods on which she had witnessed or supposed that she had witnessed a supernatural appearance then it was that it often seemed to her as if a good and evil power strove for mastery over her destiny  solitude is favourable to feelings of selfimportance and it is when alone and occupied only with their own thoughts that fanatics have reveries and imagined saints lose themselves in imaginary ecstasies with eveline the influence of enthusiasm went not such a length yet it seemed to her as if in the vision of the night she saw sometimes the aspect of the lady of the garde doloureuse bending upon her glances of pity comfort and protection sometimes the ominous form of the saxon castle of baldringbam holding up the bloody hand as witness of the injuries with which she had been treated while in life and menacing with revenge the descendant of her murderer  on awaking from such dreams eveline would reflect that she was the last branch of her housea house to which the tutelage and protection of the miraculous image and the enmity and evil influence of the revengeful vanda had been peculiarly attached for ages it seemed to her as if she were the prize for the disposal of which the benign saint and vindictive fiend were now to play their last and keenest game  thus thinking and experiencing little interruption of her meditations from any external circumstance of interest and amusement she became pensive absent wrapt herself up in contemplations which withdrew her attention from the conversation around her and walked in the world of reality like one who is still in a dream when she thought of her engagement with the constable of chester it was with resignation but without a wish and almost without an expectation that she would be called upon to fulfil it she had accomplished her vow by accepting the faith of her deliverer in exchange for her own and although she held herself willing to redeem the pledgenay would scarce confess to herself the reluctance with which she thought of doing soyet it is certain that she entertained unavowed hopes that our lady of the garde doloureuse would not be a severe creditor but satisfied with the readiness she had shown to accomplish her vow would not insist upon her claim in its full rigour it would have been the blackest ingratitude to have wished that her gallant deliverer whom she had so much cause to pray for should experience any of those fatalities which in the holy land so often changed the laurelwreath into cypress but other accidents chanced when men had been long abroad to alter those purposes with which they had left home  a strolling minstrel who sought the garde doloureuse had recited for the amusement of the lady and household the celebrated lay of the count of gleichen who already married in his own country laid himself under so many obligations in the east to a saracen princess through whose means he achieved his freedom that he married her also the pope and his conclave were pleased to approve of the double wedlock in a case so extraordinary and the good count of gleichen shared his nuptial bed between two wives of equal rank and now sleeps between them under the same monument the commentaries of the inmates of the castle had been various and discrepant upon this legend father aldrovand considered it as altogether false and an unworthy calumny on the head of the church in affirming his holiness would countenance such irregularity old margery with the tender heartedness of an ancient nurse wept bitterly for pity during the tale and never questioning either the power of the pope or the propriety of his decision was pleased that a mode of extrication was found for a complication of love distresses which seemed almost inextricable dame gillian declared it unreasonable that since a woman was only allowed one husband a man should under any circumstances be permitted to have two wives while raoul glancing towards her a look of verjuice pitied the deplorable idiocy of the man who could be fool enough to avail himself of such a privilege  peace all the rest of you said the lady eveline and do you my dear rose tell me your judgment upon the count of gleichen and his two wives  rose blushed and replied she was not much accustomed to think of such matters but that in her apprehension the wife who could be contented with but one half of her husbands affections had never deserved to engage the slightest share of them  thou art partly right rose said eveline and methinks the european lady when she found herself outshone by the young and beautiful foreign princess would have best consulted her own dignity in resigning the place and giving the holy father no more trouble than in annulling the marriage as has been done in cases of more frequent occurrence  this she said with an air of indifference and even gaiety which intimated to her faithful attendant with how little effort she herself could have made such a sacrifice and served to indicate the state of her affections towards the constable but there was another than the constable on whom her thoughts turned more frequently though involuntarily than perhaps in prudence they should have done  the recollections of damian de lacy had not been erased from evelines mind they were indeed renewed by hearing his name so often mentioned and by knowing that he was almost constantly in the neighbourhood with his whole attention fixed upon her convenience interest and safety whilst on the other hand so far from waiting on her in person he never even attempted by a direct communication with herself to consult her pleasure even upon what most concerned her  the messages conveyed by father aldrovand or by rose to amelot damians page while they gave an air of formality to their intercourse which eveline thought unnecessary and even unkind yet served to fix her attention upon the connection between them and to keep it ever present to her memory the remark by which rose had vindicated the distance observed by her youthful guardian sometimes arose to her recollection and while her soul repelled with scorn the suspicion that in any case his presence whether at intervals or constantly could be prejudicial to his uncles interest she conjured up various arguments for giving him a frequent place in her memorywas it not her duty to think of damian often and kindly as the constables nearest best beloved and most trusted relativewas he not her former deliverer and her present guardianand might he not be considered as an instrument specially employed by her divine patroness in rendering effectual the protection with which she had graced her in more than one emergency  evelines mind mutinied against the restrictions which were laid on their intercourse as against something which inferred suspicion and degradation like the compelled seclusion to which she had heard the paynim infidels of the east subjected their females why should she see her guardian only in the benefits which he conferred upon her and the cares he took for her safety and hear his sentiments only by the mouth of others as if one of them had been infected with the plague or some other fatal or infectious disorder which might render their meeting dangerous to the otherand if they did meet occasionally what else could be the consequence save that the care of a brother towards a sister of a trusty and kind guardian to the betrothed bride of his near relative and honoured patron might render the melancholy seclusion of the garde doloureuse more easy to be endured by one so young in years and though dejected by present circumstances naturally so gay in temper  yet though this train of reasoning appeared to eveline when tracing it in her own mind so conclusive that she several times resolved to communicate her view of the case to rose flammock it so chanced that whenever she looked on the calm steady blue eye of the flemish maiden and remembered that her unblemished faith was mixed with a sincerity and plain dealing proof against every consideration she feared lest she might be subjected in the opinion of her attendant to suspicions from which her own mind freed her and her proud norman spirit revolted at the idea of being obliged to justify herself to another when she stood self acquitted to her own mind let things be as they are she said and let us endure all the weariness of a life which might be so easily rendered more cheerful rather than that this zealous but punctilious friend should in the strictness and nicety of her feelings on my account conceive me capable of encouraging an intercourse which could lead to a less worthy thought of me in the mind of the most scrupulous of manor of womankind but even this vacillation of opinion and resolution tended to bring the image of the handsome young damian more frequently before the lady evelines fancy than perhaps his uncle had he known it would altogether have approved of in such reflections however she never indulged long ere a sense of the singular destiny which had hitherto attended her led her back into the more melancholy contemplations from which the buoyancy of her youthful fancy had for a short time emancipated her     chapter the twentythird      ours is the skie    where at what fowl we please our hawk shall flie      randolph   one bright september morning old raoul was busy in the mews where he kept his hawks grumbling all the while to himself as he surveyed the condition of each bird and blaming alternately the carelessness of the underfalconer and the situation of the building and the weather and the wind and all things around him for the dilapidation which time and disease had made in the neglected hawking establishment of the garde doloureuse while in these unpleasing meditations he was surprised by the voice of his beloved dame gillian who seldom was an early riser and yet more rarely visited him when he was in his sphere of peculiar authority raoul raoul where art thou manever to seek for when thou canst make aught of advantage for thyself or me  and what wantst thou dame said raoul what means thy screaming worse than the seagull before wet weather a murrain on thy voice it is enough to fray every hawk from the perch  hawk answered dame gillian it is time to be looking for hawks when here is a cast of the bravest falcons come hither for sale that ever flew by lake brook or meadow  kites like her that brings the news said raoul  no nor kestrils like him that hears it replied gillian but brave jerfalcons with large nares strongly armed and beaks short and something bluish  pshaw with thy jargonwhere came they from said raoul interested in the tidings but unwilling to give his wife the satisfaction of seeing that he was so  from the isle of man replied gillian  they must be good then though it was a woman brought tidings of them said raoul smiling grimly at his own wit then leaving the mews he demanded to know where this famous falconmerchant was to be met withal  why between the barriers and the inner gate replied gillian where other men are admitted that have wares to utterwhere should he be  and who let him in demanded the suspicious raoul  why master steward thou owl said gillian he came but now to my chamber and sent me hither to call you  oh the stewardthe stewardi might have guessed as much and he came to thy chamber doubtless because he could not have as easily come hither to me himselfwas it not so sweetheart  i do not know why he chose to come to me rather than to you raoul said gillian and if i did know perhaps i would not tell you go tomiss your bargain or make your bargain i care not whichthe man will not wait for youhe has good proffers from the seneschal of malpas and the welsh lord of dinevawr  i comei come said raoul who felt the necessity of embracing this opportunity of improving his hawking establishment and hastened to the gate where he met the merchant attended by a servant who kept in separate cages the three falcons which he offered for sale  the first glance satisfied raoul that they were of the best breed in europe and that if their education were in correspondence to their race there could scarce be a more valuable addition even to a royal mews the merchant did not fail to enlarge upon all their points of excellence the breadth of their shoulders the strength of their train their full and fierce dark eyes the boldness with which they endured the approach of strangers and the lively spirit and vigour with which they pruned their plumes and shook or as it was technically termed roused themselves he expatiated on the difficulty and danger with which they were obtained from the rock of ramsey on which they were bred and which was an every unrivalled even on the coast of norway  raoul turned apparently a deaf ear to all these commendations friend merchant said he i know a falcon as well as thou dost and i will not deny that thine are fine ones but if they be not carefully trained and reclaimed i would rather have a gosshawk on my perch than the fairest falcon that ever stretched wing to weather  i grant ye said the merchant but if we agree on the price for that is the main matter thou shalt see the birds fly if thou wilt and then buy them or not as thou likest i am no true merchant if thou ever sawst birds beat them whether at the mount or the stoop  that i call fair said raoul if the price be equally so  it shall be corresponding said the hawkmerchant for i have brought six casts from the island by the good favour of good king reginald of man and i have sold every feather of them save these and so having emptied my cages and filled my purse i desire not to be troubled longer with the residue and if a good fellow and a judge as thou seemest to be should like the hawks when he has seen them fly he shall have the price of his own making  go to said raoul we will have no blind bargains my lady if the hawks be suitable is more able to pay for them than thou to give them away will a bezant be a conformable price for the cast  a bezant master falconerby my faith you are no bold bodesman nevertheless double your offer and i will consider it  if the hawks are well reclaimed said raoul i will give you a bezant and a half but i will see them strike a heron ere i will be so rash as to deal with you  it is well said the merchant and i had better take your offer than be longer cumbered with them for were i to carry them into wales i might get paid in a worse fashion by some of their long kniveswill you to horse presently  assuredly said raoul and though march be the fitter month for hawking at the heron yet i will show you one of these frogpeckers for the trouble of riding the matter of a mile by the waterside  content sir falconer said the merchant but are we to go alone or is there no lord or lady in the castle who would take pleasure to see a piece of game gallantly struck i am not afraid to show these hawks to a countess my lady used to love the sport well enough said raoul but i wot not why she is moped and mazed ever since her fathers death and lives in her fair castle like a nun in a cloister without disport or revelry of any kind nevertheless gillian thou canst do something with her good now do a kind deed for once and move her to come out and look on this mornings sportthe poor heart hath seen no pastime this summer  that i will do quoth gillian and moreover i will show her such a new ridingtire for the head that no woman born could ever look at without the wish to toss it a little in the wind  as gillian spoke it appeared to her jealouspated husband that he surprised a glance of more intelligence exchanged betwixt her and the trader than brief acquaintance seemed to warrant even when allowance was made for the extreme frankness of dame gillians disposition he thought also that on looking more closely at the merchant his lineaments were not totally unknown to him and proceeded to say to him dryly we have met before friend but i cannot call to remembrance where  like enough said the merchant i have used this country often and may have taken money of you in the way of trade if i were in fitting place i would gladly bestow a bottle of wine to our better acquaintance  not so fast friend said the old huntsman ere i drink to better acquaintance with any one i must be well pleased with what i already know of him we will see thy hawks fly and if their breeding match thy bragging we may perhaps crush a cup together and here come grooms and equerries in faithmy lady has consented to come forth  the opportunity of seeing this rural pastime had offered itself to eveline at a time when the delightful brilliancy of the day the temperance of the air and the joyous work of harvest proceeding in every direction around made the temptation to exercise almost irresistible  as they proposed to go no farther than the side of the neighbouring river near the fatal bridge over which a small guard of infantry was constantly maintained eveline dispensed with any farther escort and contrary to the custom of the castle took no one in her train save rose and gillian and one or two servants who led spaniels or carried appurtenances of the chase raoul the merchant and an equerry attended her of course each holding a hawk on his wrist and anxiously adjusting the mode in which they should throw them off so as best to ascertain the extent of their powers and training  when these important points had been adjusted the party rode down the river carefully looking on every side for the object of their game but no heron was seen stalking on the usual haunts of the bird although there was a heronry at no great distance  few disappointments of a small nature are more teasing than that of a sportsman who having set out with all means and appliances for destruction of game finds that there is none to be met with because he conceives himself with his full shooting trim and his empty gamepouch to be subjected to the sneer of every passing rustic the party of the lady eveline felt all the degradation of such disappointment  a fair country this said the merchant where on two miles of river you cannot find one poor heron  it is the clatter those dd flemings make with their watermills and fullingmills said raoul they destroy good sport and good company wherever they come but were my lady willing to ride a mile or so farther to the red pool i could show you a long shanked fellow who would make your hawks cancelier till their brains were giddy  the red pool said rose thou knowest it is more than three miles beyond the bridge and lies up towards the hills  ay ay said raoul another flemish freak to spoil pastime they are not so scarce on the marches these flemish wenches that they should fear being hawked at by welsh haggards  raoul is right rose answered eveline it is absurd to be cooped uplike birds in a cage when all around us has been so uniformly quiet i am determined to break out of bounds for once and see sport in our old fashion without being surrounded with armed men like prisoners of state we will merrily to the red pool wench and kill a heron like free maids of the marches  let me but tell my father at least to mount and follow us said rosefor they were now near the reestablished manufacturing houses of the stout fleming  i care not if thou dost rose said eveline yet credit me girl we will be at the red pool and thus far on our way home again ere thy father has donned his best doublet girded on his twohanded sword and accoutred his strong flanderkin elephant of a horse which he judiciously names slothnay frown not and lose not in justifying thy father the time that may be better spent in calling him out  rose rode to the mills accordingly when wilkin flammock at the command of his liege mistress readily hastened to get his steel cap and habergeon and ordered halfadozen of his kinsmen and servants to get on horseback rose remained with him to urge him to more despatch than his methodical disposition rendered natural to him but in spite of all her efforts to stimulate him the lady eveline had passed the bridge more than half an hour ere her escort was prepared to follow her  meanwhile apprehensive of no evil and riding gaily on with the sensation of one escaped from confinement eveline moved forward on her lively jennet as light as a lark the plumes with which dame gillian had decked her ridingbonnet dancing in the wind and her attendants galloping behind her with dogs pouches lines and all other appurtenances of the royal sport of hawking after passing the river the wild greensward path which they pursued began to wind upward among small eminences sometimes bare and craggy sometimes overgrown with hazel sloethorn and other dwarf shrubs and at length suddenly descending brought them to the verge of a mountain rivulet that like a lamb at play leapt merrily from rock to rock seemingly uncertain which way to run  this little stream was always my favourite dame gillian said eveline and now methinks it leaps the lighter that it sees me again  ah lady said dame gillian whose turn for conversation never extended in such cases beyond a few phrases of gross flattery many a fair knight would leap shoulderheight for leave to look on you as free as the brook may more especially now that you have donned that ridingcap which in exquisite delicacy of invention methinks is a bowshot before aught that i ever inventedwhat thinkest thou raoul  i think answered her wellnatured helpmate that womens tongues were contrived to drive all the game out of the country here we come near to the spot where we hope to speed or no where wherefore pray my sweet lady be silent yourself and keep your followers as much so as their natures will permit while we steal along the bank of the pool under the wind with our hawks hoods cast loose all ready for a flight  as he spoke they advanced about a hundred yards up the brawling stream until the little vale through which it flowed making a very sudden turn to one side showed them the red pool the superfluous water of which formed the rivulet itself  this mountainlake or tarn as it is called in some countries was a deep basin of about a mile in circumference but rather oblong than circular on the side next to our falconers arose a ridge of rock of a dark red hue giving name to the pool which reflecting this massive and dusky barrier appeared to partake of its colour on the opposite side was a heathy hill whose autumnal bloom had not yet faded from purple to russet its surface was varied by the dark green furze and the fern and in many places gray cliffs or loose stones of the same colour formed a contrast to the ruddy precipice to which they lay opposed a natural road of beautiful sand was formed by a beach which extending all the way around the lake separated its waters from the precipitous rock on the one hand and on the other from the steep and broken hill and being no where less than five or six yards in breadth and in most places greatly more offered around its whole circuit a tempting opportunity to the rider who desired to exercise and breathe the horse on which he was mounted the verge of the pool on the rocky side was here and there strewed with fragments of large size detached from the precipice above but not in such quantity as to encumber this pleasant horsecourse many of these rocky masses having passed the margin of the water in their fall lay immersed there like small islets and placed amongst a little archipelago the quick eye of raoul detected the heron which they were in search of  a moments consultation was held to consider in what manner they should approach the sad and solitary bird which unconscious that itself was the object of a formidable ambuscade stood motionless on a stone by the brink of the lake watching for such small fish or waterreptiles as might chance to pass by its lonely station a brief debate took place betwixt raoul and the hawkmerchant on the best mode of starting the quarry so as to allow lady eveline and her attendants the most perfect view of the flight the facility of killing the heron at the far jettee or at the jettee ferrethat is upon the hither or farther sid of the pool was anxiously debated in language of breathless importance as if some great and perilous enterprise was about to be executed  at length the arrangements were fixed and the party began to advance towards the aquatic hermit who by this time aware of their approach drew himself up to his full height erected his long lean neck spread his broad fanlike wings uttered his usual clanging cry and projecting his length of thin legs far behind him rose upon the gentle breeze it was then with a loud whoop of encouragement that the merchant threw off the noble hawk he bore having first unhooded her to give her a view of her quarry  eager as a frigate in chase of some rich galleon darted the falcon towards the enemy which she had been taught to pursue while preparing for defence if he should be unable to escape by flight the heron exerted all his powers of speed to escape from an enemy so formidable plying his almost unequalled strength of wing he ascended high and higher in the air by short gyrations that the hawk might gain no vantage ground for pouncing at him while his spiked beak at the extremity of so long a neck as enabled him to strike an object at a yards distance in every direction possessed for any less spirited assailant all the terrors of a moorish javelin  another hawk was now thrown off and encouraged by the halloos of the falconer to join her companion both kept mounting or scaling the air as it were by a succession of small circles endeavoring to gain that superior height which the heron on his part was bent to preserve and to the exquisite delight of the spectators the contest was continued until all three were wellnigh mingled with the fleecy clouds from which was occasionally heard the harsh and plaintive cry of the quarry appealing as it were to the heaven which he was approaching against the wanton cruelty of those by whom he was persecuted  at length on of the falcons had reached a pitch from which she ventured to stoop at the heron but so judiciously did the quarry maintain his defence as to receive on his beak the stroke which the falcon shooting down at full descent had made against his right wing so that one of his enemies spiked through the body by his own weight fell fluttering into the lake very near the land on the side farthest from the falconers and perished there  there goes a gallant falcon to the fishes said raoul merchant thy cake is dough  even as he spoke however the remaining bird had avenged the fate of her sister for the success which the heron met with on one side did not prevent his being assailed on the other wing and the falcon stooping boldly and grappling with or as it is called in falconry binding his prey both came tumbling down together from a great height in the air it was then no small object on the part of the falconers to come in as soon as possible lest the falcon should receive hurt from the beak or talons of the heron and the whole party the men setting spurs and the females switching their palfreys went off like the wind sweeping along the fair and smooth beach betwixt the rock and the water  lady eveline far better mounted than any of her train her spirits elated by the sport and by the speed at which she moved was much sooner than any of her attendants at the spot where the falcon and heron still engaged in their mortal struggle lay fighting upon the moss the wing of the latter having been broken by the stoop of the former the duty of a falconer in such a crisis was to run in and assist the hawk by thrusting the herons bill into the earth and breaking his legs and thus permitting the falcon to dispatch him on easy terms  neither would the sex nor quality of the lady eveline have excused her becoming second to the falcon in this cruel manner but just as she had dismounted for that purpose she was surprised to find herself seized on by wild form who exclaimed in welsh that he seized her as a waif for hawking on the demesnes of dawfyd with the one eye at the same time many other welshmen to the number of more than a score showed themselves from behind crags and bushes all armed at point with the axes called welsh hooks long knives darts and bows and arrows  eveline screamed to her attendants for assistance and at the same time made use of what welsh phrases she possessed to move the fears or excite the compassion of the outlawed mountaineers for she doubted not that she had fallen under the power of such a party when she found her requests were unheeded and she perceived it was their purpose to detain her prisoner she disdained to use farther entreaties but demanded at their peril that they should treat her with respect promising in that case that she would pay them a large ransom and threatening them with the vengeance of the lords marchers and particularly of sir damian de lacy if they ventured to use her otherwise  the men seemed to understand her and although they proceeded to tie a bandage over her eyes and to bind her arms with her own veil yet they observed in these acts of violence a certain delicacy and attention both to her feelings and her safety which led her to hope that her request had had some effect on them they secured her to the saddle of her palfrey and led her away with them through the recesses of the hills while she had the additional distress to hear behind her the noise of a conflict occasioned by the fruitless efforts of her retinue to procure her rescue  astonishment had at first seized the hawking party when they saw from some distance their sport interrupted by a violent assault on their mistress old raoul valiantly put spurs to his horse and calling on the rest to follow him to the rescue rode furiously towards the banditti but having no other arms save a hawking pole and short sword he and those who followed him in his meritorious but ineffectual attempt were easily foiled and raoul and one or two of the foremost severely beaten the banditti exercising upon them their own poles till they were broken to splinters but generously abstaining from the use of more dangerous weapons the rest of the retinue completely discouraged dispersed to give the alarm and the merchant and dame gillian remained by the lake filling the air with shrieks of useless fear and sorrow the outlaws meanwhile drawing together in a body shot a few arrows at the fugitives but more to alarm than to injure them and then marched off in a body as if to cover their companions who had gone before with the lady eveline in their custody     chapter the twentyfourth      four ruffians seized me yester morn    alas a maiden most forlorn    they choked my cries with wicked might    and bound me on a palfrey white     coleridge   such adventures as are now only recorded in works of mere fiction were not uncommon in the feudal ages when might was so universally superior to right and it followed that those whose conditions exposed them to frequent violence were more prompt in repelling and more patient in enduring it than could otherwise have been expected from their sex and age  the lady eveline felt that she was a prisoner nor was she devoid of fears concerning the purposes of this assault but she suffered neither her alarm nor the violence with which she was hurried along to deprive her of the power of observing and reflecting from the noise of hoofs which now increased around she concluded that the greater part of the ruffians by whom she had been seized had betaken themselves to their horses this she knew was consonant to the practice of the welsh marauders who although the small size and slightness of their nags made them totally unfit for service in battle availed themselves of their activity and sureness of foot to transport them with the necessary celerity to and from the scenes of their rapine ensuring thus a rapid and unperceived approach and a secure and speedy retreat these animals traversed without difficulty and beneath the load of a heavy soldier the wild mountain paths by which the country was intersected and in one of which lady eveline berenger concluded she was now engaged from the manner in which her own palfrey supported by a man on foot at either rein seemed now to labour up some precipice and anon to descend with still greater risk on the other side  at one of those moments a voice which she had not yet distinguished addressed her in the anglonorman language and asked with apparent interest if she sat safely on her saddle offering at the same time to have her accoutrements altered at her pleasure and convenience  insult not my condition with the mention of safety said eveline you may well believe that i hold my safety altogether irreconcilable with these deeds of violence if i or my vassals have done injury to any of the gymry footnote cymbri or welsh let me know and it shall be amendedif it is ransom which you desire name the sum and i will send an order to treat for it but detain me not prisoner for that can but injure me and will avail you nothing  the lady eveline answered the voice still in a tone of courtesy inconsistent with the violence which she sustained will speedily find that our actions are more rough than purposes  if you know who i am said eveline you cannot doubt that this atrocity will be avengedyou must know by whose banner my lands are at present protected  under de lacys answered the voice with a tone of indifference be it sofalcons fear not falcons  at this moment there was a halt and a confused murmur arose amongst those around her who had hitherto been silent unless when muttering to each other in welsh and as briefly as possible directions which way to hold or encouragement to use haste  these murmurs ceased and there was a pause of several minutes at length eveline again heard the voice which formerly addressed her giving directions which she could not understand he then spoke to herself you will presently see he said whether i have spoken truly when i said i scorned the ties by which you are fettered but you are at once the cause of strife and the reward of victory your safety must be cared for as time will admit and strange as the mode of protection is to which we are to intrust you i trust the victor in the approaching struggle will find you uninjured  do not for the sake of the blessed virgin let there be strife and bloodshed said eveline rather unbind my eyes and let me speak to those whose approach you dread if friends as it would seem to me i will be the means of peace between you  i despise peace replied the speaker i have not undertaken a resolute and daring adventure to resign it as a child doth his plaything at the first frown of fortune please to alight noble lady or rather be not offended that i thus lift you from thy seat and place you on the greensward  as he spoke eveline felt herself lifted from her palfrey and placed carefully and safely on the ground in a sitting posture a moment after the same peremptory valet who had aided her to dismount disrobed her of her cap the masterpiece of dame gillian and of her upper mantle i must yet farther require you said the bandit leader to creep on hands and knees into this narrow aperture believe me i regret the nature of the singular fortification to which i commit your person for safety  eveline crept forwards as directed conceiving resistance to be of no avail and thinking that compliance with the request of one who spoke like a person of consequence might find her protection against the unbridled fury of the welsh to whom she was obnoxious as being the cause of gwenwyns death and the defeat of the britons under the walls of the garde doloureuse  she crept then forwards through a narrow and damp passage built on either side with rough stones and so low that she could not have entered it in any other posture when she had proceeded about two or three yards the passage opened into a concavity or apartment high enough to permit her to sit at her ease and of irregular but narrow dimensions at the same time she became sensible from the noise which she heard behind her that the ruffians were stopping up the passage by which she had been thus introduced into the bowels of the earth she could distinctly hear the clattering of stone with which they closed the entrance and she became sensible that the current of fresh air which had rushed through the opening was gradually failing and that the atmosphere of the subterranean apartment became yet more damp earthy and oppressive than at first  at this moment came a distant sound from without in which eveline thought she could distinguish cries blows the trampling of horse the oaths shouts and screams of the combatants but all deadened by the rude walls of her prison into a confused hollow murmur conveying such intelligence to her ears as we may suppose the dead to hear from the world they have quitted  influenced by desperation under circumstances so dreadful eveline struggled for liberty with such frantic energy that she partly effected her purpose by forcing her arms from the bonds which confined them but this only convinced her of the impossibility to escape for rending off the veil which wrapped her head she found herself in total darkness and flinging her arms hastily around her she discovered she was cooped up in a subterranean cavern of very narrow dimensions her hands which groped around encountered only pieces of decayed metal and a substance which at another moment would have made her shudder being in truth the mouldering bones of the dead at present not even this circumstance could add to her fears immured as she seemed to be to perish by a strange and subterranean death while her friends and deliverers were probably within a few yards of her she flung her arms wildly around in search of some avenue of escape but every effort she made for liberating herself from the ponderous circumvallation was as ineffectual as if directed against the dome of a cathedral  the noise by which her ears were at first assailed increased rapidly and at one moment it seemed as if the covering of the vault under which she lay sounded repeatedly to blows or the shock of substances which had fallen or been thrown against it it was impossible that a human brain could have withstood these terrors operating upon it so immediately but happily this extremity lasted not long sounds more hollow and dying away in distance argued that one or other of the parties had retreated and at length all was silent  eveline was now left to the undisturbed contemplation of her own disastrous situation the fight was over and as circumstances led her to infer her own friends were conquerors for otherwise the victor would have relieved her from her place of confinement and carried her away captive with him as his words had menaced but what could the success of her faithful friends and followers avail eveline who pent up under a place of concealment which whatever was its character must have escaped their observation was left on the field of battle to become again the prize of the enemy should their band venture to return or die in darkness and privation a death as horrid as ever tyrant invented or martyr underwent and which the unfortunate young lady could not even bear to think of without a prayer that her agony might at least be shortened  in this hour of dread she recollected the poniard which she wore and the dark thought crossed her mind that when life became hopeless a speedy death was at least within her reach as her soul shuddered at so dreadful an alternative the question suddenly occurred might not this weapon be put to a more hallowed use and aid her emancipation instead of abridging her sufferings  this hope once adopted the daughter of raymond berenger hastened to prove the experiment and by repeated efforts succeeded though with difficulty in changing her posture so as to admit of her inspecting her place of confinement all around but particularly the passage by which she had entered and by which she now attempted again to return to the light of day she crept to the extremity and found it as she expected strongly blocked up with large stones and earth rammed together in such a manner as nearly to extinguish all hope of escape the work however had been hastily performed and life and liberty were prizes to stimulate exertion with her poniard she cleared away the earth and sods with her hands little accustomed to such labour she removed several stones and advanced in her task so far as to obtain a glimmering of light and what was scarce less precious a supply of purer air but at the same time she had the misfortune to ascertain that from the size and massiveness of a huge stone which closed the extremity of the passage there was no hope that her unassisted strength could effect her extrication yet her condition was improved by the admission of air and light as well as by the opportunity afforded of calling out for assistance  such cries indeed were for some time uttered in vainthe field had probably been left to the dead and the dying for low and indistinct groans were the only answer which she received for several minutes at length as she repeated her exclamation a voice faint as that of one just awakened from a swoon pronounced these words in answeredris of the earthen house dost thou call from thy tomb to the wretch who just hastens to his ownare the boundaries broken down which connect me with the livingand do i already hear with fleshly ears the faint and screaming accents of the dead  it is no spirit who speaks replied eveline overjoyed at finding she could at least communicate her existence to a living personno spirit but a most unhappy maiden eveline berenger by name immured beneath this dark vault and in danger to perish horribly unless god send me rescue  eveline berenger exclaimed he whom she addressed in the accents of wonder it is impossiblei watched her green mantle i watched her plumy bonnet as i saw her hurried from the field and felt my own inability to follow to the rescue nor did force or exertion altogether leave me till the waving of the robe and the dancing of the feathers were lost to my eyes and all hope of rescuing her abandoned my heart  faithful vassal or right true friend or courteous stranger whichsoever i may name thee answered eveline know thou hast been abused by the artifices of these welsh bandittithe mantle and headgear of eveline berenger they have indeed with them and may have used them to mislead those true friends who like thee are anxious for my fate wherefore brave sir devise some succour if thou canst for thyself and me since i dread that these ruffians when they shall have escaped immediate pursuit will return hither like the robber to the hoard where he has deposited his stolen booty  now the holy virgin be praised said the wounded man that i can spend the last breath of my life in thy just and honourable service i would not before blow my bugle lest i recalled from the pursuit to the aid of my worthless self some of those who might be effectually engaged in thy rescue may heaven grant that the recall may now be heard that my eyes may yet see the lady eveline in safety and liberty  the words though spoken in a feeble tone breathed a spirit of enthusiasm and were followed by the blast of a horn faintly winded to which no answer was made save the echoing of the dell a sharper and louder blast was then sent forth but sunk so suddenly that it seemed the breath of him who sounded the instrument had failed in the efforta strange thought crossed evelines mind even in that moment of uncertainty and terror that she said was the note of a de lacysurely you cannot be my gentle kinsman sir damian  i am that unhappy wretch deserving of death for the evil care which i have taken of the treasure intrusted to mewhat was my business to trust to reports and messengers i should have worshipped the saint who was committed to my keeping with such vigilance as avarice bestows on the dross which he calls treasure i should have rested no where save at your gate outwatched the brightest stars in the horizon unseen and unknown myself i should never have parted from your neighbourhood then had you not been in the present danger andmuch less important consequence thou damian de lacy had not filled the grave of a forsworn and negligent caitiff  alas noble damian said eveline break not my heart by blaming yourself for an imprudence which is altogether my own thy succour was ever near when i intimated the least want of it and it imbitters my own misfortune to know that my rashness has been the cause of your disaster answer me gentle kinsman and give me to hope that the wounds you have suffered are such as may be cured alas how much of your blood have i seen spilled and what a fate is mine that i should ever bring distress on all for whom i would most willingly sacrifice my own happinessbut do not let us imbitter the moments given us in mercy by fruitless repinings try what you can to stop thine ebbing blood which is so dear to englandto evelineand to thine uncle  damian groaned as she spoke and was silent while maddened with the idea that he might be perishing for want of aid eveline repeated her efforts to extricate herself for her kinsmans assistance as well as her own it was all in vain and she had ceased the attempt in despair and passing from one hideous subject of terror to another she sat listening with sharpened ear for the dying groan of damian whenfeeling of ecstasythe ground was shaken with horses feet advancing rapidly yet this joyful sound if decisive of life did not assure her of liberty it might be the banditti of the mountains returning to seek their captive even then they would surely allow her leave to look upon and bind up the wounds of damian de lacy for to keep him as a captive might vantage them more in many degrees than could his death a horseman came upeveline invoked his assistance and the first word she heard was an exclamation in flemish from the faithful wilkin flammock which nothing save some spectacle of the most unusual kind was ever known to compel from that phlegmatic person  his presence indeed was particularly useful on this occasion for being informed by the lady eveline in what condition she was placed and implored at the same time to look to the situation of sir damian de lacy he began with admirable composure and some skill to stop the wounds of the one while his attendants collected levers left by the welsh as they retreated and were soon ready to attempt the liberation of eveline with much caution and under the experienced direction of flammock the stone was at length so much raised that the lady eveline was visible to the delight of all and especially of the faithful rose who regardless of the risk of personal harm fluttered around her mistresss place of confinement like a bird robbed of her nestlings around the cage in which the truant urchin has imprisoned them precaution was necessary to remove the stone lest falling inwards it might do the lady injury  at length the rocky fragment was so much displaced that she could issue forth while her people as in hatred of the coercion which she had sustained ceased not to heave with bar and lever till totally destroying the balance of the heavy mass it turned over from the little flat on which it had been placed at the mouth of the subterranean entrance and acquiring force as it revolved down a steep declivity was at length put into rapid motion and rolled crashed and thundered down the hill amid flashes of fire which it forced from the rocks and clouds of smoke and dust until it alighted in the channel of a brook where it broke into several massive fragments with a noise that might have been heard some miles off  with garments rent and soiled through the violence which she had sustained with dishevelled hair and disordered dress faint from the stifling effect of her confinement and exhausted by the efforts she had made to relieve herself eveline did not nevertheless waste a single minute in considering her own condition but with the eagerness of a sister hastening to the assistance of her only brother betook herself to examine the several severe wounds of damian de lacy and to use proper means to stanch the blood and recall him from his swoon we have said elsewhere that like other ladies of the time eveline was not altogether unacquainted with the surgical art and she now displayed a greater share of knowledge than she had been thought capable of exerting there was prudence foresight and tenderness in every direction which she gave and the softness of the female sex with their officious humanity ever ready to assist in alleviating human misery seemed in her enhanced and rendered dignified by the sagacity of a strong and powerful understanding after hearing with wonder for a minute or two the prudent and readywitted directions of her mistress rose seemed at once to recollect that the patient should not be left to the exclusive care of the lady eveline and joining therefore in the task she rendered what assistance she could while the attendants were employed in forming a litter on which the wounded knight was to be conveyed to the castle of the garde doloureuse     chapter the twentyfifth     a merry place tis said in times of yore   but something ails it nowthe place is cursed       wordsworth   the place on which the skirmish had occurred and the deliverance of the lady eveline had been effected was a wild and singular spot being a small level plain forming a sort of stage or restingplace between two very rough paths one of which winded up the rivulet from below and another continued the ascent above being surrounded by hills and woods it was a celebrated spot for finding game and in former days a welsh prince renowned for his universal hospitality his love of crw and of the chase had erected a forestlodge where he used to feast his friends and followers with a profusion unexampled in cambria the fancy of the bards always captivated with magnificence and having no objections to the peculiar species of profusion practised by this potentate gave him the surname of edris of the goblets and celebrated him in their odes in terms as high as those which exalt the heroes of the famous hirlas horn the subject of their praises however fell finally a victim to his propensities having been stabbed to the heart in one of those scenes of confusion and drunkenness which were frequently the conclusion of his renowned banquets shocked at this catastrophe the assembled britons interred the relics of the prince on the place where he had died within the narrow vault where eveline had been confined and having barricaded the entrance of the sepulchre with fragments of rock heaped over it an immense cairn or pile of stones on the summit of which they put the assassin to death superstition guarded the spot and for many a year this memorial of edris remained unviolated although the lodge had gone to ruin and its vestiges had totally decayed  in latter years some prowling band of welsh robbers had discovered the secret entrance and opened it with the view of ransacking the tomb for arms and treasures which were in ancient times often buried with the dead these marauders were disappointed and obtained nothing by the violation of the grave of edris excepting the knowledge of a secret place which might be used for depositing their booty or even as a place of retreat for one of their number in a case of emergency  when the followers of damian five or six in number explained their part of the history of the day to wilkin flammock it appeared that damian had ordered them to horse at break of day with a more considerable body to act as they understood against a party of insurgent peasants when of a sudden he had altered his mind and dividing his force into small bands employed himself and them in reconnoitring more than one mountainpass betwixt wales and the marches of the english country in the neighbourhood of the garde doloureuse  this was an occupation so ordinary for him that it excited no particular notice these manoeuvres were frequently undertaken by the warlike marchers for the purpose of intimidating the welsh in general more especially the bands of outlaws who independent of any regular government infested these wild frontiers yet it escaped not comment that in undertaking such service at this moment damian seemed to abandon that of dispersing the insurgents which had been considered as the chief object of the day  it was about noon when falling in as good fortune would have it with one of the fugitive grooms damian and his immediate attendants received information of the violence committed on the lady eveline and by their perfect knowledge of the country wore able to intercept the ruffians at the pass of edris as it was called by which the welsh rovers ordinarily returned to their strongholds in the interior it is probable that the banditti were not aware of the small force which damian headed in person and at the same time knew that there would be an immediate and hot pursuit in their rear and these circumstances led their leader to adopt the singular expedient of hiding eveline in the tomb while one of their own number dressed in her clothes might serve as a decoy to deceive their assailants and lead them from the spot where she was really concealed to which it was no doubt the purpose of the banditti to return when they had eluded their pursuers  accordingly the robbers had already drawn up before the tomb for the purpose of regularly retreating until they should find some suitable place either for making a stand or where if overmatched they might by abandoning their horses and dispersing among the rocks evade the attack of the norman cavalry their plan had been defeated by the precipitation of damian who beholding as he thought the plumes and mantle of the lady eveline in the rear of the party charged them without considering either the odds of numbers or the lightness of his own armour which consisting only of a headpiece and a buff surcoat offered but imperfect resistance to the welsh knives and glaives he was accordingly wounded severely at the onset and would have been slain but for the exertions of his few followers and the fears of the welsh that while thus continuing the battle in front they might be assaulted in the rear by the followers of eveline whom they must now suppose were all in arms and motion they retreated therefore or rather fled and the attendants of damian were despatched after them by their fallen master with directions to let no consideration induce them to leave off the chase until the captive lady of the garde doloureuse was delivered from her ravishers  the outlaws secure in their knowledge of the paths and the activity of their small welsh horses made an orderly retreat with the exception of two or three of their rearguard cut down by damian in his furious onset they shot arrows from time to time at the menatarms and laughed at the ineffectual efforts which these heavyarmed warriors with their barbed horses made to overtake them but the scene was changed by the appearance of wilkin flammock on his puissant warhorse who was beginning to ascend the pass leading a party consisting both of foot and horse the fear of being intercepted caused the outlaws to have recourse to their last stratagem and abandoning their welsh nags they betook themselves to the cliffs and by superior activity and dexterity baffled generally speaking the attempts of their pursuers on either hand all of them however were not equally fortunate for two or three fell into the hands of flammocks party amongst others the person upon whom evelines clothes had been placed and who now to the great disappointment of those who had attached themselves to his pursuit proved to be not the lady whom they were emulous to deliver but a fairhaired young welshman whose wild looks and incoherent speech seemed to argue a disturbed imagination this would not have saved him from immediate death the usual doom of captives taken in such skirmishes had not the faint blast of damians horn sounding from above recalled his own party and summoned that of wilkin flammock to the spot while in the confusion and hurry of their obeying the signal the pity or the contempt of his guards suffered the prisoner to escape they had indeed little to learn from him even had he been disposed to give intelligence or capable of communicating it all were well assured that their lady had fallen into an ambuscade formed by dawfyd the oneeyed a redoubted freebooter of the period who had ventured upon this hardy enterprise in the hope of obtaining a large ransom for the captive eveline and all incensed at his extreme insolence and audacity devoted his head and limbs to the eagles and the ravens  these were the particulars which the followers of flammock and of damian learned by comparing notes with each other on the incidents of the day as they returned by the red pool they were joined by dame gillian who after many exclamations of joy at the unexpected liberation of her lady and as many of sorrow at the unexpected disaster of damian proceeded to inform the menat arms that the merchant whose hawks had been the original cause of these adventures had been taken prisoner by two or three of the welsh in their retreat and that she herself and the wounded raoul would have shared the same fate but that they had no horse left to mount her upon and did not consider old raoul as worth either ransom or the trouble of killing one had indeed flung a stone at him as he lay on the hillside but happily as his dame said it fell something short of himit was but a little fellow who threw it she saidthere was a big man amongst themif he had tried its like by our ladys grace he had cast it a thought farther so saying the dame gathered herself up and adjusted her dress for again mounting on horseback  the wounded damian was placed on a litter hastily constructed of boughs and with the females was placed in the centre of the little troop augmented by the rest of the young knights followers who began to rejoin his standard the united body now marched with military order and precaution and winded through the passes with the attention of men prepared to meet and to repel injury     chapter the twentysixth     what fair and young and faithful too   a miracle if this be true      waller   rose by nature one of the most disinterested and affectionate maidens that ever breathed was the first who hastily considering the peculiar condition in which her lady was placed and the marked degree of restraint which had hitherto characterized her intercourse with her youthful guardian became anxious to know how the wounded knight was to be disposed of and when she came to evelines side for the purpose of asking this important question her resolution wellnigh failed her  the appearance of eveline was indeed such as might have made it almost cruelty to intrude upon her any other subject of anxious consideration than those with which her mind had been so lately assailed and was still occupied her countenance was as pale as death could have made it unless where it was specked with drops of blood her veil torn and disordered was soiled with dust and with gore her hair wildly dishevelled fell in elflocks on her brow and shoulders and a single broken and ragged feather which was all that remained of her headgear had been twisted among her tresses and still flowed there as if in mockery rather than ornament her eyes were fixed on the litter where damian was deposited and she rode close beside it without apparently wasting a thought on any thing save the danger of him who was extended there  rose plainly saw that her lady was under feelings of excitation which might render it difficult for her to take a wise and prudent view of her own situation she endeavoured gradually to awaken her to a sense of it dearest lady said rose will it please you to take my mantle  torment me not answered eveline with some sharpness in her accent  indeed my lady said dame gillian bustling up as one who feared her functions as mistress of the robes might be interfered withindeed my lady rose flammock speaks truth and neither your kirtle nor your gown are sitting as they should do and to speak truth they are but barely decent and so if rose will turn herself and put her horse out of my way continued the tire woman i will put your dress in better order in the sticking in of a bodkin than any fleming of them all could do in twelve hours  i care not for my dress replied eveline in the same manner as before  care then for your honourfor your fame said rose riding close to her mistress and whispering in her ear think and that hastily how you are to dispose of this wounded young man  to the castle answered eveline aloud as if scorning the affectation of secrecy lead to the castle and that straight as you can  why not rather to his own camp or to malpas said rose dearest lady believe it will be for the best  wherefore notwherefore notwherefore not leave him on the wayside at once to the knife of the welshman and the teeth of the wolfoncetwicethree times has he been my preserver where i go he shall go nor will i be in safety myself a moment sooner than i know that he is so  rose saw that she could make no impression on her mistress and her own reflection told her that the wounded mans life might be endangered by a longer transportation than was absolutely necessary an expedient occurred to her by which she imagined this objection might be obviated but it was necessary she should consult her father she struck her palfrey with her ridingrod and in a moment her diminutive though beautiful figure and her spirited little jennet were by the side of the gigantic fleming and his tall black horse and riding as it were in their vast shadow my dearest father said rose the lady intends that sir damian be transported to the castle where it is like he may be a long sojournerwhat think youis that wholesome counsel  wholesome for the youth surely roschen answered the fleming because he will escape the better risk of a fever  true but is it wise for my lady continued rose  wise enough if she deal wisely but wherefore shouldst thou doubt her roschen  i know not said rose unwilling to breathe even to her father the fears and doubts which she herself entertained but where there are evil tongues there may be evil rehearsing sir damian and my lady are both very youngmethinks it were better dearest father would you offer the shelter of your roof to the wounded knight in the stead of his being carried to the castle  that i shall not wench answered the fleming hastilythat i shall not if i may help norman shall not cross my quiet threshold nor englishman neither to mock my quiet thrift and consume my substance thou dost not know them because thou art ever with thy lady and hast her good favour but i know them well and the best i can get from them is lazy flanderkin and greedy flanderkin and flemish soti thank the saints they cannot say coward flanderkin since gwenwyns welsh uproar  i had ever thought my father answered rose that your spirit was too calm to regard these base calumnies bethink you we are under this ladys banner and that she has been my loving mistress and her father was your good lord to the constable too are you beholden for enlarged privileges money may pay debt but kindness only can requite kindness and i forebode that you will never have such an opportunity to do kindness to the houses of berenger and de lacy as by opening the doors of your house to this wounded knight  the doors of my house answered the flemingdo i know how long i may call that or any house upon earth my own alas my daughter we came hither to fly from the rage of the elements but who knows how soon we may perish by the wrath of men  you speak strangely my father said rose it holds not with your solid wisdom to augur such general evil from the rash enterprise of a welsh outlaw  i think not of the oneeyed robber said wilkin although the increase and audacity of such robbers as dawfyd is no good sign of a quiet country but thou who livest within yonder walls hearest but little of what passes without and your estate is less anxiousyou had known nothing of the news from me unless in case i had found it necessary to remove to another country  to remove my dearest father from the land where your thrift and industry have gained you an honourable competency  ay and where the hunger of wicked men who envy me the produce of my thrift may likely bring me to a dishonourable death there have been tumults among the english rabble in more than one county and their wrath is directed against those of our nation as if we were jews or heathens and not better christians and better men than themselves they have at york bristol and elsewhere sacked the houses of the flemings spoiled their goods misused their families and murdered themselvesand whyexcept that we have brought among them the skill and industry which they possessed not and because wealth which they would never else have seen in britain was the reward of our art and our toil roschen this evil spirit is spreading wider daily here we are more safe than elsewhere because we form a colony of some numbers and strength but i confide not in our neighbours and hadst not thou rose been in security i would long ere this have given up all and left britain  given up all and left britainthe words sounded prodigious in the ears of his daughter who knew better than any one how successful her father had been in his industry and how unlikely one of his firm and sedate temper was to abandon known and present advantages for the dread of distant or contingent peril at length she replied if such be your peril my father methinks your house and goods cannot have a better protection than the presence of this noble knight where lives the man who dare aught of violence against the house which harbours damian de lacy  i know not that said the fleming in the same composed and steady but ominous tonemay heaven forgive it me if it be sin but i see little save folly in these crusades which the priesthood have preached up so successfully here has the constable been absent for nearly three years and no certain tidings of his life or death victory or defeat he marched from hence as if he meant not to draw bridle or sheathe sword until the holy sepulchre was won from the saracens yet we can hear with no certainty whether even a hamlet has been taken from the saracens in the meanwhile the people that are at home grow discontented their lords with the better part of their followers are in palestinedead or alive we scarcely know the people themselves are oppressed and flayed by stewards and deputies whose yoke is neither so light nor so lightly endured as that of the actual lord the commons who naturally hate the knights and gentry think it no bad time to make some head against themay and there be some of noble blood who would not care to be their leaders that they may have their share in the spoil for foreign expeditions and profligate habits have made many poor and he that is poor will murder his father for money i hate poor people and i would the devil had every man who cannot keep himself by the work of his own hand  the fleming concluded with this characteristic imprecation a speech which gave rose a more frightful view of the state of england than shut up as she was within the garde doloureuse she had before had an opportunity of learning surely she said surely these violences of which you speak are not to be dreaded by those who live under the banner of de lacy and of berenger  berenger subsists but in name answered wilkin flammock and damian though a brave youth hath not his uncles ascendency of character and authority his men also complain that they are harassed with the duty of watching for protection of a castle in itself impregnable and sufficiently garrisoned and that they lose all opportunity of honourable enterprise as they call it that is of fight and spoilin this inactive and inglorious manner of life they say that damian the beardless was a man but that damian with the mustache is no better than a woman and that age which has darkened his upper lip hath at the same time blenched his courageand they say more which were but wearisome to tell  nay but let me know what they say let me know it for heavens sake answered rose if it concern as it must concern my dear lady  even so roschen answered wilkin there are many among the norman menatarms who talk over their winecups how that damian de lacy is in love with his uncles betrothed bride ay and that they correspond together by art magic  by art magic indeed it must be said rose smiling scornfully for by no earthly means do they correspond as i for one can bear witness  to art magic accordingly they impute it quoth wilkin flammock that so soon as ever my lady stirs beyond the portal of her castle de lacy is in the saddle with a party of his cavalry though they are positively certain that he has received no messenger letter or other ordinary notice of her purpose nor have they ever on such occasions scoured the passes long ere they have seen or heard of my lady evelines being abroad  this has not escaped me said rose and my lady has expressed herself even displeased at the accuracy which damian displayed in procuring a knowledge of her motions as well as at the officious punctuality with which he has attended and guarded them today has however shown she continued that his vigilance may serve a good purpose and as they never met upon these occasions but continued at such distance as excluded even the possibility of intercourse methinks they might have escaped the censure of the most suspicious  ay my daughter roschen replied wilkin but it is possible to drive caution so far as to excite suspicion why say the menat arms should these two observe such constant yet such guarded intelligence with one another why should their approach be so near and why yet should they never meet if they had been merely the nephew and the uncles bride they must have had interviews avowedly and frankly and on the other hand if they be two secret lovers there is reason to believe that they do find their own private places of meeting though they have art sufficient to conceal them  every word that you speak my father replied the generous rose increases the absolute necessity that you receive this wounded youth into your house be the evils you dread ever so great yet may you rely upon it that they cannot be augmented by admitting him with a few of his faithful followers  not one follower said the fleming hastily not one beeffed knave of them save the page that is to tend him and the doctor that is to attempt his cure  but i may offer the shelter of your roof to these three at least answered rose  do as thou wilt do as thou wilt said the doating father by my faith roschen it is well for thee thou hast sense and moderation in asking since i am so foolishly prompt in granting this is one of your freaks now of honour or generositybut commend me to prudence and honestyah rose rose those who would do what is better than good sometimes bring about what is worse than badbut i think i shall be quit of the trouble for the fear and that thy mistress who is with reverence something of a damsel errant will stand stoutly for the chivalrous privilege of lodging her knight in her own bower and tending him in person  the fleming prophesied true rose had no sooner made the proposal to eveline that the wounded damian should be left at her fathers house for his recovery than her mistress briefly and positively rejected the proposal he has been my preserver she said and if there be one being left for whom the gates of the garde doloureuse should of themselves fly open it is to damian de lacy nay damsel look not upon me with that suspicious and yet sorrowful countenancethey that are beyond disguise my girl contemn suspicionit is to god and our lady that i must answer and to them my bosom lies open  they proceeded in silence to the castle gate when the lady eveline issued her orders that her guardian as she emphatically termed damian should be lodged in her fathers apartment and with the prudence of more advanced age she gave the necessary direction for the reception and accommodation of his followers and the arrangements which such an accession of guests required in the fortress all this she did with the utmost composure and presence of mind even before she altered or arranged her own disordered dress  another step still remained to be taken she hastened to the chapel of the virgin and prostrating herself before her divine protectress returned thanks for her second deliverance and implored her guidance and direction and through her intercession that of almighty god for the disposal and regulation of her conduct thou knowest she said that from no confidence in my own strength have i thrust myself into danger oh make me strong where i am most weaklet not my gratitude and my compassion be a snare to me and while i strive to discharge the duties which thankfulness imposes on me save me from the evil tongues of menand saveoh save me from the insidious devices of my own heart  she then told her rosary with devout fervour and retiring from the chapel to her own apartment summoned her women to adjust her dress and remove the external appearance of the violence to which she had been so lately subjected     chapter the twentyseventh      juliagentle sir     you are our captivebut well use you so    that you shall think your prison joys may match    whateer your liberty hath known of pleasure     roderick    no fairest we have trifled here too long    and lingering to see your roses blossom    ive let my laurels wither     old play   arrayed in garments of a mourning colour and of a fashion more matronly than perhaps altogether befitted her youthplain to an extremity and devoid of all ornament save her rosaryeveline now performed the duty of waiting upon her wounded deliverer a duty which the etiquette of the time not only permitted but peremptorily enjoined she was attended by rose and dame gillian margery whose element was a sickchamber had been already despatched to that of the young knight to attend to whatever his condition might require  eveline entered the room with a light step as if unwilling to disturb the patient she paused at the door and cast her eyes around her it had been her fathers chamber nor had she entered it since his violent death around the walls hung a part of his armour and weapons with hawking gloves huntingpoles and other instruments of silvan sport these relics brought as it were in living form before her the stately presence of old sir raymond frown not my fatherher lips formed the words though her voice did not utter themfrown noteveline will never be unworthy of thee  father aldrovand and amelot the page of damian were seated by the bedside they rose as lady eveline entered and the first who meddled a little with the healing art said to eveline that the knight had slumbered for some time and was now about to awake  amelot at the same time came forward and in a hasty and low voice begged that the chamber might be kept quiet and the spectators requested to retire my lord he said ever since his illness at gloucester is apt to speak something wildly as he awakes from sleep and will be displeased with me should i permit any one to be near him  eveline accordingly caused her women and the monk to retire into the anteroom while she herself remained standing by the door communication which connected the apartments and heard damian mention her name as he turned himself painfully on his couch is she safe and unharmed was his first question and it was asked with an eagerness which intimated how far it preceded all other considerations when amelot replied in the affirmative he sighed as one whose bosom is relieved from some weighty load and in a less animated voice asked of the page where they were this apartment he said with its furniture are all strange to me  my dear master said amelot you are at present too weak to ask questions and receive explanations  be i where i will said damian as if recovering his recollection i am not in the place where my duty calls me tell my trumpets to sound to horseto horse and let ralph genvil carry my banner to horseto horse we have not a moment to lose  the wounded knight made some effort to rise which in his state of weakness amelot was easily able to frustrate thou art right he said as he sunk back into his reclining posturethou art righti am weakbut why should strength remain when honour is lost the unhappy young man covered his face with his hands and groaned in agony which seemed more that of the mind than of the body lady eveline approached his bedside with unassured steps fearing she knew not what yet earnest to testify the interest she felt in the distresses of the sufferer damian looked up and beheld her and again hid his face with his hands  what means this strange passion sir knight said eveline with a voice which at first weak and trembling gradually obtained steadiness and composure ought it to grieve you so much sworn as you are to the duties of chivalry that heaven hath twice made you its instrument to save the unfortunate eveline berenger  oh no no he exclaimed with rapidity since you are saved all is wellbut time pressesit is necessary i should presently departnowhere ought i now to tarryleast of all within this castleonce more amelot let them get to horse  nay my good lord said the damsel this must not be as your ward i cannot let my guardian part thus suddenlyas a physician i cannot allow my patient to destroy himselfit is impossible that you can brook the saddle  a littera biera cart to drag forth the dishonoured knight and traitorall were too good for mea coffin were best of all but see amelot that it be framed like that of the meanest churlno spurs displayed on the pallno shield with the ancient coat of the de lacysno helmet with their knightly crest must deck the hearse of him whose name is dishonoured  is his brain unsettled said eveline looking with terror from the wounded man to his attendant or is there some dreadful mystery in these broken wordsif so speak it forth and if it may be amended by life or goods my deliverer will sustain no wrong  amelot regarded her with a dejected and melancholy air shook his head and looked down on his master with a countenance which seemed to express that the questions which she asked could not be prudently answered in sir damians presence the lady eveline observing this gesture stepped back into the outer apartment and made amelot a sign to follow her he obeyed after a glance at his master who remained in the same disconsolate posture as formerly with his hands crossed over his eyes like one who wished to exclude the light and all which the light made visible  when amelot was in the wardrobe eveline making signs to her attendants to keep at such distance as the room permitted questioned him closely on the cause of his masters desperate expression of terror and remorse thou knowest she said that i am bound to succour thy lord if i may both from gratitude as one whom he hath served to the peril of his lifeand also from kinsmanship tell me therefore in what case he stands that i may help him if i canthat is she added her pale cheeks deeply colouring if the cause of the distress be fitting for me to hear  the page bowed low yet showed such embarrassment when he began to speak as produced a corresponding degree of confusion in the lady eveline who nevertheless urged him as before to speak without scruple or delayso that the tenor of his discourse was fitting for her ears  believe me noble lady said amelot your commands had been instantly obeyed but that i fear my masters displeasure if i talk of his affairs without his warrant nevertheless on your command whom i know he honours above all earthly beings i will speak thus far that if his life be safe from the wounds he has received his honour and worship may be in great danger if it please not heaven to send a remedy  speak on said eveline and be assured you will do sir damian de lacy no prejudice by the confidence you may rest in me  i well believe it lady said the page know then if it be not already known to you that the clowns and rabble who have taken arms against the nobles in the west pretend to be favoured in their insurrection not only by randal lacy but by my master sir damian  they lie that dare charge him with such foul treason to his own blood as well as to his sovereign replied eveline  well do i believe they lie said amelot but this hinders not their falsehoods from being believed by those who know him less inwardly more than one runaway from our troop have joined this rabblement and that gives some credit to the scandal and then they saythey saythatin short that my master longs to possess the lands in his proper right which he occupies as his uncles administrator and that if the old constablei crave your pardon madamshould return from palestine he should find it difficult to obtain possession of his own again  the sordid wretches judge of others by their own base minds and conceive those temptations too powerful for men of worth which they are themselves conscious they would be unable to resist but are the insurgents then so insolent and so powerful we have heard of their violences but only as if it had been some popular tumult  we had notice last night that they have drawn together in great force and besieged or blockaded wild wenlock with his menat arms in a village about ten miles hence he hath sent to my master as his kinsman and companionatarms to come to his assistance we were on horseback this morning to march to the rescuewhen  he paused and seemed unwilling to proceed eveline caught at the word when you heard of my danger she said i would ye had rather heard of my death  surely noble lady said the page with his eyes fixed on the ground nothing but so strong a cause could have made my master halt his troop and carry the better part of them to the welsh mountains when his countrymans distress and the commands of the kings lieutenant so peremptorily demanded his presence elsewhere  i knew it she saidi knew i was born to be his destruction yet methinks this is worse than i dreamed of when the worst was in my thoughts i feared to occasion his death not his loss of fame for gods sake young amelot do what thou canst and that without loss of time get thee straightway to horse and join to thy own men as many as thou canst gather of minegoride my brave youthshow thy masters banner and let them see that his forces and his heart are with them though his person be absent haste haste for the time is precious  but the safety of this castlebut your own safety said the page god knows how willingly i would do aught to save his fame but i know my masters mood and were you to suffer by my leaving the garde doloureuse even although i were to save him lands life and honour by my doing so i should be more like to taste of his dagger than of his thanks or bounty  go nevertheless dear amelot said she gather what force thou canst make and begone  you spur a willing horse madam said the page springing to his feet and in the condition of my master i see nothing better than that his banner should be displayed against these churls  to arms then said eveline hastily to arms and win thy spurs bring me assurance that thy masters honour is safe and i will myself buckle them on thy heels heretake this blessed rosarybind it on thy crest and be the thought of the virgin of the garde doloureuse that never failed a votary strong with thee in the hour of conflict  she had scarcely ended ere amelot flew from her presence and summoning together such horse as he could assemble both of his masters and of those belonging to the castle there were soon forty cavaliers mounted in the courtyard  but although the page was thus far readily obeyed yet when the soldiers heard they were to go forth on a dangerous expedition with no more experienced general than a youth of fifteen they showed a decided reluctance to move from the castle the old soldiers of de lacy said damian himself was almost too youthful to command them and had no right to delegate his authority to a mere boy while the followers of berenger said their mistress might be satisfied with her deliverance of the morning without trying farther dangerous conclusions by diminishing the garrison of her castlethe times they said were stormy and it was wisest to keep a stone roof over their heads  the more the soldiers communicated their ideas and apprehensions to each other the stronger their disinclination to the undertaking became and when amelot who pagelike had gone to see that his own horse was accoutred and brought forth returned to the castleyard he found them standing confusedly together some mounted some on foot all men speaking loud and all in a state of disorder ralph genvil a veteran whose face had been seamed with many a scar and who had long followed the trade of a soldier of fortune stood apart from the rest holding his horses bridle in one hand and in the other the bannerspear around which the banner of de lacy was still folded  what means this genvil said the page angrily why do you not mount your horse and display the banner and what occasions all this confusion  truly sir page said genvil composedly i am not in my saddle because i have some regard for this old silken rag which i have borne to honour in my time and i will not willingly carry it where men are unwilling to follow and defend it  no marchno sallyno lifting of banner today cried the soldiers by way of burden to the bannermans discourse how now cowards do you mutiny said amelot laying his hand upon his sword  menace not me sir boy said genvil nor shake your sword my way i tell thee amelot were my weapon to cross with yours never flail sent abroad more chaff than i would make splinters of your hatched and gilded toastingiron look you there are gray bearded men here that care not to be led about on any boys humour for me i stand little upon that and i care not whether one boy or another commands me but i am the lacys man for the time and i am not sure that in marching to the aid of this wild wenlock we shall do an errand the lacy will thank us for why led he us not thither in the morning when we were commanded off into the mountains  you well know the cause said the page  yes we do know the cause or if we do not we can guess it answered the bannerman with a horse laugh which was echoed by several of his companions  i will cram the calumny down thy false throat genvil said the page and drawing his sword threw himself headlong on the bannerman without considering their great difference of strength  genvil was contented to foil his attack by one and as it seemed a slight movement of his gigantic arm with which he forced the page aside parrying at the same time his blow with the standardspear  there was another loud laugh and amelot feeling all his efforts baffled threw his sword from him and weeping in pride and indignation hastened back to tell the lady eveline of his bad success all he said is lostthe cowardly villains have mutinied and will not move and the blame of their sloth and faintheartedness will be laid on my dear master  that shall never be said eveline should i die to prevent it follow me amelot  she hastily threw a scarlet scarf over her dark garments and hastened down to the courtyard followed by gillian assuming as she went various attitudes and actions expressing astonishment and pity and by rose carefully suppressing all appearance of the feelings which she really entertained  eveline entered the castlecourt with the kindling eye and glowing brow which her ancestors were wont to bear in danger and extremity when their soul was arming to meet the storm and displayed in their mien and looks high command and contempt of danger she seemed at the moment taller than her usual size and it was with a voice distinct and clearly heard though not exceeding the delicacy of feminine tone that the mutineers heard her address them how is this my masters she said and as she spoke the bulky forms of the armed soldiers seemed to draw closer together as if to escape her individual censure it was like a group of heavy waterfowl when they close to avoid the stoop of the slight and beautiful merlin dreading the superiority of its nature and breeding over their own inert physical strengthhow now again she demanded of them is it a time think ye to mutiny when your lord is absent and his nephew and lieutenant lies stretched on a bed of sicknessis it thus you keep your oathsthus ye merit your leaders bountyshame on ye craven hounds that quail and give back the instant you lose sight of the huntsman  there was a pausethe soldiers looked on each other and then again on eveline as if ashamed alike to hold out in their mutiny or to return to their usual discipline  i see how it is my brave friendsye lack a leader here but stay not for thati will guide you myself and woman as i am there need not a man of you fear disgrace where a berenger commandstrap my palfrey with a steel saddle she said and that instantly she snatched from the ground the pages light headpiece and threw it over her hair caught up his drawn sword and went on here i promise you my countenance and guidance this gentleman she pointed to genvil shall supply my lack of military skill he looks like a man that hath seen many a day of battle and can well teach a young leader her devoir  certes said the old soldier smiling in spite of himself and shaking his head at the same time many a battle have i seen but never under such a commander  nevertheless said eveline seeing how the eyes of the rest turned on genvil you do notcannotwill notrefuse to follow me you do not as a soldier for my weak voice supplies your captains ordersyou cannot as a gentleman for a lady a forlorn and distressed female asks you a boonyou will not as an englishman for your country requires your sword and your comrades are in danger unfurl your banner then and march  i would do so upon my soul fair lady answered genvil as if preparing to unfold the bannerand amelot might lead us well enough with advantage of some lessons from me but i wot not whether you are sending us on the right road  surely surely said eveline earnestly it must be the right road which conducts you to the relief of wenlock and his followers besieged by the insurgent boors  i know not said genvil still hesitating our leader here sir damian de lacy protects the commonsmen say he befriends them and i know he quarrelled with wild wenlock once for some petty wrong he did to the millers wife at twyford we should be finely off when our fiery young leader is on foot again if he should find we had been fighting against the side he favoured  assure yourself said the maiden anxiously the more he would protect the commons against oppression the more he would put them down when oppressing others mount and ridesave wenlock and his menthere is life and death in every moment i will warrant with my life and lands that whatsoever you do will be held good service to de lacy come then follow me  none surely can know sir damians purpose better than you fair damsel answered genvil nay for that matter you can make him change as ye listand so i will march with the men and we will aid wenlock if it is yet time as i trust it may for he is a rugged wolf and when he turns to bay will cost the boors blood enough ere they sound a mort but do you remain within the castle fair lady and trust to amelot and mecome sir page assume the command since so it must be though by my faith it is pity to take the headpiece from that pretty head and the sword from that pretty handby saint george to see them there is a credit to the soldiers profession  the lady accordingly surrendered the weapons to amelot exhorting him in few words to forget the offence he had received and do his devoir manfully meanwhile genvil slowly unrolled the pennonthen shook it abroad and without putting his foot in the stirrup aided himself a little with resting on the spear and threw himself into the saddle heavily armed as he was we are ready now an it like your juvenility said he to amelot and then while the page was putting the band into order he whispered to his nearest comrade methinks instead of this old swallows tail footnote the pennon of a knight was in shape a long streamer and forked like a swallows tail the banner of a banneret was square and was formed into the other by cutting the ends from the pennon it was thus the ceremony was performed on the pennon of john chandos by the black prince before the battle of nejara we should muster rarely under a broidered petticoata furbelowed petticoat has no fellow in my mindlook you stephen pontoysi can forgive damian now for forgetting his uncle and his own credit about this wench for by my faith she is one i could have doated to death upon par amoursah evil luck be the womens portionthey govern us at every turn stephen and at every age when they are young they bribe us with fair looks and sugared words sweet kisses and love tokens and when they are of middle age they work us to their will by presents and courtesies red wine and red gold and when they are old we are fain to run their errands to get out of sight of their old leathern visages well old de lacy should have staid at home and watched his falcon but it is all one to us stephen and we may make some vantage today for these boors have plundered more than one castle  ay ay answered pontoys the boor to the booty and the bannerman to the boor a right pithy proverb but prithee canst thou say why his pageship leads us not forward yet  pshaw answered genvil the shake i gave him has addled his brainsor perchance he has not swallowed all his tears yet sloth it is not for tis a forward cockeril for his years wherever honour is to be wonsee they now begin to movewell it is a singular thing this gentle blood stephen for here is a child whom i but now baffled like a schoolboy must lead us gray beards where we may get our heads broken and that at the command of a light lady  i warrant sir damian is secretary to my pretty lady answered stephen pontoys as this springald amelot is to sir damian and so we poor men must obey and keep our mouths shut  but our eyes open stephen pontoysforget not that  they were by this time out of the gates of the castle and upon the road leading to the village in which as they understood by the intelligence of the morning wenlock was besieged or blockaded by a greatly superior number of the insurgent commons amelot rode at the head of the troop still embarrassed at the affront which he had received in presence of the soldiers and lost in meditating how he was to eke out that deficiency of experience which on former occasions had been supplied by the counsels of the bannerman with whom he was ashamed to seek a reconciliation but genvil was not of a nature absolutely sullen though a habitual grumbler he rode up to the page and having made his obeisance respectfully asked him whether it were not well that some one or two of their number pricked forward upon good horses to learn how it stood with wenlock and whether they should be able to come up in time to his assistance  methinks bannerman answered amelot you should take the ruling of the troop since you know so fittingly what should be done you may be the fitter to command becausebut i will not upbraid you  because i know so ill how to obey replied genvil that is what you would say and by my faith i cannot deny but there may be some truth in it but is it not peevish in thee to let a fair expedition be unwisely conducted because of a foolish word or a sudden actioncome let it be peace with us  with all my heart answered amelot and i will send out an advanced party upon the adventure as thou hast advised me  let it be old stephen pontoys and two of the chester spearshe is as wily as an old fox and neither hope nor fear will draw him a hairbreadth farther than judgment warrants  amelot eagerly embraced the hint and at his command pontoys and two lances started forward to reconnoitre the road before them and inquire into the condition of those whom they were advancing to succour and now that we are on the old terms sir page said the bannerman tell me if thou canst doth not yonder fair lady love our handsome knight par amours  it is a false calumny said amelot indignantly betrothed as she is to his uncle i am convinced she would rather die than have such a thought and so would our master i have noted this heretical belief in thee before now genvil and i have prayed thee to check it you know the thing cannot be for you know they have scarce ever met  how should i know that said genvil or thou either watch them ever so closemuch water slides past the mill that hob miller never wots of they do correspond that at least thou canst not deny  i do deny it said amelot as i deny all that can touch their honour  then how in heavens name comes he by such perfect knowledge of her motions as he has displayed no longer since than the morning  how should i tell answered the page there be such things surely as saints and good angels and if there be one on earth deserves their protection it is dame eveline berenger  well said master counselkeeper replied genvil laughing but that will hardly pass on an old troopersaint and angels quotha most saintlike doings i warrant you  the page was about to continue his angry vindication when stephen pontoys and his followers returned upon the spur wenlock holds out bravely he exclaimed though he is felly girded in with these boors the large crossbows are doing good service and i little doubt his making his place good till we come up if it please you to ride something sharply they have assailed the barriers and were close up to them even now but were driven back with small success  the party were now put in as rapid motion as might consist with order and soon reached the top of a small eminence beneath which lay the village where wenlock was making his defence the air rung with the cries and shouts of the insurgents who numerous as bees and possessed of that dogged spirit of courage so peculiar to the english thronged like ants to the barriers and endeavoured to break down the palisades or to climb over them in despite of the showers of stones and arrows from within by which they suffered great loss as well as by the swords and battleaxes of the menatarms whenever they came to handblows  we are in time we are in time said amelot dropping the reins of his bridle and joyfully clapping his hands shake thy banner abroad genvilgive wenlock and his fellows a fair view of it comrades haltbreathe your horses for a momenthark hither genvilif we descend by yonder broad pathway into the meadow where the cattle are bravo my young falcon replied genvil whose love of battle like that of the warhorse of job kindled at the sight of the spears and at the sound of the trumpet we shall have then an easy field for a charge on yonder knaves  what a thick black cloud the villains make said amelot but we will let daylight through it with our lancessee genvil the defenders hoist a signal to show they have seen us  a signal to us exclaimed genvil by heaven it is a white flaga signal of surrender  surrender they cannot dream of it when we are advancing to their succour replied amelot when two or three melancholy notes from the trumpets of the besieged with a thundering and tumultuous acclamation from the besiegers rendered the fact indisputable  down goes wenlocks pennon said genvil and the churls enter the barricades on all pointshere has been cowardice or treacherywhat is to be done  advance on them said amelot retake the place and deliver the prisoners  advance indeed answered the bannermannot a horses length by my counselwe should have every nail in our corslets counted with arrowshot before we got down the hill in the face of such a multitude and the place to storm afterwardsit were mere insanity  yet come a little forward along with me said the page perhaps we may find some path by which we could descend unperceived  accordingly they rode forward a little way to reconnoitre the face of the hill the page still urging the possibility of descending it unperceived amid the confusion when genvil answered impatiently unperceivedyou are already perceivedhere comes a fellow pricking towards us as fast as his beast may trot  as he spoke the rider came up to them he was a short thickset peasant in an ordinary frieze jacket and hose with a blue cap on his head which he had been scarcely able to pull over a shock head of red hair that seemed in arms to repel the covering the mans hands were bloody and he carried at his saddlebow a linen bag which was also stained with blood ye be of damian de lacys company be ye not said this rude messenger and when they answered in the affirmative he proceeded with the same blunt courtesy hob miller of twyford commends him to damian de lacy and knowing his purpose to amend disorders in the commonwealth hob miller sends him toll of the grist which he has grinded and with that he took from the bag a human head and tendered it to amelot  it is wenlocks head said genvilhow his eyes stare  they will stare after no more wenches now said the boori have cured him of caterwauling  thou said amelot stepping back in disgust and indignation  yes i myself replied the peasant i am grand justiciary of the commons for lack of a better  grand hangman thou wouldst say replied genvil  call it what thou list replied the peasant truly it behoves men in state to give good example ill bid no man do that i am not ready to do myself it is as easy to hang a man as to say hang him we will have no splitting of offices in this new world which is happily set up in old england  wretch said amelot take back thy bloody token to them that sent thee hadst thou not come upon assurance i had pinned thee to the earth with my lancebut be assured your cruelty shall be fearfully avengedcome genvil let us to our men there is no farther use in abiding here  the fellow who had expected a very different reception stood staring after them for a few moments then replaced his bloody trophy in the wallet and rode back to those who sent him  this comes of meddling with mens amourettes said genvil sir damian would needs brawl with wenlock about his dealings with this millers daughter and you see they account him a favourer of their enterprise it will be well if others do not take up the same opinioni wish we were rid of the trouble which such suspicions may bring upon usay were it at the price of my best horsei am like to lose him at any rate with the days hard service and i would it were the worst it is to cost us  the party returned wearied and discomforted to the castle of the garde doloureuse and not without losing several of their number by the way some straggling owing to the weariness of their horses and others taking the opportunity of desertion in order to join the bands of insurgents and plunderers who had now gathered together in different quarters and were augmented by recruits from the dissolute soldiery  amelot on his return to the castle found that the state of his master was still very precarious and that the lady eveline though much exhausted had not yet retired to rest but was awaiting his return with impatience he was introduced to her accordingly and with a heavy heart mentioned the ineffectual event of his expedition  now the saints have pity upon us said the lady eveline for it seems as if a plague or pest attached to me and extended itself to all who interest themselves in my welfare from the moment they do so their very virtues become snares to them and what would in every other case recommend them to honour is turned to destruction to the friends of eveline berenger  fear not fair lady said amelot there are still men enough in my masters camp to put down these disturbers of the public peace i will but abide to receive his instructions and will hence to morrow and draw out a force to restore quiet in this part of the country  alas you know not yet the worst of it replied eveline since you went hence we have received certain notice that when the soldiers at sir damians camp heard of the accident which he this morning met with already discontented with the inactive life which they had of late led and dispirited by the hurts and reported death of their leader they have altogether broken up and dispersed their forces yet be of good courage amelot she said this house is strong enough to bear out a worse tempest than any that is likely to be poured on it and if all men desert your master in wounds and affliction it becomes yet more the part of eveline berenger to shelter and protect her deliverer     chapter the twentyeighth      let our proud trumpet shako their castle wall    menacing death and ruin      otway   the evil news with which the last chapter concluded were necessarily told to damian de lacy as the person whom they chiefly concerned and lady eveline herself undertook the task of communicating them mingling what she said with tears and again interrupting those tears to suggest topics of hope and comfort which carried no consolation to her own bosom  the wounded knight continued with his face turned towards her listening to the disastrous tidings as one who was not otherwise affected by them than as they regarded her who told the story when she had done speaking he continued as in a reverie with his eyes so intently fixed upon her that she rose up with the purpose of withdrawing from looks by which she felt herself embarrassed he hastened to speak that he might prevent her departure all that you have said fair lady he replied had been enough if told by another to have broken my heart for it tells me that the power and honour of my house so solemnly committed to my charge have been blasted in my misfortunes but when i look upon you and hear your voice i forget every thing saving that you have been rescued and are here in honour and safety let me therefore pray of your goodness that i may be removed from the castle which holds you and sent elsewhere i am in no shape worthy of your farther care since i have no longer the swords of others at my disposal and am totally unable for the present to draw my own  and if you are generous enough to think of me in your own misfortunes noble knight answered eveline can you suppose that i forget wherefore and in whose rescue these wounds were incurred no damian speak not of removalwhile there is a turret of the garde doloureuse standing within that turret shall you find shelter and protection such i am well assured would be the pleasure of your uncle were he here in person  it seemed as if a sudden pang of his wound had seized upon damian for repeating the words my uncle he writhed himself round and averted his face from eveline then again composing himself replied alas knew my uncle how ill i have obeyed his precepts instead of sheltering me within this house he would command me to be flung from the battlements  fear not his displeasure said eveline again preparing to withdraw but endeavour by the composure of your spirit to aid the healing of your wounds when i doubt not you will be able again to establish good order in the constables jurisdiction long before his return  she coloured as she pronounced the last words and hastily left the apartment when she was in her own chamber she dismissed her other attendants and retained rose what dost thou think of these things my wise maiden and monitress said she  i would replied rose either that this young knight had never entered this castleor that being here he could presently leave itor that he could honourably remain here for ever  what dost thou mean by remaining here for ever said eveline sharply and hastily let me answer that question with another how long has the constable of chester been absent from england  three years come saint clements day said eveline and what of that  nay nothing but  but whati command you to speak out  a few weeks will place your hand at your own disposal  and think you rose said eveline rising with dignity that there are no bonds save those which are drawn by the scribes penwe know little of the constables adventures but we know enough to show that his towering hopes have fallen and his sword and courage proved too weak to change the fortunes of the sultan saladin suppose him returning some brief time hence as we have seen so many crusaders regain their homes poor and broken in healthsuppose that he finds his lands laid waste and his followers dispersed by the consequence of their late misfortunes how would it sound should he also find that his betrothed bride had wedded and endowed with her substance the nephew whom he most trusteddost thou think such an engagement is like a lombards mortgage which must be redeemed on the very day else forfeiture is sure to be awarded  i cannot tell madam replied rose but they that keep their covenant to the letter are in my country held bound to no more  that is a flemish fashion rose said her mistress but the honour of a norman is not satisfied with an observance so limited what wouldst thou have my honour my affections my duty all that is most valuable to a woman depend on the same progress of the kalendar which an usurer watches for the purpose of seizing on a forfeited pledgeam i such a mere commodity that i must belong to one man if he claims me before michaelmas to another if he comes afterwardsno rose i did not thus interpret my engagement sanctioned as it was by the special providence of our lady of the garde doloureuse  it is a feeling worthy of you my dearest lady answered the attendant yet you are so youngso beset with perilsso much exposed to calumnythat i at least looking forward to the time when you may have a legal companion and protector see it as an extrication from much doubt and danger do not think of it rose answered eveline do not liken your mistress to those provident dames who while one husband yet lives though in old age or weak health are prudently engaged in plotting for another  enough my dearest lady said roseyet not so permit me one word more since you are determined not to avail yourself of your freedom even when the fatal period of your engagement is expired why suffer this young man to share our solitudehe is surely well enough to be removed to some other place of security let us resume our former sequestered mode of life until providence send us some better or more certain prospects  eveline sighedlooked downthen looking upwards once more had opened her lips to express her willingness to enforce so reasonable an arrangement but for damians recent wounds and the distracted state of the country when she was interrupted by the shrill sound of trumpets blown before the gate of the castle and raoul with anxiety on his brow came limping to inform his lady that a knight attended by a pursuivantatarms in the royal livery with a strong guard was in front of the castle and demanded admittance in the name of the king  eveline paused a moment ere she replied not even to the kings order shall the castle of my ancestors be opened until we are well assured of the person by whom and the purpose for which it is demanded we will ourself to the gate and learn the meaning of this summonsmy veil rose and call my womenagain that trumpet sounds alas it rings like a signal to death and ruin  the prophetic apprehensions of eveline were not false for scarce had she reached the door of the apartment when she was met by the page amelot in a state of such disordered apprehension as an eleve of chivalry was scarce on any occasion permitted to display lady noble lady he said hastily bending his knee to eveline save my dearest masteryou and you alone can save him at this extremity  i said eveline in astonishmenti save himand from what dangergod knows how willingly  there she stopped short as if afraid to trust herself with expressing what rose to her lips  guy monthermer lady is at the gate with a pursuivant and the royal banner the hereditary enemy of the house of lacy thus accompanied comes hither for no goodthe extent of the evil i know not but for evil he comes my master slew his nephew at the field of malpas and thereforehe was here interrupted by another flourish of trumpets which rung as if in shrill impatience through the vaults of the ancient fortress  the lady eveline hasted to the gate and found that the wardens and others who attended there were looking on each other with doubtful and alarmed countenances which they turned upon her at her arrival as if to seek from their mistress the comfort and the courage which they could not communicate to each other without the gate mounted and in complete armour was an elderly and stately knight whose raised visor and beaver depressed showed a beard already grizzled beside him appeared the pursuivant on horseback the royal arms embroidered on his heraldic dress of office and all the importance of offended consequence on his countenance which was shaded by his barretcap and triple plume they were attended by a body of about fifty soldiers arranged under the guidon of england  when the lady eveline appeared at the barrier the knight after a slight reverence which seemed more informal courtesy than in kindness demanded if he saw the daughter of raymond berenger and is it he continued when he had received an answer in the affirmative before the castle of that approved and favoured servant of the house of anjou that king henrys trumpets have thrice sounded without obtaining an entrance for those who are honoured with their sovereigns command  my condition answered eveline must excuse my caution i am a lone maiden residing in a frontier fortress i may admit no one without inquiring his purpose and being assured that his entrance consists with the safety of the place and mine own honour  since you are so punctilious lady replied monthermer know that in the present distracted state of the country it is his grace the kings pleasure to place within your walls a body of menatarms sufficient to guard this important castle both from the insurgent peasants who burn and slay and from the welsh who it must be expected will according to their wont in time of disturbance make incursions on the frontiers undo your gates then lady of berenger and suffer his graces forces to enter the castle  sir knight answered the lady this castle like every other fortress in england is the kings by law but by law also i am the keeper and defender of it and it is the tenure by which my ancestors held these lands i have men enough to maintain the garde doloureuse in my time as my father and my grandfather before him defended it in theirs the king is gracious to send me succours but i need not the aid of hirelings neither do i think it safe to admit such into my castle who may in this lawless time make themselves master of it for other than its lawful mistress  lady replied the old warrior his grace is not ignorant of the motives which produce a contumacy like this it is not any apprehension for the royal forces which influences you a royal vassal in this refractory conduct i might proceed upon your refusal to proclaim you a traitor to the crown but the king remembers the services of your father know then we are not ignorant that damian de lacy accused of instigating and heading this insurrection and of deserting his duty in the field and abandoning a noble comrade to the swords of the brutal peasants has found shelter under this roof with little credit to your loyalty as vassal or your conduct as a highborn maiden deliver him up to us and i will draw off these menatarms and dispense though i may scarce answer doing so with the occupation of the castle  guy de monthermer answered eveline he that throws a stain on my name speaks falsely and unworthily as for damian de lacy he knows how to defend his own fame this only let me say that while he takes his abode in the castle of the betrothed of his kinsman she delivers him to no one least of all to his well known feudal enemydrop the portcullis wardens and let it not be raised without my special order  the portcullis as she spoke fell rattling and clanging to the ground and monthermer in baffled spite remained excluded from the castle unworthy ladyhe began in passion then checking himself said calmly to the pursuivant ye are witness that she hath admitted that the traitor is within that castleye are witness that lawfully summoned this eveline berenger refuses to deliver him up do your duty sir pursuivant as is usual in such cases  the pursuivant then advanced and proclaimed in the formal and fatal phrase befitting the occasion that eveline berenger lawfully summoned refusing to admit the kings forces into her castle and to deliver up the body of a false traitor called damian de lacy had herself incurred the penalty of high treason and had involved within the same doom all who aided abetted or maintained her in holding out the said castle against their allegiance to henry of anjou the trumpets so soon as the voice of the herald had ceased confirmed the doom he had pronounced by a long and ominous peal startling from their nests the owl and the raven who replied to it by their illboding screams  the defenders of the castle looked on each other with blank and dejected countenances while monthermer raising aloft his lance exclaimed as he turned his horse from the castle gate when i next approach the garde doloureuse it will be not merely to intimate but to execute the mandate of my sovereign  as eveline stood pensively to behold the retreat of monthermer and his associates and to consider what was to be done in this emergency she heard one of the flemings in a low tone ask an englishman who stood beside him what was the meaning of a traitor  one who betrayeth a trust reposeda betrayer said the interpreter the phrase which he used recalled to evelines memory her boding vision or dream alas she said the vengeance of the fiend is about to be accomplished widowd wife and wedded maidthese epithets have long been mine betrothedwos me it is the keystone of my destiny betrayer i am now denounced though thank god i am clear from the guilt it only follows that i should be betrayed and the evil prophecy will be fulfilled to the very letter fir     chapter the twentyninth      out on ye owls    nothing but songs of death      richard iii   more than three months had elapsed since the event narrated in the last chapter and it had been the precursor of others of still greater importance which will evolve themselves in the course of our narrative but profess to present to the reader not a precise detail of circumstances according to their order and date but a series of pictures endeavouring to exhibit the most striking incidents before the eye or imagination of those whom it may concern we therefore open a new scene and bring other actors upon the stage  along a wasted tract of country more than twelve miles distant from the garde doloureuse in the heat of a summer noon which shed a burning lustre on the silent valley and the blackened ruins of the cottages with which it had been once graced two travellers walked slowly whose palmer cloaks pilgrims staves large slouched hats with a scallop shell bound on the front of each above all the cross cut in red cloth upon their shoulders marked them as pilgrims who had accomplished their vow and had returned from that fatal bourne from which in those days returned so few of the thousands who visited it whether in the love of enterprise or in the ardour of devotion  the pilgrims had passed that morning through a scene of devastation similar to and scarce surpassed in misery by those which they had often trod during the wars of the cross they had seen hamlets which appeared to have suffered all the fury of military execution the houses being burned to the ground and in many cases the carcasses of the miserable inhabitants or rather relics of such objects were suspended on temporary gibbets or on the trees which had been allowed to remain standing only it would seem to serve the convenience of the executioners living creatures they saw none excepting those wild denizens of nature who seemed silently resuming the now wasted district from which they might have been formerly expelled by the course of civilization their ears were no less disagreeably occupied than their eyes the pensive travellers might indeed hear the screams of the raven as if lamenting the decay of the carnage on which he had been gorged and now and then the plaintive howl of some dog deprived of his home and master but no sounds which argued either labour or domestication of any kind  the sable figures who with wearied steps as it appeared travelled through these scenes of desolation and ravage seemed assimilated to them in appearance they spoke not with each other they looked not to each otherbut one the shorter of the pair keeping about half a pace in front of his companion they moved slowly as priests returning from a sinners deathbed or rather as spectres flitting along the precincts of a churchyard  at length they reached a grassy mound on the top of which was placed one of those receptacles for the dead of the ancient british chiefs of distinction called kistvaen which are composed of upright fragments of granite so placed as to form a stone coffin or something bearing that resemblance the sepulchre had been long violated by the victorious saxons either in scorn or in idle curiosity or because treasures were supposed to be sometimes concealed in such spots the huge flat stone which had once been the cover of the coffin if so it might be termed lay broken in two pieces at some distance from the sepulchre and overgrown as the fragments were with grass and lichens showed plainly that the lid had been removed to its present situation many years before a stunted and doddered oak still spread its branches over the open and rude mausoleum as if the druids badge and emblem shattered and stormbroken was still bending to offer its protection to the last remnants of their worship  this then is the kistvaen said the shorter pilgrim and here we must abide tidings of our scout but what philip guarine have we to expect as an explanation of the devastation which we have traversed  some incursion of the welsh wolves my lord replied guarine and by our lady here lies a poor saxon sheep whom they have snapped up  the constable for he was the pilgrim who had walked foremost as he heard his squire speak and saw the corpse of a man amongst the long grass by which indeed it was so hidden that he himself had passed without notice what the esquire in less abstracted mood had not failed to observe the leathern doublet of the slain bespoke him an english peasantthe body lay on its face and the arrow which had caused his death still stuck in his back  philip guarine with the cool indifference of one accustomed to such scenes drew the shaft from the mans back as composedly as he would have removed it from the body of a deer with similar indifference the constable signed to his esquire to give him the arrowlooked at it with indolent curiosity and then said thou hast forgotten thy old craft guarine when thou callest that a welsh shaft trust me it flew from a norman bow but why it should be found in the body of that english churl i can ill guess  some runaway serf i would warrantsome mongrel cur who had joined the welsh pack of hounds answered the esquire  it may be so said the constable but i rather augur some civil war among the lords marchers themselves the welsh indeed sweep the villages and leave nothing behind them but blood and ashes but here even castles seem to have been stormed and taken may god send us good news of the garde doloureuse  amen replied his squire but if renault vidal brings it twill be the first time he has proved a bird of good omen  philip said the constable i have already told thee thou art a jealouspated fool how many times has vidal shown his faith in doubthis address in difficultyhis courage in battlehis patience under suffering  it may be all very true my lord replied guarine yetbut what avails to speaki own he has done you sometimes good service but loath were i that your life or honour were at the mercy of renault vidal  in the name of all the saints thou peevish and suspicious fool what is it thou canst found upon to his prejudice  nothing my lord replied guarine but instinctive suspicion and aversion the child that for the first time sees a snake knows nothing of its evil properties yet he will not chase it and take it up as he would a butterfly such is my dislike of vidali cannot help it i could pardon the man his malicious and gloomy sidelong looks when he thinks no one observes him but his sneering laugh i cannot forgiveit is like the beast we heard of in judea who laughs they say before he tears and destroys  philip said de lacy i am sorry for theesorry from my soul to see such a predominating and causeless jealousy occupy the brain of a gallant old soldier here in this last misfortune to recall no more ancient proofs of his fidelity could he mean otherwise than well with us when thrown by shipwreck upon the coast of wales we would have been doomed to instant death had the cymri recognized in me the constable of chester and in thee his trusty esquire the executioner of his commands against the welsh in so many instances  i acknowledge said philip guarine death had surely been our fortune had not that mans ingenuity represented us as pilgrims and under that character acted as our interpreterand in that character he entirely precluded us from getting information from any one respecting the state of things here which it behoved your lordship much to know and which i must needs say looks gloomy and suspicious enough  still art thou a fool guarine said the constable for look you had vidal meant ill by us why should he not have betrayed us to the welsh or suffered us by showing such knowledge as thou and i may have of their gibberish to betray ourselves  well my lord said guarine i may be silenced but not satisfied all the fair words he can speakall the fine tunes he can playrenault vidal will be to my eyes ever a dark and suspicious man with features always ready to mould themselves into the fittest form to attract confidence with a tongue framed to utter the most flattering and agreeable words at one time and at another to play shrewd plainness or blunt honesty and an eye which when he thinks himself unobserved contradicts every assumed expression of features every protestation of honesty and every word of courtesy or cordiality to which his tongue has given utterance but i speak not more on the subject only i am an old mastiff of the true breedi love my master but cannot endure some of those whom he favours and yonder as i judge comes vidal to give us such an account of our situation as it shall please him  a horseman was indeed seen advancing in the path towards the kist vaen with a hasty pace and his dress in which something of the eastern fashion was manifest with the fantastic attire usually worn by men of his profession made the constable aware that the minstrel of whom they were speaking was rapidly approaching them  although hugo de lacy rendered this attendant no more than what in justice he supposed his services demanded when he vindicated him from the suspicions thrown out by guarine yet at the bottom of his heart he had sometimes shared those suspicions and was often angry at himself as a just and honest man for censuring on the slight testimony of looks and sometimes casual expressions a fidelity which seemed to be proved by many acts of zeal and integrity  when vidal approached and dismounted to make his obeisance his master hasted to speak to him in words of favour as if conscious he had been partly sharing guarines unjust judgment upon him by even listening to it welcome my trusty vidal he said thou hast been the raven that fed us on the mountains of wales be now the dove that brings us good tidings from the marchesthou art silent what mean these downcast looksthat embarrassed carriagethat cap plucked down oer thine eyesin gods name man speakfear not for mei can bear worse than tongue of man may tell thou hast seen me in the wars of palestine when my brave followers fell man by man around me and when i was left wellnigh aloneand did i blench thenthou hast seen me when the ships keel lay grating on the rock and the billows flew in foam over her deckdid i blench thennonor will i now  boast not said the minstrel looking fixedly upon the constable as the former assumed the port and countenance of one who sets fortune and her utmost malice at defianceboast not lest thy bands be made strong there was a pause of a minute during which the group formed at this instant a singular picture  afraid to ask yet ashamed to seem to fear the ill tidings which impended the constable confronted his messenger with person erect arms folded and brow expanded with resolution while the minstrel carried beyond his usual and guarded apathy by the interest of the moment bent on his master a keen fixed glance as if to observe whether his courage was real or assumed  philip guarine on the other hand to whom heaven in assigning him a rough exterior had denied neither sense nor observation kept his eye in turn firmly fixed on vidal as if endeavouring to determine what was the character of that deep interest which gleamed in the minstrels looks apparently and was unable to ascertain whether it was that of a faithful domestic sympathetically agitated by the bad news with which he was about to afflict his master or that of an executioner standing with his knife suspended over his victim deferring his blow until he should discover where it would be most sensibly felt in guarines mind prejudiced perhaps by the previous opinion he had entertained the latter sentiment so decidedly predominated that he longed to raise his staff and strike down to the earth the servant who seemed thus to enjoy the protracted sufferings of their common master  at length a convulsive movement crossed the brow of the constable and guarine when he beheld a sardonic smile begin to curl vidals lip could keep silence no longer vidal he said thou art a  a bearer of bad tidings said vidal interrupting him therefore subject to the misconstruction of every fool who cannot distinguish between the author of harm and him who unwillingly reports it  to what purpose this delay said the constable come sir minstrel i will spare you a pangeveline has forsaken and forgotten me the minstrel assented by a low inclination  hugo de lacy paced a short turn before the stone monument endeavouring to conquer the deep emotion which he felt i forgive her he said forgive did i sayalas i have nothing to forgive she used but the right i left in her handyesour date of engagement was outshe had heard of my lossesmy defeatsthe destruction of my hopesthe expenditure of my wealth and has taken the first opportunity which strict law afforded to break off her engagement with one bankrupt in fortune and fame many a maiden would have doneperhaps in prudence should have done thisbut that womans name should not have been eveline berenger  he leaned on his esquires arm and for an instant laid his head on his shoulder with a depth of emotion which guarine had never before seen him betray and which in awkward kindness he could only attempt to console by bidding his master be of good couragehe had lost but a woman  this is no selfish emotion philip said the constable resuming selfcommand i grieve less that she has left me than that she has misjudged methat she has treated me as the pawnbroker does his wretched creditor who arrests the pledge as the very moment elapses within which it might have been relieved did she then think that i in my turn would have been a creditor so rigidthat i who since i knew her scarce deemed myself worthy of her when i had wealth and fame should insist on her sharing my diminished and degraded fortunes how little she ever knew me or how selfish must she have supposed my misfortunes to have made me but be it soshe is gone and may she be happy the thought that she disturbed me shall pass from my mind and i will think she has done that which i myself as her best friend must in honour have advised  so saying his countenance to the surprise of his attendants resumed its usual firm composure  i give you joy said the esquire in a whisper to the minstrel your evil news have wounded less deeply than doubtless you believed was possible  alas replied the minstrel i have others and worse behind this answer was made in an equivocal tone of voice corresponding to the peculiarity of his manner and like that seeming emotion of a deep but very doubtful character  eveline berenger is then married said the constable and let me make a wild guessshe has not abandoned the family though she has forsaken the individualshe is still a lacy hadolt that thou art wilt thou not understand me she is married to damian de lacyto my nephew  the effort with which the constable gave breath to this supposition formed a strange contrast to the constrained smile to which he compelled his features while he uttered it with such a smile a man about to drink poison might name a health as he put the fatal beverage to his lips no my lordnot married answered the minstrel with an emphasis on the word which the constable knew how to interpret  no no he replied quickly not married perhaps but engaged trothplighted wherefore not the date of her old alliance was out why not enter into a new engagement  the lady eveline and sir damian de lacy are not affianced that i know of answered his attendant  this reply drove de lacys patience to extremity  dog dost thou trifle with me he exclaimed vile wirepincher thou torturest me speak the worst at once or i will presently make thee minstrel to the household of satan  calm and collected did the minstrel replythe lady eveline and sir damian are neither married nor affianced my lord they have loved and lived togetherpar amours  dog and son of a dog said de lacy thou liest and seizing the minstrel by the breast the exasperated baron shook him with his whole strength but great as that strength was it was unable to stagger vidal a practised wrestler in the firm posture which he had assumed any more than his masters wrath could disturb the composure of the minstrels bearing  confess thou hast lied said the constable releasing him after having effected by his violence no greater degree of agitation than the exertion of human force produces upon the rocking stones of the druids which may be shaken indeed but not displaced  were a lie to buy my own life yea the lives of all my tribe said the minstrel i would not tell one but truth itself is ever termed falsehood when it counteracts the train of our passions  hear him philip guarine hear him exclaimed the constable turning hastily to his squire he tells me of my disgraceof the dishonour of my houseof the depravity of those whom i have loved the best in the worldhe tells me of it with a calm look an eye composed an unfaltering tongueis thiscan it be natural is de lacy sunk so low that his dishonour shall be told by a common strolling minstrel as calmly as if it were a theme for a vain ballad perhaps thou wilt make it one ha as he concluded darting a furious glance at the minstrel  perhaps i might my lord replied the minstrel were it not that i must record therein the disgrace of renault vidal who served a lord without either patience to bear insults and wrongs or spirit to revenge them on the authors of his shame  thou art right thou art right good fellow said the constable hastily it is vengeance now alone which is left usand yet upon whom  as he spoke he walked shortly and hastily to and fro and becoming suddenly silent stood still and wrung his hands with deep emotion  i told thee said the minstrel to guarine that my muse would find a tender part at last dost thou remember the bullfight we saw in spain a thousand little darts perplexed and annoyed the noble animal ere he received the last deadly thrust from the lance of the moorish cavalier  man or fiend be which thou wilt replied guarine that can thus drink in with pleasure and contemplate at your ease the misery of another i bid thee beware of me utter thy coldblooded taunts in some other ear for if my tongue be blunt i wear a sword that is sharp enough  thou hast seen me amongst swords answered the minstrel and knowest how little terror they have for such as i am yet as he spoke he drew off from the esquire he had in fact only addressed him in that sort of fulness of heart which would have vented itself in soliloquy if alone and now poured itself out on the nearest auditor without the speaker being entirely conscious of the sentiments which his speech excited  few minutes had elapsed before the constable of chester had regained the calm external semblance with which until this last dreadful wound he had borne all the inflictions of fortune he turned towards his followers and addressed the minstrel with his usual calmness thou art right good fellow he said in what thou saidst to me but now and i forgive thee the taunt which accompanied thy good counsel speak out in gods name and speak to one prepared to endure the evil which god hath sent him certes a good knight is best known in battle and a christian in the time of trouble and adversity  the tone in which the constable spoke seemed to produce a corresponding effect upon the deportment of his followers the minstrel dropped at once the cynical and audacious tone in which he had hitherto seemed to tamper with the passions of his master and in language simple and respectful and which even approached to sympathy informed him of the evil news which he had collected during his absence it was indeed disastrous  the refusal of the lady eveline berengor to admit monthermer and his forces into her castle had of course given circulation and credence to all the calumnies which had been circulated to her prejudice and that of damian de lacy and there were many who for various causes were interested in spreading and supporting these slanders a large force had been sent into the country to subdue the insurgent peasants and the knights and nobles despatched for that purpose failed not to avenge to the utter most upon the wretched plebeians the noble blood which they had spilled during their temporary triumph  the followers of the unfortunate wenlock were infected with the same persuasion blamed by many for a hasty and cowardly surrender of a post which might have been defended they endeavoured to vindicate themselves by alleging the hostile demonstrations of de lacys cavalry as the sole cause of their premature submission  these rumours supported by such interested testimony spread wide and far through the land and joined to the undeniable fact that damian had sought refuge in the strong castle of garde doloureuse which was now defending itself against the royal arms animated the numerous enemies of the house of de lacy and drove its vassals and friends almost to despair as men reduced either to disown their feudal allegiance or renounce that still more sacred fealty which they owed to their sovereign  at this crisis they received intelligence that the wise and active monarch by whom the sceptre of england was then swayed was moving towards that part of england at the head of a large body of soldiers for the purpose at once of pressing the siege of the garde doloureuse and completing the suppression of the insurrection of the peasantry which guy monthermer had nearly accomplished  in this emergency and when the friends and dependents of the house of lacy scarcely knew which hand to turn to randal the constables kinsman and after damian his heir suddenly appeared amongst them with a royal commission to raise and command such followers of the family as might not desire to be involved in the supposed treason of the constables delegate in troublesome times mens vices are forgotten provided they display activity courage and prudence the virtues then most required and the appearance of randal who was by no means deficient in any of these attributes was received as a good omen by the followers of his cousin they quickly gathered around him surrendered to the royal mandate such strongholds as they possessed and to vindicate themselves from any participation in the alleged crimes of damian they distinguished themselves under randals command against such scattered bodies of peasantry as still kept the field or lurked in the mountains and passes and conducted themselves with such severity after success as made the troops even of monthermer appear gentle and clement in comparison with those of de lacy finally with the banner of his ancient house displayed and five hundred good men assembled under it randal appeared before the garde poloureuse and joined henrys camp there  the castle was already hardly pressed and the few defenders disabled by wounds watching and privation had now the additional discouragement to see displayed against their walls the only banner in england under which they had hoped forces might be mustered for their aid  the highspirited entreaties of eveline unbent by adversity and want gradually lost effect on the defenders of the castle and proposals for surrender were urged and discussed by a tumultuary council into which not only the inferior officers but many of the common men had thrust themselves as in a period of such general distress as unlooses all the bonds of discipline and leaves each man at liberty to speak and act for himself to their surprise in the midst of their discussions damian de lacy arisen from the sickbed to which he had been so long confined appeared among them pale and feeble his cheek tinged with the ghastly look which is left by long illnesshe leaned on his page amelot gentlemen he said and soldiersyet why should i call you eithergentlemen are ever ready to die in behalf of a lady soldiers hold life in scorn compared to their honour  out upon him out upon him exclaimed some of the soldiers interrupting him he would have us who are innocent die the death of traitors and be hanged in our armour over the walls rather than part with his leman  peace irreverent slave said damian in a voice like thunder or my last blow shall be a mean one aimed against such a caitiff as thou artand you he continued addressing the restyou who are shrinking from the toils of your profession because if you persist in a course of honour death may close them a few years sooner than it needs mustyou who are scared like children at the sight of a deathshead do not suppose that damian de lacy would desire to shelter himself at the expense of those lives which you hold so dear make your bargain with king henry deliver me up to his justice or his severity or if you like it better strike my head from my body and hurl it as a peace offering from the walls of the castle to god in his good time will i trust for the clearance of mine honour in a word surrender me dead or alive or open the gates and permit me to surrender myself only as ye are men since i may not say better of ye care at least for the safety of your mistress and make such terms as may secure her safety and save yourselves from the dishonour of being held cowardly and perjured caitiffs in your graves  methinks the youth speaks well and reasonably said william flammock let us een make a grace of surrendering his body up to the king and assure thereby such terms as we can for ourselves and the lady ere the last morsel of our provision is consumed  i would hardly have proposed this measure said or rather mumbled father aldrovand who had recently lost four of his front teeth by a stone from a slingyet being so generously offered by the party principally concerned i hold with the learned scholiast volenti non fit injuria  priest and fleming said the old bannerman ralph genvil i see how the wind stirreth you but you deceive yourselves if you think to make our young master sir damian a scapegoat for your light ladynay never frown nor fume sir damian if you know not your safest course we know it for youfollowers of de lacy throw yourselves on your horses and two men on one if it be necessarywe will take this stubborn boy in the midst of us and the dainty squire amelot shall be prisoner too if he trouble us with his peevish opposition then let us make a fair sally upon the siegers those who can cut their way through will shift well enough those who fall will be provided for  a shout from the troopers of lacys band approved this proposal whilst the followers of berenger expostulated in loud and angry tone eveline summoned by the tumult in vain endeavoured to appease it and the anger and entreaties of damian were equally lost on his followers to each and either the answer was the same  have you no care of itbecause you love par amours is it reasonable you should throw away your life and ours so exclaimed genvil to de lacy and in softer language but with equal obstinacy the followers of raymond berenger refused on the present occasion to listen to the commands or prayers of his daughter  wilkin flammock had retreated from the tumult when he saw the turn which matters had taken he left the castle by a sallyport of which he had been intrusted with the key and proceeded without observation or opposition to the royal camp where he requested access to the sovereign this was easily obtained and wilkin speedily found himself in the presence of king henry the monarch was in his royal pavilion attended by two of his sons richard and john who afterwards swayed the sceptre of england with very different auspices  how nowwhat art thou was the royal question  an honest man from the castle of the garde doloureuse  thou mayst be honest replied the sovereign but thou comest from a nest of traitors  such as they are my lord it is my purpose to put them at your royal disposal for they have no longer the wisdom to guide themselves and lack alike prudence to hold out and grace to submit but i would first know of your grace to what terms you will admit the defenders of yonder garrison  to such as kings give to traitors said henry sternlysharp knives and tough cords  nay my gracious lord you must be kinder than that amounts to if the castle is to be rendered by my means else will your cords and knives have only my poor body to work upon and you will be as far as ever from the inside of the garde doloureuse  the king looked at him fixedly thou knowest he said the law of arms here provostmarshal stands a traitor and yonder stands a tree  and here is a throat said the stouthearted fleming unbuttoning the collar of his doublet  by mine honour said prince richard a sturdy and faithful yeoman it were better send such fellows their dinners and then buffet it out with them for the castle than to starve them as the beggarly frenchmen famish their hounds  peace richard said his father thy wit is over green and thy blood over hot to make thee my counsellor hereand you knave speak you some reasonable terms and we will not be over strict with thee  first then said the fleming i stipulate full and free pardon for life limb body and goods to me wilkin flammock and my daughter rose  a true fleming said prince john he takes care of himself in the first instance  his request said the king is reasonable what next  safety in life honour and land for the demoiselle eveline berenger  how sir knave said the king angrily is it for such as thou to dictate to our judgment or clemency in the case of a noble norman lady confine thy mediation to such as thyself or rather render us this castle without farther delay and be assured thy doing so will be of more service to the traitors within than weeks more of resistance which must and shall be bootless  the fleming stood silent unwilling to surrender without some specific terms yet half convinced from the situation in which he had left the garrison of the garde doloureuse that his admitting the kings forces would be perhaps the best he could do for lady eveline  i like thy fidelity fellow said the king whose acute eye perceived the struggle in the flemings bosom but carry not thy stubbornness too far have we not said we will be gracious to yonder offenders as far as our royal duty will permit  and royal father said prince john interposing i pray you let me have the grace to take first possession of the garde doloureuse and the wardship or forfeiture of the offending lady  i pray you also my royal father to grant johns boon said his brother richard in a tone of mockery consider royal father it is the first desire he hath shown to approach the barriers of the castle though we have attacked them forty times at least marry crossbow and mangonel were busy on the former occasions and it is like they will be silent now  peace richard said the king your words aimed at thy brothers honour pierce my heartjohn thou hast thy boon as concerns the castle for the unhappy young lady we will take her in our own chargefleming how many men wilt thou undertake to admit  ere flammock could answer a squire approached prince richard and whispered in his ear yet so as to be heard by all present we have discovered that some internal disturbance or other cause unknown has withdrawn many of the warders from the castle walls and that a sudden attack might  dost thou hear that john exclaimed richard ladders manget ladders and to the wall how i should delight to see thee on the highest roundthy knees shakingthy hands grasping convulsively like those of one in an ague fitall air around thee save a baton or two of woodthe moat belowhalfadozen pikes at thy throat  peace richard for shame if not for charity said his father in a tone of anger mingled with grief and thou john get ready for the assault  as soon as i have put on my armour father answered the prince and withdrew slowly with a visage so blank as to promise no speed in his preparations  his brother laughed as he retired and said to his squire it were no bad jest alberick to carry the place ere john can change his silk doublet for a steel one  so saying he hastily withdrew and his father exclaimed in paternal distress out alas as much too hot as his brother is too cold but it is the manlier faultgloucester said he to that celebrated earl take sufficient strength and follow prince richard to guard and sustain him if any one can rule him it must be a knight of thy established fame alas alas for what sin have i deserved the affliction of these cruel family feuds  be comforted my lord said the chancellor who was also in attendance  speak not of comfort to a father whose sons are at discord with each other and agree only in their disobedience to him  thus spoke henry the second than whom no wiser or generally speaking more fortunate monarch ever sat upon the throne of england yet whose life is a striking illustration how family dissensions can tarnish the most brilliant lot to which heaven permits humanity to aspire and how little gratified ambition extended power and the highest reputation in war and in peace can do towards curing the wounds of domestic affliction  the sudden and fiery attack of richard who hastened to the escalade at the head of a score of followers collected at random had the complete effect of surprise and having surmounted the walls with their ladders before the contending parties within were almost aware of the assault the assailants burst open the gates and admitted gloucester who had hastily followed with a strong body of menatarms the garrison in their state of surprise confusion and disunion offered but little resistance and would have been put to the sword and the place plundered had not henry himself entered it and by his personal exertions and authority restrained the excesses of the dissolute soldiery  the king conducted himself considering the times and the provocation with laudable moderation he contented himself with disarming and dismissing the common soldiers giving them some trifle to carry them out of the country lest want should lead them to form themselves into bands of robbers the officers were more severely treated being for the greater part thrown into dungeons to abide the course of the law in particular imprisonment was the lot of damian de lacy against whom believing the various charges with which he was loaded henry was so highly incensed that he purposed to make him an example to all false knights and disloyal subjects to the lady eveline berenger he assigned her own apartment as a prison in which she was honourably attended by rose and alice but guarded with the utmost strictness it was generally reported that her demesnes would be declared a forfeiture to the crown and bestowed at least in part upon randal de lacy who had done good service during the siege her person it was thought was destined to the seclusion of some distant french nunnery where she might at leisure repent her of her follies and her rashness  father aldrovand was delivered up to the discipline of the convent long experience having very effectually taught henry the imprudence of infringing on the privileges of the church although when the king first beheld him with a rusty corslet clasped over his frock he with difficulty repressed the desire to cause him to hanged over the battlements to preach to the ravens  with wilkin flammock henry held much conference particularly on his subject of manufactures and commerce on which the sound headed though bluntspoken fleming was well qualified to instruct an intelligent monarch thy intentions he said shall not be forgotten good fellow though they have been anticipated by the headlong valour of my son richard which has cost some poor caitiffs their livesrichard loves not to sheathe a bloodless weapon but thou and thy countrymen shall return to thy mills yonder with a full pardon for past offences so that you meddle no more with such treasonable matters  and our privileges and duties my liege said flammock your majesty knows well we are vassals to the lord of this castle and must follow him in battle  it shall no longer be so said henry i will form a community of flemings here and thou flammock shalt be mayor that thou mayst not plead feudal obedience for a relapse into treason  treason my liege said flammock longing yet scarce venturing to interpose a word in behalf of lady eveline for whom despite the constitutional coolness of his temperament he really felt much interesti would that your grace but justly knew how many threads went to that woof  peace sirrahmeddle with your loom said henry and if we deign to speak to thee concerning the mechanical arts which thou dost profess take it for no warrant to intrude farther on our privacy  the fleming retired rebuked and in silence and the fate of the unhappy prisoners remained in the kings bosom he himself took up his lodging in the castle of the garde doloureuse as a convenient station for sending abroad parties to suppress and extinguish all the embers of rebellion and so active was randal de lacy on these occasions that he appeared daily to rise in the kings grace and was gratified with considerable grants out of the domains of berenger and lacy which the king seemed already to treat as forfeited property most men considered this growing favour of randal as a perilous omen both far the life of young de lacy and for the fate of the unfortunate eveline     chapter the thirtieth      a vow a vowi have a vow in heaven    shall i bring perjury upon my soul    no not for venice      merchant of venice   the conclusion of the last chapter contains the tidings with which the minstrel greeted his unhappy master hugo de lacy not indeed with the same detail of circumstances with which we have been able to invest the narrative but so as to infer the general and appalling facts that his betrothed bride and beloved and trusted kinsman had leagued together for his dishonourhad raised the banner of rebellion against their lawful sovereign and failing in their audacious attempt had brought the life of one of them at least into the most imminent danger and the fortunes of the house of lacy unless some instant remedy could be found to the very verge of ruin  vidal marked the countenance of his master as he spoke with the same keen observation which the chirurgeon gives to the progress of his dissectingknife there was grief on the constables featuresdeep griefbut without the expression of abasement or prostration which usually accompanies it anger and shame were therebut they were both of a noble character seemingly excited by his bride and nephews transgressing the laws of allegiance honour and virtue rather than by the disgrace and damage which he himself sustained through their crime  the minstrel was so much astonished at this change of deportment from the sensitive acuteness of agony which attended the beginning of his narrative that he stepped back two paces and gazing on the constable with wonder mixed with admiration exclaimed we have heard of martyrs in palestine but this exceeds them  wonder not so much good friend said the constable patiently it is the first blow of the lance or mace which pierces or stuns those which follow are little felt footnote such an expression is said to have been used by mandrin the celebrated smuggler while in the act of being broken upon the wheel this dreadful punishment consists in the executioner with a bar of iron breaking the shoulderbones arms thighbones and legs of the criminal takinghis alternate sides the punishment is concluded by a blow across the breast called the coup de grace because it removes the sufferer from his agony when mandrin received the second blow over the left shoulderbone he laughed his confessor inquired the reason of demeanour so unbecominghis situation i only lavish at my own folly my father answered mandrin who could suppose that sensibility of pain should continue after the nervous system had been completely deranged by the first blow  think my lord said vidal all is lostlove dominion high office and bright fameso late a chief among nobles now a poor palmer  wouldst thou make sport with my misery said hugo sternly but even that comes of course behind my back and why should it not be endured when said to my faceknow then minstrel and put it in song if you list that hugo de lacy having lost all he carried to palestine and all which he left at home is still lord of his own mind and adversity can no more shake him than the breeze which strips the oak of its leaves can tear up the trunk by the roots  now by the tomb of my father said the minstrel rapturously this mans nobleness is too much for my resolve and stepping hastily to the constable he kneeled on one knee and caught his hand more freely than the state maintained by men of de lacys rank usually permitted here said vidal on this handthis noble handi renounce but ere he could utter another word hugo de lacy who perhaps felt the freedom of the action as an intrusion on his fallen condition pulled back his hand and bid the minstrel with as stern frown arise and remember that misfortune made not de lacy a fit personage for a mummery  renault vidal rose rebuked i had forgot he said the distance between an armorican violer and a high norman baron i thought that the same depth of sorrow the same burst of joy levelled for a moment at least those artificial barriers by which men are divided but it is well as it is live within the limits of your rank as heretofore within your donjon tower and your fosses my lord undisturbed by the sympathy of any mean man like me i too have my duties to discharge  and now to the garde doloureuse said the baron turning to philip guarinegod knoweth how well it deserveth the name there to learn with our own eyes and ears the truth of these woful tidings dismount minstrel and give me thy palfreyi would guarine that i had one for theeas for vidal his attendance is less necessary i will face my foes or my misfortunes like a manthat be assured of violer and look not so sullen knavei will not forget old adherents  one of them at least will not forget you my lord replied the minstrel with his usual dubious tone of look and emphasis  but just as the constable was about to prick forwards two persons appeared on the path mounted on one horse who hidden by some dwarfwood had come very near them without being perceived they were male and female and the man who rode foremost was such a picture of famine as the eyes of the pilgrims had scarce witnessed in all the wasted land through which they had travelled his features naturally sharp and thin had disappeared almost entirely among the uncombed gray beard and hairs with which they were overshadowed and it was but the glimpse of a long nose that seemed as sharp as the edge of a knife and the twinkling glimpse of his gray eyes which gave any intimation of his lineaments his leg in the wide old boot which enclosed it looked like the handle of a mop left by chance in a pailhis arms were about the thickness of ridingrodsand such parts of his person as were not concealed by the tatters of a huntsmans cassock seemed rather the appendages of a mummy than a live man  the female who sat behind this spectre exhibited also some symptoms of extenuation but being a brave jolly dame naturally famine had not been able to render her a spectacle so rueful as the anatomy behind which she rode dame gillians cheek for it was the readers old acquaintance had indeed lost the rosy hue of good cheer and the smoothness of complexion which art and easy living had formerly substituted for the more delicate bloom of youth her eyes were sunken and had lost much of their bold and roguish lustre but she was still in some measure herself and the remnants of former finery together with the tightdrawn scarlet hose though sorely faded showed still a remnant of coquettish pretension  so soon as she came within sight of the pilgrims she began to punch raoul with the end of her ridingrod try thy new trade man since thou art unfit for any otherto the good manto them crave their charity  beg from beggars muttered raoul that were hawking at sparrows dame  it will bring our hand in use though said gillian and commenced in a whining tone god love you holy men who have had the grace to go to the holy land and what is more have had the grace to come back again i pray bestow some of your alms upon my poor old husband who is a miserable object as you see and upon one who has the bad luck to be his wifeheaven help me  peace woman and hear what i have to say said the constable laying his hand upon the bridle of the horsei have present occasion for that horse and  by the huntinghorn of st hubert but thou gettest him not without blows answered the old huntsman a fine world it is when palmers turn horsestealers  peace fellow said the constable sternlyi say i have occasion presently for the service of thy horse here be two gold bezants for a days use of the brute it is well worth the feesimple of him were he never returned  but the palfrey is an old acquaintance master said raoul and if perchance  out upon if and perchance both said the dame giving her husband so determined a thrust as wellnigh pushed him out of the saddle off the horse and thank god and this worthy man for the help he hath sent us in this extremity what signifies the palfrey when we have not enough to get food either for the brute or ourselves not though we would eat grass and corn with him like king somebody whom the good father used to read us to sleep about  a truce with your prating dame said raoul offering his assistance to help her from the croupe but she preferred that of guarine who though advanced in years retained the advantage of his stout soldierly figure i humbly thank your goodness said she as having first kissed her the squire set her on the ground and pray sir are ye come from the holy landheard ye any tidings there of him that was constable of chester  de lacy who was engaged in removing the pillion from behind the saddle stopped short in his task and said ha dame what would you with him  a great deal good palmer an i could light on him for his lands and offices are all to be given its like to that false thief his kinsman  whatto damian his nephew exclaimed the constable in a harsh and hasty tone  lord how you startle me sir said gillian then continued turning to philip guarine your friend is a hasty man belike  it is the fault of the sun he has lived under so long said the squire but look you answer his questions truly and he will make it the better for you  gillian instantly took the hint was it damian de lacy you asked afteralas i poor young gentleman no offices or lands for him more likely to have a gallowscast poor ladand all for nought as i am a true dame damianno no it is not damian or damson neitherbut randal lacy that must rule the roast and have all the old mans lands and livings and lordships  what said the constablebefore they know whether the old man is dead or nomethinks that were against law and reason both  ay but randal lacy has brought about less likely matters look you he hath sworn to the king that they have true tidings of the constables deathay and let him alone to make them soothfast enough if the constable were once within his danger  indeed said the constable but you are forging tales on a noble gentleman come come dame you say this because you like not randal lacy  like him notand what reason have i to like him i trow answered gillian is it because he seduced my simplicity to let him into the castle of the garde doloureuseay oftener than once or twice eitherwhen he was disguised as a pedlar and told him all the secrets of the family and how the boy damian and the girl eveline were dying of love with each other but had not courage to say a word of it for fear of the constable though he were a thousand miles offyou seem concerned worthy sirmay i offer your reverend worship a trifling sup from my bottle which is sovereign for tremor cordis and fits of the spleen  no no ejaculated de lacyi was but grieved with the shooting of an old wound but dame i warrant me this damian and eveline as you call them became better closer friends in time  theynot they indeed poor simpletons answered the dame they wanted some wise counsellor to go between and advise them for look you sir if old hugo be dead as is most like it were more natural that his bride and his nephew should inherit his lands than this same randal who is but a distant kinsman and a foresworn caitiff to bootwould you think it reverend pilgrim after the mountains of gold he promised mewhen the castle was taken and he saw i could serve him no more he called me old beldame and spoke of the beadle and the cuckingstoolyes reverend sir old beldame and cuckingstool were his best words when he knew i had no one to take my part save old raoul who cannot take his own but if grim old hugh bring back his weatherbeaten carcass from palestine and have but half the devil in him which he had when he was fool enough to go away saint mary but i will do his kinsmans office to him  there was a pause when she had done speaking  thou sayst at length exclaimed the constable that damian de lacy and eveline love each other yet are unconscious of guilt or falsehood or ingratitude to mei would say to their relative in palestine  love sirin troth and so it isthey do love each other said gillian but it is like angelsor like lambsor like fools if you will for they would never so much as have spoken together but for a prank of that same randal lacys  how demanded the constablea prank of randalswhat motive had he that these two should meet  nay their meeting was none of his seeking but he had formed a plan to carry off the lady eveline himself for he was a wild rover this same randal and so he came disguised as a merchant of falcons and trained out my old stupid raoul and the lady eveline and all of us as if to have an hours mirth in hawking at the heron but he had a band of welsh kites in readiness to pounce upon us and but for the sudden making in of damian to our rescue it is undescribable to think what might have come of us and damian being hurt in the onslaught was carried to the garde doloureuse in mere necessity and but to save his life it is my belief my lady would never have asked him to cross the drawbridge even if he had offered  woman said the constable think what thou sayst if thou hast done evil in these matters heretofore as i suspect from thine own story think not to put it right by a train of new falsehoods merely from spite at missing thy reward  palmer said old raoul with his brokentoned voice cracked by many a hollo i am wont to leave the business of talebearing to my wife gillian who will tonguepad it with any shrew in christendom but thou speakst like one having some interest in these matters and therefore i will tell thee plainly that although this woman has published her own shame in avowing her correspondence with that same randal lacy yet what she has said is true as the gospel and were it my last word i would say that damian and the lady eveline are innocent of all treason and all dishonesty as is the babe unbornbut what avails what the like of us say who are even driven to the very begging for mere support after having lived at a good house and in a good lords serviceblessing be with him  but hark you continued the constable are there left no ancient servants of the house that could speak out as well as you humph answered the huntsmanmen are not willing to babble when randal lacy is cracking his thong above their heads many are slain or starved to deathsome disposed ofsome spirited away but there are the weaver flammock and his daughter rose who know as much of the matter as we do  whatwilkin flammock the stout netherlander said the constable he and his blunt but true daughter rosei will venture my life on their faith where dwell theywhat has been their lot amidst these changes and in gods name who are you that ask these questions said dame gillian husband husband we have been too free there is something in that look and that tone which i should remember  yes look at me more fixedly said the constable throwing back the hood which had hitherto in some degree obscured his features  on your kneeson your knees raoul exclaimed gillian dropping on her own at the same time it is the constable himself and he has heard me call him old hugh  it is all that is left of him who was the constable at least replied de lacy and old hugh willingly forgives your freedom in consideration of your good news where are flammock and his daughter  rose is with the lady eveline said dame gillian her ladyship belike chose her for bowerwoman in place of me although rose was never fit to attire so much as a dutch doll  the faithful girl said the constable and where is flammock  oh for him he has pardon and favour from the king said raoul and is at his own house with his rabble of weavers close beside the battlebridge as they now call the place where your lordship quelled the welsh  thither will i then said the constable and will then see what welcome king henry of anjou has for an old servant you two must accompany me  my lord said gillian with hesitation you know poor folk are little thanked for interference with great mens affairs i trust your lordship will be able to protect us if we speak the truth and that you will not look back with displeasure on what i did acting for the best  peace dame with a wanion to ye said raoul will you think of your own old sinful carcass when you should be saving your sweet young mistress from shame and oppressionand for thy ill tongue and worse practices his lordship knows they are bred in the bone of thee  peace good fellow said the constable we will not look back on thy wifes errors and your fidelity shall be rewardedfor you my faithful followers he said turning towards guarine and vidal when de lacy shall receive his rights of which he doubts nothing his first wish shall be to reward your fidelity  mine such as it is has been and shall be its own reward said vidal i will not accept favours from him in prosperity who in adversity refused me his handour account stands yet open  go to thou art a fool but thy profession hath a privilege to be humorous said the constable whose weatherbeaten and homely features looked even handsome when animated by gratitude to heaven and benevolence towards mankind we will meet he said at battlebridge an hour before vespersi shall have much achieved before that time  the space is short said his esquire  i have won a battle in yet shorter replied the constable   in which said the minstrel many a man has died that thought himself well assured of life and victory  even so shall my dangerous cousin randal find his schemes of ambition blighted answered the constable and rode forwards accompanied by raoul and his wife who had remounted their palfrey while the minstrel and squire followed afoot and of course much more slowly     chapter the thirtyfirst      oh fear not fear not good lord john    that i would you betray    or sue requital for a debt    which nature cannot pay    bear witness all ye sacred powers    ye lights that gin to shine    this night shall prove the sacred tie    that binds your faith and mine      ancient scottish ballad   left behind by their master the two dependants of hugh de lacy marched on in sullen silence like men who dislike and distrust each other though bound to one common service and partners therefore in the same hopes and fears the dislike indeed was chiefly upon guarines side for nothing could be more indifferent to renault vidal than was his companion farther than as he was conscious that philip loved him not and was not unlikely so far as lay in his power to thwart some plans which he had nearly at heart he took little notice of his companion but hummed over to himself as for the exercise of his memory romances and songs many of which were composed in languages which guarine who had only an ear for his native norman did not understand  they had proceeded together in this sullen manner for nearly two hours when they were met by a groom on horseback leading a saddled palfrey pilgrims said the man after looking at them with some attention which of you is called philip guarine  i for fault of a better said the esquire reply to that name  thy lord in that case commends him to you said the groom and sends you this token by which you shall know that i am his true messenger  he showed the esquire a rosary which philip instantly recognized as that used by the constable  i acknowledge the token he said speak my masters pleasure  he bids me say replied the rider that his visit thrives as well as is possible and that this very evening by time that the sun sets he will be possessed of his own he desires therefore you will mount this palfrey and come with me to the garde doloureuse as your presence would be wanted there  it is well and i obey him said the esquire much pleased with the import of the message and not dissatisfied at being separated from his travelling companion  and what charge for me said the minstrel addressing the messenger  if you as i guess are the minstrel renault vidal you are to abide your master at the battlebridge according to the charge formerly given  i will meet him as in duty bound was vidals answer and scarce was it uttered ere the two horsemen turning their backs on him rode briskly forward and were speedily out of sight  it was now four hours past noon and the sun was declining yet there was more than three hours space to the time of rendezvous and the distance from the place did not now exceed four miles vidal therefore either for the sake of rest or reflection withdrew from the path into a thicket on the left hand from which gushed the waters of a streamlet fed by a small fountain that bubbled up amongst the trees here the traveller sat himself down and with an air which seemed unconscious of what he was doing bent his eye on the little sparkling font for more than half an hour without change of posture so that he might in pagan times have represented the statue of a watergod bending over his urn and attentive only to the supplies which it was pouring forth at length however he seemed to recall himself from this state of deep abstraction drew himself up and took some coarse food from his pilgrims scrip as if suddenly reminded that life is not supported without means but he had probably something at his heart which affected his throat or appetite after a vain attempt to swallow a morsel he threw it from him in disgust and applied him to a small flask in which he had some wine or other liquor but seemingly this also turned distasteful for he threw from him both scrip and bottle and bending down to the spring drank deeply of the pure element bathed in it his hands and face and arising from the fountain apparently refreshed moved slowly on his way singing as he went but in a low and saddened tone wild fragments of ancient poetry in a tongue equally ancient  journeying on in this melancholy manner he at length came in sight of the battlebridge near to which arose in proud and gloomy strength the celebrated castle of the garde doloureuse here then he saidhere then i am to await the proud de lacy be it so in gods namehe shall know me better ere we part  so saying he strode with long and resolved steps across the bridge and ascending a mound which arose on the opposite side at some distance he gazed for a time upon the scene beneaththe beautiful river rich with the reflected tints of the western sky the trees which were already brightened to the eye and saddened to the fancy with the hue of autumnand the darksome walls and towers of the feudal castle from which at times flashed a glimpse of splendour as some sentinels arms caught and gave back a transient ray of the setting sun  the countenance of the minstrel which had hitherto been dark and troubled seemed softened by the quiet of the scene he threw loose his pilgrims dress yet suffering part of its dark folds to hang around him mantlewise under which appeared his minstrels tabard he took from his side a rote and striking from time to time a welsh descant sung at others a lay of which we can offer only a few fragments literally translated from the ancient language in which they were chanted premising that they are in that excursive symbolical style of poetry which taliessin llewarch hen and other bards had derived perhaps from the time of the druids    i asked of my harp who hath injured thy chords   and she replied the crooked finger which i mocked in my tune   a blade of silver may be bendeda blade of steel abideth   kindness fadeth away but vengeance endureth    the sweet taste of mead passeth from the lips   but they are long corroded by the juice of wormwood   the lamb is brought to the shambles but the wolf rangeth the mountain   kindness fadeth away but vengeance endureth    i asked the redhot iron when it glimmered on the anvil   wherefore glowest thou longer than the firebrand   i was born in the dark mine and the brand in the pleasant greenwood   kindness fadeth away but vengeance endureth    i asked the green oak of the assembly wherefore its boughs     were dry and seared like the horns of the stag   and it showed me that a small worm had gnawed its roots   the boy who remembered the scourge undid the wicket of the     castle at midnight   kindness fadeth away but vengeance endureth    lightning destroyeth temples though their spires pierce the clouds   storms destroy armadas though their sails intercept the gale   he that is in his glory falleth and that by a contemptible enemy   kindness fadeth away but vengeance endureth  more of the same wild images were thrown out each bearing some analogy however fanciful and remote to the theme which occurred like a chorus at the close of each stanza so that the poetry resembled a piece of music which after repeated excursions through fanciful variations returns ever and anon to the simple melody which is the subject of ornament  as the minstrel sung his eyes were fixed on the bridge and its vicinity but when near the close of his chant he raised up his eyes towards the distant towers of the garde doloureuse he saw that the gates were opened and that there was a mustering of guards and attendants without the barriers as if some expedition were about to set forth or some person of importance to appear on the scene at the same time glancing his eyes around he discovered that the landscape so solitary when he first took his seat on the gray stone from which he overlooked it was now becoming filled with figures  during his reverie several persons solitary and in groups men women and children had begun to assemble themselves on both sides of the river and were loitering there as if expecting some spectacle there was also much bustling at the flemings mills which though at some distance were also completely under his eye a procession seemed to be arranging itself there which soon began to move forward with pipe and tabor and various other instruments of music and soon approached in regular order the place where vidal was seated  it appeared the business in hand was of a pacific character for the graybearded old men of the little settlement in their decent russet gowns came first after the rustic band of music walking in ranks of three and three supported by their staves and regulating the motion of the whole procession by their sober and staid pace after these fathers of the settlement came wilkin flammock mounted on his mighty warhorse and in complete armor save his head like a vassal prepared to do military service for his lord after him followed and in battle rank the flower of the little colony consisting of thirty men well armed and appointed whose steady march as well as their clean and glittering armour showed steadiness and discipline although they lacked alike the fiery glance of the french soldiery or the look of dogged defiance which characterized the english or the wild ecstatic impetuosity of eye which then distinguished the welsh the mothers and the maidens of the colony came next then followed the children with faces as chubby and features as serious and steps as grave as their parents and last as a rearguard came the youths from fourteen to twenty armed with light lances bows and similar weapons becoming their age  this procession wheeled around the base of the mound or embankment on which the minstrel was seated crossed the bridge with the same slow and regular pace and formed themselves into a double line facing inwards as if to receive some person of consequence or witness some ceremonial flammock remained at the extremity of the avenue thus formed by his countrymen and quietly yet earnestly engaged in making arrangements and preparations  in the meanwhile stragglers of different countries began to draw together apparently brought there by mere curiosity and formed a motley assemblage at the farther end of the bridge which was that nearest to the castle two english peasants passed very near the stone on which vidal satwilt thou sing us a song minstrel said one of them and here is a tester for thee throwing into his hat a small silver coin  i am under a vow answered the minstrel and may not practise the gay science at present  or you are too proud to play to english churls said the elder peasant for thy tongue smacks of the norman  keep the coin nevertheless said the younger man let the palmer have what the minstrel refuses to earn  i pray you reserve your bounty kind friend said vidal i need it notand tell me of your kindness instead what matters are going forward here  why know you not that we have got our constable de lacy again and that he is to grant solemn investiture to the flemish weavers of all these fine things harry of anjou has givenhad edward the confessor been alive to give the netherland knaves their guerdon it would have been a cast of the gallowstree but come neighbour we shall lose the show  so saying they pressed down the hill vidal fixed his eyes on the gates of the distant castle and the distant waving of banners and mustering of men on horseback though imperfectly seen at such a distance apprized him that one of note was about to set forth at the head of a considerable train of military attendants distant flourishes of trumpets which came faintly yet distinctly on his ear seemed to attest the same presently he perceived by the dust which began to arise in columns betwixt the castle and the bridge as well as by the nearer sound of the clarions that the troop was advancing towards him in procession  vidal on his own part seemed as if irresolute whether to retain his present position where he commanded a full but remote view of the whole scene or to obtain a nearer but more partial one by involving himself in the crowd which now closed around on either hand of the bridge unless where the avenue was kept open by the armed and arrayed flemings  a monk next hurried past vidal and on his enquiring as formerly the cause of the assembly answered in a muttering tone from beneath his hood that it was the constable de lacy who as the first act of his authority was then and there to deliver to the flemings a royal charter of their immunities he is in haste to exercise his authority methinks said the minstrel  he that has just gotten a sword is impatient to draw it replied the monk who added more which the minstrel understood imperfectly for father aldrovand had not recovered the injury which he had received during the siege  vidal however understood him to say that he was to meet the constable there to beg his favourable intercession  i also will meet him said renault vidal rising suddenly from the stone which he occupied  follow me then mumbled the priest the flemings know me and will let me forward  but father aldrovand being in disgrace his influence was not so potent as he had flattered himself and both he and the minstrel were jostled to and fro in the crowd and separated from each other  vidal however was recognized by the english peasants who had before spoke to him canst thou do any jugglers feats minstrel said one thou mayst earn a fair largess for our norman masters love jonglerie  i know but one said vidal and i will show it if you will yield me some room  they crowded a little off from him and gave him time to throw aside his oonnet bare his legs and knees by stripping off the leathern buskins which swathed them and retaining only his sandals he then tied a particoloured handkerchief around his swarthy and sunburnt hair and casting off his upper doublet showed his brawny and nervous arms naked to the shoulder  but while he amused those immediately about him with these preparations a commotion and rush among the crowd together with the close sound of trumpets answered by all the flemish instruments of music as well as the shouts in norman and english of long live the gallant constableour lady for the bold de lacy announced that the constable was close at hand  vidal made incredible exertions to approach the leader of the procession whose morion distinguished by its lofty plumes and right hand holding his truncheon or leadingstaff was all he could see on account of the crowd of officers and armed men around him at length his exertions prevailed and he came within three yards of the constable who was then in a small circle which had been with difficulty kept clear for the purpose of the ceremonial of the day his back was towards the minstrel and he was in the act of bending from his horse to deliver the royal charter to wilkin flammock who had knelt on one knee to receive it the more reverentially his discharge of this duty occasioned the constable to stoop so low that his plume seemed in the act of mixing with the flowing mane of his noble charger  at this moment vidal threw himself with singular agility over the heads of the flemings who guarded the circle and ere an eye could twinkle his right knee was on the croupe of the constables horsethe grasp of his left hand on the collar of de lacys buff coat then clinging to its prey like a tiger after its leap he drew in the same instant of time a short sharp daggerand buried it in the back of the neck just where the spine which was severed by the stroke serves to convey to the trunk of the human body the mysterious influences of the brain the blow was struck with the utmost accuracy of aim and strength of arm the unhappy horseman dropped from his saddle without groan or struggle like a bull in the amphitheatre under the steel of the tauridor and in the same saddle sat his murderer brandishing the bloody poniard and urging the horse to speed  there was indeed a possibility of his having achieved his escape so much were those around paralyzed for the moment by the suddenness and audacity of the enterprise but flammocks presence of mind did not forsake himhe seized the horse by the bridle and aided by those who wanted but an example made the rider prisoner bound his arms and called aloud that he must be carried before king henry this proposal uttered in flammocks strong and decided tone of voice silenced a thousand wild cries of murder and treason which had arisen while the different and hostile natives of which the crowd was composed threw upon each other reciprocally the charge of treachery  all the streams however now assembled in one channel and poured with unanimous assent towards the garde doloureuse excepting a few of the murdered noblemans train who remained to transport their masters body in decent solemnity of mourning from the spot which he had sought with so much pomp and triumph  when flammock reached the garde doloureuse he was readily admitted with his prisoner and with such witnesses as he had selected to prove the execution of the crime to his request of an audience he was answered that the king had commanded that none should be admitted to him for some time yet so singular were the tidings of the constables slaughter that the captain of the guard ventured to interrupt henrys privacy in order to communicate that event and returned with orders that flammock and his prisoner should be instantly admitted to the royal apartment here they found henry attended by several persons who stood respectfully behind the royal seat in a darkened part of the room  when flammock entered his large bulk and massive limbs were strangely contrasted with cheeks pale with horror at what he had just witnessed and with awe at finding himself in the royal presencechamber beside him stood his prisoner undaunted by the situation in which he was placed the blood of his victim which had spirited from the wound was visible on his bare limbs and his scanty garments but particularly upon his brow and the handkerchief with which it was bound  henry gazed on him with a stern look which the other not only endured without dismay but seemed to return with a frown of defiance  does no one know this caitiff said henry looking around him  there was no immediate answer until philip guarine stepping from the group which stood behind the royal chair said though with hesitation so please you my liege but for the strange guise in which he is now arrayed i should say there was a household minstrel of my master by name renault vidal  thou art deceived norman replied the minstrel my menial place and base lineage were but assumedi am cadwallon the britoncadwallon of the nine layscadwallon the chief bard of gwenwyn of powyslandand his avenger  as he uttered the last word his looks encountered those of a palmer who had gradually advanced from the recess in which the attendants were stationed and now confronted him  the welshmans eyes looked eagerly ghastly as if flying from their sockets while he exclaimed in a tone of surprise mingled with horror do the dead come before monarchsor if thou art alive whom have i slaini dreamed not surely of that bound and of that homeblowyet my victim stands before me have i not slain the constable of chester  thou hast indeed slain the constable answered the king but know welshman it was randal de lacy on whom that charge was this morning conferred by our belief of our loyal and faithful hugh de lacys having been lost upon his return from the holy land as the vessel in which ho had taken passage was reported to have suffered shipwreck thou hast cut short randals brief elevation but by a few hours for tomorrows sun would have again seen him without land or lordship  the prisoner dropped his head on his bosom in evident despair i thought he murmured that he had changed his slough and come forth so glorious all too soon may the eyes drop out that were cheated with those baubles a plumed cap and a lacquered baton  i will take care welshman thine eyes cheat thee not again said the king sternly before the night is an hour older they shall be closed on all that is earthly  may i request of your nobleness said the constable that you will permit me to ask the unhappy man a few questions  when i have demanded of him myself said the king why he has dipt his hands in the blood of a noble norman  because he at whom i aimed my blow said the briton his eye glancing fiercely from the king to de lacy and back had spilled the blood of the descendant of a thousand kings to which his own gore or thine proud count of anjou is but as the puddle of the highway to the silver fountain  henrys eye menaced the audacious speaker but the king reined in his wrath when he beheld the imploring look of his servantwhat wouldst thou ask of him he said be brief for his time is short  so please you my liege i would but demand wherefore he has for years forborne to take the life he aimed at when it was in his powernay when it must have been lost but for his seemingly faithful service  norman said cadwallon i will answer thee when i first took upon me thy service it was well my purpose to have slain thee that night there stands the man pointing to philip guarine to whose vigilance thou owedst thy safety  indeed said de lacy i do remember some indications of such a purpose but why didst thou forego it when following opportunities put it in thy power  when the slayer of my sovereign became gods soldier answered cadwallon and served his cause in palestine he was safe from my earthly vengeance  a wonderful forbearance on the part of a welsh assassin said the king scornfully  ay answered cadwallon and which certain christian princes have scarce attained to who have never neglected the chance of pillage or conquest afforded by the absence of a rival in the holy crusade  now by the holy roodsaid henry on the point of bursting out for the insult affected him peculiarly but suddenly stopping he said with an air of contempt to the gallows with the knave  but one other question said de lacy renault or by whatever name thou art called ever since my return thou hast rendered me service inconsistent with thy stern resolution upon my lifethou didst aid me in my shipwreckand didst guide me safely through wales where my name would have ensured my death and all this after the crusade was accomplished  i could explain thy doubt said the bard but that it might be thought i was pleading for my life  hesitate riot for that said the king for were our holy father to intercede for thee his prayer were in vain  well then said the bard know the truthi was too proud to permit either wave or welshman to share in my revenge know also what is perhaps cadwallons weaknessuse and habit had divided my feelings towards de lacy between aversion and admiration i still contemplated my revenge but as something which i might never complete and which seemed rather an image in the clouds than an object to which i must one day draw near and when i beheld thee he said turning to de lacy this very day so determined so sternly resolved to bear thy impending fate like a manthat you seemed to me to resemble the last tower of a ruined palace still holding its head to heaven when its walls of splendour and its bowers of delight lay in desolation aroundmay i perish i said to myself in secret ere i perfect its ruin yes de lacy then even thenbut some hours sincehadst thou accepted my proffered hand i had served thee as never follower served master you rejected it with scornand yet notwithstanding that insult it required that i should have seen you as i thought trampling over the field in which you slew my master in the full pride of norman insolence to animate my resolution to strike the blow which meant for you has slain at least one of your usurping racei will answer no more questionslead on to axe or gallowsit is indifferent to cadwallonmy soul will soon be with my free and noble ancestry and with my beloved and royal patron  my liege and prince said de lacy bending his knee to henry can you hear this and refuse your ancient servant one request spare this manextinguish not such a light because it is devious and wild  rise rise de lacy and shame thee of thy petition said the king thy kinsmans bloodthe blood of a noble norman is on the welshmans hands and brow as i am crowned king he shall die ere it is wiped offhere have him to present execution  cadwallon was instantly withdrawn under a guard the constable seemed by action rather than words to continue his intercession  thou art mad de lacythou art mad mine old and true friend to urge me thus said the king compelling de lacy to rise seest thou not that my care in this matter is for theethis randal by largesses and promises hath made many friends who will not perhaps easily again be brought to your allegiance returning as thou dost diminished in power and wealth had he lived we might have had hard work to deprive him entirely of the power which he had acquired we thank the welsh assassin who hath rid us of him but his adherents would cry foul play were the murderer spared when blood is paid for blood all will be forgotten and their loyalty will once more flow in its proper channel to thee their lawful lord  hugo de lacy arose from his knees and endeavoured respectfully to combat the politic reasons of his wily sovereign which he plainly saw were resorted to less for his sake than with the prudent purpose of effecting the change of feudal authority with the east possible trouble to the country or sovereign  henry listened to de lacys arguments patiently and combated them with temper until the deathdrum beganto beat and the castle bell to toll he then led de lacy to the window on which for it was now dark a strong ruddy light began to gleam from without a body of menatarms each holding in his hand a blazing torch were returning along the terrace from the execution of the wild but highsould briton with cries of long live king henry and so perish all enemies of the gentle norman men   conclusion      a sun hath seta star hath risen    o geraldine since arms of thine    have been the lovely ladys prison      coleridge  popular fame had erred in assigning to eveline berenger after the capture of her castle any confinement more severe than that of her aunt the lady abbess of the cistertians convent afforded yet that was severe enough for maiden aunts whether abbesses or no are not tolerant of the species of errors of which eveline was accused and the innocent damosel was brought in many ways to eat her bread in shame of countenance and bitterness of heart every day of her confinement was rendered less and less endurable by taunts in the various forms of sympathy consolation and exhortation but which stript of their assumed forms were undisguised anger and insult the company of rose was all which eveline had to sustain her under these inflictions and that was at length withdrawn on the very morning when so many important events took place at the garde doloureuse  the unfortunate young lady inquired in vain of a grimfaced nun who appeared in roses place to assist her to dress why her companion and friend was debarred attendance the nun observed on that score an obstinate silence but threw out many hints on the importance attached to the vain ornaments of a frail child of clay and on the hardship that even a spouse of heaven was compelled to divert her thoughts from her higher duties and condescend to fasten clasps and adjust veils  the lady abbess however told her niece after matins that her attendant had not been withdrawn from her for a space only but was likely to be shut up in a house of the severest profession for having afforded her mistress assistance in receiving damian de lacy into her sleeping apartment at the castle of baldringham  a soldier of de lacys band who had hitherto kept what he had observed a secret being off his post that night had now in damians disgrace found he might benefit himself by telling the story this new blow so unexpected so afflictivethis new charge which it was so difficult to explain and so impossible utterly to deny seemed to eveline to seal damians fate and her own while the thought that she had involved in ruin her single hearted and highsould attendant was all that had been wanting to produce a state which approached to the apathy of despair think of me what you will she said to her aunt i will no longer defend myselfsay what you will i will no longer reply carry me where you will i will no longer resistgod will in his good time clear my famemay he forgive my persecutors  after this and during several hours of that unhappy day the lady eveline pale cold silent glided from chapel to refectory from refectory to chapel again at the slightest beck of the abbess or her official sisters and seemed to regard the various privations penances admonitions and repreaches of which she in the course of that day was subjected to an extraordinary share no more than a marble statue minds the inclemency of the external air or the raindrops which fall upon it though they must in time waste and consume it  the abbess who loved her niece although her affection showed itself often in a vexatious manner became at length alarmed countermanded her orders for removing eveline to an inferior cell attended herself to see her laid in bed in which as in every thing else the young lady seemed entirely passive and with something like reviving tenderness kissed and blessed her on leaving the apartment slight as the mark of kindness was it was unexpected and like the rod of moses opened the hidden fountains of waters eveline wept a resource which had been that day denied to hershe prayedand finally sobbed herself to sleep like an infant with a mind somewhat tranquillized by having given way to this tide of natural emotion  she awoke more than once in the night to recall mingled and gloomy dreams of cells and of castles of funerals and of bridals of coronets and of racks and gibbets but towards morning she fell into sleep more sound than she had hitherto enjoyed and her visions partook of its soothing character the lady of the garde doloureuse seemed to smile on her amid her dreams and to promise her votaress protection the shade of her father was there also and with the boldness of a dreamer she saw the paternal resemblance with awe but without fear his lips moved and she heard wordstheir import she did not fully comprehend save that they spoke of hope consolation and approaching happiness there also glided in with bright blue eyes fixed upon hers dressed in a tunic of saffroncoloured silk with a mantle of cerulean blue of antique fashion the form of a female resplendent in that delicate species of beauty which attends the fairest complexion it was she thought the britoness vanda but her countenance was no longer resentfulher long yellow hair flew not loose on her shoulders but was mysteriously braided with oak and mistletoe above all her right hand was gracefully disposed of under her mantle and it was an unmutilated unspotted and beautifully formed hand which crossed the brow of eveline yet under these assurances of favour a thrill of fear passed over her as the vision seemed to repeat or chant    widowd wife and wedded maid   betrothed betrayer and betrayd   all is done that has been said   vandas wrong has been wroken   take her pardon by this token  she bent down as if to kiss eveline who started at that instant and then awoke her hand was indeed gently pressed by one as pure and white as her own the blue eyes and fair hair of a lovely female face with halfveiled bosom and dishevelled locks flitted through her vision and indeed its lips approached to those of the lovely sleeper at the moment of her awakening but it was rose in whose arms her mistress found herself pressed and who moistened her face with tears as in a passion of affection she covered it with kisses  what means this rose said eveline thank god you are restored to mebut what mean these bursts of weeping  let me weeplet me weep said rose it is long since i have wept for joy and long i trust it will be ere i again weep for sorrow news are come on the spur from the garde doloureuse amelot has brought themhe is at libertyso is his master and in high favour with henry hear yet more but let me not tell it too hastilyyou grow pale  no no said eveline go ongo oni think i understand youi think i do  the villain randal de lacy the mastermover of all our sorrows will plague you no more he was slain by an honest welshman and grieved am i that they have hanged the poor man for his good service above all the stout old constable is himself returned from palestine as worthy and somewhat wiser than he was for it is thought he will renounce his contract with your ladyship  silly girl said eveline crimsoning as high as she had been before pale jest not amidst such a talebut can this be realityis randal indeed slainand the constable returned  these were hasty and hurried questions answered as hastily and confusedly and broken with ejaculations of surprise and thanks to heaven and to our lady until the ecstasy of delight sobered down into a sort of tranquil wonder  meanwhile damian lacy also had his explanations to receive and the mode in which they were conveyed had something remarkable damian had for some time been the inhabitant of what our age would have termed a dungeon but which in the ancient days they called a prison we are perhaps censurable in making the dwelling and the food of acknowledged and convicted guilt more comfortable and palatable than what the parties could have gained by any exertions when at large and supporting themselves by honest labour but this is a venial error compared to that of our ancestors who considering a charge and a conviction as synonymous treated the accused before sentence in a manner which would have been of itself a severe punishment after he was found guilty damian therefore notwithstanding his high birth and distinguished rank was confined after the manner of the most atrocious criminal was heavily fettered fed on the coarsest food and experienced only this alleviation that he was permitted to indulge his misery in a solitary and separate cell the wretched furniture of which was a mean bedstead and a broken table and chair a coffinand his own arms and initials were painted upon itstood in one corner to remind him of his approaching fate and a crucifix was placed in another to intimate to him that there was a world beyond that which must soon close upon him no noise could penetrate into the iron silence of his prisonno rumour either touching his own fate or that of his friends charged with being taken in open arms against the king he was subject to military law and to be put to death even without the formality of a hearing and he foresaw no milder conclusion to his imprisonment  this melancholy dwelling had been the abode of damian for nearly a month when strange as it may seem his health which had suffered much from his wounds began gradually to improve either benefited by the abstemious diet to which he was reduced or that certainty however melancholy is an evil better endured by many constitutions than the feverish contrast betwixt passion and duty but the term of his imprisonment seemed drawing speedily to a close his jailer a sullen saxon of the lowest order in more words than he had yet used to him warned him to look to a speedy change of dwelling and the tone in which he spoke convinced the prisoner there was no time to be lost he demanded a confessor and the jailer though he withdrew without reply seemed to intimate by his manner that the boon would be granted  next morning at an unusually early hour the chains and bolts of the cell were heard to clash and groan and damian was startled from a broken sleep which he had not enjoyed for above two hours his eyes were bent on the slowly opening door as if he had expected the headsman and his assistants but the jailer ushered in a stout man in a pilgrims habit is it a priest whom you bring me warden said the unhappy prisoner  he can best answer the question himself said the surly official and presently withdrew  the pilgrim remained standing on the floor with his back to the small window or rather loophole by which the cell was imperfectly lighted and gazed intently upon damian who was seated oil the side of his bed his pale cheek and dishevelled hair bearing a melancholy correspondence to his heavy irons he returned the pilgrims gaze but the imperfect light only showed him that his visiter was a stout old man who wore the scallop shell on his bonnet as a token that he had passed the sea and carried a palm branch in his hand to show he had visited the holy land  benedictine reverend father said the unhappy young man are you a priest come to unburden my conscience  i am not a priest replied the palmer but one who brings you news of discomfort  you bring them to one to whom comfort has been long a stranger and to a place which perchance never knew it replied damian  i may be the bolder in my communication said the palmer those in sorrow will better hear ill news than those whom they surprise in the possession of content and happiness  yet even the situation of the wretched said damian can be rendered more wretched by suspense i pray you reverend sir to speak the worst at onceif you come to announce the doom of this poor frame may god be gracious to the spirit which must be violently dismissed from it  i have no such charge said the palmer i come from the holy laud and have the more grief in finding you thus because my message to you was one addressed to a free man and a wealthy one  for my freedom said damian let these fetters speak and this apartment for my wealthbut speak out thy newsshould my uncle for i fear thy tale regards himwant either my arm or my fortune this dungeon and my degradation have farther pangs than i had yet supposed as they render me unable to aid him  your uncle young man said the palmer is prisoner i should rather say slave to the great soldan taken in a battle in which he did his duty though unable to avert the defeat of the christians with which it was concluded he was made prisoner while covering the retreat but not until he had slain with his own hand for his misfortune as it has proved hassan ali a favourite of the soldan the cruel pagan has caused the worthy knight to be loaded with irons heavier than those you wear and the dungeon to which he is confined would make this seem a palace the infidels first resolution was to put the valiant constable to the most dreadful death which his tormentors could devise but fame told him that hugo de lacy was a man of great power and wealth and he has demanded a ransom of ten thousand bezants of gold your uncle replied that the payment would totally impoverish him and oblige him to dispose of his whole estates even then he pleaded time must be allowed him to convert them into money the soldan replied that it imported little to him whether a hound like the constable were fat or lean and that he therefore insisted upon the full amount of the ransom but he so far relaxed as to make it payable in three portions on condition that along with the first portion of the price the nearest of kin and heir of de lacy must be placed in his hands as a hostage for what remained due on these conditions he consented your uncle should be put at liberty so soon as you arrive in palestine with the gold  now may i indeed call myself unhappy said damian that i cannot show my love and duty to my noble uncle who hath ever been a father to me in my orphan state  it will be a heavy disappointment doubtless to the constable said the palmer because he was eager to return to this happy country to fulfil a contract of marriage which he had formed with a lady of great beauty and fortune  damian shrunk together in such sort that his fetters clashed but he made no answer  were he not your uncle continued the pilgrim and well known as a wise man i should think he is not quite prudent in this matter whatever he was before he left england two summers spent in the wars of palestine and another amid the tortures and restraints of a heathen prison have made him a sorry bridegroom  peace pilgrim said de lacy with a commanding tone it is not thy part to censure such a noble knight as my uncle nor is it meet that i should listen to your strictures  i crave your pardon young man said the palmer i spoke not without some view to your interest which methinks does not so well consort with thine uncle having an heir of his body  peace base man said damian by heaven i think worse of my cell than i did before since its doors opened to such a counsellor and of my chains since they restrain me from chastising himdepart i pray thee  not till i have your answer for your uncle answered the palmer my age scorns the anger of thy youth as the rock despises the foam of the rivulet dashed against it  then say to my uncle answered damian i am a prisoner or i would have come to himi am a confiscated beggar or i would have sent him my all  such virtuous purposes are easily and boldly announced said the palmer when he who speaks them knows that he cannot be called upon to make good the boast of his tongue but could i tell thee of thy restoration to freedom and wealth i trow thou wouldst consider twice ere thy act confirmed the sacrifice thou hast in thy present state promised so glibly  leave me i prithee old man said damian thy thought cannot comprehend the tenor of minego and add not to my distress insults which i have not the means to avenge  but what if i had it in my power to place thee in the situation of a free and wealthy man would it please thee then to be reminded of thy present boast for if not thou mayst rely on my discretion never to mention the difference of sentiment between damian bound and damian at liberty  how meanest thouor hast thou any meaning save to torment me said the youth  not so replied the old palmer plucking from his bosom a parchment scroll to which a heavy seal was attachedknow that thy cousin randal hath been strangely slain and his treacheries towards the constable and thee as strangely discovered the king in requital of thy sufferings hath sent thee this full pardon and endowed thee with a third part of those ample estates which by his death revert to the crown  and hath the king also restored my freedom and my right of blood exclaimed damian  from this moment forthwith said the palmerlook upon the parchmentbehold the royal hand and seal  i must have better proofhere he exclaimed loudly clashing his irons at the same time here thou doggetwarder son of a saxon wolfhound  the palmer striking on the door seconded the previous exertions for summoning the jailer who entered accordingly  warder said damian de lacy in a stern tone am i yet thy prisoner or no  the sullen jailer consulted the palmer by a look and then answered to damian that he was a free man  then death of thy heart slave said damian impatiently why hang these fetters on the free limbs of a norman noble each moment they confine him are worth a lifetime of bondage to such a serf as thou  they are soon rid of sir damian said the man and i pray you to take some patience when you remember that ten minutes since you had little right to think these bracelets would have been removed for any other purpose than your progress to the scaffold  peace bandog said damian and be speedyand thou who hast brought me these good tidings i forgive thy former bearingthou thoughtest doubtless that it was prudent to extort from me professions during my bondage which might in honour decide my conduct when at large the suspicion inferred in it was somewhat offensive but thy motive was to ensure my uncles liberty  and it is really your purpose said the palmer to employ your newlygained freedom in a voyage to syria and to exchange your english prison for the dungeon of the soldan  if thou thyself wilt act as my guide answered the undaunted youth you shall not say i dally by the way  and the ransom said the palmer how is that to be provided  how but from the estates which nominally restored to me remain in truth and justice my uncles and must be applied to his use in the first instance if i mistake not greatly there is not a jew or lombard who would not advance the necessary sums on such securitytherefore dog he continued addressing the jailer hasten thy unclenching and undoing of rivets and be not dainty of giving me a little pain so thou break no limb for i cannot afford to be stayed on my journey  the palmer looked on a little while as if surprised at damians determination then exclaimed i can keep the old mans secret no longersuch highsouled generosity must not be sacrificedhark thee brave sir damian i have a mighty secret still to impart and as this saxon churl understands no french this is no unfit opportunity to communicate it know that thine uncle is a changed man in mind as he is debilitated and broken down in body peevishness and jealousy have possessed themselves of a heart which was once strong and generous his life is now on the dregs and i grieve to speak it these dregs are foul and bitter  is this thy mighty secret said damian that men grow old i know and if with infirmity of body comes infirmity of temper and mind their case the more strongly claims the dutiful observance of those who are bound to them in blood or affection  ay replied the pilgrim but the constables mind has been poisoned against thee by rumours which have reached his ear from england that there have been thoughts of affection betwixt thee and his betrothed bride eveline berengerha have i touched you now  not a whit said damian putting on the strongest resolution with which his virtue could supply himit was but this fellow who struck my shinbone somewhat sharply with his hammer proceed my uncle heard such a report and believed it  he did said the palmeri can well aver it since he concealed no thought from me but he prayed me carefully to hide his suspicions from you otherwise said he the young wolfcub will never thrust himself into the trap for the deliverance of the old hewolf were he once in my prisonhouse your uncle continued to speak of you he should rot and die ere i sent one penny of ransom to set at liberty the lover of my betrothed bride  could this be my uncles sincere purpose said damian all aghast could he plan so much treachery towards me as to leave me in the captivity into which i threw myself for his redemption tush it cannot be  flatter not yourself with such a vain opinion said the palmer if you go to syria you go to eternal captivity while your uncle returns to possession of wealth little diminishedand of eveline berenger  ha ejaculated damian and looking down for an instant demanded of the palmer in a subdued voice what he would have him do in such an extremity  the case is plain according to my poor judgment replied the palmer no one is bound to faith with those who mean to observe none with him anticipate this treachery of your uncle and let his now short and infirm existence moulder out in the pestiferous cell to which he would condemn your youthful strength the royal grant has assigned you lands enough for your honourable support and wherefore not unite with them those of the garde doloureuse eveline berenger if i do not greatly mistake will scarcely say nay ay morei vouch it on my soul that she will say yes for i have sure information of her mind and for her precontract a word from henry to his holiness now that they are in the heyday of their reconciliation will obliterate the name hugh from the parchment and insert damian in its stead  now by my faith said damian arising and placing his foot upon the stool that the warder might more easily strike off the last ring by which he was encumberedi have heard of such things as thisi have heard of beings who with seeming gravity of word and aspectwith subtle counsels artfully applied to the frailties of human naturehave haunted the cells of despairing men and made them many a fair promise if they would but exchange for their byways the paths of salvation such are the fiends dearest agents and in such a guise hath the fiend himself been known to appear in the name of god old man if human thou art begonei like not thy words or thy presencei spit at thy counsels and mark me he added with a menacing gesture look to thine own safety i shall presently be at liberty  boy replied the palmer folding his arms contemptuously in his cloak i scorn thy menacesi leave thee not till we know each other better  i too said damian would fain know whether thou best man or fiend and now for the trial as he spoke the last shackle fell from his leg and clashed on the pavement and at the same moment he sprung on the palmer caught him by the waist and exclaimed as he made three distinct and separate attempts to lift him up and dash him headlong to the earth this for maligning a noblemanthis for doubting the honour of a knightand this with a yet more violent exertion for belying a lady  each effort of damian seemed equal to have rooted up a tree yet though they staggered the old man they overthrew him not and while damian panted with his last exertion he replied and take this for so roughly entreating thy fathers brother  as he spoke damian de lacy the best youthful wrestler in cheshire received no soft fall on the floor of the dungeon he arose slowly and astounded but the palmer had now thrown back both hood and dalmatique and the features though bearing marks of age and climate were those of his uncle the constable who calmly observed i think damian thou art become stronger or i weaker since my breast was last pressed against yours in our countrys celebrated sport thou hadst nigh had me down in that last turn but that i knew the old de lacys backtrip as well as thoubut wherefore kneel man he raised him with much kindness kissed his cheek and proceeded think not my dearest nephew that i meant in my late disguise to try your faith which i myself never doubted but evil tongues had been busy and it was this which made me resolve on an experiment the result of which has been as i expected most honourable for you and know for these walls have sometimes ears even according to the letter there are ears and eyes not far distant which have heard and seen the whole marry i wish though thy last hug had not been so severe a one my ribs still feel the impression of thy knuckles  dearest and honoured uncle said damianexcuse  there is nothing to excuse replied his uncle interrupting him have we not wrestled a turn before nowbut there remains yet one trial for thee to go throughget thee out of this hole speedilydon thy best array to accompany me to the church at noon for damian thou must be present at the marriage of the lady eveline berenger  this proposal at once struck to the earth the unhappy young man for mercys sake he exclaimed hold me excused in this my gracious unclei have been of late severely wounded and am very weak  as my bones can testify said his uncle why man thou hast the strength of a norway bear  passion answered damian might give me strength for a moment but dearest uncle ask any thing of me rather than this methinks if i have been faulty some other punishment might suffice  i tell thee said the constable thy presence is necessary indispensably necessary strange reports have been abroad which thy absence on this occasion would go far to confirm evelines character and mine own are concerned in this  if so said damian if it be indeed so no task will be too hard for me but i trust when the ceremony is over you will not refuse me your consent to take the cross unless you should prefer my joining the troops destined as i heard for the conquest of ireland  ay ay said the constable if eveline grant you permission i will not withhold mine  uncle said damian somewhat sternly you do not know the feelings which you jest with  nay said the constable i compel nothing for if thou goest to the church and likest not the match thou mayst put a stop to it if thou wiltthe sacrament cannot proceed without the bridegrooms consent  i understand you not uncle said damian you have already consented  yes damian he said i haveto withdraw my claim and to relinquish it in thy favour for if eveline berenger is wedded today thou art her bridegroom the church has given her sanction the king his approbationthe lady says not nayand the question only now remains whether the bridegroom will say yes  the nature of the answer may be easily conceived nor is it necessary to dwell upon the splendour of the ceremonial which to atone for his late unmerited severity henry honoured with his own presence amelot and rose were shortly afterwards united old flammock having been previously created a gentleman of coat armour that the gentle norman blood might without utter derogation mingle with the meaner stream that coloured the cheek with crimson and meandered in azure over the lovely neck and bosom of the fair fleming there was nothing in the manner of the constable towards his nephew and his bride which could infer a regret of the generous selfdenial which he had exercised in favour of their youthful passion but he soon after accepted a high command in the troops destined to invade ireland and his name is found amongst the highest in the roll of the chivalrous normans who first united that fair island to the english crown  eveline restored to her own fair castle and domains failed not to provide for her confessor as well as for her old soldiers servants and retainers forgetting their errors and remembering their fidelity the confessor was restored to the fleshpots of egypt more congenial to his habits than the meagre fare of his convent even gillian had the means of subsistence since to punish her would have been to distress the faithful raoul they quarrelled for the future part of their lives in plenty just as they had formerly quarrelled in poverty for wrangling curs will fight over a banquet as fiercely as over a bare bone raoul died first and gillian having lost her whetstone found that as her youthful looks decayed her wit turned somewhat blunt she therefore prudently commenced devotee and spent hours in long panegyrics on her departed husband  the only serious cause of vexation which i can trace the lady eveline having been tried with arose from a visit of her saxon relative made with much form but unfortunately at the very time which the lady abbess had selected for that same purpose the discord which arose between these honoured personages was of a double character for they were norman and saxon and moreover differed in opinion concerning the time of holding easter this however was but a slight gale to disturb the general serenity of eveline for with her unhopedfor union with damian ended the trials and sorrows of the betrothed  end of the betrothed
