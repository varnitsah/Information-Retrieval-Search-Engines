62611825	john marr and other poems  by  herman melville  with an introductory note by henry chapin   mcmxxii    introductory note  melvilles verse printed for the most part privately in small editions from middle life onward after his great prose work had been written taken as a whole is of an amateurish and uneven quality in it however that loveable freshness of personality which his philosophical dejection never quenched is everywhere in evidence it is clear that he did not set himself to master the poets art yet through the mask of conventional verse which often falls into doggerel the voice of a true poet is heard in selecting the pieces for this volume i have put in the vigorous sea verses of john marr in their entirety and added those others from his battle pieces timoleon etc that best indicate the quality of their authors personality the prose supplement to battle pieces has been included because it does so much to explain the feeling of his war verse and further because it is such a remarkably wise and clear commentary upon those confused and troublous days of postwar reconstruction   h c   contents  introductory note  john marr and other poems   john marr and other

supplement  were i fastidiously anxious for the symmetry of this book it would close with the notes but the times are such that patriotismnot free from solicitudeurges a claim overriding all literary scruples  it is more than a year since the memorable surrender but events have not yet rounded themselves into completion not justly can we complain of this there has been an upheaval affecting the basis of things to altered circumstances complicated adaptations are to be made there are difficulties great and novel but is reason still waiting for passion to spend itself we have sung of the soldiers and sailors but who shall hymn the politicians  in view of the infinite desirableness of reestablishment and considering that so far as feeling is concerned it depends not mainly on the temper in which the south regards the north but rather conversely one who never was a blind adherent feels constrained to submit some thoughts counting on the indulgence of his countrymen  and first it may be said that if among the feelings and opinions growing immediately out of a great civil convulsion there are any which time shall modify or do away they are presumably those of a less temperate and charitable cast  there seems no reason why patriotism and narrowness should go together or why intellectual impartiality should be confounded with political trimming or why serviceable truth should keep cloistered because not partisan yet the work of reconstruction if admitted to be feasible at all demands little but common sense and christian charity little but these these are much  some of us are concerned because as yet the south shows no penitence but what exactly do we mean by this since down to the close of the war she never confessed any for braving it the only penitence now left her is that which springs solely from the sense of discomfiture and since this evidently would be a contrition hypocritical it would be unworthy in us to demand it certain it is that penitence in the sense of voluntary humiliation will never be displayed nor does this afford just ground for unreserved condemnation it is enough for all practical purposes if the south have been taught by the terrors of civil war to feel that secession like slavery is against destiny that both now lie buried in one grave that her fate is linked with ours and that together we comprise the nation  the clouds of heroes who battled for the union it is needless to eulogize here but how of the soldiers on the other side and when of a free community we name the soldiers we thereby name the people it was in subserviency to the slaveinterest that secession was plotted but it was under the plea plausibly urged that certain inestimable rights guaranteed by the constitution were directly menaced that the people of the south were cajoled into revolution through the arts of the conspirators and the perversity of fortune the most sensitive love of liberty was entrapped into the support of a war whose implied end was the erecting in our advanced century of an angloamerican empire based upon the systematic degradation of man  spite this clinging reproach however signal military virtues and achievements have conferred upon the confederate arms historic fame and upon certain of the commanders a renown extending beyond the seaa renown which we of the north could not suppress even if we would in personal character also not a few of the military leaders of the south enforce forbearance the memory of others the north refrains from disparaging and some with more or less of reluctance she can respect posterity sympathizing with our convictions but removed from our passions may perhaps go farther here if george iv could out of the graceful instinct of a gentleman raise an honorable monument in the great fane of christendom over the remains of the enemy of his dynasty charles edward the invader of england and victor in the rout of preston pansupon whose head the kings ancestor but one reign removed had set a priceis it probable that the granchildren of general grant will pursue with rancor or slur by sour neglect the memory of stonewall jackson  but the south herself is not wanting in recent histories and biographies which record the deeds of her chieftainswritings freely published at the north by loyal houses widely read here and with a deep though saddened interest by students of the war such works are hailed as welcome accessories and tending to the completeness of the record  supposing a happy issue out of present perplexities then in the generation next to come southerners there will be yielding allegiance to the union feeling all their interests bound up in it and yet cherishing unrebuked that kind of feeling for the memory of the soldiers of the fallen confederacy that burns scott and the ettrick shepherd felt for the memory of the gallant clansmen ruined through their fidelity to the stuartsa feeling whose passion was tempered by the poetry imbuing it and which in no wise affected their loyalty to the georges and which it may be added indirectly contributed excellent things to literature but setting this view aside dishonorable would it be in the south were she willing to abandon to shame the memory of brave men who with signal personal disinterestedness warred in her behalf though from motives as we believe so deplorably astray  patriotism is not baseness neither is it inhumanity the mourners who this summer bear flowers to the mounds of the virginian and georgian dead are in their domestic bereavement and proud affection as sacred in the eye of heaven as are those who go with similar offerings of tender grief and love into the cemeteries of our northern martyrs and yet in one aspect how needless to point the contrast  cherishing such sentiments it will hardly occasion surprise that in looking over the battlepieces in the foregoing collection i have been tempted to withdraw or modify some of them fearful lest in presenting though but dramatically and by way of poetic record the passions and epithets of civil war i might be contributing to a bitterness which every sensible american must wish at an end so too with the emotion of victory as reproduced on some pages and particularly toward the close it should not be construed into an exultation misappliedan exultation as ungenerous as unwise and made to minister however indirectly to that kind of censoriousness too apt to be produced in certain natures by success after trying reverses zeal is not of necessity religion neither is it always of the same essence with poetry or patriotism  there are excesses which marked the conflict most of which are perhaps inseparable from a civil strife so intense and prolonged and involving warfare in some border countries new and imperfectly civilized barbarities also there were for which the southern people collectively can hardly be held responsible though perpetrated by ruffians in their name but surely other qualitiesexalted onescourage and fortitude matchless were likewise displayed and largely and justly may these be held the characteristic traits and not the former  in this view what northern writer however patriotic but must revolt from acting on paper a part any way akin to that of the live dog to the dead lion and yet it is right to rejoice for our triumphs so far as it may justly imply an advance for our whole country and for humanity  let it be held no reproach to any one that he pleads for reasonable consideration for our late enemies now stricken down and unavoidably debarred for the time from speaking through authorized agencies for themselves nothing has been urged here in the foolish hope of conciliating those menfew in number we trustwho have resolved never to be reconciled to the union on such hearts everything is thrown away except it be religious commiseration and the sincerest yet let them call to mind that unhappy secessionist not a military man who with impious alacrity fired the first shot of the civil war at sumter and a little more than four years afterward fired the last one into his heart at richmond  noble was the gesture into which patriotic passion surprised the people in a utilitarian time and country yet the glory of the war falls short of its pathosa pathos which now at last ought to disarm all animosity  how many and earnest thoughts still rise and how hard to repress them we feel what past years have been and years unretarded years shall come may we all have moderation may we all show candor though perhaps nothing could ultimately have averted the strife and though to treat of human actions is to deal wholly with second causes nevertheless let us not cover up or try to extenuate what humanly speaking is the truthnamely that those unfraternal denunciations continued through years and which at last inflamed to deeds that ended in bloodshed were reciprocal and that had the preponderating strength and the prospect of its unlimited increase lain on the other side on ours might have lain those actions which now in our late opponents we stigmatize under the name of rebellion as frankly let us ownwhat it would be unbecoming to parade were foreigners concerned that our triumph was won not more by skill and bravery than by superior resources and crushing numbers that it was a triumph too over a people for years politically misled by designing men and also by some honestlyerring men who from their position could not have been otherwise than broadly influential a people who though indeed they sought to perpetuate the curse of slavery and even extend it were not the authors of it but less fortunate not less righteous than we were the fated inheritors a people who having a like origin with ourselves share essentially in whatever worthy qualities we may possess no one can add to the lasting reproach which hopeless defeat has now cast upon secession by withholding the recognition of these verities  surely we ought to take it to heart that that kind of pacification based upon principles operating equally all over the land which lovers of their country yearn for and which our arms though signally triumphant did not bring about and which lawmaking however anxious or energetic or repressive never by itself can achieve may yet be largely aided by generosity of sentiment public and private some revisionary legislation and adaptive is indispensable but with this should harmoniously work another kind of prudence not unallied with entire magnanimity benevolence and policychristianity and machiavellidissuade from penal severities toward the subdued abstinence here is as obligatory as considerate care for our unfortunate fellowmen late in bonds and if observed would equally prove to be wise forecast the great qualities of the south those attested in the war we can perilously alienate or we may make them nationally available at need  the blacks in their infant pupilage to freedom appeal to the sympathies of every humane mind the paternal guardianship which for the interval government exercises over them was prompted equally by duty and benevolence yet such kindliness should not be allowed to exclude kindliness to communities who stand nearer to us in nature for the future of the freed slaves we may well be concerned but the future of the whole country involving the future of the blacks urges a paramount claim upon our anxiety effective benignity like the nile is not narrow in its bounty and true policy is always broad to be sure it is vain to seek to glide with moulded words over the difficulties of the situation and for them who are neither partisans nor enthusiasts nor theorists nor cynics there are some doubts not readily to be solved and there are fears why is not the cessation of war now at length attended with the settled calm of peace wherefore in a clear sky do we still turn our eyes toward the south as the neapolitan months after the eruption turns his toward vesuvius do we dread lest the repose may be deceptive in the recent convulsion has the crater but shifted let us revere that sacred uncertainty which forever impends over men and nations those of us who always abhorred slavery as an atheistical iniquity gladly we join in the exulting chorus of humanity over its downfall but we should remember that emancipation was accomplished not by deliberate legislation only through agonized violence could so mighty a result be effected in our natural solicitude to confirm the benefit of liberty to the blacks let us forbear from measures of dubious constitutional rightfulness toward our white countrymenmeasures of a nature to provoke among other of the last evils exterminating hatred of race toward race in imagination let us place ourselves in the unprecedented position of the southernerstheir position as regards the millions of ignorant manumitted slaves in their midst for whom some of us now claim the suffrage let us be christians toward our fellowwhites as well as philanthropists toward the blacks our fellowmen in all things and toward all we are enjoined to do as we would be done by nor should we forget that benevolent desires after passing a certain point can not undertake their own fulfillment without incurring the risk of evils beyond those sought to be remedied something may well be left to the graduated care of future legislation and to heaven in one point of view the coexistence of the two races in the south whether the negro be bond or free seems even as it did to abraham lincoln a grave evil emancipation has ridded the country of the reproach but not wholly of the calamity especially in the present transition period for both races in the south more or less of trouble may not unreasonably be anticipated but let us not hereafter be too swift to charge the blame exclusively in any one quarter with certain evils men must be more or less patient our institutions have a potent digestion and may in time convert and assimilate to good all elements thrown in however originally alien  but so far as immediate measures looking toward permanent re establishment are concerned no consideration should tempt us to pervert the national victory into oppression for the vanquished should plausible promise of eventual good or a deceptive or spurious sense of duty lead us to essay this count we must on serious consequences not the least of which would be divisions among the northern adherents of the union assuredly if any honest catos there be who thus far have gone with us no longer will they do so but oppose us and as resolutely as hitherto they have supported but this path of thought leads toward those waters of bitterness from which one can only turn aside and be silent  but supposing reestablishment so far advanced that the southern seats in congress are occupied and by men qualified in accordance with those cardinal principles of representative government which hitherto have prevailed in the landwhat then why the congressmen elected by the people of the south willrepresent the people of the south this may seem a flat conclusion but in view of the last five years may there not be latent significance in it what will be the temper of those southern members and confronted by them what will be the mood of our own representatives in private life true reconciliation seldom follows a violent quarrel but if subsequent intercourse be unavoidable nice observances and mutual are indispensable to the prevention of a new rupture amity itself can only be maintained by reciprocal respect and true friends are punctilious equals on the floor of congress north and south are to come together after a passionate duel in which the south though proving her valor has been made to bite the dust upon differences in debate shall acrimonious recriminations be exchanged shall censorious superiority assumed by one section provoke defiant selfassertion on the other shall manassas and chickamauga be retorted for chattanooga and richmond under the supposition that the full congress will be composed of gentlemen all this is impossible yet if otherwise it needs no prophet of israel to foretell the end the maintenance of congressional decency in the future will rest mainly with the north rightly will more forbearance be required from the north than the south for the north is victor  but some there are who may deem these latter thoughts inapplicable and for this reason since the testoath operatively excludes from congress all who in any way participated in secession therefore none but southerners wholly in harmony with the north are eligible to seats this is true for the time being but the oath is alterable and in the wonted fluctuations of parties not improbably it will undergo alteration assuming such a form perhaps as not to bar the admission into the national legislature of men who represent the populations lately in revolt such a result would involve no violation of the principles of democratic government not readily can one perceive how the political existence of the millions of late secessionists can permanently be ignored by this republic the years of the war tried our devotion to the union the time of peace may test the sincerity of our faith in democracy  in no spirit of opposition not by way of challenge is anything here thrown out these thoughts are sincere ones they seem natural inevitable here and there they must have suggested themselves to many thoughtful patriots and if they be just thoughts ere long they must have that weight with the public which already they have had with individuals  for that heroic bandthose children of the furnace who in regions like texas and tennessee maintained their fidelity through terrible trialswe of the north felt for them and profoundly we honor them yet passionate sympathy with resentments so close as to be almost domestic in their bitterness would hardly in the present juncture tend to discreet legislation were the unionists and secessionists but as guelphs and ghibellines if not then far be it from a great nation now to act in the spirit that animated a triumphant townfaction in the middle ages but crowding thoughts must at last be checked and in times like the present one who desires to be impartially just in the expression of his views moves as among swordpoints presented on every side  let us pray that the terrible historic tragedy of our time may not have been enacted without instructing our whole beloved country through terror and pity and may fulfillment verify in the end those expectations which kindle the bards of progress and humanity      poems from battle pieces      the portent 1859  hanging from the beam   slowly swaying
