50441040	a footnote to history eight years of trouble in samoa by robert louis stevenson     preface   an affair which might be deemed worthy of a note of a few lines in any general history has been here expanded to the size of a volume or large pamphlet  the smallness of the scale and the singularity of the manners and events and many of the characters considered it is hoped that in spite of its outlandish subject the sketch may find readers  it has been a task of difficulty  speed was essential or it might come too late to be of any service to a distracted country  truth in the midst of conflicting rumours and in the dearth of printed material was often hard to ascertain and since most of those engaged were of my personal acquaintance it was often more than delicate to express  i must certainly have erred often and much it is not for want of trouble taken nor of an impartial temper  and if my plain speaking shall cost me any of the friends that i still count i shall be sorry but i need not be ashamed  in one particular the spelling of samoan words has been altered and the characteristic nasal n of the language written throughout ng instead of g  thus i put pangopango instead of pagopago the sound being that of soft ng in english as in singer not as in finger  r l s vailima upolu samoa     chapter ithe elements of discord native   the story i have to tell is still going on as i write the characters are alive and active it is a piece of contemporary history in the most exact sense  and yet for all its actuality and the part played in it by mails and telegraphs and iron warships the ideas and the manners of the native actors date back before the roman empire  they are christians churchgoers singers of hymns at family worship hardy cricketers their books are printed in london by spottiswoode trubner or the tract society but in most other points they are the contemporaries of our tattooed ancestors who drove their chariots on the wrong side of the roman wall  we have passed the feudal system they are not yet clear of the patriarchal  we are in the thick of the age of finance they are in a period of communism  and this makes them hard to understand  to us with our feudal ideas samoa has the first appearance of a land of despotism  an elaborate courtliness marks the race alone among polynesians terms of ceremony fly thick as oaths on board a ship commoners mylord each other when they meetand urchins as they play marbles  and for the real noble a whole private dialect is set apart the common names for an axe for blood for bamboo a bamboo knife a pig food entrails and an oven are taboo in his presence as the common names for a bug and for many offices and members of the body are taboo in the drawingrooms of english ladies  special words are set apart for his leg his face his hair his belly his eyelids his son his daughter his wife his wifes pregnancy his wifes adultery adultery with his wife his dwelling his spear his comb his sleep his dreams his anger the mutual anger of several chiefs his food his pleasure in eating the food and eating of his pigeons his ulcers his cough his sickness his recovery his death his being carried on a bier the exhumation of his bones and his skull after death  to address these demigods is quite a branch of knowledge and he who goes to visit a high chief does well to make sure of the competence of his interpreter  to complete the picture the same word signifies the watching of a virgin and the warding of a chief and the same word means to cherish a chief and to fondle a favourite child  men like us full of memories of feudalism hear of a man so addressed so flattered and we leap at once to the conclusion that he is hereditary and absolute  hereditary he is born of a great family he must always be a man of mark but yet his office is elective and in a weak sense is held on good behaviour  compare the case of a highland chief born one of the great ones of his clan he was sometimes appointed its chief officer and conventional father was loved and respected and served and fed and died for implicitly if he gave loyalty a chance and yet if he sufficiently outraged clan sentiment was liable to deposition  as to authority the parallel is not so close  doubtless the samoan chief if he be popular wields a great influence but it is limited  important matters are debated in a fono or native parliament with its feasting and parade its endless speeches and polite genealogical allusions debated i saynot decided for even a small minority will often strike a clan or a province impotent  in the midst of these ineffective councils the chief sits usually silent a kind of a gagged audience for village orators  and the deliverance of the fono seems for the moment to be final  the absolute chiefs of tahiti and hawaii were addressed as plain john and thomas the chiefs of samoa are surfeited with liphonour but the seat and extent of their actual authority is hard to find  it is so in the members of the state and worse in the belly  the idea of a sovereign pervades the air the name we have the thing we are not so sure of  and the process of election to the chief power is a mystery certain provinces have in their gift certain high titles or names as they are called  these can only be attributed to the descendants of particular lines  once granted each name conveys at once the principality whatever that be worth of the province which bestows it and counts as one suffrage towards the general sovereignty of samoa  to be indubitable king they say or some of them sayi find few in perfect harmonya man should resume five of these names in his own person  but the case is purely hypothetical local jealousy forbids its occurrence  there are rival provinces far more concerned in the prosecution of their rivalry than in the choice of a right man for king if one of these shall have bestowed its name on competitor a it will be the signal and the sufficient reason for the other to bestow its name on competitor b or c  the majority of savaii and that of aana are thus in perennial opposition  nor is this all  in 1881 laupepa the present king held the three names of malietoa natoaitele and tamasoalii tamasese held that of tuiaana and mataafa that of tuiatua  laupepa had thus a majority of suffrages he held perhaps as high a proportion as can be hoped in these distracted islands and he counted among the number the preponderant name of malietoa  here if ever was an election  here if a king were at all possible was the king  and yet the natives were not satisfied  laupepa was crowned march 19th and next month the provinces of aana and atua met in joint parliament and elected their own two princes tamasese and mataafa to an alternate monarchy tamasese taking the first trick of two years  war was imminent when the consuls interfered and any war were preferable to the terms of the peace which they procured  by the lackawanna treaty laupepa was confirmed king and tamasese set by his side in the nondescript office of viceking  the compromise was not i am told without precedent but it lacked all appearance of success  to the constitution of samoa which was already all wheels and no horses the consuls had added a fifth wheel  in addition to the old conundrum who is the king they had supplied a new one what is the viceking  two royal lines some cloudy idea of alternation between the two an electorate in which the vote of each province is immediately effectual as regards itself so that every candidate who attains one name becomes a perpetual and dangerous competitor for the other four such are a few of the more trenchant absurdities  many argue that the whole idea of sovereignty is modern and imported but it seems impossible that anything so foolish should have been suddenly devised and the constitution bears on its front the marks of dotage  but the king once elected and nominated what does he become  it may be said he remains precisely as he was  election to one of the five names is significant it brings not only dignity but power and the holder is secure from that moment of a certain following in war  but i cannot find that the further step of election to the kingship implies anything worth mention  the successful candidate is now the tupu o samoamuch good may it do him  he can so sign himself on proclamations which it does not follow that any one will heed  he can summon parliaments it does not follow they will assemble  if he be too flagrantly disobeyed he can go to war  but so he could before when he was only the chief of certain provinces  his own provinces will support him the provinces of his rivals will take the field upon the other part just as before  in so far as he is the holder of any of the five names in short he is a man to be reckoned with in so far as he is king of samoa i cannot find but what the president of a college debating society is a far more formidable officer  and unfortunately although the credit side of the account proves thus imaginary the debit side is actual and heavy  for he is now set up to be the mark of consuls he will be badgered to raise taxes to make roads to punish crime to quell rebellion and how he is to do it is not asked  if i am in the least right in my presentation of this obscure matter no one need be surprised to hear that the land is full of war and rumours of war  scarce a year goes by but what some province is in arms or sits sulky and menacing holding parliaments disregarding the kings proclamations and planting food in the bush the first step of military preparation  the religious sentiment of the people is indeed for peace at any price no pastor can bear arms and even the layman who does so is denied the sacraments  in the last war the college of malua where the picked youth are prepared for the ministry lost but a single student the rest in the bosom of a bleeding country and deaf to the voices of vanity and honour peacefully pursued their studies  but if the church looks askance on war the warrior in no extremity of need or passion forgets his consideration for the church  the houses and gardens of her ministers stand safe in the midst of armies a way is reserved for themselves along the beach where they may be seen in their white kilts and jackets openly passing the lines while not a hundred yards behind the skirmishers will be exchanging the useless volleys of barbaric warfare  women are also respected they are not fired upon and they are suffered to pass between the hostile camps exchanging gossip spreading rumour and divulging to either army the secret councils of the other this is plainly no savage war it has all the punctilio of the barbarian and all his parade feasts precede battles fine dresses and songs decorate and enliven the field and the young soldier comes to camp burning on the one hand to distinguish himself by acts of valour and on the other to display his acquaintance with field etiquette  thus after mataafa became involved in hostilities against the germans and had another code to observe beside his own he was always asking his white advisers if things were done correctly  let us try to be as wise as mataafa and to conceive that etiquette and morals differ in one country and another  we shall be the less surprised to find samoan war defaced with some unpalatable customs  the childish destruction of fruittrees in an enemys country cripples the resources of samoa and the habit of headhunting not only revolts foreigners but has begun to exercise the minds of the natives themselves  soon after the german heads were taken mr carne wesleyan missionary had occasion to visit mataafas camp and spoke of the practice with abhorrence  misi kane said one chief we have just been puzzling ourselves to guess where that custom came from but misi is it not so that when david killed goliath he cut off his head and carried it before the king  with the civil life of the inhabitants we have far less to do and yet even here a word of preparation is inevitable  they are easy merry and pleasureloving the gayest though by far from either the most capable or the most beautiful of polynesians  fine dress is a passion and makes a samoan festival a thing of beauty  song is almost ceaseless  the boatman sings at the oar the family at evening worship the girls at night in the guesthouse sometimes the workman at his toil  no occasion is too small for the poets and musicians a death a visit the days news the days pleasantry will be set to rhyme and harmony  even half grown girls the occasion arising fashion words and train choruses of children for its celebration  song as with all pacific islanders goes hand in hand with the dance and both shade into the drama  some of the performances are indecent and ugly some only dull others are pretty funny and attractive  games are popular  cricketmatches where a hundred played upon a side endured at times for weeks and ate up the country like the presence of an army  fishing the daily bath flirtation courtship which is gone upon by proxy conversation which is largely political and the delights of public oratory fill in the long hours  but the special delight of the samoan is the malanga  when people form a party and go from village to village junketing and gossiping they are said to go on a malanga  their songs have announced their approach ere they arrive the guesthouse is prepared for their reception the virgins of the village attend to prepare the kava bowl and entertain them with the dance time flies in the enjoyment of every pleasure which an islander conceives and when the malanga sets forth the same welcome and the same joys expect them beyond the next cape where the nearest village nestles in its grove of palms  to the visitors it is all golden for the hosts it has another side  in one or two words of the language the fact peeps slyly out  the same word afemoeina expresses a long call and to come as a calamity the same word lesolosolou signifies to have no intermission of pain and to have no cessation as in the arrival of visitors and soua used of epidemics bears the sense of being overcome as with fire flood or visitors  but the gem of the dictionary is the verb alovao which illustrates its pages like a humorous woodcut  it is used in the sense of to avoid visitors but it means literally hide in the wood  so by the sure hand of popular speech we have the picture of the house deserted the malanga disappointed and the host that should have been quaking in the bush  we are thus brought to the beginning of a series of traits of manners highly curious in themselves and essential to an understanding of the war  in samoa authority sits on the one hand entranced on the other property stands bound in the midst of chartered marauders  what property exists is vested in the family not in the individual and of the loose communism in which a family dwells the dictionary may yet again help us to some idea  i find a string of verbs with the following senses to deal leniently with as in helping oneself from a family plantation to give away without consulting other members of the family to go to strangers for help instead of to relatives to take from relatives without permission to steal from relatives to have plantations robbed by relatives  the ideal of conduct in the family and some of its depravations appear here very plainly  the man who in a native word of praise is mataainga a raceregarder has his hand always open to his kindred the man who is not in a native term of contempt noa knows always where to turn in any pinch of want or extremity of laziness beggary within the familyand by the less selfrespecting without ithas thus grown into a custom and a scourge and the dictionary teems with evidence of its abuse  special words signify the begging of food of uncooked food of fish of pigs of pigs for travellers of pigs for stock of taro of tarotops of tarotops for planting of tools of flyhooks of implements for netting pigeons and of mats  it is true the beggar was supposed in time to make a return somewhat as by the roman contract of mutuum  but the obligation was only moral it could not be or was not enforced as a matter of fact it was disregarded  the language had recently to borrow from the tahitians a word for debt while by a significant excidence it possessed a native expression for the failure to payto omit to make a return for property begged  conceive now the position of the householder besieged by harpies and all defence denied him by the laws of honour  the sacramental gesture of refusal his last and single resource was supposed to signify my house is destitute  until that point was reached in other words the conduct prescribed for a samoan was to give and to continue giving  but it does not appear he was at all expected to give with a good grace  the dictionary is well stocked with expressions standing ready like missiles to be discharged upon the locuststroop of shamefaced ones you draw in your head like a tern you make your voice small like a whistlepipe you beg like one delirious and the verb pongitai to look cross is equipped with the pregnant rider as at the sight of beggars  this insolence of beggars and the weakness of proprietors can only be illustrated by examples  we have a girl in our service to whom we had given some finery that she might wait at table and at her own request some warm clothing against the cold mornings of the bush  she went on a visit to her family and returned in an old tablecloth her whole wardrobe having been divided out among relatives in the course of twenty four hours  a pastor in the province of atua being a handy busy man bought a boat for a hundred dollars fifty of which he paid down presently after relatives came to him upon a visit and took a fancy to his new possession  we have long been wanting a boat said they  give us this one  so when the visit was done they departed in the boat the pastor meanwhile travelled into savaii the best way he could sold a parcel of land and begged mats among his other relatives to pay the remainder of the price of the boat which was no longer his  you might think this was enough but some months later the harpies having broken a thwart brought back the boat to be repaired and repainted by the original owner  such customs it might be argued being doubleedged will ultimately right themselves  but it is otherwise in practice  such folk as the pastors harpy relatives will generally have a boat and will never have paid for it such men as the pastor may have sometimes paid for a boat but they will never have one  it is there as it is with us at home the measure of the abuse of either system is the blackness of the individual heart  the same man who would drive his poor relatives from his own door in england would besiege in samoa the doors of the rich and the essence of the dishonesty in either case is to pursue ones own advantage and to be indifferent to the losses of ones neighbour  but the particular drawback of the polynesian system is to depress and stagger industry  to work more is there only to be more pillaged to save is impossible  the family has then made a good day of it when all are filled and nothing remains over for the crew of freebooters and the injustice of the system begins to be recognised even in samoa  one native is said to have amassed a certain fortune two clever lads have individually expressed to us their discontent with a system which taxes industry to pamper idleness and i hear that in one village of savaii a law has been passed forbidding gifts under the penalty of a sharp fine  under this economic regimen the unpopularity of taxes which strike all at the same time which expose the industrious to a perfect siege of mendicancy and the lazy to be actually condemned to a days labour may be imagined without words  it is more important to note the concurrent relaxation of all sense of property  from applying for help to kinsmen who are scarce permitted to refuse it is but a step to taking from them in the dictionary phrase without permission from that to theft at large is but a hairsbreadth     chapter iithe elements of discord foreign   the huge majority of samoans like other godfearing folk in other countries are perfectly content with their own manners  and upon one condition it is plain they might enjoy themselves far beyond the average of man  seated in islands very rich in food the idleness of the many idle would scarce matter and the provinces might continue to bestow their names among rival pretenders and fall into war and enjoy that a while and drop into peace and enjoy that in a manner highly to be envied  but the conditionthat they should be let aloneis now no longer possible  more than a hundred years ago and following closely on the heels of cook an irregular invasion of adventurers began to swarm about the isles of the pacific  the seven sleepers of polynesia stand still but half aroused in the midst of the century of competition  and the island races comparable to a shopful of crockery launched upon the stream of time now fall to make their desperate voyage among pots of brass and adamant  apia the port and mart is the seat of the political sickness of samoa at the foot of a peaked woody mountain the coast makes a deep indent roughly semicircular  in front the barrier reef is broken by the fresh water of the streams if the swell be from the north it enters almost without diminution and the warships roll dizzily at their moorings and along the fringing coral which follows the configuration of the beach the surf breaks with a continuous uproar  in wild weather as the world knows the roads are untenable  along the whole shore which is everywhere green and level and overlooked by inland mountaintops the town lies drawn out in strings and clusters  the western horn is mulinuu the eastern matautu and from one to the other of these extremes i ask the reader to walk  he will find more of the history of samoa spread before his eyes in that excursion than has yet been collected in the bluebooks or the whitebooks of the world  mulinuu where the walk is to begin is a flat windswept promontory planted with palms backed against a swamp of mangroves and occupied by a rather miserable village  the reader is informed that this is the proper residence of the samoan kings he will be the more surprised to observe a board set up and to read that this historic village is the property of the german firm  but these boards which are among the commonest features of the landscape may be rather taken to imply that the claim has been disputed  a little farther east he skirts the stores offices and barracks of the firm itself  thence he will pass through matafele the one really townlike portion of this long string of villages by german bars and stores and the german consulate and reach the catholic mission and cathedral standing by the mouth of a small river  the bridge which crosses here bridge of mulivai is a frontier behind is matafele beyond apia proper behind germans are supreme beyond with but few exceptions all is anglosaxon  here the reader will go forward past the stores of mr moors american and messrs macarthur english past the english mission the office of the english newspaper the english church and the old american consulate till he reaches the mouth of a larger river the vaisingano  beyond in matautu his way takes him in the shade of many trees and by scattered dwellings and presently brings him beside a great range of offices the place and the monument of a german who fought the german firm during his life  his house now he is dead remains pointed like a discharged cannon at the citadel of his old enemies  fitly enough it is at present leased and occupied by englishmen  a little farther and the reader gains the eastern flanking angle of the bay where stands the pilothouse and signalpost and whence he can see on the line of the main coast of the island the british and the new american consulates  the course of his walk will have been enlivened by a considerable to and fro of pleasure and business  he will have encountered many varieties of whitessailors merchants clerks priests protestant missionaries in their pith helmets and the nondescript hangerson of any island beach and the sailors are sometimes in considerable force but not the residents  he will think at times there are more signboards than men to own them  it may chance it is a full day in the harbour he will then have seen all manner of ships from menofwar and deepsea packets to the labour vessels of the german firm and the cockboat island schooner and if he be of an arithmetical turn he may calculate that there are more whites afloat in apia bay than whites ashore in the whole archipelago  on the other hand he will have encountered all ranks of natives chiefs and pastors in their scrupulous white clothes perhaps the king himself attended by guards in uniform smiling policemen with their pewter stars girls women crowds of cheerful children  and he will have asked himself with some surprise where these reside  here and there in the back yards of european establishments he may have had a glimpse of a native house elbowed in a corner but since he left mulinuu none on the beach where islanders prefer to live scarce one on the line of street  the handful of whites have everything the natives walk in a foreign town  a year ago on a knoll behind a barroom he might have observed a native house guarded by sentries and flown over by the standard of samoa  he would then have been told it was the seat of government driven as i have to relate over the mulivai and from beyond the german town into the anglosaxon  today he will learn it has been carted back again to its old quarters  and he will think it significant that the king of the islands should be thus shuttled to and fro in his chief city at the nod of aliens  and then he will observe a feature more significant still a house with some concourse of affairs policemen and idlers hanging by a man at a bankcounter overhauling manifests perhaps a trial proceeding in the front verandah or perhaps the council breaking up in knots after a stormy sitting  and he will remember that he is in the eleele sa the forbidden soil or neutral territory of the treaties that the magistrate whom he has just seen trying native criminals is no officer of the native kings and that this the only port and place of business in the kingdom collects and administers its own revenue for its own behoof by the hands of white councillors and under the supervision of white consuls  let him go further afield  he will find the roads almost everywhere to cease or to be made impassable by native pigfences bridges to be quite unknown and houses of the whites to become at once a rare exception  set aside the german plantations and the frontier is sharp  at the boundary of the eleele sa europe ends samoa begins  here then is a singular state of affairs all the money luxury and business of the kingdom centred in one place that place excepted from the native government and administered by whites for whites and the whites themselves holding it not in common but in hostile camps so that it lies between them like a bone between two dogs each growling each clutching his own end  should apia ever choose a coat of arms i have a motto ready enter rumour painted full of tongues  the majority of the natives do extremely little the majority of the whites are merchants with some four mails in the month shopkeepers with some ten or twenty customers a day and gossip is the common resource of all  the town hums to the days news and the bars are crowded with amateur politicians  some are office seekers and earwig king and consul and compass the fall of officials with an eye to salary  some are humorists delighted with the pleasure of faction for itself   i never saw so good a place as this apia said one of these you can be in a new conspiracy every day  many on the other hand are sincerely concerned for the future of the country  the quarters are so close and the scale is so small that perhaps not any one can be trusted always to preserve his temper  every one tells everything he knows that is our country sickness  nearly every one has been betrayed at times and told a trifle more the way our sickness takes the predisposed  and the news flies and the tongues wag and fists are shaken  pot boil and caldron bubble  within the memory of man the white people of apia lay in the worst squalor of degradation  they are now unspeakably improved both men and women  today they must be called a more than fairly respectable population and a much more than fairly intelligent  the whole would probably not fill the ranks of even an english halfbattalion yet there are a surprising number above the average in sense knowledge and manners  the trouble for samoa is that they are all here after a livelihood  some are sharp practitioners some are famous justly or not for foul play in business  tales fly  one merchant warns you against his neighbour the neighbour on the first occasion is found to return the compliment each with a good circumstantial story to the proof  there is so much copra in the islands and no more a mans share of it is his share of bread and commerce like politics is here narrowed to a focus shows its ugly side and becomes as personal as fisticuffs  close at their elbows in all this contention stands the native looking on  like a child his true analogue he observes apprehends misapprehends and is usually silent  as in a child a considerable intemperance of speech is accompanied by some power of secrecy  news he publishes his thoughts have often to be dug for  he looks on at the rude career of the dollarhunt and wonders  he sees these men rolling in a luxury beyond the ambition of native kings he hears them accused by each other of the meanest trickery he knows some of them to be guilty and what is he to think  he is strongly conscious of his own position as the common milkcow and what is he to do  surely these white men on the beach are not great chiefs is a common question perhaps asked with some design of flattering the person questioned  and one stung by the last incident into an unusual flow of english remarked to me i begin to be weary of white men on the beach  but the true centre of trouble the head of the boil of which samoa languishes is the german firm  from the conditions of business a great island house must ever be an inheritance of care and it chances that the greatest still afoot has its chief seat in apia bay and has sunk the main part of its capital in the island of upolu  when its founder john caesar godeffroy went bankrupt over russian paper and westphalian iron his most considerable asset was found to be the south sea business  this passed i understand through the hands of baring brothers in london and is now run by a company rejoicing in the gargantuan name of the deutsche handels und plantagen gesellschaft fur sudsee inseln zu hamburg  this piece of literature is in practice shortened to the d h and p g the old firm the german firm the firm and among humorists the long handle firm  even from the deck of an approaching ship the island is seen to bear its signaturezones of cultivation showing in a more vivid tint of green on the dark vest of forest  the total area in use is near ten thousand acres  hedges of fragrant lime enclose broad avenues intersect them  you shall walk for hours in parks of palmtree alleys regular like soldiers on parade in the recesses of the hills you may stumble on a millhouse toiling and trembling there fathoms deep in superincumbent forest  on the carpet of clean sward troops of horses and herds of handsome cattle may be seen to browse and to one accustomed to the rough luxuriance of the tropics the appearance is of fairyland the managers many of them german seacaptains are enthusiastic in their new employment  experiment is continually afoot coffee and cacao both of excellent quality are among the more recent outputs and from one plantation quantities of pineapples are sent at a particular season to the sydney markets  a hundred and fifty thousand pounds of english money perhaps two hundred thousand lie sunk in these magnificent estates  in estimating the expense of maintenance quite a fleet of ships must be remembered and a strong staff of captains supercargoes overseers and clerks  these last mess together at a liberal board the wages are high and the staff is inspired with a strong and pleasing sentiment of loyalty to their employers  seven or eight hundred imported men and women toil for the company on contracts of three or of five years and at a hypothetical wage of a few dollars in the month  i am now on a burning question the labour traffic and i shall ask permission in this place only to touch it with the tongs  suffice it to say that in queensland fiji new caledonia and hawaii it has been either suppressed or placed under close public supervision  in samoa where it still flourishes there is no regulation of which the public receives any evidence and the dirty linen of the firm if there be any dirty and if it be ever washed at all is washed in private  this is unfortunate if germans would believe it  but they have no idea of publicity keep their business to themselves rather affect to move in a mysterious way and are naturally incensed by criticisms which they consider hypocritical from men who would import labour for themselves if they could afford it and would probably maltreat them if they dared  it is said the whip is very busy on some of the plantations it is said that punitive extralabour by which the thralls term of service is extended has grown to be an abuse and it is complained that even where that term is out much irregularity occurs in the repatriation of the discharged  to all this i can say nothing good or bad  a certain number of the thralls many of them wild negritos from the west have taken to the bush harbour there in a state partly bestial or creep into the back quarters of the town to do a days stealthy labour under the nose of their proprietors  twelve were arrested one morning in my own boys kitchen  farther in the bush huts small patches of cultivation and smoking ovens have been found by hunters  there are still three runaways in the woods of tutuila whither they escaped upon a raft  and the samoans regard these darkskinned rangers with extreme alarm the fourth refugee in tutuila was shot down as i was told in that island while carrying off the virgin of a village and tales of cannibalism run round the country and the natives shudder about the evening fire  for the samoans are not cannibals do not seem to remember when they were and regard the practice with a disfavour equal to our own  the firm is gulliver among the lilliputs and it must not be forgotten that while the small independent traders are fighting for their own hand and inflamed with the usual jealousy against corporations the germans are inspired with a sense of the greatness of their affairs and interests  the thought of the money sunk the sight of these costly and beautiful plantations menaced yearly by the returning forest and the responsibility of administering with one hand so many conjunct fortunes might well nerve the manager of such a company for desperate and questionable deeds  upon this scale commercial sharpness has an air of patriotism and i can imagine the man so far from haggling over the scourge for a few solomon islanders prepared to oppress rival firms overthrow inconvenient monarchs and let loose the dogs of war  whatever he may decide he will not want for backing  every clerk will be eager to be up and strike a blow and most germans in the group whatever they may babble of the firm over the walnuts and the wine will rally round the national concern at the approach of difficulty  they are so fewi am ashamed to give their number it were to challenge contradictionthey are so few and the amount of national capital buried at their feet is so vast that we must not wonder if they seem oppressed with greatness and the sense of empire  other whites take part in our brabbles while temper holds out with a certain schoolboy entertainment  in the germans alone no trace of humour is to be observed and their solemnity is accompanied by a touchiness often beyond belief  patriotism flies in arms about a hen and if you comment upon the colour of a dutch umbrella you have cast a stone against the german emperor  i give one instance typical although extreme  one who had returned from tutuila on the mail cutter complained of the vermin with which she is infested  he was suddenly and sharply brought to a stand  the ship of which he spoke he was reminded was a german ship  john caesar godeffroy himself had never visited the islands his sons and nephews came indeed but scarcely to reap laurels and the mainspring and headpiece of this great concern until death took him was a certain remarkable man of the name of theodor weber  he was of an artful and commanding character in the smallest thing or the greatest without fear or scruple equally able to affect equally ready to adopt the most engaging politeness or the most imperious airs of domination  it was he who did most damage to rival traders it was he who most harried the samoans and yet i never met any one white or native who did not respect his memory  all felt it was a gallant battle and the man a great fighter and now when he is dead and the war seems to have gone against him many can scarce remember without a kind of regret how much devotion and audacity have been spent in vain  his name still lives in the songs of samoa  one that i have heard tells of misi ueba and a biscuitboxthe suggesting incident being long since forgotten  another sings plaintively how all things land and food and property pass progressively as by a law of nature into the hands of misi ueba and soon nothing will be left for samoans  this is an epitaph the man would have enjoyed  at one period of his career weber combined the offices of director of the firm and consul for the city of hamburg  no question but he then drove very hard  germans admit that the combination was unfortunate and it was a german who procured its overthrow  captain zembsch superseded him with an imperial appointment one still remembered in samoa as the gentleman who acted justly  there was no house to be found and the new consul must take up his quarters at first under the same roof with weber on several questions in which the firm was vitally interested zembsch embraced the contrary opinion  riding one day with an englishman in vailele plantation he was startled by a burst of screaming leaped from the saddle ran round a house and found an overseer beating one of the thralls  he punished the overseer and being a kindly and perhaps not a very diplomatic man talked high of what he felt and what he might consider it his duty to forbid or to enforce  the firm began to look askance at such a consul and worse was behind  a number of deeds being brought to the consulate for registration zembsch detected certain transfers of land in which the date the boundaries the measure and the consideration were all blank  he refused them with an indignation which he does not seem to have been able to keep to himself and whether or not by his fault some of these unfortunate documents became public  it was plain that the relations between the two flanks of the german invasion the diplomatic and the commercial were strained to bursting but weber was a man ill to conquer  zembsch was recalled and from that time forth whether through influence at home or by the solicitations of weber on the spot the german consulate has shown itself very apt to play the game of the german firm  that game we may say was twofoldthe first part even praiseworthy the second at least natural  on the one part they desired an efficient native administration to open up the country and punish crime they wished on the other to extend their own provinces and to curtail the dealings of their rivals  in the first they had the jealous and diffident sympathy of all whites in the second they had all whites banded together against them for their lives and livelihoods  it was thus a game of beggar my neighbour between a large merchant and some small ones  had it so remained it would still have been a cutthroat quarrel  but when the consulate appeared to be concerned when the warships of the german empire were thought to fetch and carry for the firm the rage of the independent traders broke beyond restraint  and largely from the national touchiness and the intemperate speech of german clerks this scramble among dollarhunters assumed the appearance of an interracial war  the firm with the indomitable weber at its head and the consulate at its backthere has been the chief enemy at samoa  no english reader can fail to be reminded of john company and if the germans appear to have been not so successful we can only wonder that our own blunders and brutalities were less severely punished  even on the field of samoa though german faults and aggressors make up the burthen of my story they have been nowise alone  three nations were engaged in this infinitesimal affray and not one appears with credit  they figure but as the three ruffians of the elder playwrights  the united states have the cleanest hands and even theirs are not immaculate  it was an ambiguous business when a private american adventurer was landed with his pieces of artillery from an american warship and became prime minister to the king  it is true even if he were ever really supported that he was soon dropped and had soon sold himself for money to the german firm  i will leave it to the reader whether this trait dignifies or not the wretched story  and the end of it spattered the credit alike of england and the states when this man the premier of a friendly sovereign was kidnapped and deported on the requisition of an american consul by the captain of an english warship  i shall have to tell as i proceed of villages shelled on very trifling grounds by germans the like has been done of late years though in a better quarrel by ourselves of england i shall have to tell how the germans landed and shed blood at fangalii it was only in 1876 that we british had our own misconceived little massacre at mulinuu  i shall have to tell how the germans bludgeoned malietoa with a sudden call for money it was something of the suddenest that sir arthur gordon himself smarting under a sensible public affront made and enforced a somewhat similar demand     chapter iiithe sorrows of laupepa 1883 to 1887   you ride in a german plantation and see no bush no soul stirring only acres of empty sward miles of cocoanut alley a desert of food  in the eyes of the samoan the place has the attraction of a park for the holiday schoolboy of a granary for mice  we must add the yet more lively allurement of a haunted house for over these empty and silent miles there broods the fear of the negrito cannibal  for the samoan besides there is something barbaric unhandsome and absurd in the idea of thus growing food only to send it from the land and sell it  a man at home who should turn all yorkshire into one wheatfield and annually burn his harvest on the altar of mumbojumbo might impress ourselves not much otherwise  and the firm which does these things is quite extraneous a wen that might be excised tomorrow without loss but to itself few natives drawing from it so much as days wages and the rest beholding in it only the occupier of their acres  the nearest villages have suffered most they see over the hedge the lands of their ancestors waving with useless cocoapalms and the sales were often questionable and must still more often appear so to regretful natives spinning and improving yarns about the evening lamp  at the worst then to help oneself from the plantation will seem to a samoan very like orchardbreaking to the british schoolboy at the best it will be thought a gallant robinhoodish readjustment of a public wrong  and there is more behind  not only is theft from the plantations regarded rather as a lark and peccadillo the idea of theft in itself is not very clearly present to these communists and as to the punishment of crime in general a great gulf of opinion divides the natives from ourselves  indigenous punishments were short and sharp  death deportation by the primitive method of setting the criminal to sea in a canoe fines and in samoa itself the penalty of publicly biting a hot illsmelling root comparable to a rough forfeit in a childrens gamethese are approved  the offender is killed or punished and forgiven  we on the other hand harbour malice for a period of years continuous shame attaches to the criminal even when he is doing his besteven when he is submitting to the worst form of torture regular workhe is to stand aside from life and from his family in dreadful isolation  these ideas most polynesians have accepted in appearance as they accept other ideas of the whites in practice they reduce it to a farce  i have heard the french resident in the marquesas in talk with the french gaoler of taiohae eh bien ou sont vos prisonnieresje crois mon commandant quelles sont allees quelque part faire une visite  and the ladies would be welcome  this is to take the most savage of polynesians take some of the most civilised  in honolulu convicts labour on the highways in piebald clothing gruesome and ridiculous and it is a common sight to see the family of such an one troop out about the dinner hour wreathed with flowers and in their holiday best to picnic with their kinsman on the public wayside  the application of these outlandish penalties in fact transfers the sympathy to the offender  remember besides that the clan system and that imperfect idea of justice which is its worst feature are still lively in samoa that it is held the duty of a judge to favour kinsmen of a king to protect his vassals and the difficulty of getting a plantation thief first caught then convicted and last of all punished will appear  during the early eighties the germans looked upon this system with growing irritation  they might see their convict thrust in gaol by the front door they could never tell how soon he was enfranchised by the back and they need not be the least surprised if they met him a few days after enjoying the delights of a malanga  it was a banded conspiracy from the king and the viceking downward to evade the law and deprive the germans of their profits  in 1883 accordingly the consul dr stuebel extorted a convention on the subject in terms of which samoans convicted of offences against german subjects were to be confined in a private gaol belonging to the german firm  to dr stuebel it seemed simple enough the offenders were to be effectually punished the sufferers partially indemnified  to the samoans the thing appeared no less simple but quite different malietoa was selling samoans to misi ueba  what else could be expected  here was a private corporation engaged in making money to it was delegated upon a question of profit and loss one of the functions of the samoan crown and those who make anomalies must look for comments  public feeling ran unanimous and high prisoners who escaped from the private gaol were not recaptured or not returned and malietoa hastened to build a new prison of his own whither he conveyed or pretended to convey the fugitives  in october 1885 a trenchant state paper issued from the german consulate  twenty prisoners the consul wrote had now been at large for eight months from webers prison  it was pretended they had since then completed their term of punishment elsewhere  dr stuebel did not seek to conceal his incredulity but he took ground beyond he declared the point irrelevant the law was to be enforced  the men were condemned to a certain period in webers prison they had run away they must now be brought back and whatever had become of them in the interval work out the sentence doubtless dr stuebels demands were substantially just but doubtless also they bore from the outside a great appearance of harshness and when the king submitted the murmurs of the people increased  but weber was not yet content  the law had to be enforced property or at least the property of the firm must be respected  and during an absence of the consuls he seems to have drawn up with his own hand and certainly first showed to the king in his own house a new convention weber here and weber there  as an able man he was perhaps in the right to prepare and propose conventions  as the head of a trading company he seems far out of his part to be communicating state papers to a sovereign  the administration of justice was the colour and i am willing to believe the purpose of the new paper but its effect was to depose the existing government  a council of two germans and two samoans were to be invested with the right to make laws and impose taxes as might be desirable for the common interest of the samoan government and the german residents  the provisions of this council the king and viceking were to sign blindfold  and by a last hardship the germans who received all the benefit reserved a right to recede from the agreement on six months notice the samoans who suffered all the loss were bound by it in perpetuity  i can never believe that my friend dr stuebel had a hand in drafting these proposals i am only surprised he should have been a party to enforcing them perhaps the chief error in these islands of a man who has made few  and they were enforced with a rigour that seems injudicious  the samoans according to their own account were denied a copy of the document they were certainly rated and threatened their deliberation was treated as contumacy two german warships lay in port and it was hinted that these would shortly intervene  succeed in frightening a child and he takes refuge in duplicity malietoa one of the chiefs had written we know well we are in bondage to the great governments  it was now thought one tyrant might be better than three and any one preferable to germany  on the 5th november 1885 accordingly laupepa tamasese and fortyeight high chiefs met in secret and the supremacy of samoa was secretly offered to great britain for the second time in history  laupepa and tamasese still figured as king and viceking in the eyes of dr stuebel in their own they had secretly abdicated were become private persons and might do what they pleased without binding or dishonouring their country  on the morrow accordingly they did public humiliation in the dust before the consulate and five days later signed the convention  the last was done it is claimed upon an impulse  the humiliation which it appeared to the samoans so great a thing to offer to the practical mind of dr stuebel seemed a trifle to receive and the pressure was continued and increased  laupepa and tamasese were both heavy wellmeaning inconclusive men  laupepa educated for the ministry still bears some marks of it in character and appearance tamasese was in private of an amorous and sentimental turn but no one would have guessed it from his solemn and dull countenance  impossible to conceive two less dashing champions for a threatened race and there is no doubt they were reduced to the extremity of muddlement and childish fear  it was drawing towards night on the 10th when this luckless pair and a chief of the name of tuiatafu set out for the german consulate still minded to temporise  as they went they discussed their case with agitation  they could see the lights of the german warships as they walkedan eloquent reminder  and it was then that tamasese proposed to sign the convention  it will give us peace for the day said laupepa and afterwards great britain must decidebetter fight germany than that cried tuiatafu speaking words of wisdom and departed in anger  but the two others proceeded on their fatal errand signed the convention writing themselves king and viceking as they now believed themselves to be no longer and with childish perfidy took part in a scene of reconciliation at the german consulate  malietoa supposed himself betrayed by tamasese  consul churchward states with precision that the document was sold by a scribe for thirtysix dollars  twelve days later at least november 22nd the text of the address to great britain came into the hands of dr stuebel  the germans may have been wrong before they were now in the right to be angry  they had been publicly solemnly and elaborately fooled the treaty and the reconciliation were both fraudulent with the broad farcical fraudulency of children and barbarians  this history is much from the outside it is the digested report of eyewitnesses it can be rarely corrected from state papers and as to what consuls felt and thought or what instructions they acted under i must still be silent or proceed by guess  it is my guess that stuebel now decided malietoa laupepa to be a man impossible to trust and unworthy to be dealt with  and it is certain that the business of his deposition was put in hand at once  the position of weber with his knowledge of things native his prestige and his enterprising intellect must have always made him influential with the consul at this juncture he was indispensable  here was the deed to be done here the man of action  mr weber rested not says laupepa it was like the old days of his own consulate writes churchward  his messengers filled the isle his house was thronged with chiefs and orators he sat close over his loom delightedly weaving the future there was one thing requisite to the intriguea native pretender and the very man you would have said stood waiting mataafa titular of atua descended from both the royal lines late joint king with tamasese fobbed off with nothing in the time of the lackawanna treaty probably mortified by the circumstance a chief with a strong following and in character and capacity high above the native average  yet when webers spiriting was done and the curtain rose on the set scene of the coronation mataafa was absent and tamasese stood in his place  malietoa was to be deposed for a piece of solemn and offensive trickery and the man selected to replace him was his sole partner and accomplice in the act  for so strange a choice good ground must have existed but it remains conjectural some supposing mataafa scratched as too independent others that tamasese had indeed betrayed laupepa and his new advancement was the price of his treachery  so these two chiefs began to change places like the scales of a balance one down the other up  tamasese raised his flag jan 28th 1886 in leulumoenga chief place of his own province of aana usurped the style of king and began to collect and arm a force  weber by the admission of stuebel was in the market supplying him with weapons so were the americans so but for our salutary british law would have been the british for wherever there is a sound of battle there will the traders be gathered together selling arms  a little longer and we find tamasese visited and addressed as king and majesty by a german commodore meanwhile for the unhappy malietoa the road led downward  he was refused a bodyguard  he was turned out of mulinuu the seat of his royalty on a land claim of webers fled across the mulivai and had the coolness german expression to hoist his flag in apia  he was asked in the most polite manner says the same accountin the most delicate manner in the world a reader of marryat might be tempted to amend the phraseto strike his flag in his own capital and on his refusal to accede to this request dr stuebel appeared himself with ten men and an officer from the cruiser albatross a sailor climbed into the tree and brought down the flag of samoa which was carefully folded and sent in the most polite manner to its owner  the consuls of england and the states were there the excellent gentlemen to protest  last and yet more explicit the german commodore who visited the betitled tamasese addressed the kingwe may surely say the late kingas the high chief malietoa  had he no party then  at that time it is probable he might have called some fivesevenths of samoa to his standard  and yet he sat there helpless monarch like a fowl trussed for roasting  the blame lies with himself because he was a helpless creature it lies also with england and the states  their agents on the spot preached peace where there was no peace and no pretence of it with eloquence and iteration secretary bayard seems to have felt a call to join personally in the solemn farce and was at the expense of a telegram in which he assured the sinking monarch it was for the higher interests of samoa he should do nothing  there was no man better at doing that the advice came straight home and was devoutly followed  and to be just to the great powers something was done in europe a conference was called it was agreed to send commissioners to samoa and the decks had to be hastily cleared against their visit  dr stuebel had attached the municipality of apia and hoisted the german warflag over mulinuu the american consul in a sudden access of good service had flown the stars and stripes over samoan colours on either side these steps were solemnly retracted  the germans expressly disowned tamasese and the islands fell into a period of suspense of some twelve months duration during which the seat of the history was transferred to other countries and escapes my purview here on the spot i select three incidents the arrival on the scene of a new actor the visit of the hawaiian embassy and the riot on the emperors birthday  the rest shall be silence only it must be borne in view that tamasese all the while continued to strengthen himself in leulumoenga and laupepa sat inactive listening to the song of consuls  captain brandeis  the new actor was brandeis a bavarian captain of artillery of a romantic and adventurous character  he had served with credit in war but soon wearied of garrison life resigned his battery came to the states found employment as a civil engineer visited cuba took a subcontract on the panama canal caught the fever and came for the sake of the sea voyage to australia  he had that natural love for the tropics which lies so often latent in persons of a northern birth difficulty and danger attracted him and when he was picked out for secret duty to be the hand of germany in samoa there is no doubt but he accepted the post with exhilaration  it is doubtful if a better choice could have been made  he had courage integrity ideas of his own and loved the employment the people and the place  yet there was a fly in the ointment  the double error of unnecessary stealth and of the immixture of a trading company in political affairs has vitiated and in the end defeated much german policy  and brandeis was introduced to the islands as a clerk and sent down to leulumoenga where he was soon drilling the troops and fortifying the position of the rebel king as an agent of the german firm  what this mystification cost in the end i shall tell in another place and even in the beginning it deceived no one  brandeis is a man of notable personal appearance he looks the part allotted him and the military clerk was soon the centre of observation and rumour  malietoa wrote and complained of his presence to becker who had succeeded dr stuebel in the consulate  becker replied i have nothing to do with the gentleman brandeis  be it well known that the gentleman brandeis has no appointment in a military character but resides peaceably assisting the government of leulumoenga in their work for brandeis is a quiet sensible gentleman  and then he promised to send the viceconsul to get information of the captains doings surely supererogation of deceit  the hawaiian embassy  the prime minister of the hawaiian kingdom was at this period an adventurer of the name of gibson  he claimed on the strength of a romantic story to be the heir of a great english house  he had played a part in a revolt in java had languished in dutch fetters and had risen to be a trusted agent of brigham young the utah president it was in this character of a mormon emissary that he first came to the islands of hawaii where he collected a large sum of money for the church of the latter day saints  at a given moment he dropped his saintship and appeared as a christian and the owner of a part of the island of lanai  the steps of the transformation are obscure they seem at least to have been illreceived at salt lake and there is evidence to the effect that he was followed to the islands by mormon assassins  his first attempt on politics was made under the auspices of what is called the missionary party and the canvass conducted largely it is said with tears on the platform at prayermeetings  it resulted in defeat without any decency of delay he changed his colours abjured the errors of reform and with the support of the catholics rose to the chief power  in a very brief interval he had thus run through the gamut of religions in the south seas  it does not appear that he was any more particular in politics but he was careful to consult the character and prejudices of the late king kalakaua  that amiable far from unaccomplished but too convivial sovereign had a continued use for money gibson was observant to keep him well supplied  kalakaua one of the most theoretical of men was filled with visionary schemes for the protection and development of the polynesian race gibson fell in step with him it is even thought he may have shared in his illusions  the king and minister at least conceived between them a scheme of island confederationthe most obvious fault of which was that it came too lateand armed and fitted out the cruiser kaimiloa nestegg of the future navy of hawaii  samoa the most important group still independent and one immediately threatened with aggression was chosen for the scene of action  the hon john e bush a halfcaste hawaiian sailed december 1887 for apia as ministerplenipotentiary accompanied by a secretary of legation henry f poor and as soon as she was ready for sea the warship followed in support  the expedition was futile in its course almost tragic in result  the kaimiloa was from the first a scene of disaster and dilapidation the stores were sold the crew revolted for a great part of a night she was in the hands of mutineers and the secretary lay bound upon the deck  the mission installing itself at first with extravagance in matautu was helped at last out of the island by the advances of a private citizen  and they returned from dreams of polynesian independence to find their own city in the hands of a clique of white shopkeepers and the great gibson once again in gaol yet the farce had not been quite without effect  it had encouraged the natives for the moment and it seems to have ruffled permanently the temper of the germans  so might a fly irritate caesar  the arrival of a mission from hawaii would scarce affect the composure of the courts of europe  but in the eyes of polynesians the little kingdom occupies a place apart  it is there alone that men of their race enjoy most of the advantages and all the pomp of independence news of hawaii and descriptions of honolulu are grateful topics in all parts of the south seas and there is no better introduction than a photograph in which the bearer shall be represented in company with kalakaua  laupepa was besides sunk to the point at which an unfortunate begins to clutch at straws and he received the mission with delight  letters were exchanged between him and kalakaua a deed of confederation was signed 17th february 1887 and the signature celebrated in the new house of the hawaiian embassy with some original ceremonies  malietoa laupepa came attended by his ministry several hundred chiefs two guards and six policemen  always decent he withdrew at an early hour by those that remained all decency appears to have been forgotten high chiefs were seen to dance and day found the house carpeted with slumbering grandees who must be roused doctored with coffee and sent home  as a first chapter in the history of polynesian confederation it was hardly cheering and laupepa remarked to one of the embassy with equal dignity and sense if you have come here to teach my people to drink i wish you had stayed away  the germans looked on from the first with natural irritation that a power of the powerlessness of hawaii should thus profit by its undeniable footing in the family of nations and send embassies and make believe to have a navy and bark and snap at the heels of the great german empire but becker could not prevent the hunted laupepa from taking refuge in any hole that offered and he could afford to smile at the fantastic orgie in the embassy  it was another matter when the hawaiians approached the intractable mataafa sitting still in his atua government like achilles in his tent helping neither side and as the germans suspected keeping the eggs warm for himself  when the kaimiloa steamed out of apia on this visit the german warship adler followed at her heels and mataafa was no sooner set down with the embassy than he was summoned and ordered on board by two german officers  the step is one of those triumphs of temper which can only be admired  mataafa is entertaining the plenipotentiary of a sovereign power in treaty with his own king and the captain of a german corvette orders him to quit his guests  but there was worse to come  i gather that tamasese was at the time in the sulks  he had doubtless been promised prompt aid and a prompt success he had seen himself surreptitiously helped privately ordered about and publicly disowned and he was still the king of nothing more than his own province and already the second in command of captain brandeis  with the adhesion of some part of his native cabinet and behind the back of his white minister he found means to communicate with the hawaiians  a passage on the kaimiloa a pension and a home in honolulu were the bribes proposed and he seems to have been tempted  a day was set for a secret interview  poor the hawaiian secretary and j d strong an american painter attached to the embassy in the surprising quality of government artist landed with a samoan boatscrew in aana and while the secretary hid himself according to agreement in the outlying home of an english settler the artist ostensibly bent on photography entered the headquarters of the rebel king  it was a great day in leulumoenga three hundred recruits had come in a feast was cooking and the photographer in view of the native love of being photographed was made entirely welcome  but beneath the friendly surface all were on the alert  the secret had leaked out weber beheld his plans threatened in the root brandeis trembled for the possession of his slave and sovereign and the german viceconsul mr sonnenschein had been sent or summoned to the scene of danger  it was after dark prayers had been said and the hymns sung through all the village and strong and the german sat together on the mats in the house of tamasese when the events began  strong speaks german freely a fact which he had not disclosed and he was scarce more amused than embarrassed to be able to follow all the evening the dissension and the changing counsels of his neighbours  first the king himself was missing and there was a false alarm that he had escaped and was already closeted with poor  next came certain intelligence that some of the ministry had run the blockade and were on their way to the house of the english settler  thereupon in spite of some protests from tamasese who tried to defend the independence of his cabinet brandeis gathered a posse of warriors marched out of the village brought back the fugitives and clapped them in the corrugated iron shanty which served as gaol  along with these he seems to have seized billy coe interpreter to the hawaiians and poor seeing his conspiracy public burst with his boats crew into the town made his way to the house of the native prime minister and demanded coes release  brandeis hastened to the spot with strong at his heels and the two principals being both incensed and strong seriously alarmed for his friends safety there began among them a scene of great intemperance  at one point when strong suddenly disclosed his acquaintance with german it attained a high style of comedy at another when a pistol was most foolishly drawn it bordered on drama and it may be said to have ended in a mixed genus when poor was finally packed into the corrugated iron gaol along with the forfeited ministers  meanwhile the captain of his boat siteoni of whom i shall have to tell again had cleverly withdrawn the boatscrew at an early stage of the quarrel  among the population beyond tamaseses marches he collected a body of armed men returned before dawn to leulumoenga demolished the corrugated iron gaol and liberated the hawaiian secretary and the rump of the rebel cabinet  no opposition was shown and doubtless the rescue was connived at by brandeis who had gained his point  poor had the face to complain the next day to becker but to compete with becker in effrontery was labour lost  you have been repeatedly warned mr poor not to expose yourself among these savages said he  not long after the presence of the kaimiloa was made a casus belli by the germans and the roughandtumble embassy withdrew on borrowed money to find their own government in hot water to the neck        the emperors birthday  it is possible and it is alleged that the germans entered into the conference with hope  but it is certain they were resolved to remain prepared for either fate  and i take the liberty of believing that laupepa was not forgiven his duplicity that during this interval he stood marked like a tree for felling and that his conduct was daily scrutinised for further pretexts of offence  on the evening of the emperors birthday march 22nd 1887 certain germans were congregated in a public bar  the season and the place considered it is scarce cynical to assume they had been drinking nor so much being granted can it be thought exorbitant to suppose them possibly in fault for the squabble that took place  a squabble i say but i am willing to call it a riot  and this was the new fault of laupepa this it is that was described by a german commodore as the trampling upon by malietoa of the german emperor  i pass the rhetoric by to examine the point of liability  four natives were brought to trial for this horrid fact not before a native judge but before the german magistrate of the tripartite municipality of apia  one was acquitted one condemned for theft and two for assault  on appeal not to malietoa but to the three consuls the case was by a majority of two to one returned to the magistrate and as far as i can learn was then allowed to drop  consul becker himself laid the chief blame on one of the policemen of the municipality a half white of the name of scanlon  him he sought to have discharged but was again baffled by his brother consuls  where in all this are we to find a corner of responsibility for the king of samoa  scanlon the alleged author of the outrage was a halfwhite as becker was to learn to his cost he claimed to be an american subject and he was not even in the kings employment  apia the scene of the outrage was outside the kings jurisdiction by treaty by the choice of germany he was not so much as allowed to fly his flag there  and the denial of justice if justice were denied rested with the consuls of britain and the states  but when a dog is to be beaten any stick will serve  in the meanwhile on the proposition of mr bayard the washington conference on samoan affairs was adjourned till autumn so that the ministers of germany and great britain might submit the protocols to their respective governments  you propose that the conference is to adjourn and not to be broken up asked sir lionel west  to adjourn for the reasons stated replied bayard  this was on july 26th and twentynine days later by wednesday the 24th of august germany had practically seized samoa  for this flagrant breach of faith one excuse is openly alleged another whispered  it is openly alleged that bayard had shown himself impracticable it is whispered that the hawaiian embassy was an expression of american intrigue and that the germans only did as they were done by  the sufficiency of these excuses may be left to the discretion of the reader  but however excused the breach of faith was public and express it must have been deliberately predetermined and it was resented in the states as a deliberate insult  by the middle of august 1887 there were five sail of german warships in apia bay the bismarck of 3000 tons displacement the carola the sophie and the olga all considerable ships and the beautiful adler which lies there to this day kanted on her beam dismantled scarlet with rust the day showing through her ribs  they waited inactive as a burglar waits till the patrol goes by  and on the 23rd when the mail had left for sydney when the eyes of the world were withdrawn and samoa plunged again for a period of weeks into her original islandobscurity becker opened his guns  the policy was too cunning to seem dignified it gave to conduct which would otherwise have seemed bold and even brutally straightforward the appearance of a timid ambuscade and helped to shake mens reliance on the word of germany  on the day named an ultimatum reached malietoa at afenga whither he had retired months before to avoid friction  a fine of one thousand dollars and an ifo or public humiliation were demanded for the affair of the emperors birthday  twelve thousand dollars were to be paid quickly for thefts from german plantations in the course of the last four years it is my opinion that there is nothing just or correct in samoa while you are at the head of the government concluded becker  i shall be at afenga in the morning of tomorrow wednesday at 11 am  the blow fell on laupepa in his own expression out of the bush the dilatory fellow had seen things hang over so long he had perhaps begun to suppose they might hang over for ever and here was ruin at the door  he rode at once to apia and summoned his chiefs  the council lasted all night long many voices were for defiance  but laupepa had grown inured to a policy of procrastination and the answer ultimately drawn only begged for delay till saturday the 27th  so soon as it was signed the king took horse and fled in the early morning to afenga the council hastily dispersed and only three chiefs selu seumanu and le mamea remained by the government building tremulously expectant of the result  by seven the letter was received  by 730 becker arrived in person inquired for laupepa was evasively answered and declared war on the spot  before eight the germans seven hundred men and six guns came ashore and seized and hoisted german colours on the government building the three chiefs had made good haste to escape but a considerable booty was made of government papers firearms and some seventeen thousand cartridges  then followed a scene which long rankled in the minds of the white inhabitants when the german marines raided the town in search of malietoa burst into private houses and were accused i am willing to believe on slender grounds of violence to private persons  on the morrow the 25th one of the german warships which had been despatched to leulumoenga over night reentered the bay flying the tamasese colours at the fore  the new king was given a royal salute of twentyone guns marched through the town by the commodore and a german guard of honour and established on mulinuu with two or three hundred warriors  becker announced his recognition to the other consuls  these replied by proclaiming malietoa and in the usual mealymouthed manner advised samoans to do nothing  on the 27th martial law was declared and on the 1st september the german squadron dispersed about the group bearing along with them the proclamations of the new king  tamasese was now a great man to have five iron warships for his postrunners  but the moment was critical  the revolution had to be explained the chiefs persuaded to assemble at a fono summoned for the 15th and the ships carried not only a store of printed documents but a squad of tamasese orators upon their round  such was the german coup detat  they had declared war with a squadron of five ships upon a single man that man late king of the group was in hiding on the mountains and their own nominee backed by german guns and bayonets sat in his stead in mulinuu  one of the first acts of malietoa on fleeing to the bush was to send for mataafa twice i am alone in the bush if you do not come quickly you will find me bound  it is to be understood the men were near kinsmen and had if they had nothing else a common jealousy  at the urgent cry mataafa set forth from falefa and came to mulinuu to tamasese  what is this that you and the german commodore have decided on doing he inquired  i am going to obey the german consul replied tamasese whose wish it is that i should be the king and that all samoa should assemble here  do not pursue in wrath against malietoa said mataafa but try to bring about a compromise and form a united government  very well said tamasese leave it to me and i will try  from mulinuu mataafa went on board the bismarck and was graciously received  probably said the commodore we shall bring about a reconciliation of all samoa through you and then asked his visitor if he bore any affection to malietoa  yes said mataafa  and to tamasese  to him also and if you desire the weal of samoa you will allow either him or me to bring about a reconciliation  if it were my will said the commodore i would do as you say  but i have no will in the matter  i have instructions from the kaiser and i cannot go back again from what i have been sent to do  i thought you would be commanded said mataafa if you brought about the weal of samoa  i will tell you said the commodore  all shall go quietly  but there is one thing that must be done malietoa must be deposed  i will do nothing to him beyond he will only be kept on board for a couple of months and be well treated just as we germans did to the french chief napoleon iii some time ago whom we kept a while and cared for well  becker was no less explicit war he told sewall should not cease till the germans had custody of malietoa and tamasese should be recognised  meantime in the malietoa provinces a profound impression was received people trooped to their fugitive sovereign in the bush  many natives in apia brought their treasures and stored them in the houses of white friends  the tamasese orators were sometimes ill received  over in savaii they found the village of satupaitea deserted save for a few lads at cricket  these they harangued and were rewarded with ironical applause and the proclamation as soon as they had departed was torn down  for this offence the village was ultimately burned by german sailors in a very decent and orderly style on the 3rd september  this was the dinnerbell of the fono on the 15th  the threat conveyed in the terms of the summonsif any government district does not quickly obey this direction i will make war on that government districtwas thus commented on and reinforced  and the meeting was in consequence well attended by chiefs of all parties  they found themselves unarmed among the armed warriors of tamasese and the marines of the german squadron and under the guns of five strong ships  brandeis rose it was his first open appearance the german firm signing its revolutionary work  his words were few and uncompromising great are my thanks that the chiefs and heads of families of the whole of samoa are assembled here this day it is strictly forbidden that any discussion should take place as to whether it is good or not that tamasese is king of samoa whether at this fono or at any future fono  i place for your signature the following we inform all the people of samoa of what follows 1 the government of samoa has been assumed by king tuiaana tamasese  2 by order of the king it was directed that a fono should take place today composed of the chiefs and heads of families and we have obeyed the summons  we have signed our names under this 15th september 1887  needs must under all these guns and the paper was signed but not without open sullenness  the bearing of mataafa in particular was long remembered against him by the germans  do you not see the king said the commodore reprovingly  his father was no king was the bold answer  a bolder still has been printed but this is mataafas own recollection of the passage  on the next day the chiefs were all ordered back to shake hands with tamasese  again they obeyed but again their attitude was menacing and some it is said audibly murmured as they gave their hands  it is time to follow the poor sheet of paper literal meaning of laupepa who was now to be blown so broadly over the face of earth  as soon as news reached him of the declaration of war he fled from afenga to tanungamanono a hamlet in the bush about a mile and a half behind apia where he lurked some days  on the 24th selu his secretary despatched to the american consul an anxious appeal his majestys cry and prayer in behalf of this weak people  by august 30th the germans had word of his lurkingplace surrounded the hamlet under cloud of night and in the early morning burst with a force of sailors on the houses  the people fled on all sides and were fired upon  one boy was shot in the hand the first blood of the war  but the king was nowhere to be found he had wandered farther over the woody mountains the backbone of the land towards siumu and safata  here in a safe place he built himself a town in the forest where he received a continual stream of visitors and messengers  day after day the german bluejackets were employed in the hopeless enterprise of beating the forests for the fugitive day after day they were suffered to pass unhurt under the guns of ambushed samoans day after day they returned exhausted and disappointed to apia  seumanu tafa high chief of apia was known to be in the forest with the king his wife fatuila was seized imprisoned in the german hospital and when it was thought her spirit was sufficiently reduced brought up for crossexamination  the wise lady confined herself in answer to a single word  is your husband near apia  yes is he far from apia  yes is he with the king  yes  are he and the king in different places  yes  whereupon the witness was discharged  about the 10th of september laupepa was secretly in apia at the american consulate with two companions  the german pickets were close set and visited by a strong patrol and on his return his party was observed and hailed and fired on by a sentry  they ran away on all fours in the dark and so doing plumped upon another sentry whom laupepa grappled and flung in a ditch for the sheet of paper although infirm of character is like most samoans of an able body  the second sentry like the first fired after his assailants at random in the dark and the two shots awoke the curiosity of apia  on the afternoon of the 16th the day of the handshakings suatele a high chief despatched two boys across the island with a letter  they were most of the night upon the road it was near three in the morning before the sentries in the camp of malietoa beheld their lantern drawing near out of the wood but the king was at once awakened  the news was decisive and the letter peremptory if malietoa did not give himself up before ten on the morrow he was told that great sorrows must befall his country  i have not been able to draw laupepa as a hero but he is a man of certain virtues which the germans had now given him an occasion to display  without hesitation he sacrificed himself penned his touching farewell to samoa and making more expedition than the messengers passed early behind apia to the banks of the vaisingano  as he passed he detached a messenger to mataafa at the catholic mission  mataafa followed by the same road and the pair met at the riverside and went and sat together in a house  all present were in tears  do not let us weep said the talking man lauati  we have no cause for shame  we do not yield to tamasese but to the invincible strangers  the departing king bequeathed the care of his country to mataafa and when the latter sought to console him with the commodores promises he shook his head and declared his assurance that he was going to a life of exile and perhaps to death  about two oclock the meeting broke up mataafa returned to the catholic mission by the back of the town and malietoa proceeded by the beach road to the german naval hospital where he was received as he owns with perfect civility by brandeis  about three becker brought him forth again  as they went to the wharf the people wept and clung to their departing monarch  a boat carried him on board the bismarck and he vanished from his countrymen  yet it was long rumoured that he still lay in the harbour and so late as october 7th a boy who had been paddling round the carola professed to have seen and spoken with him  here again the needless mystery affected by the germans bitterly disserved them  the uncertainty which thus hung over laupepas fate kept his name continually in mens mouths  the words of his farewell rang in their ears to all samoa on account of my great love to my country and my great affection to all samoa this is the reason that i deliver up my body to the german government  that government may do as they wish to me  the reason of this is because i do not desire that the blood of samoa shall be spilt for me again  but i do not know what is my offence which has caused their anger to me and to my country  and then apostrophising the different provinces tuamasanga farewell  manono and family farewell  so also salafai tutuila aana and atua farewell  if we do not again see one another in this world pray that we may be again together above  so the sheep departed with the halo of a saint and men thought of him as of some king arthur snatched into avilion  on board the bismarck the commodore shook hands with him told him he was to be taken away from all the chiefs with whom he had been accustomed and had him taken to the wardroom under guard  the next day he was sent to sea in the adler  there went with him his brother moli one meisake and one alualu halfcaste german to interpret  he was respectfully used he dined in the stern with the officers but the boys dined near where the fire was  they come to a newlyformed place in australia where the albatross was lying and a british ship which he knew to be a manofwar because the officers were nicely dressed and wore epaulettes  here he was transhipped in a boat with a screen which he supposed was to conceal him from the british ship and on board the albatross was sent below and told he must stay there till they had sailed  later however he was allowed to come on deck where he found they had rigged a screen perhaps an awning under which he walked looking at the newlyformed settlement and admiring a big house where he was sure the governor lived  from australia they sailed some time and reached an anchorage where a consulgeneral came on board and where laupepa was only allowed on deck at night  he could then see the lights of a town with wharves he supposes cape town  off the cameroons they anchored or layto far at sea and sent a boat ashore to see he supposes that there was no british manofwar  it was the next morning before the boat returned when the albatross stood in and came to anchor near another german ship  here alualu came to him on deck and told him this was the place  that is an astonishing thing said he  i thought i was to go to germany i do not know what this means i do not know what will be the end of it my heart is troubled  whereupon alualu burst into tears  a little after laupepa was called below to the captain and the governor  the last addressed him this is my own place a good place a warm place  my house is not yet finished but when it is you shall live in one of my rooms until i can make a house for you then he was taken ashore and brought to a tall iron house  this house is regulated said the governor there is no fire allowed to burn in it  in one part of this house weapons of the government were hung up there was a passage and on the other side of the passage fifty criminals were chained together two and two by the ankles  the windows were out of reach and there was only one door which was opened at six in the morning and shut again at six at night  all day he had his liberty went to the baptist mission and walked about viewing the negroes who were like the sand on the seashore for number  at six they were called into the house and shut in for the night without beds or lights  although they gave me no light said he with a smile i could see i was in a prison  good food was given him biscuits tea made with warm water beef etc all excellent  once in their walks they spied a breadfruit tree bearing in the garden of an english merchant ran back to the prison to get a shilling and came and offered to purchase  i am not going to sell breadfruit to you people said the merchant come and take what you like  here malietoa interrupted himself to say it was the only tree bearing in the cameroons  the governor had none or he would have given it to me  on the passage from the cameroons to germany he had great delight to see the cliffs of england  he saw the rocks shining in the sun and three hours later was surprised to find them sunk in the heavens  he saw also wharves and immense buildings perhaps dover and its castle  in hamburg after breakfast mr weber who had now finally ceased from troubling samoa came on board and carried him ashore suitably in a steam launch to a large house of the government where he stayed till noon  at noon weber told him he was going to the place where ships are anchored that go to samoa and led him to a very magnificent house with carriages inside and a wonderful roof of glass to wit the railway station  they were benighted on the train and then went in something with a house drawn by horses which had windows and many decks plainly an omnibus  here at bremen or bremerhaven i believe they stayed some while in a house of five hundred rooms then were got on board the nurnberg as they understood for samoa anchored in england on a sunday were joined en route by the famous dr knappe passed through a narrow passage where they went very slow and which was just like a river and beheld with exhilarated curiosity that red sea of which they had learned so much in their bibles  at last at the hour when the fires burn red they came to a place where was a german manofwar  laupepa was called with one of the boys on deck when he found a german officer awaiting him and a steam launch alongside and was told he must now leave his brother and go elsewhere  i cannot go like this he cried  you must let me see my brother and the other old mena term of courtesy  knappe who seems always to have been goodnatured revised his orders and consented not only to an interview but to allow moli to continue to accompany the king  so these two were carried to the manofwar and sailed many a day still supposing themselves bound for samoa and lo she came to a country the like of which they had never dreamed of and cast anchor in the great lagoon of jaluit and upon that narrow land the exiles were set on shore  this was the part of his captivity on which he looked back with the most bitterness  it was the last for one thing and he was worn down with the long suspense and terror and deception  he could not bear the brackish water and though the germans were still good to him and gave him beef and biscuit and tea he suffered from the lack of vegetable food  such is the narrative of this simple exile  i have not sought to correct it by extraneous testimony  it is not so much the facts that are historical as the mans attitude  no one could hear this tale as he originally told it in my hearingi think none can read it as here condensed and unadornedwithout admiring the fairness and simplicity of the samoan and wondering at the want of heartor want of humourin so many successive civilised germans that they should have continued to surround this infant with the secrecy of state     chapter ivbrandeis   september 87 to august 88  so tamasese was on the throne and brandeis behind it and i have now to deal with their brief and luckless reign  that it was the reign of brandeis needs not to be argued the policy is throughout that of an able overhasty white with eyes and ideas  but it should be borne in mind that he had a double task and must first lead his sovereign before he could begin to drive their common subjects  meanwhile he himself was exposed if all tales be true to much dictation and interference and to some cumbrous aid from the consulate and the firm  and to one of these aids the suppression of the municipality i am inclined to attribute his ultimate failure  the white enemies of the new regimen were of two classes  in the first stood moors and the employes of macarthur the two chief rivals of the firm who saw with jealousy a clerk or a socalled clerk of their competitors advanced to the chief power  the second class that of the officials numbered at first exactly one  wilson the english acting consul is understood to have held strict orders to help germany commander leary of the adams the american captain when he arrived on the 16th october and for some time after seemed devoted to the german interest and spent his days with a german officer captain von widersheim who was deservedly beloved by all who knew him  there remains the american consulgeneral harold marsh sewall a young man of high spirit and a generous disposition  he had obeyed the orders of his government with a grudge and looked back on his past action with regret almost to be called repentance  from the moment of the declaration of war against laupepa we find him standing forth in bold consistent and sometimes rather captious opposition stirring up his government at home with clear and forcible despatches and on the spot grasping at every opportunity to thrust a stick into the german wheels  for some while he and moors fought their difficult battle in conjunction in the course of which first one and then the other paid a visit home to reason with the authorities at washington and during the consuls absence there was found an american clerk in apia william blacklock to perform the duties of the office with remarkable ability and courage  the three names just brought together sewall moors and blacklock make the head and front of the opposition if tamasese fell if brandeis was driven forth if the treaty of berlin was signed theirs is the blame or the credit  to understand the feelings of selfreproach and bitterness with which sewall took the field the reader must see laupepas letter of farewell to the consuls of england and america  it is singular that this far from brilliant or dignified monarch writing in the forest in heaviness of spirit and under pressure for time should have left behind him not only one but two remarkable and most effective documents  the farewell to his people was touching the farewell to the consuls for a man of the character of sewall must have cut like a whip  when the chief tamasese and others first moved the present troubles he wrote it was my wish to punish them and put an end to the rebellion but i yielded to the advice of the british and american consuls  assistance and protection was repeatedly promised to me and my government if i abstained from bringing war upon my country  relying upon these promises i did not put down the rebellion  now i find that war has been made upon me by the emperor of germany and tamasese has been proclaimed king of samoa  i desire to remind you of the promises so frequently made by your government and trust that you will so far redeem them as to cause the lives and liberties of my chiefs and people to be respected  sewalls immediate adversary was of course becker  i have formed an opinion of this gentleman largely from his printed despatches which i am at a loss to put in words  astute ingenious capable at moments almost witty with a kind of glacial wit in action he displayed in the course of this affair every description of capacity but that which is alone useful and which springs from a knowledge of mens natures  it chanced that one of sewalls early moves played into his hands and he was swift to seize and to improve the advantage  the neutral territory and the tripartite municipality of apia were eyesores to the german consulate and brandeis  by landing tamaseses two or three hundred warriors at mulinuu as becker himself owns they had infringed the treaties and sewall entered protest twice  there were two ways of escaping this dilemma one was to withdraw the warriors the other by some hocuspocus to abrogate the neutrality  and the second had subsidiary advantages it would restore the taxes of the richest district in the islands to the samoan king and it would enable them to substitute over the royal seat the flag of germany for the new flag of tamasese  it is true and it was the subject of much remark that these two could hardly be distinguished by the naked eye but their effects were different  to seat the puppet king on german land and under german colours so that any rebellion was constructive war on germany was a trick apparently invented by becker and which we shall find was repeated and persevered in till the end  otto martin was at this time magistrate in the municipality  the post was held in turn by the three nationalities martin had served far beyond his term and should have been succeeded months before by an american  to make the change it was necessary to hold a meeting of the municipal board consisting of the three consuls each backed by an assessor  and for some time these meetings had been evaded or refused by the german consul  as long as it was agreed to continue martin becker had attended regularly as soon as sewall indicated a wish for his removal becker tacitly suspended the municipality by refusing to appear  this policy was now the more necessary for if the whole existence of the municipality were a check on the freedom of the new government it was plainly less so when the power to enforce and punish lay in german hands for some while back the malietoa flag had been flown on the municipal building becker denies this i am sorry my information obliges me to suppose he is in error  sewall with postmortem loyalty to the past insisted that this flag should be continued  and becker immediately made his point  he declared justly enough that the proposal was hostile and argued that it was impossible he should attend a meeting under a flag with which his sovereign was at war  upon one occasion of urgency he was invited to meet the two other consuls at the british consulate even this he refused and for four months the municipality slumbered martin still in office  in the month of october in consequence the british and american ratepayers announced they would refuse to pay  becker doubtless rubbed his hands  on saturday the 10th the chief tamaseu a malietoa man of substance and good character was arrested on a charge of theft believed to be vexatious and cast by martin into the municipal prison  he sent to moors who was his tenant and owed him money at the time for bail  moors applied to sewall ranking consul  after some search martin was found and refused to consider bail before the monday morning  whereupon sewall demanded the keys from the gaoler accepted moorss verbal recognisances and set tamaseu free  things were now at a deadlock and becker astonished every one by agreeing to a meeting on the 14th  it seems he knew what to expect writing on the 13th at least he prophesies that the meeting will be held in vain that the municipality must lapse and the government of tamasese step in  on the 14th sewall left his consulate in time and walked some part of the way to the place of meeting in company with wilson the english proconsul  but he had forgotten a paper and in an evil hour returned for it alone  wilson arrived without him and becker broke up the meeting for want of a quorum  there was some unedifying disputation as to whether he had waited ten or twenty minutes whether he had been officially or unofficially informed by wilson that sewall was on the way whether the statement had been made to himself or to weber 1 in answer to a question and whether he had heard wilsons answer or only webers question all otiose if he heard the question he was bound to have waited for the answer if he heard it not he should have put it himself and it was the manifest truth that he rejoiced in his occasion  sir he wrote to sewall i have the honour to inform you that to my regret i am obliged to consider the municipal government to be provisionally in abeyance since you have withdrawn your consent to the continuation of mr martin in his position as magistrate and since you have refused to take part in the meeting of the municipal board agreed to for the purpose of electing a magistrate  the government of the town and district of the municipality rests as long as the municipality is in abeyance with the samoan government  the samoan government has taken over the administration and has applied to the commander of the imperial german squadron for assistance in the preservation of good order  this letter was not delivered until 4 pm  by three sailors had been landed already german colours flew over tamaseses headquarters at mulinuu and german guards had occupied the hospital the german consulate and the municipal gaol and courthouse where they stood to arms under the flag of tamasese  the same day sewall wrote to protest  receiving no reply he issued on the morrow a proclamation bidding all americans look to himself alone  on the 26th he wrote again to becker and on the 27th received this genial reply sir your high favour of the 26th of this month i give myself the honour of acknowledging  at the same time i acknowledge the receipt of your high favour of the 14th october in reply to my communication of the same date which contained the information of the suspension of the arrangements for the municipal government  there the correspondence ceased  and on the 18th january came the last step of this irritating intrigue when tamasese appointed a judgeand the judge proved to be martin  thus was the adventure of the castle municipal achieved by sir becker the chivalrous  the taxes of apia the gaol the police all passed into the hands of tamasesebrandeis a german was secured upon the bench and the german flag might wave over her puppet unquestioned  but there is a law of human nature which diplomatists should be taught at school and it seems they are not that men can tolerate bare injustice but not the combination of injustice and subterfuge  hence the chequered career of the thimblerigger  had the municipality been seized by open force there might have been complaint it would not have aroused the same lasting grudge  this grudge was an ill gift to bring to brandeis who had trouble enough in front of him without  he was an alien he was supported by the guns of alien warships and he had come to do an aliens work highly needful for samoa but essentially unpopular with all samoans  the law to be enforced causes of dispute between white and brown to be eliminated taxes to be raised a central power created the country opened up the native race taught industry all these were detestable to the natives and to all of these he must set his hand  the more i learn of his brief term of rule the more i learn to admire him and to wish we had his like  in the face of bitter native opposition he got some roads accomplished he set up beacons  the taxes he enforced with necessary vigour  by the 6th of january aua and fangatonga districts in tutuila having made a difficulty brandeis is down at the island in a schooner with the adler at his heels seizes the chief maunga fines the recalcitrant districts in three hundred dollars for expenses and orders all to be in by april 20th which if it is not not one thing will be done he proclaimed but war declared against you and the principal chiefs taken to a distant island  he forbade mortgages of copra a frequent source of trickery and quarrel and to clear off those already contracted passed a severe but salutary law  each individual or family was first to pay off its own obligation that settled the free man was to pay for the indebted village the free village for the indebted province and one island for another  samoa he declared should be free of debt within a year  had he given it three years and gone more gently i believe it might have been accomplished  to make it the more possible he sought to interdict the natives from buying cotton stuffs and to oblige them to dress at least for the time in their own tapa  he laid the beginnings of a royal territorial army  the first draft was in his hands drilling but it was not so much on drill that he depended it was his hope to kindle in these men an esprit de corps which should weaken the old local jealousies and bonds and found a central or national party in the islands  looking far before and with a wisdom beyond that of many merchants he had condemned the single dependence placed on copra for the national livelihood  his recruits even as they drilled were taught to plant cacao  each his term of active service finished should return to his own land and plant and cultivate a stipulated area  thus as the young men continued to pass through the army habits of discipline and industry a central sentiment the principles of the new culture and actual gardens of cacao should be concurrently spread over the face of the islands  tamasese received including his household expenses 1960 dollars a year brandeis 2400  all such disproportions are regrettable but this is not extreme we have seen horses of a different colour since then  and the tamaseseites with true samoan ostentation offered to increase the salary of their white premier an offer he had the wisdom and good feeling to refuse  a european chief of police received twelve hundred there were eight head judges one to each province and appeal lay from the district judge to the provincial thence to mulinuu  from all salaries i gather a small monthly guarantee was withheld  the army was to cost from three to four thousand apia many whites refusing to pay taxes since the suppression of the municipality might cost three thousand more sir beckers high feat of arms coming expensive it will be noticed even in money  the whole outlay was estimated at twentyseven thousand and the revenue forty thousand a sum samoa is well able to pay  such were the arrangements and some of the ideas of this strong ardent and sanguine man  of criticisms upon his conduct beyond the general consent that he was rather harsh and in too great a hurry few are articulate  the native paper of complaints was particularly childish out of twentythree counts the first two refer to the private character of brandeis and tamasese  three complain that samoan officials were kept in the dark as to the finances one of the tapa law one of the direct appointment of chiefs by tamasesebrandeis the sort of mistake into which europeans in the south seas fall so readily one of the enforced labour of chiefs one of the taxes and one of the roads  this i may give in full from the very lame translation in the american white book the roads that were made were called the government roads they were six fathoms wide  their making caused much damage to samoas lands and what was planted on it  the samoans cried on account of their lands which were taken highhandedly and abused  they again cried on account of the loss of what they had planted which was now thrown away in a highhanded way without any regard being shown or question asked of the owner of the land or any compensation offered for the damage done  this was different with foreigners land in their case permission was first asked to make the roads the foreigners were paid for any destruction made the sting of this count was i fancy in the last clause  no less than six articles complain of the administration of the law and i believe that was never satisfactory  brandeis told me himself he was never yet satisfied with any native judge  and men say and it seems to fit in well with his hasty and eager character that he would legislate by word of mouth sometimes forget what he had said and on the same question arising in another province decide it perhaps otherwise  i gather on the whole our artillery captain was not great in law  two articles refer to a matter i must deal with more at length and rather from the point of view of the white residents  the common charge against brandeis was that of favouring the german firm coming as he did this was inevitable  weber had bought steinberger with hard cash that was matter of history  the present government he did not even require to buy having founded it by his intrigues and introduced the premier to samoa through the doors of his own office  and the effect of the initial blunder was kept alive by the chatter of the clerks in bar rooms boasting themselves of the new government and prophesying annihilation to all rivals  the time of raising a tax is the harvest of the merchants it is the time when copra will be made and must be sold and the intention of the german firm first in the time of steinberger and again in april and may 1888 with brandeis was to seize and handle the whole operation  their chief rivals were the messrs macarthur and it seems beyond question that provincial governors more than once issued orders forbidding samoans to take money from the new zealand firm these when they were brought to his notice brandeis disowned and he is entitled to be heard  no man can live long in samoa and not have his honesty impugned  but the accusations against brandeiss veracity are both few and obscure  i believe he was as straight as his sword  the governors doubtless issued these orders but there were plenty besides brandeis to suggest them  every wandering clerk from the firms office every plantation manager would be dinning the same story in the native ear  and here again the initial blunder hung about the neck of brandeis a tons weight  the natives as well as the whites had seen their premier masquerading on a stool in the office in the eyes of the natives as well as in those of the whites he must always have retained the mark of servitude from that illjudged passage and they would be inclined to look behind and above him to the great house of misi ueba the government was like a vista of puppets  people did not trouble with tamasese if they got speech with brandeis in the same way they might not always trouble to ask brandeis if they had a hint direct from misi ueba  in only one case though it seems to have had many developments do i find the premier personally committed  the macarthurs claimed the copra of fasitotai on a district mortgage of three hundred dollars  the german firm accepted a mortgage of the whole province of aana claimed the copra of fasitotai as that of a part of aana and were supported by the government  here brandeis was false to his own principle that personal and village debts should come before provincial  but the case occurred before the promulgation of the law and was as a matter of fact the cause of it so the most we can say is that he changed his mind and changed it for the better  if the history of his government be consideredhow it originated in an intrigue between the firm and the consulate and was for the firms sake alone supported by the consulate with foreign bayonetsthe existence of the least doubt on the mans action must seem marvellous  we should have looked to find him playing openly and wholly into their hands that he did not implies great independence and much secret friction and i believe if the truth were known the firm would be found to have been disgusted with the stubbornness of its intended tool and brandeis often impatient of the demands of his creators  but i may seem to exaggerate the degree of white opposition  and it is true that before fate overtook the brandeis government it appeared to enjoy the fruits of victory in apia and one dissident the unconquerable moors stood out alone to refuse his taxes  but the victory was in appearance only the opposition was latent it found vent in talk and thus reacted on the natives upon the least excuse it was ready to flame forth again  and this is the more singular because some were far from out of sympathy with the native policy pursued  when i met captain brandeis he was amazed at my attitude  whom did you find in apia to tell you so much good of me he asked  i named one of my informants he he cried  if he thought all that why did he not help me  i told him as well as i was able  the man was a merchant  he beheld in the government of brandeis a government created by and for the firm who were his rivals  if brandeis were minded to deal fairly where was the probability that he would be allowed  if brandeis insisted and were strong enough to prevail what guarantee that as soon as the government were fairly accepted brandeis might not be removed  here was the attitude of the hour and i am glad to find it clearly set forth in a despatch of sewalls june 18th 1888 when he commends the law against mortgages and goes on whether the author of this law will carry out the good intentions which he professeswhether he will be allowed to do so if he desires against the opposition of those who placed him in power and protect him in the possession of itmay well be doubted brandeis had come to apia in the firms livery  even while he promised neutrality in commerce the clerks were prating a different story in the barrooms and the late high feat of the knighterrant becker had killed all confidence in germans at the root  by these three impolicies the german adventure in samoa was defeated  i imply that the handful of whites were the true obstacle not the thousands of malcontent samoans for had the whites frankly accepted brandeis the path of germany was clear and the end of their policy however troublesome might be its course was obvious  but this is not to say that the natives were content  in a sense indeed their opposition was continuous  there will always be opposition in samoa when taxes are imposed and the deportation of malietoa stuck in mens throats  tuiatua mataafa refused to act under the new government from the beginning and tamasese usurped his place and title  as early as february i find him signing himself tuiaana tuiatua tamasese the first step on a dangerous path  asi like mataafa disclaimed his chiefship and declared himself a private person but he was more rudely dealt with  german sailors surrounded his house in the night burst in and dragged the women out of the mosquito netsan offence against samoan manners  no asi was to be found but at last they were shown his fishinglights on the reef rowed out took him as he was and carried him on board a man ofwar where he was detained some while betweendecks  at last january 16th after a farewell interview over the ships side with his wife he was discharged into a ketch and along with two other chiefs maunga and tuiletufunga deported to the marshalls  the blow struck fear upon all sides  le mamea a very able chief was secretly among the malcontents his family and followers murmured at his weakness but he continued throughout the duration of the government to serve brandeis with trembling  a circus coming to apia he seized at the pretext for escape and asked leave to accept an engagement in the company  i will not allow you to make a monkey of yourself said brandeis and the phrase had a success throughout the islands pungent expressions being so much admired by the natives that they cannot refrain from repeating them even when they have been levelled at themselves  the assumption of the atua name spread discontent in that province many chiefs from thence were convicted of disaffection and condemned to labour with their hands upon the roadsa great shock to the samoan sense of the becoming which was rendered the more sensible by the death of one of the number at his task mataafa was involved in the same trouble  his disaffected speech at a meeting of atua chiefs was betrayed by the girls that made the kava and the man of the future was called to apia on safeconduct but after an interview suffered to return to his lair  the peculiarly tender treatment of mataafa must be explained by his relationship to tamasese laupepa was of malietoa blood  the hereditary retainers of the tupua would see him exiled even with some complacency  but mataafa was tupua himself and tupua men would probably have murmured and would perhaps have mutinied had he been harshly dealt with  the native opposition i say was in a sense continuous  and it kept continuously growing  the sphere of brandeis was limited to mulinuu and the north central quarters of upolupractically what is shown upon the map opposite  there the taxes were expanded in the outdistricts men paid their money and saw no return  here the eye and hand of the dictator were ready to correct the scales of justice in the outdistricts all things lay at the mercy of the native magistrates and their oppressions increased with the course of time and the experience of impunity  in the spring of the year a very intelligent observer had occasion to visit many places in the island of savaii  our lives are not worth living was the burthen of the popular complaint  we are groaning under the oppression of these men  we would rather die than continue to endure it  on his return to apia he made haste to communicate his impressions to brandeis  brandeis replied in an epigram where there has been anarchy in a country there must be oppression for a time  but unfortunately the terms of the epigram may be reversed and personal supervision would have been more in season than wit  the same observer who conveyed to him this warning thinks that if brandeis had himself visited the districts and inquired into complaints the blow might yet have been averted and the government saved  at last upon a certain unconstitutional act of tamasese the discontent took life and fire  the act was of his own conception the dull dog was ambitious brandeis declares he would not be dissuaded perhaps his adviser did not seriously try perhaps did not dream that in that welter of contradictions the samoan constitution any one point would be considered sacred  i have told how tamasese assumed the title of tuiatua  in august 1888 a year after his installation he took a more formidable step and assumed that of malietoa  this name as i have said is of peculiar honour it had been given to it had never been taken from the exiled laupepa those in whose grant it lay stood punctilious upon their rights and tamasese as the representative of their natural opponents the tupua line was the last who should have had it  and there was yet more though i almost despair to make it thinkable by europeans  certain old mats are handed down and set huge store by they may be compared to coats of arms or heirlooms among ourselves and to the horror of more than onehalf of samoa tamasese the head of the tupua began collecting malietoa mats  it was felt that the cup was full and men began to prepare secretly for rebellion  the history of the month of august is unknown to whites it passed altogether in the covert of the woods or in the stealthy councils of samoans  one ominous sign was to be noted arms and ammunition began to be purchased or inquired about and the more wary traders ordered fresh consignments of material of war  but the rest was silence the government slept in security and brandeis was summoned at last from a public dinner to find rebellion organised the woods behind apia full of insurgents and a plan prepared and in the very article of execution to surprise and seize mulinuu  the timely discovery averted all and the leaders hastily withdrew towards the south side of the island leaving in the bush a rearguard under a young man of the name of saifaleupolu  according to some accounts it scarce numbered forty the leader was no great chief but a handsome industrious lad who seems to have been much beloved  and upon this obstacle brandeis fell it is the mans fault to be too impatient of results his public intention to free samoa of all debt within the year depicts him and instead of continuing to temporise and let his enemies weary and disperse he judged it politic to strike a blow  he struck it with what seemed to be success and the sound of it roused samoa to rebellion  about two in the morning of august 31st apia was wakened by men marching  day came and brandeis and his warparty were already long disappeared in the woods  all morning belated tamaseseites were still to be seen running with their guns  all morning shots were listened for in vain but over the top of the forest far up the mountain smoke was for some time observed to hang  about ten a dead man was carried in lashed under a pole like a dead pig his rosary for he was a catholic hanging nearly to the ground  next came a young fellow wounded sitting in a rope swung from a pole two fellows bearing him two running behind for a relief  at last about eleven three or four heavy volleys and a great shouting were heard from the bush town tanungamanono the affair was over the victorious force on the march back was there celebrating its victory by the way  presently after it marched through apia five or six hundred strong in tolerable order and strutting with the ludicrous assumption of the triumphant islander  women who had been buying bread ran and gave them loaves  at the tail end came brandeis himself smoking a cigar deadly pale and with perhaps an increase of his usual nervous manner  one spoke to him by the way  he expressed his sorrow the action had been forced on him  poor people its all the worse for them he said  itll have to be done another way now  and it was supposed by his hearer that he referred to intervention from the german warships  he meant he said to put a stop to headhunting his men had taken two that day he added but he had not suffered them to bring them in and they had been left in tanungamanono  thither my informant rode was attracted by the sound of wailing and saw in a house the two heads washed and combed and the sister of one of the dead lamenting in the island fashion and kissing the cold face  soon after a small grave was dug the heads were buried in a beef box and the pastor read the service  the body of saifaleupolu himself was recovered unmutilated brought down from the forest and buried behind apia  the same afternoon the men of vaimaunga were ordered to report in mulinuu where tamaseses flag was halfmasted for the death of a chief in the skirmish  vaimaunga is that district of taumasanga which includes the bay and the foothills behind apia and both province and district are strong malietoa  not one man it is said obeyed the summons  night came and the town lay in unusual silence no one abroad the blinds down around the native houses the men within sleeping on their arms the old women keeping watch in pairs  and in the course of the two following days all vaimaunga was gone into the bush the very gaoler setting free his prisoners and joining them in their escape  hear the words of the chiefs in the 23rd article of their complaint some of the chiefs fled to the bush from fear of being reported fear of german menofwar constantly being accused etc and brandeis commanded that they were to be shot on sight  this act was carried out by brandeis on the 31st day of august 1888  after this we evaded these laws we could not stand them our patience was worn out with the constant wickedness of tamasese and brandeis  we were tired out and could stand no longer the acts of these two men  so through an illtimed skirmish two severed heads and a dead body the rule of brandeis came to a sudden end  we shall see him a while longer fighting for existence in a losing battle but his governmenttake it for all in all the most promising that has ever been in these unlucky islandswas from that hour a piece of history     chapter vthe battle of matautu   september 1888  the revolution had all the character of a popular movement  many of the high chiefs were detained in mulinuu the commons trooped to the bush under inferior leaders  a camp was chosen near faleula threatening mulinuu well placed for the arrival of recruits and close to a german plantation from which the force could be subsisted  manono came all tuamasanga much of savaii and part of aana tamaseses own government and titular seat  both sides were arming  it was a brave day for the trader though not so brave as some that followed when a single cartridge is said to have been sold for twelve cents currencybetween nine and ten cents gold  yet even among the traders a strong party feeling reigned and it was the common practice to ask a purchaser upon which side he meant to fight  on september 5th brandeis published a letter to the chiefs of tuamasanga manono and faasaleleanga in the bush chiefs by authority of his majesty tamasese the king of samoa i make known to you all that the german manofwar is about to go together with a samoan fleet for the purpose of burning manono  after this island is all burnt tis good if the people return to manono and live quiet  to the people of faasaleleanga i say return to your houses and stop there  the same to those belonging to tuamasanga  if you obey this instruction then you will all be forgiven if you do not obey then all your villages will be burnt like manono  these instructions are made in truth in the sight of god in the heaven  the same morning accordingly the adler steamed out of the bay with a force of tamasese warriors and some native boats in tow the samoan fleet in question  manono was shelled the tamasese warriors under the conduct of a manono traitor who paid before many days the forfeit of his blood landed and did some damage but were driven away by the sight of a force returning from the mainland no one was hurt for the women and children who alone remained on the island found a refuge in the bush and the adler and her acolytes returned the same evening  the letter had been energetic the performance fell below the programme  the demonstration annoyed and yet reassured the insurgents and it fully disclosed to the germans a new enemy  captain yon widersheim had been relieved  his successor captain fritze was an officer of a different stamp  i have nothing to say of him but good he seems to have obeyed the consuls requisitions with secret distaste his despatches were of admirable candour but his habits were retired he spoke little english and was far indeed from inheriting von widersheims close relations with commander leary  it is believed by germans that the american officer resented what he took to be neglect  i mention this not because i believe it to depict commander leary but because it is typical of a prevailing infirmity among germans in samoa touchy themselves they read all history in the light of personal affronts and tiffs and i find this weakness indicated by the big thumb of bismarck when he places sensitiveness to small disrespectsempfindlichkeit ueber mangel an respect among the causes of the wild career of knappe  whatever the cause at least the natives had no sooner taken arms than leary appeared with violence upon that side  as early as the 3rd he had sent an obscure but menacing despatch to brandeis  on the 6th he fell on fritze in the matter of the manono bombardment  the revolutionists he wrote had an armed force in the field within a few miles of this harbour when the vessels under your command transported the tamasese troops to a neighbouring island with the avowed intention of making war on the isolated homes of the women and children of the enemy  being the only other representative of a naval power now present in this harbour for the sake of humanity i hereby respectfully and solemnly protest in the name of the united states of america and of the civilised world in general against the use of a national warvessel for such services as were yesterday rendered by the german corvette adler  fritzes reply to the effect that he is under the orders of the consul and has no right of choice reads even humble perhaps he was not himself vain of the exploit perhaps not prepared to see it thus described in words  from that moment leary was in the front of the row  his name is diagnostic but it was not required on every step of his subsequent action in samoa irishman is writ large over all his doings a malign spirit of humour presided  no malice was too small for him if it were only funny  when night signals were made from mulinuu he would sit on his own poop and confound them with gratuitous rockets  he was at the pains to write a letter and address it to the high chief tamasesea device as old at least as the wars of robert brucein order to bother the officials of the german postoffice in whose hands he persisted in leaving it although the address was death to them and the distribution of letters in samoa formed no part of their profession  his great masterwork of pleasantry the scanlon affair must be narrated in its place  and he was no less bold than comical  the adams was not supposed to be a match for the adler there was no glory to be gained in beating her and yet i have heard naval officers maintain she might have proved a dangerous antagonist in narrow waters and at short range  doubtless leary thought so  he was continually daring fritze to come on and already in a despatch of the 9th i find becker complaining of his language in the hearing of german officials and how he had declared that on the adler again interfering he would interfere himself if he went to the bottom for itund wenn sein schiff dabei zu grunde ginge  here is the style of opposition which has the merit of being frank not that of being agreeable  becker was annoying leary infuriating there is no doubt that the tempers in the german consulate were highly ulcerated and if war between the two countries did not follow we must set down the praise to the forbearance of the german navy  this is not the last time that i shall have to salute the merits of that service  the defeat and death of saifaleupolu and the burning of manono had thus passed off without the least advantage to tamasese  but he still held the significant position of mulinuu and brandeis was strenuous to make it good  the whole peninsula was surrounded with a breastwork across the isthmus it was six feet high and strengthened with a ditch and the beach was staked against landing  webers land claimthe same that now broods over the village in the form of a signboardthen appeared in a more military guise the german flag was hoisted and german sailors manned the breastwork at the isthmusto protect german property and its trifling parenthesis the king of samoa  much vigilance reigned and in the island fashion much wild firing  and in spite of all desertion was for a long time daily  the detained high chiefs would go to the beach on the pretext of a natural occasion plunge in the sea and swimming across a broad shallow bay of the lagoon join the rebels on the faleula side  whole bodies of warriors sometimes hundreds strong departed with their arms and ammunition  on the 7th of september for instance the day after learys letter too and mataia left with their contingents and the whole aana people returned home in a body to hold a parliament  ten days later it is true a part of them returned to their duty but another part branched off by the way and carried their services and tamaseses dearbought guns to faleula  on the 8th there was a defection of a different kind but yet sensible the high chief seumanu had been still detained in mulinuu under anxious observation  his people murmured at his absence threatened to take away his name and had already attempted a rescue  the adventure was now taken in hand by his wife faatulia a woman of much sense and spirit and a strong partisan and by her contrivance seumanu gave his guardians the slip and rejoined his clan at faleula  this process of winnowing was of course counterbalanced by another of recruitment  but the harshness of european and military rule had made brandeis detested and tamasese unpopular with many and the force on mulinuu is thought to have done little more than hold its own  mataafa sympathisers set it down at about two or three thousand  i have no estimate from the other side but becker admits they were not strong enough to keep the field in the open  the political significance of mulinuu was great but in a military sense the position had defects  if it was difficult to carry it was easy to blockade and to be hemmed in on that narrow finger of land were an inglorious posture for the monarch of samoa  the peninsula besides was scant of food and destitute of water  pressed by these considerations brandeis extended his lines till he had occupied the whole foreshore of apia bay and the opposite point matautu  his men were thus drawn out along some three nautical miles of irregular beach everywhere with their backs to the sea and without means of communication or mutual support except by water  the extension led to fresh sorrows  the tamasese men quartered themselves in the houses of the absent men of the vaimaunga disputes arose with english and americans  leary interposed in a loud voice of menace  it was said the firm profited by the confusion to buttress up imperfect land claims i am sure the other whites would not be far behind the firm  properties were fenced in fences and houses were torn down scuffles ensued  the german example at mulinuu was followed with laughable unanimity wherever an englishman or an american conceived himself to have a claim he set up the emblem of his country and the beach twinkled with the flags of nations  all this it will be observed was going forward in that neutral territory sanctified by treaty against the presence of armed samoans the insurgents themselves looked on in wonder on the 4th trembling to transgress against the great powers they had written for a delimitation of the eleele sa and becker in conversation with the british consul replied that he recognised none  so long as tamasese held the ground this was expedient  but suppose tamasese worsted it might prove awkward for the stores mills and offices of a great german firm thus bared of shelter by the act of their own consul  on the morning of the 9th september just ten days after the death of saifaleupolu mataafa under the name of malietoa tooa mataafa was crowned king at faleula  on the 11th he wrote to the british and american consuls gentlemen i write this letter to you two very humbly and entreatingly on account of this difficulty that has come before me i desire to know from you two gentlemen the truth where the boundaries of the neutral territory are  you will observe that i am now at vaimoso a step nearer the enemy and i have stopped here until i knew what you say regarding the neutral territory  i wish to know where i can go and where the forbidden ground is for i do not wish to go on any neutral territory or on any foreigners property  i do not want to offend any of the great powers  another thing i would like  would it be possible for you three consuls to make tamasese remove from german property for i am in awe of going on german land  he must have received a reply embodying beckers renunciation of the principle at once for he broke camp the same day and marched eastward through the bush behind apia  brandeis expecting attack sought to improve his indefensible position he reformed his centre by the simple expedient of suppressing it  apia was evacuated  the two flanks mulinuu and matautu were still held and fortified mulinuu as i have said to the isthmus matautu on a line from the bayside to the little river fuisa  the centre was represented by the trajectory of a boat across the bay from one flank to another and was held we may say by the german warship  mataafa decided i am assured to make a feint on matautu induce brandeis to deplete mulinuu in support and then fall upon and carry that  and there is no doubt in my mind that such a plan was bruited abroad for nothing but a belief in it could explain the behaviour of brandeis on the 12th  that it was seriously entertained by mataafa i stoutly disbelieve the german flag and sailors forbidding the enterprise in mulinuu  so that we may call this false intelligence the beginning and the end of mataafas strategy  the whites who sympathised with the revolt were uneasy and impatient they will still tell you though the dates are there to show them wrong that mataafa even after his coronation delayed extremely a proof of how long two days may seem to last when men anticipate events  on the evening of the 11th while the new king was already on the march one of these walked into matautu  the moon was bright  by the way he observed the native houses dark and silent the men had been about a fortnight in the bush but now the women and children were gone also at which he wondered  on the seabeach in the camp of the tamaseses the solitude was near as great he saw three or four men smoking before the british consulate perhaps a dozen in all the rest were behind in the bush upon their line of forts  about the midst he sat down and here a woman drew near to him  the moon shone in her face and he knew her for a householder near by and a partisan of mataafas  she looked about her as she came and asked him trembling what he did in the camp of tamasese  he was there after news he told her  she took him by the hand  you must not stay here you will get killed she said  the bush is full of our people the others are watching them fighting may begin at any moment and we are both here too long  so they set off together and she told him by the way that she had came to the hostile camp with a present of bananas so that the tamasese men might spare her house  by the vaisingano they met an old man a woman and a child and these also she warned and turned back  such is the strange part played by women among the scenes of samoan warfare such were the liberties then permitted to the whites that these two could pass the lines talk together in tamaseses camp on the eve of an engagement and pass forth again bearing intelligence like privileged spies  and before a few hours the white man was in direct communication with the opposing general  the next morning he was accosted about breakfasttime by two natives who stood leaning against the pickets of a publichouse where the siumu road strikes in at right angles to the main street of apia they told him battle was imminent and begged him to pass a little way inland and speak with mataafa  the road is at this point broad and fairly good running between thick groves of cocoapalm and breadfruit  a few hundred yards along this the white man passed a picket of four armed warriors with red handkerchiefs and their faces blackened in the form of a full beard the mataafa rallying signs for the day a little farther on some fifty farther still a hundred and at last a quarter of a mile of them sitting by the wayside armed and blacked  near by in the verandah of a house on a knoll he found mataafa seated in white clothes a winchester across his knees  his men he said were still arriving from behind and there was a turning movement in operation beyond the fuisa so that the tamaseses should be assailed at the same moment from the south and east  and this is another indication that the attack on matautu was the true attack had any design on mulinuu been in the wind not even a samoan general would have detached these troops upon the other side  while they still spoke five tamasese women were brought in with their hands bound they had been stealing our bananas  all morning the town was strangely deserted the very children gone  a sense of expectation reigned and sympathy for the attack was expressed publicly  some men with unblacked faces came to moorss store for biscuit  a native woman who was there marketing inquired after the news and hearing that the battle was now near at hand give them two more tins said she and dont put them down to my husbandhe would growl put them down to me  between twelve and one two white men walked toward matautu finding as they went no sign of war until they had passed the vaisingano and come to the corner of a bypath leading to the bush  here were four blackened warriors on guardthe extreme left wing of the mataafa force where it touched the waters of the bay  thence the line which the white men followed stretched inland among bush and marsh facing the forts of the tamaseses  the warriors lay as yet inactive behind trees but all the young boys and harlots of apia toiled in the front upon a trench digging with knives and cocoashells and a continuous stream of children brought them water  the young sappers worked crouching from the outside only an occasional head or a hand emptying a shell of earth was visible and their enemies looked on inert from the line of the opposing forts  the lists were not yet prepared the tournament was not yet open and the attacking force was suffered to throw up works under the silent guns of the defence  but there is an end even to the delay of islanders  as the white men stood and looked the tamasese line thundered into a volley it was answered the crowd of silent workers broke forth in laughter and cheers and the battle had begun  thenceforward all day and most of the next night volley followed volley and pounds of lead and pounds sterling of money continued to be blown into the air without cessation and almost without result  colonel de coetlogon an old soldier described the noise as deafening  the harbour was all struck with shots a man was knocked over on the german warship half apia was under fire and a house was pierced beyond the mulivai  all along the two lines of breastwork the entrenched enemies exchanged this hail of balls and away on the east of the battle the fusillade was maintained with equal spirit across the narrow barrier of the fuisa  the whole rear of the tamaseses was enfiladed by this flank fire and i have seen a house there by the river brink that was riddled with bullets like a piece of wormeaten wreckwood  at this point of the field befell a trait of samoan warfare worth recording  taiese brother to siteoni already mentioned shot a tamasese man  he saw him fall and inflamed with the lust of glory passed the river singlehanded in that storm of missiles to secure the head  on the farther bank as was but natural he fell himself he who had gone to take a trophy remained to afford one and the mataafas who had looked on exulting in the prospect of a triumph saw themselves exposed instead to a disgrace  then rose one vingi passed the deadly water swung the body of taiese on his back and returned unscathed to his own side the head saved the corpse filled with useless bullets  at this rate of practice the ammunition soon began to run low and from an early hour of the afternoon the malietoa stores were visited by customers in search of more  an elderly man came leaping and cheering his gun in one hand a basket of three heads in the other  a fellow came shot through the forearm  it doesnt hurt now he said as he bought his cartridges but it will hurt tomorrow and i want to fight while i can  a third followed a mere boy with the end of his nose shot off have you any painkiller give it me quick so that i can get back to fight  on either side there was the same delight in sound and smoke and schoolboy cheering the same unsophisticated ardour of battle and the misdirected skirmish proceeded with a din and was illustrated with traits of bravery that would have fitted a waterloo or a sedan  i have said how little i regard the alleged plan of battle  at least it was now all gone to water  the whole forces of mataafa had leaked out man by man village by village on the socalled false attack  they were all pounding for their lives on the front and the left flank of matautu about halfpast three they enveloped the right flank also  the defenders were driven back along the beach road as far as the pilot station at the turn of the land  from this also they were dislodged stubbornly fighting  one it is told retreated to his middle in the lagoon stood there loading and firing till he fell and his body was found on the morrow pierced with four mortal wounds  the tamasese force was now enveloped on three sides it was besides almost cut off from the sea and across its whole rear and only way of retreat a fire of hostile bullets crossed from east and west in the midst of which men were surprised to observe the birds continuing to sing and a cow grazed all afternoon unhurt  doubtless here was the defence in a poor way but then the attack was in irons  for the mataafas about the pilot house could scarcely advance beyond without coming under the fire of their own men from the other side of the fuisa and there was not enough organisation perhaps not enough authority to divert or to arrest that fire  the progress of the fight along the beach road was visible from mulinuu and brandeis despatched ten boats of reinforcements  they crossed the harbour paused for a while beside the adlerit is supposed for ammunitionand drew near the matautu shore  the mataafa men lay close among the shoreside bushes expecting their arrival when a silly lad in mere lightness of heart fired a shot in the air  my native friend mrs mary hamilton ran out of her house and gave the culprit a good shaking an episode in the midst of battle as incongruous as the grazing cow  but his sillier comrades followed his example a harmless volley warned the boats what they might expect and they drew back and passed outside the reef for the passage of the fuisa  here they came under the fire of the right wing of the mataafas on the riverbank  the beach raked east and west appeared to them no place to land on  and they hung off in the deep water of the lagoon inside the barrier reef feebly fusillading the pilot house  between four and five the fabeata regiment or folk of that village on the mataafa left which had been under arms all day fell to be withdrawn for rest and food the siumu regiment which should have relieved it was not ready or not notified in time and the tamaseses gallantly profiting by the mismanagement recovered the most of the ground in their proper right  it was not for long  they lost it again yard by yard and from house to house till the pilot station was once more in the hands of the mataafas  this is the last definite incident in the battle  the vicissitudes along the line of the entrenchments remain concealed from us under the cover of the forest  some part of the tamasese position there appears to have been carried but what part or at what hour or whether the advantage was maintained i have never learned  night and rain but not silence closed upon the field  the trenches were deep in mud but the younger folk wrecked the houses in the neighbourhood carried the roofs to the front and lay under them men and women together through a long night of furious squalls and furious and useless volleys  meanwhile the older folk trailed back into apia in the rain they talked as they went of who had fallen and what heads had been taken upon either sidethey seemed to know by name the losses upon both and drenched with wet and broken with excitement and fatigue they crawled into the verandahs of the town to eat and sleep  the morrow broke grey and drizzly but as so often happens in the islands cleared up into a glorious day  during the night the majority of the defenders had taken advantage of the rain and darkness and stolen from their forts unobserved  the rallying sign of the tamaseses had been a white handkerchief  with the dawn the de coetlogons from the english consulate beheld the ground strewn with these badges discarded and close by the house a belated turncoat was still changing white for red matautu was lost tamasese was confined to mulinuu and by nine oclock two mataafa villages paraded the streets of apia taking possession  the cost of this respectable success in ammunition must have been enormous in life it was but small  some compute forty killed on either side others forty on both three or four being women and one a white man master of a schooner from fiji  nor was the number even of the wounded at all proportionate to the surprising din and fury of the affair while it lasted     chapter vilast exploits of becker   septembernovember 1888  brandeis had held all day by mulinuu expecting the reported real attack he woke on the 13th to find himself cut off on that unwatered promontory and the mataafa villagers parading apia  the same day fritze received a letter from mataafa summoning him to withdraw his party from the isthmus and fritze as if in answer drew in his ship into the small harbour close to mulinuu and trained his port battery to assist in the defence from a step so decisive it might be thought the german plans were unaffected by the disastrous issue of the battle  i conceive nothing would be further from the truth  here was tamasese penned on mulinuu with his troops apia from which alone these could be subsisted in the hands of the enemy a battle imminent in which the german vessel must apparently take part with men and battery and the buildings of the german firm were apparently destined to be the first target of fire unless becker reestablished that which he had so lately and so artfully thrown downthe neutral territorythe firm would have to suffer  if he reestablished it tamasese must retire from mulinuu  if becker saved his goose he lost his cabbage  nothing so well depicts the mans effrontery as that he should have conceived the design of saving bothof reestablishing only so much of the neutral territory as should hamper mataafa and leaving in abeyance all that could incommode tamasese  by drawing the boundary where he now proposed across the isthmus he protected the firm drove back the mataafas out of almost all that they had conquered and so far from disturbing tamasese actually fortified him in his old position  the real story of the negotiations that followed we shall perhaps never learn  but so much is plain that while becker was thus outwardly straining decency in the interest of tamasese he was privately intriguing or pretending to intrigue with mataafa  in his despatch of the 11th he had given an extended criticism of that chieftain whom he depicts as very dark and artful and while admitting that his assumption of the name of malietoa might raise him up followers predicted that he could not make an orderly government or support himself long in sole power without very energetic foreign help  of what help was the consul thinking  there was no helper in the field but germany  on the 15th he had an interview with the victor told him that tamaseses was the only government recognised by germany and that he must continue to recognise it till he received other instructions from his government whom he was now advising of the late events refused accordingly to withdraw the guard from the isthmus and desired mataafa until the arrival of these fresh instructions to refrain from an attack on mulinuu  one thing of two either this language is extremely perfidious or becker was preparing to change sides  the same detachment appears in his despatch of october 7th  he computes the losses of the german firm with an easy cheerfulness  if tamasese get up again gelingt die wiederherstellung der regierung tamaseses tamasese will have to pay  if not then mataafa  this is not the language of a partisan  the tone of indifference the easy implication that the case of tamasese was already desperate the hopes held secretly forth to mataafa and secretly reported to his government at home trenchantly contrast with his external conduct  at this very time he was feeding tamasese he had german sailors mounting guard on tamaseses battlements the german warship lay close in whether to help or to destroy  if he meant to drop the cause of tamasese he had him in a corner helpless and could stifle him without a sob  if he meant to rat it was to be with every condition of safety and every circumstance of infamy  was it conceivable then that he meant it  speaking with a gentleman who was in the confidence of dr knappe was it not a pity i asked that knappe did not stick to beckers policy of supporting mataafa you are quite wrong there that was not knappes doing was the reply becker had changed his mind before knappe came  why then had he changed it  this excellent if ignominious idea once entertained why was it let drop  it is to be remembered there was another german in the field brandeis who had a respect or rather perhaps an affection for tamasese and who thought his own honour and that of his country engaged in the support of that government which they had provoked and founded becker described the captain to laupepa as a quiet sensible gentleman if any word came to his ears of the intended manoeuvre brandeis would certainly show himself very sensible of the affront but becker might have been tempted to withdraw his former epithet of quiet  some such passage some such threatened change of front at the consulate opposed with outcry would explain what seems otherwise inexplicable the bitter indignant almost hostile tone of a subsequent letter from brandeis to knappebrandeiss inflammatory letter bismarck calls itthe proximate cause of the german landing and reverse at fangalii  but whether the advances of becker were sincere or notwhether he meditated treachery against the old king or was practising treachery upon the new and the choice is between one or otherno doubt but he contrived to gain his points with mataafa prevailing on him to change his camp for the better protection of the german plantations and persuading him long before he could persuade his brother consuls to accept that miraculous new neutral territory of his with a piece cut out for the immediate needs of tamasese  during the rest of september tamasese continued to decline  on the 19th one village and half of another deserted him on the 22nd two more  on the 21st the mataafas burned his town of leulumoenga his own splendid house flaming with the rest and there are few things of which a native thinks more or has more reason to think well than of a fine samoan house  tamasese women and children were marched up the same day from atua and handed over with their sleepingmats to mulinuu a most unwelcome addition to a party already suffering from want  by the 20th they were being watered from the adler  on the 24th the manono fleet of sixteen large boats fortified and rendered unmanageable with tons of firewood passed to windward to intercept supplies from atua  by the 27th the hungry garrison flocked in great numbers to draw rations at the german firm  on the 28th the same business was repeated with a different issue  mataafas crowded to look on words were exchanged blows followed sticks stones and bottles were caught up the detested brandeis at great risk threw himself between the lines and expostulated with the mataafashis only personal appearance in the wars if this could be called war  the same afternoon the tamasese boats got in with provisions having passed to seaward of the lumbering manono fleet and from that day on whether from a high degree of enterprise on the one side or a great lack of capacity on the other supplies were maintained from the sea with regularity  thus the spectacle of battle or at least of riot at the doors of the german firm was not repeated  but the memory must have hung heavy on the hearts not of the germans only but of all apia  the samoans are a gentle race gentler than any in europe we are often enough reminded of the circumstance not always by their friends  but a mob is a mob and a drunken mob is a drunken mob and a drunken mob with weapons in its hands is a drunken mob with weapons in its hands all the world over elementary propositions which some of us upon these islands might do worse than get by rote but which must have been evident enough to becker  and i am amazed by the mans constancy that even while blows were going at the door of that german firm which he was in samoa to protect he should have stuck to his demands  ten days before blacklock had offered to recognise the old territory including mulinuu and becker had refused and still in the midst of these alarums and excursions he continued to refuse it  on october 2nd anchored in apia bay hbms calliope captain kane carrying the flag of rearadmiral fairfax and the gunboat lizard lieutenantcommander pelly  it was rumoured the admiral had come to recognise the government of tamasese i believe in error  and at least the day for that was quite gone by and he arrived not to salute the kings accession but to arbitrate on his remains  a conference of the consuls and commanders met on board the calliope october 4th fritze alone being absent although twice invited the affair touched politics his consul was to be there and even if he came to the meeting so he explained to fairfax he would have no voice in its deliberations  the parties were plainly marked out blacklock and leary maintaining their offer of the old neutral territory and probably willing to expand or to contract it to any conceivable extent so long as mulinuu was still included knappe offered if the others liked to include the whole eastern end of the island but quite fixed upon the one point that mulinuu should be left out the english willing to meet either view and singly desirous that apia should be neutralised  the conclusion was foregone  becker held a trump card in the consent of mataafa blacklock and leary stood alone spoke with all ill grace and could not long hold out  becker had his way and the neutral boundary was chosen just where he desired across the isthmus the firm within mulinuu without  he did not long enjoy the fruits of victory  on the 7th three days after the meeting one of the scanlons wellknown and intelligent halfcastes came to blacklock with a complaint  the scanlon house stood on the hither side of the tamasese breastwork just inside the newly accepted territory and within easy range of the firm armed men to the number of a hundred had issued from mulinuu had taken charge of the house had pointed a gun at scanlons head and had twice threatened to kill his pigs  i hear elsewhere of some effects gegenstande removed  at the best a very pale atrocity though we shall find the word employed  germans declare besides that scanlon was no american subject they declare the point had been decided by court martial in 1875 that blacklock had the decision in the consular archives and that this was his reason for handing the affair to leary it is not necessary to suppose so  it is plain he thought little of the business thought indeed nothing of it except in so far as armed men had entered the neutral territory from mulinuu and it was on this ground alone and the implied breach of beckers engagement at the conference that he invited learys attention to the tale  the impish ingenuity of the commander perceived in it huge possibilities of mischief  he took up the scanlon outrage the atrocity of the threatened pigs and with that poor instrumenti am sure to his own wonderdrove tamasese out of mulinuu  it was an intrigue becker complains  to be sure it was but who was becker to be complaining of intrigue  on the 7th leary laid before fritze the following conundrum as the natives of mulinuu appear to be under the protection of the imperial german naval guard belonging to the vessel under your command i have the honour to request you to inform me whether or not they are under such protection  amicable relations pursued the humorist amicable relations exist between the government of the united states and his imperial german majestys government but we do not recognise tamaseses government and i am desirous of locating the responsibility for violations of american rights  becker and fritze lost no time in explanation or denial but went straight to the root of the matter and sought to buy off scanlon  becker declares that every reparation was offered  scanlon takes a pride to recapitulate the leases and the situations he refused and the long interviews in which he was tempted and plied with drink by becker or beckmann of the firm  no doubt in short that he was offered reparation in reason and out of reason and being thoroughly primed refused it all  meantime some answer must be made to leary and fritze repeated on the 8th his oftrepeated assurances that he was not authorised to deal with politics  the same day leary retorted the question is not one of diplomacy nor of politics  it is strictly one of military jurisdiction and responsibility  under the shadow of the german fort at mulinuu continued the hyperbolical commander atrocities have been committed    and i again have the honour respectfully to request to be informed whether or not the armed natives at mulinuu are under the protection of the imperial german naval guard belonging to the vessel under your command  to this no answer was vouchsafed till the 11th and then in the old terms and meanwhile on the 10th leary got into his gaitersthe sure sign as was both said and sung aboard his vessel of some desperate or some amusing serviceand was set ashore at the scanlons house  of this he took possession at the head of an old woman and a mop and was seen from the tamasese breastwork directing operations and plainly preparing to install himself there in a military posture  so much he meant to be understood so much he meant to carry out and an armed party from the adams was to have garrisoned on the morrow the scene of the atrocity  but there is no doubt he managed to convey more  no doubt he was a master in the art of loose speaking and could always manage to be overheard when he wanted and by this or some other equally unofficial means he spread the rumour that on the morrow he was to bombard  the proposed post from its position and from learys wellestablished character as an artist in mischief must have been regarded by the germans with uneasiness  in the bombardment we can scarce suppose them to have believed  but tamasese must have both believed and trembled  the prestige of the european powers was still unbroken  no native would then have dreamed of defying these colossal ships worked by mysterious powers and laden with outlandish instruments of death  none would have dreamed of resisting those strange but quite unrealised great powers understood with difficulty to be larger than tonga and samoa put together and known to be prolific of prints knives hard biscuit picturebooks and other luxuries as well as of overbearing men and inconsistent orders  laupepa had fallen in illblood with one of them his only idea of defence had been to throw himself in the arms of another his name his rank and his great following had not been able to preserve him and he had vanished from the eyes of menas the samoan thinks of it beyond the sky  asi maunga tuiletufunga had followed him in that new path of doom  we have seen how carefully mataafa still walked how he dared not set foot on the neutral territory till assured it was no longer sacred how he withdrew from it again as soon as its sacredness had been restored and at the bare word of a consul however gilded with ambiguous promises paused in his course of victory and left his rival unassailed in mulinuu  and now it was the rivals turn hitherto happy in the continued support of one of the white powers he now found himselfor thought himselfthreatened with war by no less than two others  tamasese boats as they passed matautu were in the habit of firing on the shore as like as not without particular aim and more in high spirits than hostility  one of these shots pierced the house of a british subject near the consulate the consul reported to admiral fairfax and on the morning of the 10th the admiral despatched captain kane of the calliope to mulinuu  brandeis met the messenger with voluble excuses and engagements for the future  he was told his explanations were satisfactory so far as they went but that the admirals message was to tamasese the de facto king  brandeis not very well assured of his puppets courage attempted in vain to excuse him from appearing  no de facto king no message he was told produce your de facto king  and tamasese had at last to be produced  to him kane delivered his errand that the lizard was to remain for the protection of british subjects that a signalman was to be stationed at the consulate that on any further firing from boats the signalman was to notify the lizard and she to fire one gun on which all boats must lower sail and come alongside for examination and the detection of the guilty and that in the event of the boats not obeying the gun the admiral would not be responsible for the consequences  it was listened to by brandeis and tamasese with the greatest attention  brandeis when it was done desired his thanks to the admiral for the moderate terms of his message and as kane went to his boat repeated the expression of his gratitude as though he meant it declaring his own hands would be thus strengthened for the maintenance of discipline  but i have yet to learn of any gratitude on the part of tamasese  consider the case of the poor owlish man hearing for the first time our diplomatic commonplaces  the admiral would not be answerable for the consequences  think of it  a devil of a position for a de facto king  and here the same afternoon was leary in the scanlon house mopping it out for unknown designs by the hands of an old woman and proffering strange threats of bloodshed  scanlon and his pigs the admiral and his gun leary and his bombardmentwhat a kettle of fish  i dwell on the effect on tamasese  whatever the faults of becker he was not timid he had already braved so much for mulinuu that i cannot but think he might have continued to hold up his head even after the outrage of the pigs and that the weakness now shown originated with the king late in the night blacklock was wakened to receive a despatch addressed to leary  you have asked that i and my government go away from mulinuu because you pretend a man who lives near mulinuu and who is under your protection has been threatened by my soldiers  as your excellency has forbidden the man to accept any satisfaction and as i do not wish to make war against the united states i shall remove my government from mulinuu to another place  it was signed by tamasese but i think more heads than his had wagged over the direct and able letter  on the morning of the 11th accordingly mulinuu the much defended lay desert tamasese and brandeis had slipped to sea in a schooner their troops had followed them in boats the german sailors and their warflag had returned on board the adler and only the german merchant flag blew there for webers landclaim  mulinuu for which becker had intrigued so long and so often for which he had overthrown the municipality for which he had abrogated and refused and invented successive schemes of neutral territory was now no more to the germans than a very unattractive barren peninsula and a very much disputed landclaim of mr webers  it will scarcely be believed that the tale of the scanlon outrages was not yet finished  leary had gained his point but scanlon had lost his compensation  and it was months later and this time in the shape of a threat of bombardment in black and white that tamasese heard the last of the absurd affair  scanlon had both his fun and his money and learys practical joke was brought to an artistic end  becker sought and missed an instant revenge  mataafa a devout catholic was in the habit of walking every morning to mass from his camp at vaiala beyond matautu to the mission at the mulivai  he was sometimes escorted by as many as six guards in uniform who displayed their proficiency in drill by perpetually shifting arms as they marched  himself meanwhile paced in front bareheaded and barefoot a staff in his hand in the customary chiefs dress of white kilt shirt and jacket and with a conspicuous rosary about his neck  tall but not heavy with eager eyes and a marked appearance of courage and capacity mataafa makes an admirable figure in the eyes of europeans to those of his countrymen he may seem not always to preserve that quiescence of manner which is thought becoming in the great  on the morning of october 16th he reached the mission before day with two attendants heard mass had coffee with the fathers and left again in safety  the smallness of his following we may suppose to have been reported  he was scarce gone at least before becker had armed men at the mission gate and came in person seeking him  the failure of this attempt doubtless still further exasperated the consul and he began to deal as in an enemys country  he had marines from the adler to stand sentry over the consulate and parade the streets by threes and fours  the bridge of the vaisingano which cuts in half the english and american quarters he closed by proclamation and advertised for tenders to demolish it  on the 17th leary and pelly landed carpenters and repaired it in his teeth  leary besides had marines under arms ready to land them if it should be necessary to protect the work  but becker looked on without interference perhaps glad enough to have the bridge repaired for even becker may not always have offended intentionally  such was now the distracted posture of the little town all government extinct the german consul patrolling it with armed men and issuing proclamations like a ruler the two other powers defying his commands and at least one of them prepared to use force in the defiance  close on its skirts sat the warriors of mataafa perhaps four thousand strong highly incensed against the germans having all to gain in the seizure of the town and firm and like an army in a fairy tale restrained by the airdrawn boundary of the neutral ground  i have had occasion to refer to the strange appearance in these islands of an american adventurer with a battery of cannon  the adventurer was long since gone but his guns remained and one of them was now to make fresh history  it had been cast overboard by brandeis on the outer reef in the course of this retreat and word of it coming to the ears of the mataafas they thought it natural that they should serve themselves the heirs of tamasese  on the 23rd a manono boat of the kind called taumualua dropped down the coast from mataafas camp called in broad day at the german quarter of the town for guides and proceeded to the reef  here diving with a rope they got the gun aboard and the night being then come returned by the same route in the shallow water along shore singing a boatsong  it will be seen with what childlike reliance they had accepted the neutrality of apia bay they came for the gun without concealment laboriously dived for it in broad day under the eyes of the town and shipping and returned with it singing as they went  on grevsmuhls wharf a light showed them a crowd of german bluejackets clustered and a hail was heard  stop the singing so that we may hear what is said said one of the chiefs in the taumualua  the song ceased the hail was heard again au mai le fanabring the gun and the natives report themselves to have replied in the affirmative and declare that they had begun to back the boat  it is perhaps not needful to believe them  a volley at least was fired from the wharf at about fifty yards range and with a very ill direction one bullet whistling over pellys head on board the lizard  the natives jumped overboard and swimming under the lee of the taumualua where they escaped a second volley dragged her towards the east  as soon as they were out of range and past the mulivai the german border they got on board and again singingthough perhaps a different song continued their return along the english and american shore  off matautu they were hailed from the seaward by one of the adlers boats which had been suddenly despatched on the sound of the firing or had stood ready all evening to secure the gun  the hail was in german the samoans knew not what it meant but took the precaution to jump overboard and swim for land  two volleys and some dropping shot were poured upon them in the water but they dived scattered and came to land unhurt in different quarters of matautu  the volleys fired inshore raked the highway a british house was again pierced by numerous bullets and these sudden sounds of war scattered consternation through the town  two british subjects hetheringtoncarruthers a solicitor and maben a landsurveyorthe first being in particular a man well versed in the native mind and languagehastened at once to their consul assured him the mataafas would be roused to fury by this onslaught in the neutral zone that the german quarter would be certainly attacked and the rest of the town and white inhabitants exposed to a peril very difficult of estimation and prevailed upon him to intrust them with a mission to the king  by the time they reached headquarters the warriors were already taking post round matafele and the agitation of mataafa himself was betrayed in the fact that he spoke with the deputation standing and gun in hand a breach of highchief dignity perhaps unparalleled  the usual result however followed the whites persuaded the samoan and the attack was countermanded to the benefit of all concerned and not least of mataafa  to the benefit of all i say for i do not think the germans were that evening in a posture to resist the liquorcellars of the firm must have fallen into the power of the insurgents and i will repeat my formula that a mob is a mob a drunken mob is a drunken mob and a drunken mob with weapons in its hands is a drunken mob with weapons in its hands all the world over  in the opinion of some then the town had narrowly escaped destruction or at least the miseries of a drunken sack  to the knowledge of all the air of the neutral territory had once more whistled with bullets  and it was clear the incident must have diplomatic consequences  leary and pelly both protested to fritze  leary announced he should report the affair to his government as a gross violation of the principles of international law and as a breach of the neutrality  i positively decline the protest replied fritze and cannot fail to express my astonishment at the tone of your last letter  this was trenchant  it may be said however that leary was already out of court that after the night signals and the scanlon incident and so many other acts of practical if humorous hostility his position as a neutral was no better than a doubtful jest  the case with pelly was entirely different and with pelly fritze was less well inspired  in his first note he was on the old guard announced that he had acted on the requisition of his consul who was alone responsible on the legal side and declined accordingly to discuss whether the lives of british subjects were in danger and to what extent armed intervention was necessary  pelly replied judiciously that he had nothing to do with political matters being only responsible for the safety of her majestys ships under his command and for the lives and property of british subjects that he had considered his protest a purely naval one and as the matter stood could only report the case to the admiral on the station  i have the honour replied fritze to refuse to entertain the protest concerning the safety of her britannic majestys ship lizard as being a naval matter  the safety of her majestys ship lizard was never in the least endangered this was guaranteed by the disciplined fire of a few shots under the direction of two officers  this offensive note in view of fritzes careful and honest bearing among so many other complications may be attributed to some misunderstanding  his small knowledge of english perhaps failed him  but i cannot pass it by without remarking how far too much it is the custom of german officials to fall into this style  it may be witty i am sure it is not wise  it may be sometimes necessary to offend for a definite object it can never be diplomatic to offend gratuitously  becker was more explicit although scarce less curt  and his defence may be divided into two statements first that the taumualua was proceeding to land with a hostile purpose on mulinuu second that the shots complained of were fired by the samoans  the second may be dismissed with a laugh  human nature has laws  and no men hitherto discovered on being suddenly challenged from the sea would have turned their backs upon the challenger and poured volleys on the friendly shore the first is not extremely credible but merits examination  the story of the recovered gun seems straightforward it is supported by much testimony the diving operations on the reef seem to have been watched from shore with curiosity it is hard to suppose that it does not roughly represent the fact  and yet if any part of it be true the whole of beckers explanation falls to the ground  a boat which had skirted the whole eastern coast of mulinuu and was already opposite a wharf in matafele and still going west might have been guilty on a thousand pointsthere was one on which she was necessarily innocent she was necessarily innocent of proceeding on mulinuu  or suppose the diving operations and the native testimony and pellys chart of the boats course and the boat itself to be all stages of some epidemic hallucination or steps in a conspiracysuppose even a second taumualua to have entered apia bay after nightfall and to have been fired upon from grevsmuhls wharf in the full career of hostilities against mulinuusuppose all this and becker is not helped  at the time of the first fire the boat was off grevsmuhls wharf  at the time of the second and that is the one complained of she was off carrutherss wharf in matautu  was she still proceeding on mulinuu  i trow not  the danger to german property was no longer imminent the shots had been fired upon a very trifling provocation the spirit implied was that of designed disregard to the neutrality  such was the impression here on the spot such in plain terms the statement of count hatzfeldt to lord salisbury at home that the neutrality of apia was only to prevent the natives from fighting not the germans and that whatever becker might have promised at the conference he could not restrict german warvessels in their freedom of action  there was nothing to surprise in this discovery and had events been guided at the same time with a steady and discreet hand it might have passed with less observation  but the policy of becker was felt to be not only reckless it was felt to be absurd also  sudden nocturnal onfalls upon native boats could lead it was felt to no good end whether of peace or war they could but exasperate they might prove in a moment and when least expected ruinous  to those who knew how nearly it had come to fighting and who considered the probable result the future looked ominous  and fear was mingled with annoyance in the minds of the anglosaxon colony  on the 24th a public meeting appealed to the british and american consuls  at halfpast seven in the evening guards were landed at the consulates  on the morrow they were each fortified with sandbags and the subjects informed by proclamation that these asylums stood open to them on any alarm and at any hour of the day or night  the social bond in apia was dissolved  the consuls like barons of old dwelt each in his armed citadel  the rank and file of the white nationalities dared each other and sometimes fell to on the street like rival clansmen  and the little town not by any fault of the inhabitants rather by the act of becker had fallen back in civilisation about a thousand years  there falls one more incident to be narrated and then i can close with this ungracious chapter  i have mentioned the name of the new english consul  it is already familiar to english readers for the gentleman who was fated to undergo some strange experiences in apia was the same de coetlogon who covered hickss flank at the time of the disaster in the desert and bade farewell to gordon in khartoum before the investment the colonel was abrupt and testy mrs de coetlogon was too exclusive for society like that of apia but whatever their superficial disabilities it is strange they should have left in such an odour of unpopularity a place where they set so shining an example of the sterling virtues  the colonel was perhaps no diplomatist he was certainly no lawyer but he discharged the duties of his office with the constancy and courage of an old soldier and these were found sufficient  he and his wife had no ambition to be the leaders of society the consulate was in their time no house of feasting but they made of it that house of mourning to which the preacher tells us it is better we should go  at an early date after the battle of matautu it was opened as a hospital for the wounded  the english and americans subscribed what was required for its support  pelly of the lizard strained every nerve to help and set up tents on the lawn to be a shelter for the patients  the doctors of the english and american ships and in particular dr oakley of the lizard showed themselves indefatigable  but it was on the de coetlogons that the distress fell  for nearly half a year their lawn their verandah sometimes their rooms were cumbered with the sick and dying their ears were filled with the complaints of suffering humanity their time was too short for the multiplicity of pitiful duties  in mrs de coetlogon and her helper miss taylor the merit of this endurance was perhaps to be looked for in a man of the colonels temper himself painfully suffering it was viewed with more surprise if with no more admiration doubtless all had their reward in a sense of duty done doubtless also as the days passed in the spectacle of many traits of gratitude and patience and in the success that waited on their efforts  out of a hundred cases treated only five died  they were all wellbehaved though full of childish wiles  one old gentleman a high chief was seized with alarming symptoms of bellyache whenever mrs de coetlogon went her rounds at night he was after brandy  others were insatiable for morphine or opium  a chief woman had her foot amputated under chloroform  let me see my foot  why does it not hurt she cried  it hurt so badly before i went to sleep  siteoni whose name has been already mentioned had his shoulderblade excised lay the longest of any perhaps behaved the worst and was on all these grounds the favourite  at times he was furiously irritable and would rail upon his family and rise in bed until he swooned with pain  once on the balcony he was thought to be dying his family keeping round his mat his father exhorting him to be prepared when mrs de coetlogon brought him round again with brandy and smellingsalts  after discharge he returned upon a visit of gratitude and it was observed that instead of coming straight to the door he went and stood long under his umbrella on that spot of ground where his mat had been stretched and he had endured pain so many months  similar visits were the rule i believe without exception and the grateful patients loaded mrs de coetlogon with gifts which had that been possible in polynesia she would willingly have declined for they were often of value to the givers  the tissue of my story is one of rapacity intrigue and the triumphs of temper the hospital at the consulate stands out almost alone as an episode of human beauty and i dwell on it with satisfaction  but it was not regarded at the time with universal favour and even today its institution is thought by many to have been impolitic  it was opened it stood open for the wounded of either party  as a matter of fact it was never used but by the mataafas and the tamaseses were cared for exclusively by german doctors  in the progressive decivilisation of the town these duties of humanity became thus a ground of quarrel  when the mataafa hurt were first brought together after the battle of matautu and some more or less amateur surgeons were dressing wounds on a green by the wayside one from the german consulate went by in the road  why dont you let the dogs die he asked  go to hell was the rejoinder  such were the amenities of apia  but becker reserved for himself the extreme expression of this spirit  on november 7th hostilities began again between the samoan armies and an inconclusive skirmish sent a fresh crop of wounded to the de coetlogons  next door to the consulate some native houses and a chapel now ruinous stood on a green  chapel and houses were certainly samoan but the ground was under a landclaim of the german firm and de coetlogon wrote to becker requesting permission in case it should prove necessary to use these structures for his wounded before an answer came the hospital was startled by the appearance of a case of gangrene and the patient was hastily removed into the chapel  a rebel laid on german groundhere was an atrocity  the day before his own relief november 11th becker ordered the mans instant removal  by his aggressive carriage and singular mixture of violence and cunning he had already largely brought about the fall of brandeis and forced into an attitude of hostility the whole nongerman population of the islands now in his last hour of office by this wanton buffet to his english colleague he prepared a continuance of evil days for his successor  if the object of diplomacy be the organisation of failure in the midst of hate he was a great diplomatist  and amongst a certain party on the beach he is still named as the ideal consul     chapter viithe samoan camps   november 1888  when brandeis and tamasese fled by night from mulinuu they carried their wandering government some six miles to windward to a position above lotoanuu  for some three miles to the eastward of apia the shores of upolu are low and the ground rises with a gentle acclivity much of which waves with german plantations  a barrier reef encloses a lagoon passable for boats and the traveller skims there on smooth manytinted shallows between the wall of the breakers on the one hand and on the other a succession of palmtree capes and cheerful beachside villages beyond the great plantation of vailele the character of the coast is changed  the barrier reef abruptly ceases the surf beats direct upon the shore and the mountains and untenanted forest of the interior descend sheer into the sea  the first mountain promontory is letongo the bay beyond is called laulii and became the headquarters of mataafa and on the next projection on steep intricate ground veiled in forest and cut up by gorges and defiles tamasese fortified his lines  this greenwood citadel which proved impregnable by samoan arms may be regarded as his front the sea covered his right and his rear extended along the coast as far as saluafata and thus commanded and drew upon a rich country including the plain of falefa  he was left in peace from 11th october till november 6th  but his adversary is not wholly to be blamed for this delay which depended upon island etiquette  his savaii contingent had not yet come in and to have moved again without waiting for them would have been surely to offend perhaps to lose them  with the month of november they began to arrive on the 2nd twenty boats on the 3rd twentynine on the 5th seventeen  on the 6th the position mataafa had so long occupied on the skirts of apia was deserted all that day and night his force kept streaming eastward to laulii and on the 7th the siege of lotoanuu was opened with a brisk skirmish  each side built forts facing across the gorge of a brook  an endless fusillade and shouting maintained the spirit of the warriors and at night even if the firing slackened the pickets continued to exchange from either side volleys of songs and pungent pleasantries  nearer hostilities were rendered difficult by the nature of the ground where men must thread dense bush and clamber on the face of precipices  apia was near enough a man if he had a dollar or two could walk in before a battle and array himself in silk or velvet  casualties were not common there was nothing to cast gloom upon the camps and no more danger than was required to give a spice to the perpetual firing  for the young warriors it was a period of admirable enjoyment  but the anxiety of mataafa must have been great and growing  his force was now considerable  it was scarce likely he should ever have more  that he should be long able to supply them with ammunition seemed incredible at the rates then or soon after current hundreds of pounds sterling might be easily blown into the air by the skirmishers in the course of a few days  and in the meanwhile on the mountain opposite his outnumbered adversary held his ground unshaken  by this time the partisanship of the whites was unconcealed  americans supplied mataafa with ammunition english and americans openly subscribed together and sent boatloads of provisions to his camp  one such boat started from apia on a day of rain it was pulled by six oars three being paid by moors three by the macarthurs moors himself and a clerk of the macarthurs were in charge and the load included not only beef and biscuit but three or four thousand rounds of ammunition  they came ashore in laulii and carried the gift to mataafa  while they were yet in his house a bullet passed overhead and out of his door they could see the tamasese pickets on the opposite hill  thence they made their way to the left flank of the mataafa position next the sea  a tamasese barricade was visible across the stream  it rained but the warriors crowded in their shanties squatted in the mud and maintained an excited conversation  balls flew either faction both happy as lords spotting for the other in chance shots and missing  one point is characteristic of that war experts in native feeling doubt if it will characterise the next  the two white visitors passed without and between the lines to a rocky point upon the beach  the person of moors was well known the purpose of their coming to laulii must have been already bruited abroad yet they were not fired upon  from the point they spied a crows nest or hanging fortification higher up and judging it was a good position for a general view obtained a guide  he led them up a steep side of the mountain where they must climb by roots and tufts of grass and coming to an open hilltop with some scattered trees bade them wait let him draw the fire and then be swift to follow  perhaps a dozen balls whistled about him ere he had crossed the dangerous passage and dropped on the farther side into the crowsnest the white men briskly following escaped unhurt  the crowsnest was built like a bartizan on the precipitous front of the position  across the ravine perhaps at five hundred yards heads were to be seen popping up and down in a fort of tameseses  on both sides the same enthusiasm without council the same senseless vigilance reigned  some took aim some blazed before them at a venture  nowwhen a head showed on the other sideone would take a crack at it remarking that it would never do to miss a chance now they would all fire a volley and bob down a return volley rang across the ravine and was punctually answered harmless as lawntennis the whites expostulated in vain  the warriors drunken with noise made answer by a fresh general discharge and bade their visitors run while it was time  upon their return to headquarters men were covering the front with sheets of coral limestone two balls having passed through the house in the interval  mataafa sat within over his kava bowl unmoved  the picture is of a piece throughout excellent courage superexcellent folly a war of schoolchildren expensive guns and cartridges used like squibs or catherinewheels on guy fawkess day  on the 20th mataafa changed his attack  tamaseses front was seemingly impregnable  something must be tried upon his rear  there was his bread basket a small success in that direction would immediately curtail his resources and it might be possible with energy to roll up his line along the beach and take the citadel in reverse  the scheme was carried out as might be expected from these childish soldiers  mataafa always uneasy about apia clung with a portion of his force to laulii and thus had the foe been enterprising exposed himself to disaster  the expedition fell successfully enough on saluafata and drove out the tamaseses with a loss of four heads but so far from improving the advantage yielded immediately to the weakness of the samoan warrior and ranged farther east through unarmed populations bursting with shouts and blackened faces into villages terrified or admiring making spoil of pigs burning houses and destroying gardens  the tamasese had at first evacuated several beach towns in succession and were still in retreat on lotoanuu finding themselves unpursued they reoccupied them one after another and reestablished their lines to the very borders of saluafata  night fell mataafa had taken saluafata tamasese had lost it and that was all  but the day came near to have a different and very singular issue  the village was not long in the hands of the mataafas when a schooner flying german colours put into the bay and was immediately surrounded by their boats  it chanced that brandeis was on board  word of it had gone abroad and the boats as they approached demanded him with threats  the late premier alone entirely unarmed and a prey to natural and painful feelings concealed himself below  the captain of the schooner remained on deck pointed to the german colours and defied approaching boats again the prestige of a great power triumphed the samoans fell back before the bunting the schooner worked out of the bay brandeis escaped he himself apprehended the worst if he fell into samoan hands it is my diffident impression that his life would have been safe  on the 22nd a new german warship the eber of tragic memory came to apia from the gilberts where she had been disarming turbulent islands the rest of that day and all night she loaded stores from the firm and on the morrow reached saluafata bay  thanks to the misconduct of the mataafas the most of the foreshore was still in the hands of the tamaseses and they were thus able to receive from the eber both the stores and weapons  the weapons had been sold long since to tarawa apaiang and pleasant island places unheard of by the general reader where obscure inhabitants paid for these instruments of death in money or in labour misused them as it was known they would be misused and had been disarmed by force  the eber had brought back the guns to a german counter whence many must have been originally sold and was here engaged like a shopboy in their distribution to fresh purchasers  such is the vicious circle of the traffic in weapons of war  another aid of a more metaphysical nature was ministered by the eber to tamasese in the shape of uncountable german flags  the full history of this epidemic of bunting falls to be told in the next chapter  but the fact has to be chronicled here for i believe it was to these flags that we owe the visit of the adams and my next and best authentic glance into a native camp  the adams arrived in saluafata on the 26th  on the morrow leary and moors landed at the village  it was still occupied by mataafas mostly from manono and savaii few in number high in spirit  the tamasese pickets were meanwhile within musket range there was maintained a steady sputtering of shots and yet a party of tamasese women were here on a visit to the women of manono with whom they sat talking and smoking under the fire of their own relatives  it was reported that leary took part in a council of war and promised to join with his broadside in the next attack  it is certain he did nothing of the sort equally certain that in tamasese circles he was firmly credited with having done so  and this heightens the extraordinary character of what i have now to tell  prudence and delicacy alike ought to have forbid the camp of tamasese to the feet of either leary or moors  moors was the originalthere was a time when he had been the onlyopponent of the puppet king  leary had driven him from the seat of government it was but a week or two since he had threatened to bombard him in his present refuge  both were in close and daily council with his adversary and it was no secret that moors was supplying the latter with food  they were partisans it lacked but a hair that they should be called belligerents it were idle to try to deny they were the most dangerous of spies  and yet these two now sailed across the bay and landed inside the tamasese lines at salelesi  on the very beach they had another glimpse of the artlessness of samoan war  hitherto the tamasese fleet being hardy and unencumbered had made a fool of the huge floating forts upon the other side and here they were toiling not to produce another boat on their own pattern in which they had always enjoyed the advantage but to make a new one the type of their enemies of which they had now proved the uselessness for months  it came on to rain as the americans landed and though none offered to oppose their coming ashore none invited them to take shelter  they were nowise abashed entered a house unbidden and were made welcome with obvious reserve  the rain clearing off they set forth westward deeper into the heart of the enemies position  three or four young men ran some way before them doubtless to give warning and leary with his indomitable taste for mischief kept inquiring as he went after the high chief tamasese  the line of the beach was one continuous breastwork some thirty odd iron cannon of all sizes and patterns stood mounted in embrasures plenty grape and canister lay ready and at every hundred yards or so the german flag was flying  the numbers of the guns and flags i give as i received them though they test my faith  at the house of brandeisa little weatherboard house crammed at the time with natives men women and squalling childrenleary and moors again asked for the high chief and were again assured that he was farther on  a little beyond the road ran in one place somewhat inland the two americans had gone down to the line of the beach to continue their inspection of the breastwork when brandeis himself in his shirtsleeves and accompanied by several german officers passed them by the line of the road  the two parties saluted in silence beyond eva point there was an observable change for the worse in the reception of the americans some whom they met began to mutter at moors and the adventurers with tardy but commendable prudence desisted from their search after the high chief and began to retrace their steps  on the return suatele and some chiefs were drinking kava in a big house and called them in to jointheir only invitation  but the night was closing the rain had begun again they stayed but for civility and returned on board the adams wet and hungry and i believe delighted with their expedition  it was perhaps the last as it was certainly one of the most extreme examples of that divinity which once hedged the white in samoa  the feeling was already different in the camp of mataafa where the safety of a german loiterer had been a matter of extreme concern  ten days later three commissioners an englishman an american and a german approached a post of mataafas were challenged by an old man with a gun and mentioned in answer what they were  ifea siamani  which is the german cried the old gentleman dancing and with his finger on the trigger and the commissioners stood somewhile in a very anxious posture till they were released by the opportune arrival of a chief  it was november the 27th when leary and moors completed their absurd excursion in about three weeks an event was to befall which changed at once and probably for ever the relations of the natives and the whites  by the 28th tamasese had collected seventeen hundred men in the trenches before saluafata thinking to attack next day  but the mataafas evacuated the place in the night  at halfpast five on the morning of the 29th a signalgun was fired in the trenches at laulii and the tamasese citadel was assaulted and defended with a fury new among samoans  when the battle ended on the following day one or more outworks remained in the possession of mataafa  another had been taken and lost as many as four times  carried originally by a mixed force from savaii and tuamasanga the victors instead of completing fresh defences or pursuing their advantage fell to eat and smoke and celebrate their victory with impromptu songs  in this humour a rally of the tamaseses smote them drove them out pellmell and tumbled them into the ravine where many broke their heads and legs  again the work was taken again lost  ammunition failed the belligerents and they fought hand to hand in the contested fort with axes clubs and clubbed rifles  the sustained ardour of the engagement surprised even those who were engaged and the butchers bill was counted extraordinary by samoans  on december 1st the women of either side collected the headless bodies of the dead each easily identified by the name tattooed on his forearm  mataafa is thought to have lost sixty killed and the de coetlogons hospital received three women and forty men  the casualties on the tamasese side cannot be accepted but they were presumably much less     chapter viiiaffairs of laulii and fangalii   novemberdecember 1888  for becker i have not been able to conceal my distaste for he seems to me both false and foolish  but of his successor the unfortunately famous dr knappe we may think as of a good enough fellow driven distraught  fond of samoa and the samoans he thought to bring peace and enjoy popularity among the islanders of a genial amiable and sanguine temper he made no doubt but he could repair the breach with the english consul  hope told a flattering tale  he awoke to find himself exchanging defiances with de coetlogon beaten in the field by mataafa surrounded on the spot by general exasperation and disowned from home by his own government  the history of his administration leaves on the mind of the student a sentiment of pity scarcely mingled  on blacklock he did not call and in view of learys attitude may be excused  but the english consul was in a different category  england weary of the name of samoa and desirous only to see peace established was prepared to wink hard during the process and to welcome the result of any german settlement  it was an unpardonable fault in becker to have kicked and buffeted his readymade allies into a state of jealousy anger and suspicion  knappe set himself at once to efface these impressions and the english officials rejoiced for the moment in the change  between knappe and de coetlogon there seems to have been mutual sympathy and in considering the steps by which they were led at last into an attitude of mutual defiance it must be remembered that both the men were sickknappe from time to time prostrated with that formidable complaint new guinea fever and de coetlogon throughout his whole stay in the islands continually ailing  tamasese was still to be recognised and if possible supported such was the german policy  two days after his arrival accordingly knappe addressed to mataafa a threatening despatch  the german plantation was suffering from the proximity of his warparty  he must withdraw from laulii at once and whithersoever he went he must approach no german property nor so much as any village where there was a german trader  by five oclock on the morrow if he were not gone knappe would turn upon him the attention of the manofwar and inflict a fine  the same evening november 14th knappe went on board the adler which began to get up steam  three months before such direct intervention on the part of germany would have passed almost without protest but the hour was now gone by beckers conduct equally timid and rash equally inconclusive and offensive had forced the other nations into a strong feeling of common interest with mataafa  even had the german demands been moderate de coetlogon could not have forgotten the night of the taumualua nor how mataafa had relinquished at his request the attack upon the german quarter  blacklock with his driver of a captain at his elbow was not likely to lag behind  and mataafa having communicated knappes letter the example of the germans was on all hands exactly followed the consuls hastened on board their respective warships and these began to get up steam  about midnight in a pouring rain pelly communicated to fritze his intention to follow him and protect british interests and knappe replied that he would come on board the lizard and see de coetlogon personally  it was deep in the small hours and de coetlogon had been long asleep when he was wakened to receive his colleague but he started up with an old soldiers readiness  the conference was long  de coetlogon protested as he did afterwards in writing against knappes claim the samoans were in a state of war they had territorial rights it was monstrous to prevent them from entering one of their own villages because a german trader kept the store and in case property suffered a claim for compensation was the proper remedy  knappe argued that this was a question between germans and samoans in which de coetlogon had nothing to see and that he must protect german property according to his instructions  to which de coetlogon replied that he was himself in the same attitude to the property of the british that he understood knappe to be intending hostilities against laulii that laulii was mortgaged to the macarthurs that its crops were accordingly british property and that while he was ever willing to recognise the territorial rights of the samoans he must prevent that property from being molested by any other nation  but if a german manofwar does it asked knappewe shall prevent it to the best of our ability replied the colonel  it is to the credit of both men that this trying interview should have been conducted and concluded without heat but knappe must have returned to the adler with darker anticipations  at sunrise on the morning of the 15th the three ships each loaded with its consul put to sea  it is hard to exaggerate the peril of the forenoon that followed as they lay off laulii  nobody desired a collision save perhaps the reckless leary but peace and war trembled in the balance and when the adler at one period lowered her gun ports war appeared to preponderate  it proved however to be a lastand therefore surely an unwiseextremity  knappe contented himself with visiting the rival kings and the three ships returned to apia before noon  beyond a doubt coming after knappes decisive letter of the day before this impotent conclusion shook the credit of germany among the natives of both sides the tamaseses fearing they were deserted the mataafas with secret delight hoping they were feared  and it gave an impetus to that ridiculous business which might have earned for the whole episode the name of the war of flags  british and american flags had been planted the night before and were seen that morning flying over what they claimed about laulii  british and american passengers on the way up and down pointed out from the decks of the warships with generous vagueness the boundaries of problematical estates  ten days later the beach of saluafata bay fluttered as i have told in the last chapter with the flag of germany  the americans riposted with a claim to tamaseses camp some small part of which says knappe did really belong to an american nigger  the disease spread the flags were multiplied the operations of war became an eggdance among miniature neutral territories and though all men took a hand in these proceedings all men in turn were struck with their absurdity  mullan learys successor warned knappe in an emphatic despatch not to squander and discredit the solemnity of that emblem which was all he had to be a defence to his own consulate  and knappe himself in his despatch of march 21st 1889 castigates the practice with much sense  but this was after the tragicomic culmination had been reached and the burnt rags of one of these toofrequently mendacious signals gone on a progress to washington like caesars body arousing indignation where it came  to such results are nations conducted by the patent artifices of a becker  the discussion of the morning the silent menace and defiance of the voyage to laulii might have set the bestnatured by the ears  but knappe and de coetlogon took their difference in excellent part  on the morrow november 16th they sat down together with blacklock in conference  the english consul introduced his colleagues who shook hands  if knappe were deadweighted with the inheritance of becker blacklock was handicapped by reminiscences of leary it is the more to the credit of this inexperienced man that he should have maintained in the future so excellent an attitude of firmness and moderation and that when the crash came knappe and de coetlogon not knappe and blacklock were found to be the protagonists of the drama  the conference was futile  the english and american consuls admitted but one cure of the evils of the time that the farce of the tamasese monarchy should cease it was one which the german refused to consider  and the agents separated without reaching any result save that diplomatic relations had been restored between the states and germany and that all three were convinced of their fundamental differences  knappe and de coetlogon were still friends they had disputed and differed and come within a fingers breadth of war and they were still friends  but an event was at hand which was to separate them for ever on december 4th came the royalist captain hand to relieve the lizard  pelly of course had to take his canvas from the consulate hospital but he had in charge certain awnings belonging to the royalist and with these they made shift to cover the wounded at that time after the fight at laulii more than usually numerous  a lieutenant came to the consulate and delivered as i have received it the following message captain hands compliments and he says you must get rid of these niggers at once and he will help you to do it doubtless the reply was no more civil than the message  the promised help at least followed promptly  a boats crew landed and the awnings were stripped from the wounded hand himself standing on the colonels verandah to direct operations  it were fruitless to discuss this passage from the humanitarian point of view or from that of formal courtesy  the mind of the new captain was plainly not directed to these objects  but it is understood that he considered the existence of a hospital a source of irritation to germans and a fault in policy  his own rude act proved in the result far more impolitic  the hospital had now been open some two months and de coetlogon was still on friendly terms with knappe and he and his wife were engaged to dine with him that day  by the morrow that was practically ended  for the rape of the awnings had two results one which was the fault of de coetlogon not at all of hand who could not have foreseen it the other which it was his duty to have seen and prevented  the first was this the de coetlogons found themselves left with their wounded exposed to the inclemencies of the season they must all be transported into the house and verandah in the distress and pressure of this task the dinner engagement was too long forgotten and a note of excuse did not reach the german consulate before the table was set and knappe dressed to receive his visitors  the second consequence was inevitable  captain hand was scarce landed ere it became public was sofort bekannt writes knappe that he and the consul were in opposition  all that had been gained by the demonstration at laulii was thus immediately cast away de coetlogons prestige was lessened and it must be said plainly that hand did less than nothing to restore it  twice indeed he interfered both times with success and once when his own person had been endangered with vehemence but during all the strange doings i have to narrate he remained in close intimacy with the german consulate and on one occasion may be said to have acted as its marshal  after the worst is over after bismarck has told knappe that the protests of his english colleague were grounded that his own conduct has not been good and that in any dispute which may arise he will find himself in the wrong knappe can still plead in his defence that captain hand has always maintained friendly intercourse with the german authorities  singular epitaph for an english sailor  in this complicity on the part of hand we may find the reasonand i had almost said the excuseof much that was excessive in the bearing of the unfortunate knappe  on the 11th december mataafa received twentyeight thousand cartridges brought into the country in saltbeef kegs by the british ship richmond  this not only sharpened the animosity between whites following so closely on the german fizzle at laulii it raised a convulsion in the camp of tamasese  on the 13th brandeis addressed to knappe his famous and fatal letter  i may not describe it as a letter of burning words but it is plainly dictated by a burning heart  tamasese and his chiefs he announces are now sick of the business and ready to make peace with mataafa  they began the war relying upon german help they now see and say that e faaalo siamani i peritania ma america that germany is subservient to england and the states  it is grimly given to be understood that the despatch is an ultimatum and a last chance is being offered for the recreant ally to fulfil her pledge  to make it more plain the document goes on with a kind of bilious irony the two german warships now in samoa are here for the protection of german property alone and when the olga shall have arrived she arrived on the morrow the german warships will continue to do against the insurgents precisely as little as they have done heretofore  plant flags in fact  here was knappes opportunity could he have stooped to seize it  i find it difficult to blame him that he could not  far from being so inglorious as the treachery once contemplated by becker the acceptance of this ultimatum would have been still in the nature of a disgrace brandeiss letter written by a german was hard to swallow  it would have been hard to accept that solution which knappe had so recently and so peremptorily refused to his brother consuls  and he was tempted on the other hand by recent changes  there was no pelly to support de coetlogon who might now be disregarded  mullan learys successor even if he were not precisely a hand was at least no leary and even if mullan should show fight knappe had now three ships and could defy or sink him without danger  many small circumstances moved him in the same direction  the looting of german plantations continued the whole force of mataafa was to a large extent subsisted from the crops of vailele and armed men were to be seen openly plundering bananas breadfruit and cocoanuts under the walls of the plantation building  on the night of the 13th the consulate stable had been broken into and a horse removed on the 16th there was a riot in apia between halfcastes and sailors from the new ship olga each side claiming that the other was the worse of drink both for a wager justly  the multiplication of flags and little neutral territories had besides begun to irritate the samoans  the protests of german settlers had been received uncivilly  on the 16th the mataafas had again sought to land in saluafata bay with the manifest intention to attack the tamaseses or in other words to trespass on german lands covered as your excellency knows with flags  i quote from his requisition to fritze december 17th  upon all these considerations he goes on it is necessary to bring the fighting to an end  both parties are to be disarmed and returned to their villagesmataafa first  and in case of any attempt upon apia the roads thither are to be held by a strong landingparty  mataafa was to be disarmed first perhaps rightly enough in his character of the last insurgent  then was to have come the turn of tamasese but it does not appear the disarming would have had the same import or have been gone about in the same way  germany was bound to tamasese  no honest man would dream of blaming knappe because he sought to redeem his countrys word  the path he chose was doubtless that of honour so far as honour was still left  but it proved to be the road to ruin  fritze ranking german officer is understood to have opposed the measure  his attitude earned him at the time unpopularity among his countrypeople on the spot and should now redound to his credit  it is to be hoped he extended his opposition to some of the details  if it were possible to disarm mataafa at all it must be done rather by prestige than force  a party of bluejackets landed in samoan bush and expected to hold against samoans a multiplicity of forest paths had their work cut out for them  and it was plain they should be landed in the light of day with a discouraging openness and even with parade  to sneak ashore by night was to increase the danger of resistance and to minimise the authority of the attack  the thing was a bluff and it is impossible to bluff with stealth  yet this was what was tried  a landingparty was to leave the olga in apia bay at two in the morning the landing was to be at four on two parts of the foreshore of vailele at eight they were to be joined by a second landingparty from the eber  by nine the olgas were to be on the crest of letongo mountain and the ebers to be moving round the promontory by the seaward paths with measures of precaution disarming all whom they encountered  there was to be no firing unless fired upon  at the appointed hour or perhaps later on the morning of the 19th this unpromising business was put in hand and there moved off from the olga two boats with some fifty blue jackets between them and a praam or punt containing ninetythe boats and the whole expedition under the command of captainlieutenant jaeckel the praam under lieutenant spengler  the men had each forty rounds one days provisions and their flasks filled  in the meanwhile mataafa sympathisers about apia were on the alert knappe had informed the consuls that the ships were to put to sea next day for the protection of german property but the tamaseses had been less discreet  tomorrow at the hour of seven they had cried to their adversaries you will know of a difficulty and our guns shall be made good in broken bones  an accident had pointed expectation towards apia the wife of le mamea washed for the german shipsa perquisite i suppose for her husbands unwilling fidelity  she sent a man with linen on board the adler where he was surprised to see le mamea in person and to be himself ordered instantly on shore  the news spread  if mamea were brought down from lotoanuu others might have come at the same time tamasese himself and half his army might perhaps lie concealed on board the german ships  and a watch was accordingly set and warriors collected along the line of the shore  one detachment lay in some riflepits by the mouth of the fuisa  they were commanded by seumanu and with his party probably as the most contiguous to apia was the warcorrespondent john klein  of english birth but naturalised american this gentleman had been for some time representing the new york world in a very effective manner always in the front living in the field with the samoans and in all vicissitudes of weather toiling to and fro with his despatches  his wisdom was perhaps not equal to his energy  he made himself conspicuous going about armed to the teeth in a boat under the stars and stripes and on one occasion when he supposed himself fired upon by the tamaseses had the petulance to empty his revolver in the direction of their camp  by the light of the moon which was then nearly down this party observed the olgas two boats and the praam which they described as almost sinking with men the boats keeping well out towards the reef the praam at the moment apparently heading for the shore  an extreme agitation seems to have reigned in the riflepits  what were the newcomers  what was their errand  were they germans or tamaseses  had they a mind to attack  the praam was hailed in samoan and did not answer  it was proposed to fire upon her ere she drew near  and at last whether on his own suggestion or that of seumanu klein hailed her in english and in terms of unnecessary melodrama  do not try to land here he cried  if you do your blood will be upon your head  spengler who had never the least intention to touch at the fuisa put up the head of the praam to her true course and continued to move up the lagoon with an offing of some seventy or eighty yards  along all the irregularities and obstructions of the beach across the mouth of the vaivasa and through the startled village of matafangatele seumanu klein and seven or eight others raced to keep up spreading the alarm and rousing reinforcements as they went presently a man on horseback made his appearance on the opposite beach of fangalii  klein and the natives distinctly saw him signal with a lantern which is the more strange as the horseman captain hufnagel plantation manager of vailele had never a lantern to signal with  the praam kept in  many men in white were seen to stand up step overboard and wade to shore  at the same time the eye of panic descried a breastwork of foreign stone brick upon the beach  samoans are prepared today to swear to its existence i believe conscientiously although no such thing was ever made or ever intended in that place  the hour is doubtful  it was the hour when the streak of dawn is seen the hour known in the warfare of heathen times as the hour of the night attack says the mataafa official account  a native whom i met on the field declared it was at cockcrow  captain hufnagel on the other hand is sure it was long before the day  it was dark at least and the moon down  darkness made the samoans bold uncertainty as to the composition and purpose of the landingparty made them desperate  fire was opened on the germans one of whom was here killed  the germans returned it and effected a lodgment on the beach and the skirmish died again to silence it was at this time if not earlier that klein returned to apia  here then were spengler and the ninety men of the praam landed on the beach in no very enviable posture the woods in front filled with unnumbered enemies but for the time successful  meanwhile jaeckel and the boats had gone outside the reef and were to land on the other side of the vailele promontory at sunga by the buildings of the plantation it was hufnagels part to go and meet them  his way led straight into the woods and through the midst of the samoans who had but now ceased firing  he went in the saddle and at a foots pace feeling speed and concealment to be equally helpless and that if he were to fall at all he had best fall with dignity  not a shot was fired at him no effort made to arrest him on his errand  as he went he spoke and even jested with the samoans and they answered in good part  one fellow was leaping yelling and tossing his axe in the air after the way of an excited islander  faimalosi go it said hufnagel and the fellow laughed and redoubled his exertions  as soon as the boats entered the lagoon fire was again opened from the woods  the fifty bluejackets jumped overboard hove down the boats to be a shield and dragged them towards the landingplace  in this way their rations and what was more unfortunate some of their miserable provision of forty rounds got wetted but the men came to shore and garrisoned the plantation house without a casualty  meanwhile the sound of the firing from sunga immediately renewed the hostilities at fangalii  the civilians on shore decided that spengler must be at once guided to the house and haideln the surveyor accepted the dangerous errand  like hufnagel he was suffered to pass without question through the midst of these platonic enemies  he found spengler some way inland on a knoll disastrously engaged the woods around him filled with samoans who were continuously reinforced  in three successive charges cheering as they ran the blue jackets burst through their scattered opponents and made good their junction with jaeckel  four men only remained upon the field the other wounded being helped by their comrades or dragging themselves painfully along  the force was now concentrated in the house and its immediate patch of garden  their rear to the seaward was unmolested but on three sides they were beleaguered  on the left the samoans occupied and fired from some of the plantation offices  in front a long rising crest of land in the horsepasture commanded the house and was lined with the assailants and on the right the hedge of the same paddock afforded them a dangerous cover  it was in this place that a samoan sharpshooter was knocked over by jaeckel with his own hand  the fire was maintained by the samoans in the usual wasteful style  the roof was made a sieve the balls passed clean through the house lieutenant sieger as he lay already dying on hufnagels bed was despatched with a fresh wound  the samoans showed themselves extremely enterprising pushed their lines forward ventured beyond cover and continually threatened to envelop the garden  thrice at least it was necessary to repel them by a sally  the men were brought into the house from the rear the front doors were thrown suddenly open and the gallant bluejackets issued cheering necessary successful but extremely costly sorties  neither could these be pushed far  the foes were undaunted so soon as the sailors advanced at all deep in the horsepasture the samoans began to close in upon both flanks and the sally had to be recalled  to add to the dangers of the german situation ammunition began to run low and the cartridgeboxes of the wounded and the dead had been already brought into use before at about eight oclock the eber steamed into the bay  her commander wallis threw some shells into letongo one of which killed five men about their cookingpot  the samoans began immediately to withdraw their movements were hastened by a sortie and the remains of the landing party brought on board  this was an unfortunate movement it gave an irremediable air of defeat to what might have been else claimed for a moderate success  the bluejackets numbered a hundred and forty all told they were engaged separately and fought under the worst conditions in the dark and among woods their position in the house was scarce tenable they lost in killed and wounded fiftysixforty per cent and their spirit to the end was above question  whether we think of the poor sailor lads always so pleasantly behaved in times of peace or whether we call to mind the behaviour of the two civilians haideln and hufnagel we can only regret that brave men should stand to be exposed upon so poor a quarrel or lives cast away upon an enterprise so hopeless  news of the affair reached apia early and moors always curious of these spectacles of war was immediately in the saddle  near matafangatele he met a manono chief whom he asked if there were any german dead  i think there are about thirty of them knocked over said he  have you taken their heads asked moors  yes said the chief  some foolish people did it but i have stopped them  we ought not to cut off their heads when they do not cut off ours  he was asked what had been done with the heads  two have gone to mataafa he replied and one is buried right under where your horse is standing in a basket wrapped in tapa  this was afterwards dug up and i am told on native authority that besides the three heads two ears were taken  moors next asked the manono man how he came to be going away  the manofwar is throwing shells said he  when they stopped firing out of the house we stopped firing also so it was as well to scatter when the shells began  we could have killed all the white men  i wish they had been tamaseses this is an ex parte statement and i give it for such but the course of the affair and in particular the adventures of haideln and hufnagel testify to a surprising lack of animosity against the germans  about the same time or but a little earlier than this conversation the same spirit was being displayed  hufnagel with a party of labour had gone out to bring in the german dead when he was surprised to be suddenly fired on from the wood  the boys he had with him were not negritos but polynesians from the gilbert islands and he suddenly remembered that these might be easily mistaken for a detachment of tamaseses  bidding his boys conceal themselves in a thicket this brave man walked into the open  so soon as he was recognised the firing ceased and the labourers followed him in safety  this is chivalrous war but there was a side to it less chivalrous  as moors drew nearer to vailele he began to meet samoans with hats guns and even shirts taken from the german sailors with one of these who had a hat and a gun he stopped and spoke  the hat was handed up for him to look at it had the late owners name on the inside  where is he asked moors  he is dead i cut his head off you shot him  no somebody else shot him in the hip  when i came he put up his hands and cried dont kill me i am a malietoa man  i did not believe him and i cut his head off have you any ammunition to fit that gun  i do not know  what has become of the cartridgebelt  another fellow grabbed that and the cartridges and he wont give them to me  a dreadful and silly picture of barbaric war the words of the german sailor must be regarded as imaginary how was the poor lad to speak native or the samoan to understand german  when moors came as far as sunga the eber was yet in the bay the smoke of battle still lingered among the trees which were themselves marked with a thousand bulletwounds  but the affair was over the combatants german and samoan were all gone and only a couple of negrito labour boys lurked on the scene  the village of letongo beyond was equally silent part of it was wrecked by the shells of the eber and still smoked the inhabitants had fled  on the beach were the native boats perhaps five thousand dollars worth deserted by the mataafas and overlooked by the germans in their common hurry to escape  still moors held eastward by the seapaths  it was his hope to get a view from the other side of the promontory towards laulii  in the way he found a house hidden in the wood and among rocks where an aged and sick woman was being tended by her elderly daughter  last lingerers in that deserted piece of coast they seemed indifferent to the events which had thus left them solitary and as the daughter said did not know where mataafa was nor where tamasese  it is the official samoan pretension that the germans fired first at fangalii  in view of all german and some native testimony the text of fritzes orders and the probabilities of the case no honest mind will believe it for a moment  certainly the samoans fired first  as certainly they were betrayed into the engagement in the agitation of the moment and it was not till afterwards that they understood what they had done  then indeed all samoa drew a breath of wonder and delight  the invincible had fallen the men of the vaunted warships had been met in the field by the braves of mataafa a superstition was no more  conceive this people steadily as schoolboys and conceive the elation in any school if the head boy should suddenly arise and drive the rector from the schoolhouse  i have received one instance of the feeling instantly aroused  there lay at the time in the consular hospital an old chief who was a pet of the colonels  news reached him of the glorious event he was sick he thought himself sinking sent for the colonel and gave him his gun  dont let the germans get it said the old gentleman and having received a promise was at peace     chapter ixfuror consularis   december 1888 to march 1889  knappe in the adler with a flag of truce at the fore was entering laulii bay when the eber brought him the news of the nights reverse his heart was doubtless wrung for his young countrymen who had been butchered and mutilated in the dark woods or now lay suffering and some of them dying on the ship  and he must have been startled as he recognised his own position  he had gone too far he had stumbled into war and what was worse into defeat he had thrown away german lives for less than nothing and now saw himself condemned either to accept defeat or to kick and pummel his failure into something like success either to accept defeat or take frenzy for a counsellor  yesterday in cold blood he had judged it necessary to have the woods to the westward guarded lest the evacuation of laulii should prove only the peril of apia  today in the irritation and alarm of failure he forgot or despised his previous reasoning and though his detachment was beat back to the ships proceeded with the remainder of his maimed design  the only change he made was to haul down the flag of truce  he had now no wish to meet with mataafa  words were out of season shells must speak  at this moment an incident befell him which must have been trying to his selfcommand  the new american ship nipsic entered laulii bay her commander mullan boarded the adler to protest succeeded in wresting from knappe a period of delay in order that the women might be spared and sent a lieutenant to mataafa with a warning  the camp was already excited by the news and the trophies of fangalii  already tamasese and lotoanuu seemed secondary objectives to the germans and apia  mullans message put an end to hesitation  laulii was evacuated  the troops streamed westward by the mountain side and took up the same day a strong position about tanungamanono and mangiangi some two miles behind apia which they threatened with the one hand while with the other they continued to draw their supplies from the devoted plantations of the german firm  laulii when it was shelled was empty  the british flags were of course fired upon and i hear that one of them was struck down but i think every one must be privately of the mind that it was fired upon and fell in a place where it had little business to be shown  such was the military epilogue to the illjudged adventure of fangalii it was difficult for failure to be more complete  but the other consequences were of a darker colour and brought the whites immediately face to face in a spirit of illfavoured animosity  knappe was mourning the defeat and death of his countryfolk he was standing aghast over the ruin of his own career when mullan boarded him  the successor of leary served himself in that bitter moment heir to learys part  and in mullan knappe saw more even than the successor of learyhe saw in him the representative of klein  klein had hailed the praam from the rifle pits he had there uttered illchosen words unhappily prophetic it is even likely that he was present at the time of the first fire  to accuse him of the design and conduct of the whole attack was but a step forward his own vapouring served to corroborate the accusation and it was not long before the german consulate was in possession of sworn native testimony in support  the worth of native testimony is small the worth of white testimony not overwhelming and i am in the painful position of not being able to subscribe either to kleins own account of the affair or to that of his accusers  klein was extremely flurried his interest as a reporter must have tempted him at first to make the most of his share in the exploit the immediate peril in which he soon found himself to stand must have at least suggested to him the idea of minimising it one way and another he is not a good witness  as for the natives they were no doubt crossexamined in that hall of terror the german consulate where they might be trusted to lie like schoolboys or if the reader prefer it like samoans  by outside white testimony it remains established for me that klein returned to apia either before or immediately after the first shots  that he ever sought or was ever allowed a share in the command may be denied peremptorily but it is more than likely that he expressed himself in an excited manner and with a highly inflammatory effect upon his hearers  he was at least severely punished  the germans enraged by his provocative behaviour and what they thought to be his german birth demanded him to be tried before courtmartial he had to skulk inside the sentries of the american consulate to be smuggled on board a warship and to be carried almost by stealth out of the island and what with the agitations of his mind and the results of a marsh fever contracted in the lines of mataafa reached honolulu a very proper object of commiseration  nor was klein the only accused de coetlogon was himself involved  as the boats passed matautu knappe declares a signal was made from the british consulate perhaps we should rather read from its neighbourhood since in the general warding of the coast the point of matautu could scarce have been neglected  on the other hand there is no doubt that the samoans in the anxiety of that night of watching and fighting crowded to the friendly consul for advice  late in the night the wounded siteoni lying on the colonels verandah one corner of which had been blinded down that he might sleep heard the coming and going of bare feet and the voices of eager consultation  and long after a man who had been discharged from the colonels employment took upon himself to swear an affidavit as to the nature of the advice then given and to carry the document to the german consul  it was an act of private revenge it fell long out of date in the good days of dr stuebel and had no result but to discredit the gentleman who volunteered it  colonel de coetlogon had his faults but they did not touch his honour his bare word would always outweigh a waggonload of such denunciations and he declares his behaviour on that night to have been blameless  the question was besides inquired into on the spot by sir john thurston and the colonel honourably acquitted  but during the weeks that were now to follow knappe believed the contrary he believed not only that moors and others had supplied ammunition and klein commanded in the field but that de coetlogon had made the signal of attack that though his bluejackets had bled and fallen against the arms of samoans these were supplied inspired and marshalled by americans and english  the legend was the more easily believed because it embraced and was founded upon so much truth  germans lay dead the german wounded groaned in their cots and the cartridges by which they fell had been sold by an american and brought into the country in a british bottom  had the transaction been entirely mercenary it would already have been hard to swallow but it was notoriously not so  british and americans were notoriously the partisans of mataafa  they rejoiced in the result of fangalii and so far from seeking to conceal their rejoicing paraded and displayed it  calumny ran high  before the dead were buried while the wounded yet lay in pain and fever cowardly accusations of cowardice were levelled at the german bluejackets  it was said they had broken and run before their enemies and that they had huddled helpless like sheep in the plantation house  small wonder if they had small wonder had they been utterly destroyed  but the fact was heroically otherwise and these dastard calumnies cut to the blood  they are not forgotten perhaps they will never be forgiven  in the meanwhile events were pressing towards a still more trenchant opposition  on the 20th the three consuls met and parted without agreement knappe announcing that he had lost men and must take the matter in his own hands to avenge their death  on the 21st the olga came before matafangatele ordered the delivery of all arms within the hour and at the end of that period none being brought shelled and burned the village  the shells fell for the most part innocuous an eyewitness saw children at play beside the flaming houses not a soul was injured and the one noteworthy event was the mutilation of captain hamiltons american flag  in one sense an incident too small to be chronicled in another this was of historic interest and import  these rags of tattered bunting occasioned the display of a new sentiment in the united states and the republic of the west hitherto so apathetic and unwieldy but already stung by german nonchalance leaped to its feet for the first time at the news of this fresh insult  as though to make the inefficiency of the warships more apparent three shells were thrown inland at mangiangi they flew high over the mataafa camp where the natives could hear them singing as they flew and fell behind in the deep romantic valley of the vaisingano  mataafa had been already summoned on board the adler his life promised if he came declared in danger if he came not and he had declined in silence the unattractive invitation  these fresh hostile acts showed him that the worst had come he was in strength his force posted along the whole front of the mountain behind apia matautu occupied the siumu road lined up to the houses of the town with warriors passionate for war  the occasion was unique and there is no doubt that he designed to seize it  the same day of this bombardment he sent word bidding all english and americans wear a black band upon their arm so that his men should recognise and spare them  the hint was taken and the band worn for a continuance of days to have refused would have been insane but to consent was unhappily to feed the resentment of the germans by a fresh sign of intelligence with their enemies and to widen the breach between the races by a fresh and a scarce pardonable mark of their division  the same day again the germans repeated one of their earlier offences by firing on a boat within the harbour  times were changed they were now at war and in peril the rigour of military advantage might well be seized by them and pardoned by others but it so chanced that the bullets flew about the ears of captain hand and that commander is said to have been insatiable of apologies the affair besides had a deplorable effect on the inhabitants  a black band they saw might protect them from the mataafas not from undiscriminating shots  panic ensued  the warships were open to receive the fugitives and the gentlemen who had made merry over fangalii were seen to thrust each other from the wharves in their eagerness to flee apia  i willingly drop the curtain on the shameful picture  meanwhile on the german side of the bay a more manly spirit was exhibited in circumstances of alarming weakness  the plantation managers and overseers had all retreated to matafele only one i understand remaining at his post  the whole german colony was thus collected in one spot and could count and wonder at its scanty numbers  knappe declares to my surprise that the warships could not spare him more than fifty men a day  the great extension of the german quarter he goes on did not allow a full occupation of the outer line hence they had shrunk into the western end by the firm buildings and the inhabitants were warned to fall back on this position in the case of an alert  so that he who had set forth a day or so before to disarm the mataafas in the open field now found his resources scarce adequate to garrison the buildings of the firm  but knappe seemed unteachable by fate  it is probable he thought he had     already waded in so deep    returning were as tedious as go oer  it is certain that he continued on the scene of his defeat and in the midst of his weakness to bluster and menace like a conqueror  active war which he lacked the means of attempting was continually threatened on the 22nd he sought the aid of his brother consuls to maintain the neutral territory against mataafa and at the same time as though meditating instant deeds of prowess refused to be bound by it himself this singular proposition was of course refused blacklock remarking that he had no fear of the natives if these were let alone de coetlogon refusing in the circumstances to recognise any neutral territory at all in vain knappe amended and baited his proposal with the offer of forty eight or ninetysix hours notice according as his objective should be near or within the boundary of the eleele sa  it was rejected and he learned that he must accept war with all its consequencesand not that which he desiredwar with the immunities of peace  this monstrous exigence illustrates the mans frame of mind  it has been still further illuminated in the german whitebook by printing alongside of his despatches those of the unimpassioned fritze  on january 8th the consulate was destroyed by fire  knappe says it was the work of incendiaries without doubt fritze admits that everything seems to show it was an accident  tamaseses people fit to bear arms writes knappe are certainly for the moment equal to mataafas though restrained from battle by the lack of ammunition  as for tamasese says fritze of the same date he is now but a phantomdient er nur als gespenst  his party for practical purposes is no longer large  they pretend ammunition to be lacking but what they lack most is goodwill captain brandeis whose influence is now small declares they can no longer sustain a serious engagement and is himself in the intention of leaving samoa by the lubeck of the 5th february  and knappe in the same despatch confutes himself and confirms the testimony of his naval colleague by the admission that the reestablishment of tamaseses government is under present circumstances not to be thought of plainly then he was not so much seeking to deceive others as he was himself possessed and we must regard the whole series of his acts and despatches as the agitations of a fever  the british steamer richmond returned to apia january 15th  on the last voyage she had brought the ammunition already so frequently referred to as a matter of fact she was again bringing contraband of war  it is necessary to be explicit upon this which served as spark to so great a flame of scandal  knappe was justified in interfering he would have been worthy of all condemnation if he had neglected in his posture of semiinvestment a precaution so elementary and the manner in which he set about attempting it was conciliatory and almost timid  he applied to captain hand and begged him to accept himself the duty of controlling the discharge of the richmonds cargo  hand was unable to move without his consul and at night an armed boat from the germans boarded searched and kept possession of the suspected ship  the next day as by an afterthought war and martial law were proclaimed for the samoan islands the introduction of contraband of war forbidden and ships and boats declared liable to search  all support of the rebels will be punished by martial law continued the proclamation no matter to what nationality the person thater may belong  hand it has been seen declined to act in the matter of the richmond without the concurrence of his consul but i have found no evidence that either hand or knappe communicated with de coetlogon with whom they were both at daggers drawn  first the seizure and next the proclamation seem to have burst on the english consul from a clear sky and he wrote on the same day throwing doubt on knappes authority to declare war  knappe replied on the 20th that the imperial german government had been at war as a matter of fact since december 19th and that it was only for the convenience of the subjects of other states that he had been empowered to make a formal declaration  from that moment he added martial law prevails in samoa  de coetlogon instantly retorted declining martial law for british subjects and announcing a proclamation in that sense instantly again came that astonishing document knappes rejoinder without pause without reflectionthe pens screeching on the paper the messengers you would think running from consulate to consulate i have had the honour to receive your excellencys hochwohlgeboren agreeable communication of today  since on the ground of received instructions martial law has been declared in samoa british subjects as well as others fall under its application  i warn you therefore to abstain from such a proclamation as you announce in your letter  it will be such a piece of business as shall make yourself answerable under martial law besides your proclamation will be disregarded  de coetlogon of course issued his proclamation at once knappe retorted with another and night closed on the first stage of this insane collision  i hear the german consul was on this day prostrated with fever charity at least must suppose him hardly answerable for his language  early on the 21st mr mansfield gallien a passing traveller was seized in his berth on board the richmond and carried halfdressed on board a german warship  his offence was in the circumstances and after the proclamation substantial  he had gone the day before in the spirit of a tourist to mataafas camp had spoken with the king and had even recommended him an appeal to sir george grey  fritze i gather had been long uneasy this arrest on board a british ship fitted the measure doubtless as he had written long before the consul alone was responsible on the legal side but the captain began to ask himself what nexttelegraphed direct home for instructions is arrest of foreigners on foreign vessels legaland was ready at a word from captain hand to discharge his dangerous prisoner  the word in question so the story goes was not without a kind of wit  i wish you would set that man ashore hand is reported to have said indicating gallien i wish you would set that man ashore to save me the trouble  the same day de coetlogon published a proclamation requesting captains to submit to search for contraband of war  on the 22nd the samoa times and south sea advertiser was suppressed by order of fritze  i have hitherto refrained from mentioning the single paper of our islands that i might deal with it once for all  it is of course a tiny sheet but i have often had occasion to wonder at the ability of its articles and almost always at the decency of its tone officials may at times be a little roughly and at times a little captiously criticised private persons are habitually respected and there are many papers in england and still more in the states even of leading organs in chief cities that might envy and would do well to imitate the courtesy and discretion of the samoa times  yet the editor cusack is only an amateur in journalism and a carpenter by trade  his chief fault is one perhaps inevitable in so small a placethat he seems a little in the leading of a clique but his interest in the public weal is genuine and generous  one mans meat is another mans poison anglosaxons and germans have been differently brought up to our galled experience the paper appears moderate to their untried sensations it seems violent  we think a public man fair game we think it a part of his duty and i am told he finds it a part of his reward to be continually canvassed by the press  for the germans on the other hand an official wears a certain sacredness when he is called over the coals they are shocked and if the official be a german feel that germany itself has been insulted  the samoa times had been long a mountain of offence  brandeis had imported from the colonies another printer of the name of jones to deprive cusack of the government printing  german sailors had come ashore one day wild with offended patriotism to punish the editor with stripes and the result was delightfully amusing  the champions asked for the english printer  they were shown the wrong man and the blows intended for cusack had hailed on the shoulders of his rival jones  on the 12th cusack had reprinted an article from a san francisco paper the germans had complained and de coetlogon in a moment of weakness had fined the editor twenty pounds the judgment was afterwards reversed in fiji but even at the time it had not satisfied the germans  and so now on the third day of martial law the paper was suppressed  here we have another of these international obscurities  to fritze the step seemed natural and obvious for anglo saxons it was a hand laid upon the altar and the month was scarce out before the voice of senator frye announced to his colleagues that free speech had been suppressed in samoa  perhaps we must seek some similar explanation for fritzes shortlived code published and withdrawn the next day the 23rd  fritze himself was in no humour for extremities  he was much in the position of a lieutenant who should perceive his captain urging the ship upon the rocks  it is plain he had lost all confidence in his commanding officer upon the legal side and we find him writing home with anxious candour he had understood that martial law implied military possession he was in military possession of nothing but his ship and shrewdly suspected that his martial jurisdiction should be confined within the same limits  as a matter of fact he writes we do not occupy the territory and cannot give foreigners the necessary protection because mataafa and his people can at any moment forcibly interrupt me in my jurisdiction  yet in the eyes of anglosaxons the severity of his code appeared burlesque  i give but three of its provisions  the crime of inciting german troops by any means as for instance informing them of proclamations by the enemy was punishable with death that of publishing or secretly distributing anything whether printed or written bearing on the war with prison or deportation and that of calling or attending a public meeting unless permitted with the same  such were the tender mercies of knappe lurking in the western end of the german quarter where mataafa could at any moment interrupt his jurisdiction  on the 22nd day of the suppression of the times de coetlogon wrote to inquire if hostilities were intended against great britain which knappe on the same day denied  on the 23rd de coetlogon sent a complaint of hostile acts such as the armed and forcible entry of the richmond before the declaration and arrest of gallien  in his reply dated the 24th knappe took occasion to repeat although now with more selfcommand his former threat against de coetlogon  i am still of the opinion he writes that even foreign consuls are liable to the application of martial law if they are guilty of offences against the belligerent state  the same day 24th de coetlogon complained that fletcher manager for messrs macarthur had been summoned by fritze  in answer knappe had the honour to inform your excellency that since the declaration of the state of war british subjects are liable to martial law and mr fletcher will be arrested if he does not appear  here then was the gauntlet thrown down and de coetlogon was burning to accept it  fletchers offence was this  upon the 22nd a steamer had come in from wellington specially chartered to bring german despatches to apia  the rumour came along with her from new zealand that in these despatches knappe would find himself rebuked and fletcher was accused of having interested himself in the spreading of this rumour  his arrest was actually ordered when hand succeeded in persuading him to surrender at the german court the case was dismissed wegen nichtigkeit and the acute stage of these distempers may be said to have ended  blessed are the peacemakers  hand had perhaps averted a collision  what is more certain he had offered to the world a perfectly original reading of the part of british seaman  hand may have averted a collision i say but i am tempted to believe otherwise  i am tempted to believe the threat to arrest fletcher was the last mutter of the declining tempest and a mere sop to knappes selfrespect  i am tempted to believe the rumour in question was substantially correct and the steamer from wellington had really brought the german consul grounds for hesitation if not orders to retreat  i believe the unhappy man to have awakened from a dream and to have read ominous writing on the wall  an enthusiastic popularity surrounded him among the germans  it was natural  consul and colony had passed through an hour of serious peril and the consul had set the example of undaunted courage  he was entertained at dinner  fritze who was known to have secretly opposed him was scorned and avoided  but the clerks of the german firm were one thing prince bismarck was another and on a cold review of these events it is not improbable that knappe may have envied the position of his naval colleague  it is certain at least that he set himself to shuffle and capitulate and when the blow fell he was able to reply that the martial law business had in the meanwhile come right that the english and american consular courts stood open for ordinary cases and that in different conversations with captain hand who has always maintained friendly intercourse with the german authorities it had been repeatedly explained that only the supply of weapons and ammunition or similar aid and support was to come under german martial law  was it weapons or ammunition that fletcher had supplied  but it is unfair to criticise these wrigglings of an unfortunate in a false position  in a despatch of the 23rd which has not been printed knappe had told his story how he had declared war subjected foreigners to martial law and been received with a counterproclamation by the english consul and how in an interview with mataafa chiefs at the plantation house of motuotua of which i cannot find the date he had demanded the cession of arms and of ringleaders for punishment and proposed to assume the government of the islands  on february 12th he received bismarcks answer you had no right to take foreigners from the jurisdiction of their consuls  the protest of your english colleague is grounded  in disputes which may arise from this cause you will find yourself in the wrong  the demand formulated by you as to the assumption of the government of samoa by germany lay outside of your instructions and of our design  take it immediately back  if your telegram is here rightly understood i cannot call your conduct good  it must be a hard heart that does not sympathise with knappe in the hour when he received this document  yet it may be said that his troubles were still in the beginning  men had contended against him and he had not prevailed he was now to be at war with the elements and find his name identified with an immense disaster  one more date however must be given first  it was on february 27th that fritze formally announced martial law to be suspended and himself to have relinquished the control of the police     chapter xthe hurricane   march 1889  the socalled harbour of apia is formed in part by a recess of the coast line at matautu in part by the slim peninsula of mulinuu and in part by the fresh waters of the mulivai and vaisingano  the barrier reefthat singular breakwater that makes so much of the circuit of pacific islandsis carried far to sea at matautu and mulinuu inside of these two horns it runs sharply landward and between them it is burst or dissolved by the fresh water  the shape of the enclosed anchorage may be compared to a highshouldered jar or bottle with a funnel mouth  its sides are almost everywhere of coral for the reef not only bounds it to seaward and forms the neck and mouth but skirting about the beach it forms the bottom also  as in the bottle of commerce the bottom is re entrant and the shorereef runs prominently forth into the basin and makes a dangerous cape opposite the fairway of the entrance  danger is therefore on all hands  the entrance gapes three cables wide at the narrowest and the formidable surf of the pacific thunders both outside and in  there are days when speech is difficult in the chambers of shore side houses days when no boat can land and when men are broken by stroke of sea against the wharves  as i write these words three miles in the mountains and with the landbreeze still blowing from the island summit the sound of that vexed harbour hums in my ears  such a creek in my native coast of scotland would scarce be dignified with the mark of an anchor in the chart but in the favoured climate of samoa and with the mechanical regularity of the winds in the pacific it forms for ten or eleven months out of the twelve a safe if hardly a commodious port  the illfound island traders ride there with their insufficient moorings the year through and discharge and are loaded without apprehension  of danger when it comes the glass gives timely warning and that any modern warship furnished with the power of steam should have been lost in apia belongs not so much to nautical as to political history  the weather throughout all that winter the turbulent summer of the islands was unusually fine and the circumstance had been commented on as providential when so many samoans were lying on their weapons in the bush  by february it began to break in occasional gales  on february 10th a german brigantine was driven ashore  on the 14th the same misfortune befell an american brigantine and a schooner  on both these days and again on the 7th march the menofwar must steam to their anchors  and it was in this last month the most dangerous of the twelve that mans animosities crowded that indentation of the reef with costly populous and vulnerable ships  i have shown perhaps already at too great a length how violently passion ran upon the spot how high this series of blunders and mishaps had heated the resentment of the germans against all other nationalities and of all other nationalities against the germans  but there was one country beyond the borders of samoa where the question had aroused a scarce less angry sentiment  the breach of the washington congress the evidence of sewall before a subcommittee on foreign relations the proposal to try klein before a military court and the rags of captain hamiltons flag had combined to stir the people of the states to an unwonted fervour  germany was for the time the abhorred of nations germans in america publicly disowned the country of their birth  in honolulu so near the scene of action german and american young men fell to blows in the street  in the same city from no traceable source and upon no possible authority there arose a rumour of tragic news to arrive by the next occasion that the nipsic had opened fire on the adler and the adler had sunk her on the first reply  punctually on the day appointed the news came and the two nations instead of being plunged into war could only mingle tears over the loss of heroes  by the second week in march three american ships were in apia baythe nipsic the vandalia and the trenton carrying the flag of rear admiral kimberley three germanthe adler the eber and the olga and one britishthe calliope captain kane  six merchant men ranging from twentyfive up to five hundred tons and a number of small craft further encumbered the anchorage  its capacity is estimated by captain kane at four large ships and the latest arrivals the vandalia and trenton were in consequence excluded and lay without in the passage  of the seven warships the seaworthiness of two was questionable the trentons from an original defect in her construction often reported never remediedher hawsepipes leading in on the berthdeck the ebers from an injury to her screw in the blow of february 14th  in this overcrowding of ships in an open entry of the reef even the eye of the landsman could spy danger and captainlieutenant wallis of the eber openly blamed and lamented not many hours before the catastrophe their helpless posture  temper once more triumphed  the army of mataafa still hung imminent behind the town the german quarter was still daily garrisoned with fifty sailors from the squadron what was yet more influential germany and the states at least in apia bay were on the brink of war viewed each other with looks of hatred and scarce observed the letter of civility  on the day of the admirals arrival knappe failed to call on him and on the morrow called on him while he was on shore  the slight was remarked and resented and the two squadrons clung more obstinately to their dangerous station  on the 15th the barometer fell to 2911 in by 2 pm  this was the moment when every sail in port should have escaped  kimberley who flew the only broad pennant should certainly have led the way he clung instead to his moorings and the germans doggedly followed his example semibelligerents daring each other and the violence of heaven  kane less immediately involved was led in error by the report of residents and a fallacious rise in the glass he stayed with the others a misjudgment that was like to cost him dear  all were moored as is the custom in apia with two anchors practically east and west clear hawse to the north and a kedge astern  topmasts were struck and the ships made snug  the night closed black with sheets of rain  by midnight it blew a gale and by the morning watch a tempest  through what remained of darkness the captains impatiently expected day doubtful if they were dragging steaming gingerly to their moorings and afraid to steam too much  day came about six and presented to those on shore a seizing and terrific spectacle  in the pressure of the squalls the bay was obscured as if by midnight but between them a great part of it was clearly if darkly visible amid driving mist and rain  the wind blew into the harbour mouth  naval authorities describe it as of hurricane force  it had however few or none of the effects on shore suggested by that ominous word and was successfully withstood by trees and buildings  the agitation of the sea on the other hand surpassed experience and description  seas that might have awakened surprise and terror in the midst of the atlantic ranged bodily and it seemed to observers almost without diminution into the belly of that flaskshaped harbour and the warships were alternately buried from view in the trough or seen standing on end against the breast of billows  the trenton at daylight still maintained her position in the neck of the bottle  but five of the remaining ships tossed already close to the bottom in a perilous and helpless crowd threatening ruin to each other as they tossed threatened with a common and imminent destruction on the reefs  three had been already in collision the olga was injured in the quarter the adler had lost her bowsprit the nipsic had lost her smokestack and was making steam with difficulty maintaining her fire with barrels of pork and the smoke and sparks pouring along the level of the deck  for the seventh warship the day had come too late the eber had finished her last cruise she was to be seen no more save by the eyes of divers  a coral reef is not only an instrument of destruction but a place of sepulchre the submarine cliff is profoundly undercut and presents the mouth of a huge antre in which the bodies of men and the hulls of ships are alike hurled down and buried  the eber had dragged anchors with the rest her injured screw disabled her from steaming vigorously up and a little before day she had struck the front of the coral come off struck again and gone down stern foremost oversetting as she went into the gaping hollow of the reef  of her whole complement of nearly eighty four souls were cast alive on the beach and the bodies of the remainder were by the voluminous outpouring of the flooded streams scoured at last from the harbour and strewed naked on the seaboard of the island  five ships were immediately menaced with the same destruction  the eber vanishedthe four poor survivors on shoreread a dreadful commentary on their danger which was swelled out of all proportion by the violence of their own movements as they leaped and fell among the billows  by seven the nipsic was so fortunate as to avoid the reef and beach upon a space of sand where she was immediately deserted by her crew with the assistance of samoans not without loss of life  by about eight it was the turn of the adler  she was close down upon the reef doomed herself it might yet be possible to save a portion of her crew and for this end captain fritze placed his reliance on the very hugeness of the seas that threatened him  the moment was watched for with the anxiety of despair but the coolness of disciplined courage  as she rose on the fatal wave her moorings were simultaneously slipped she broached to in rising and the sea heaved her bodily upward and cast her down with a concussion on the summit of the reef where she lay on her beamends her back broken buried in breaching seas but safe  conceive a table the eber in the darkness had been smashed against the rim and flung below the adler cast free in the nick of opportunity had been thrown upon the top  many were injured in the concussion many tossed into the water twenty perished  the survivors crept again on board their ship as it now lay and as it still remains keel to the waves a monument of the seas potency  in still weather under a cloudless sky in those seasons when that illnamed ocean the pacific suffers its vexed shores to rest she lies high and dry the spray scarce touching herthe hugest structure of mans hands within a circuit of a thousand milestossed up there like a schoolboys cap upon a shelf broken like an egg a thing to dream of  the unfriendly consuls of germany and britain were both that morning in matautu and both displayed their nobler qualities  de coetlogon the grim old soldier collected his family and kneeled with them in an agony of prayer for those exposed  knappe more fortunate in that he was called to a more active service must upon the striking of the adler pass to his own consulate  from this he was divided by the vaisingano now a raging torrent impetuously charioting the trunks of trees  a kelpie might have dreaded to attempt the passage we may conceive this brave but unfortunate and now ruined man to have found a natural joy in the exposure of his life and twice that day coming and going he braved the fury of the river  it was possible in spite of the darkness of the hurricane and the continual breaching of the seas to remark human movements on the adler and by the help of samoans always nobly forward in the work whether for friend or enemy knappe sought long to get a line conveyed from shore and was for long defeated  the shore guard of fifty men stood to their arms the while upon the beach useless themselves and a great deterrent of samoan usefulness  it was perhaps impossible that this mistake should be avoided  what more natural to the mind of a european than that the mataafas should fall upon the germans in this hour of their disadvantage  but they had no other thought than to assist and those who now rallied beside knappe braved as they supposed in doing so a double danger from the fury of the sea and the weapons of their enemies  about nine a quartermaster swam ashore and reported all the officers and some sixty men alive but in pitiable case some with broken limbs others insensible from the drenching of the breakers  later in the forenoon certain valorous samoans succeeded in reaching the wreck and returning with a line but it was speedily broken and all subsequent attempts proved unavailing the strongest adventurers being cast back again by the bursting seas thenceforth all through that day and night the deafened survivors must continue to endure their martyrdom and one officer died it was supposed from agony of mind in his inverted cabin  three ships still hung on the next margin of destruction steaming desperately to their moorings dashed helplessly together  the calliope was the nearest in she had the vandalia close on her port side and a little ahead the olga close astarboard the reef under her heel and steaming and veering on her cables the unhappy ship fenced with her three dangers  about a quarter to nine she carried away the vandalias quarter gallery with her jibboom a moment later the olga had near rammed her from the other side  by nine the vandalia dropped down on her too fast to be avoided and clapped her stern under the bowsprit of the english ship the fastenings of which were burst asunder as she rose  to avoid cutting her down it was necessary for the calliope to stop and even to reverse her engines and her rudder was at the momentor it seemed so to the eyes of those on boardwithin ten feet of the reef  between the vandalia and the reef writes kane in his excellent report it was destruction  to repeat fritzes manoeuvre with the adler was impossible the calliope was too heavy  the one possibility of escape was to go out  if the engines should stand if they should have power to drive the ship against wind and sea if she should answer the helm if the wheel rudder and gear should hold out and if they were favoured with a clear blink of weather in which to see and avoid the outer reefthere and there only were safety  upon this catalogue of ifs kane staked his all  he signalled to the engineer for every pound of steamand at that moment i am told much of the machinery was already redhot  the ship was sheered well to starboard of the vandalia the last remaining cable slipped  for a timeand there was no onlooker so coldblooded as to offer a guess at its durationthe calliope lay stationary then gradually drew ahead  the highest speed claimed for her that day is of one seamile an hour  the question of times and seasons throughout all this roaring business is obscured by a dozen contradictions i have but chosen what appeared to be the most consistent but if i am to pay any attention to the time named by admiral kimberley the calliope in this first stage of her escape must have taken more than two hours to cover less than four cables  as she thus crept seaward she buried bow and stem alternately under the billows  in the fairway of the entrance the flagship trenton still held on  her rudder was broken her wheel carried away within she was flooded with water from the peccant hawsepipes she had just made the signal fires extinguished and lay helpless awaiting the inevitable end  between this melancholy hulk and the external reef kane must find a path steering within fifty yards of the reef for which she was actually headed and her foreyard passing on the other hand over the trentons quarter as she rolled the calliope sheered between the rival dangers came to the wind triumphantly and was once more pointed for the sea and safety  not often in naval history was there a moment of more sickening peril and it was dignified by one of those incidents that reconcile the chronicler with his otherwise abhorrent task  from the doomed flagship the americans hailed the success of the english with a cheer  it was led by the old admiral in person rang out over the storm with holiday vigour and was answered by the calliopes with an emotion easily conceived  this ship of their kinsfolk was almost the last external object seen from the calliope for hours immediately after the mists closed about her till the morrow  she was safe at sea againuna de multiswith a damaged foreyard and a loss of all the ornamental work about her bow and stern three anchors one kedgeanchor fourteen lengths of chain four boats the jibboom bobstay and bands and fastenings of the bowsprit  shortly after kane had slipped his cable captain schoonmaker despairing of the vandalia succeeded in passing astern of the olga in the hope to beach his ship beside the nipsic  at a quarter to eleven her stern took the reef her hand swung to starboard and she began to fill and settle  many lives of brave men were sacrificed in the attempt to get a line ashore the captain exhausted by his exertions was swept from deck by a sea and the rail being soon awash the survivors took refuge in the tops  out of thirteen that had lain there the day before there were now but two ships afloat in apia harbour and one of these was doomed to be the bane of the other  about 3 pm the trenton parted one cable and shortly after a second  it was sought to keep her head to wind with stormsails and by the ingenious expedient of filling the rigging with seamen but in the fury of the gale and in that sea perturbed alike by the gigantic billows and the volleying discharges of the rivers the rudderless ship drove down stern foremost into the inner basin ranging plunging and striking like a frightened horse drifting on destruction for herself and bringing it to others  twice the olga still well under command avoided her impact by the skilful use of helm and engines but about four the vigilance of the germans was deceived and the ships collided the olga cutting into the trentons quarters first from one side then from the other and losing at the same time two of her own cables  captain von ehrhardt instantly slipped the remainder of his moorings and setting fore and aft canvas and going full steam ahead succeeded in beaching his ship in matautu whither knappe recalled by this new disaster had returned  the berth was perhaps the best in the harbour and von ehrhardt signalled that ship and crew were in security  the trenton guided apparently by an undertow or eddy from the discharge of the vaisingano followed in the course of the nipsic and vandalia and skirted southeastward along the front of the shore reef which her keel was at times almost touching  hitherto she had brought disaster to her foes now she was bringing it to friends  she had already proved the ruin of the olga the one ship that had rid out the hurricane in safety now she beheld across her course the submerged vandalia the tops filled with exhausted seamen  happily the approach of the trenton was gradual and the time employed to advantage  rockets and lines were thrown into the tops of the friendly wreck the approach of danger was transformed into a means of safety and before the ships struck the men from the vandalias main and mizzen masts which went immediately by the board in the collision were already mustered on the trentons decks  those from the foremast were next rescued and the flagship settled gradually into a position alongside her neighbour against which she beat all night with violence  out of the crew of the vandalia fortythree had perished of the four hundred and fifty on board the trenton only one  the night of the 16th was still notable for a howling tempest and extraordinary floods of rain  it was feared the wreck could scarce continue to endure the breaching of the seas among the germans the fate of those on board the adler awoke keen anxiety and knappe on the beach of matautu and the other officers of his consulate on that of matafele watched all night  the morning of the 17th displayed a scene of devastation rarely equalled the adler high and dry the olga and nipsic beached the trenton partly piled on the vandalia and herself sunk to the gundeck no sail afloat and the beach heaped high with the debris of ships and the wreck of mountain forests  already before the day seumanu the chief of apia had gallantly ventured forth by boat through the subsiding fury of the seas and had succeeded in communicating with the admiral already or as soon after as the dawn permitted rescue lines were rigged and the survivors were with difficulty and danger begun to be brought to shore  and soon the cheerful spirit of the admiral added a new feature to the scene surrounded as he was by the crews of two wrecked ships he paraded the band of the trenton and the bay was suddenly enlivened with the strains of hail columbia  during a great part of the day the work of rescue was continued with many instances of courage and devotion and for a long time succeeding the almost inexhaustible harvest of the beach was to be reaped  in the first employment the samoans earned the gratitude of friend and foe in the second they surprised all by an unexpected virtue that of honesty the greatness of the disaster and the magnitude of the treasure now rolling at their feet may perhaps have roused in their bosoms an emotion too serious for the rule of greed or perhaps that greed was for the moment satiated  sails that twelve strong samoans could scarce drag from the water great guns one of which was rolled by the sea on the body of a man the only native slain in all the hurricane an infinite wealth of rope and wood of tools and weapons tossed upon the beach  yet i have never heard that much was stolen and beyond question much was very honestly returned  on both accounts for the saving of life and the restoration of property the government of the united states showed themselves generous in reward  a fine boat was fitly presented to seumanu and rings watches and money were lavished on all who had assisted  the germans also gave money at the rate as i receive the tale of three dollars a head for every german saved  the obligation was in this instance incommensurably deep those with whom they were at war had saved the german bluejackets at the venture of their lives knappe was besides far from ungenerous and i can only explain the niggard figure by supposing it was paid from his own pocket  in one case at least it was refused  i have saved three germans said the rescuer i will make you a present of the three  the crews of the american and german squadrons were now cast still in a bellicose temper together on the beach  the discipline of the americans was notoriously loose the crew of the nipsic had earned a character for lawlessness in other ports and recourse was had to stringent and indeed extraordinary measures  the town was divided in two camps to which the different nationalities were confined  kimberley had his quarter sentinelled and patrolled  any seaman disregarding a challenge was to be shot dead any tavernkeeper who sold spirits to an american sailor was to have his tavern broken and his stock destroyed  many of the publicans were german and knappe having narrated these rigorous but necessary dispositions wonders grinning to himself over his despatch how far these americans will go in their assumption of jurisdiction over germans  such as they were the measures were successful  the incongruous mass of castaways was kept in peace and at last shipped in peace out of the islands  kane returned to apia on the 19th to find the calliope the sole survivor of thirteen sail  he thanked his men and in particular the engineers in a speech of unusual feeling and beauty of which one who was present remarked to another as they left the ship this has been a means of grace  nor did he forget to thank and compliment the admiral and i cannot deny myself the pleasure of transcribing from kimberleys reply some generous and engaging words  my dear captain he wrote your kind note received  you went out splendidly and we all felt from our hearts for you and our cheers came with sincerity and admiration for the able manner in which you handled your ship  we could not have been gladder if it had been one of our ships for in a time like that i can truly say with old admiral josiah latnall that blood is thicker than water  one more trait will serve to build up the image of this typical seaofficer  a tiny schooner the equator captain edwin reid dear to myself from the memories of a six months cruise lived out upon the high seas the fury of that tempest which had piled with wrecks the harbour of apia found a refuge in pangopango and arrived at last in the desolated port with a welcome and lucrative cargo of pigs  the admiral was glad to have the pigs but what most delighted the mans noble and childish soul was to see once more afloat the colours of his country  thus in what seemed the very article of war and within the duration of a single day the swordarm of each of the two angry powers was broken their formidable ships reduced to junk their disciplined hundreds to a horde of castaways fed with difficulty and the fear of whose misconduct marred the sleep of their commanders  both paused aghast both had time to recognise that not the whole samoan archipelago was worth the loss in men and costly ships already suffered  the socalled hurricane of march 16th made thus a marking epoch in worldhistory directly and at once it brought about the congress and treaty of berlin indirectly and by a process still continuing it founded the modern navy of the states coming years and other historians will declare the influence of that     chapter xilaupepa and mataafa   18891892  with the hurricane the broken warships and the stranded sailors i am at an end of violence and my tale flows henceforth among carpet incidents  the bluejackets on apia beach were still jealously held apart by sentries when the powers at home were already seeking a peaceable solution  it was agreed so far as might be to obliterate two years of blundering and to resume in 1889 and at berlin those negotiations which had been so unhappily broken off at washington in 1887  the example thus offered by germany is rare in history in the career of prince bismarck so far as i am instructed it should stand unique  on a review of these two years of blundering bullying and failure in a little isle of the pacific he seems magnanimously to have owned his policy was in the wrong  he left fangalii unexpiated suffered that house of cards the tamasese government to fall by its own frailty and without remark or lamentation left the samoan question openly and fairly to the conference and in the meanwhile to allay the local heats engendered by becker and knappe he sent to apia that invaluable public servant dr stuebel  i should be a dishonest man if i did not bear testimony to the loyalty since shown by germans in samoa  their position was painful they had talked big in the old days now they had to sing small  even stuebel returned to the islands under the prejudice of an unfortunate record  to the minds of the samoans his name represented the beginning of their sorrows and in his first term of office he had unquestionably driven hard  the greater his merit in the surprising success of the second  so long as he stayed the current of affairs moved smoothly he left behind him on his departure all men at peace and whether by fortune or for the want of that wise hand of guidance he was scarce gone before the clouds began to gather once more on our horizon  before the first convention germany and the states hauled down their flags  it was so done again before the second and germany by a still more emphatic step of retrogression returned the exile laupepa to his native shores  for two years the unfortunate man had trembled and suffered in the cameroons in germany in the rainy marshalls  when he left september 1887 tamasese was king served by five iron warships his right to rule like a dogma of the church was placed outside dispute the germans were still as they were called at that last tearful interview in the house by the river the invincible strangers the thought of resistance far less the hope of success had not yet dawned on the samoan mind  he returned november 1889 to a changed world  the tupua party was reduced to sue for peace brandeis was withdrawn tamasese was dying obscurely of a broken heart the german flag no longer waved over the capital and over all the islands one figure stood supreme  during laupepas absence this man had succeeded him in all his honours and titles in tenfold more than all his power and popularity  he was the idol of the whole nation but the rump of the tamaseses and of these he was already the secret admiration  in his position there was but one weak pointthat he had even been tacitly excluded by the germans  becker indeed once coquetted with the thought of patronising him but the project had no sequel and it stands alone  in every other juncture of history the german attitude has been the same  choose whom you will to be king when he has failed choose whom you please to succeed him when the second fails also replace the first upon the one condition that mataafa be excluded  pourvu quil sache signeran official is said to have thus summed up the qualifications necessary in a samoan king  and it was perhaps feared that mataafa could do no more and might not always do so much  but this original diffidence was heightened by late events to something verging upon animosity  fangalii was unavenged the arms of mataafa were     nondum inexpiatis uncta cruoribus    still soiled with the unexpiated blood  of german sailors and though the chief was not present in the field nor could have heard of the affair till it was over he had reaped from it credit with his countrymen and dislike from the germans  i may not say that trouble was hoped  i must sayif it were not feared the practice of diplomacy must teach a very hopeful view of human nature mataafa and laupepa by the sudden repatriation of the last found themselves face to face in conditions of exasperating rivalry  the one returned from the dead of exile to find himself replaced and excelled the other at the end of a long anxious and successful struggle beheld his only possible competitor resuscitated from the grave  the qualities of both in this difficult moment shone out nobly  i feel i seem always less than partial to the lovable laupepa his virtues are perhaps not those which chiefly please me and are certainly not royal but he found on his return an opportunity to display the admirable sweetness of his nature  the two entered into a competition of generosity for which i can recall no parallel in history each waiving the throne for himself each pressing it upon his rival and they embraced at last a compromise the terms of which seem to have been always obscure and are now disputed laupepa at least resumed his style of king of samoa mataafa retained much of the conduct of affairs and continued to receive much of the attendance and respect befitting royalty and the two malietoas with so many causes of disunion dwelt and met together in the same town like kinsmen  it was so that i first saw them so in a house set about with sentriesfor there was still a haunting fear of germanythat i heard them relate their various experience in the past heard laupepa tell with touching candour of the sorrows of his exile and mataafa with mirthful simplicity of his resources and anxieties in the war  the relation was perhaps too beautiful to last it was perhaps impossible but the titular king should grow at last uneasily conscious of the maire de palais at his side or the kingmaker be at last offended by some shadow of distrust or assumption in his creature  i repeat the words kingmaker and creature it is so that mataafa himself conceives of their relation surely not without justice for had he not contended and prevailed and been helped by the folly of consuls and the fury of the storm laupepa must have died in exile  foreigners in these islands know little of the course of native intrigue partly the samoans cannot explain partly they will not tell  ask how much a master can follow of the puerile politics in any school so much and no more we may understand of the events which surround and menace us with their results  the missions may perhaps have been to blame missionaries are perhaps apt to meddle overmuch outside their discipline it is a fault which should be judged with mercy the problem is sometimes so insidiously presented that even a moderate and able man is betrayed beyond his own intention and the missionary in such a land as samoa is something else besides a minister of mere religion he represents civilisation he is condemned to be an organ of reform he could scarce evade even if he desired a certain influence in political affairs  and it is believed besides by those who fancy they know that the effective force of division between mataafa and laupepa came from the natives rather than from whites  before the end of 1890 at least it began to be rumoured that there was dispeace between the two malietoas and doubtless this had an unsettling influence throughout the islands  but there was another ingredient of anxiety  the berlin convention had long closed its sittings the text of the act had been long in our hands commissioners were announced to right the wrongs of the land question and two high officials a chief justice and a president to guide policy and administer law in samoa  their coming was expected with an impatience with a childishness of trust that can hardly be exaggerated months passed these angeldeliverers still delayed to arrive and the impatience of the natives became changed to an ominous irritation  they have had much experience of being deceived and they began to think they were deceived again  a sudden crop of superstitious stories buzzed about the islands  rivers had come down red unknown fishes had been taken on the reef and found to be marked with menacing runes a headless lizard crawled among chiefs in council the gods of upolu and savaii made war by night they swam the straits to battle and defaced by dreadful wounds they had besieged the house of a medical missionary  readers will remember the portents in mediaeval chronicles or those in julius caesar when     fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds    in ranks and squadrons  and doubtless such fabrications are in simple societies a natural expression of discontent and those who forge and even those who spread them work towards a conscious purpose  early in january 1891 this period of expectancy was brought to an end by the arrival of conrad cedarcrantz chief justice of samoa  the event was hailed with acclamation and there was much about the new official to increase the hopes already entertained  he was seen to be a man of culture and ability in public of an excellent presencein private of a most engaging cordiality  but there was one point i scarce know whether to say of his character or policy which immediately and disastrously affected public feeling in the islands  he had an aversion part judicial part perhaps constitutional to haste and he announced that until he should have well satisfied his own mind he should do nothing that he would rather delay all than do aught amiss  it was impossible to hear this without academical approval impossible to hear it without practical alarm  the natives desired to see activity they desired to see many fair speeches taken on a body of deeds and works of benefit  fired by the event of the war filled with impossible hopes they might have welcomed in that hour a ruler of the stamp of brandeis breathing hurry perhaps dealing blows  and the chief justice unconscious of the fleeting opportunity ripened his opinions deliberately in mulinuu and had been already the better part of half a year in the islands before he went through the form of opening his court the curtain had risen there was no play  a reaction a chill sense of disappointment passed about the island and intrigue one moment suspended was resumed  in the berlin act the three powers recognise on the threshold the independence of the samoan government and the free right of the natives to elect their chief or king and choose their form of government  true the text continues that in view of the difficulties that surround an election in the present disordered condition of the government malietoa laupepa shall be recognised as king unless the three powers shall by common accord otherwise declare  but perhaps few natives have followed it so far and even those who have were possibly all cast abroad again by the next clause and his successor shall be duly elected according to the laws and customs of samoa  the right to elect freely given in one sentence was suspended in the next and a line or so further on appeared to be reconveyed by a sidewind  the reason offered for suspension was ludicrously false in may 1889 when sir edward malet moved the matter in the conference the election of mataafa was not only certain to have been peaceful it could not have been opposed and behind the english puppet it was easy to suspect the hand of germany  no one is more swift to smell trickery than a samoan and the thought that under the long bland benevolent sentences of the berlin act some trickery lay lurking filled him with the breath of opposition  laupepa seems never to have been a popular king  mataafa on the other hand holds an unrivalled position in the eyes of his fellowcountrymen he was the hero of the war he had lain with them in the bush he had borne the heat and burthen of the day they began to claim that he should enjoy more largely the fruits of victory his exclusion was believed to be a stroke of german vengeance his elevation to the kingship was looked for as the fitting crown and copestone of the samoan triumph and but a little after the coming of the chief justice an ominous cry for mataafa began to arise in the islands  it is difficult to see what that official could have done but what he did  he was loyal as in duty bound to the treaty and to laupepa and when the orators of the important and unruly islet of manono demanded to his face a change of kings he had no choice but to refuse them and his reproof being unheeded to suspend the meeting  whether by any neglect of his own or the mere force of circumstance he failed however to secure the sympathy failed even to gain the confidence of mataafa  the latter is not without a sense of his own abilities or of the great service he has rendered to his native land  he felt himself neglected at the very moment when the cry for his elevation rang throughout the group he thought himself made little of on mulinuu and he began to weary of his part  in this humour he was exposed to a temptation which i must try to explain as best i may be able to europeans  the bestowal of the great name malietoa is in the power of the district of malie some seven miles to the westward of apia  the most noisy and conspicuous supporters of that party are the inhabitants of manono  hence in the elaborate allusive oratory of samoa malie is always referred to by the name of pule authority as having the power of the name and manono by that of ainga clan sept or household as forming the immediate family of the chief  but these though so important are only small communities and perhaps the chief numerical force of the malietoas inhabits the island of savaii  savaii has no royal name to bestow all the five being in the gift of different districts of upolu but she has the weight of numbers and in these latter days has acquired a certain force by the preponderance in her councils of a single man the orator lauati  the reader will now understand the peculiar significance of a deputation which should embrace lauati and the orators of both malie and manono how it would represent all that is most effective on the malietoa side and all that is most considerable in samoan politics except the opposite feudal party of the tupua  and in the temptation brought to bear on mataafa even the tupua was conjoined  tamasese was dead  his followers had conceived a not unnatural aversion to all germans from which only the loyal brandeis is excepted and a not unnatural admiration for their late successful adversary  men of his own blood and clan men whom he had fought in the field whom he had driven from matautu who had smitten him back time and again from before the rustic bulwarks of lotoanuu they approached him hand in hand with their ancestral enemies and concurred in the same prayer  the treaty they argued was not carried out  the right to elect their king had been granted them or if that were denied or suspended then the right to elect his successor they were dissatisfied with laupepa and claimed according to the laws and customs of samoa duly to appoint another  the orators of malie declared with irritation that their second appointment was alone valid and mataafa the sole malietoa the whole body of malcontents named him as their choice for king and they requested him in consequence to leave apia and take up his dwelling in malie the nameplace of malietoa a step which may be described to european ears as placing before the country his candidacy for the crown  i do not know when the proposal was first made  doubtless the disaffection grew slowly every trifle adding to its force doubtless there lingered for long a willingness to give the new government a trial the chief justice at least had been nearly five months in the country and the president baron senfft von pilsach rather more than a month before the mine was sprung  on may 31 1891 the house of mataafa was found empty he and his chiefs had vanished from apia and what was worse three prisoners liberated from the gaol had accompanied them in their secession two being political offenders and the third accused of murder having been perhaps set free by accident  although the step had been discussed in certain quarters it took all men by surprise  the inhabitants at large expected instant war  the officials awakened from a dream to recognise the value of that which they had lost  mataafa at vaiala where he was the pledge of peace had perhaps not always been deemed worthy of particular attention mataafa at malie was seen twelve hours too late to be an altogether different quantity  with excess of zeal on the other side the officials trooped to their boats and proceeded almost in a body to malie where they seem to have employed every artifice of flattery and every resource of eloquence upon the fugitive high chief  these courtesies perhaps excessive in themselves had the unpardonable fault of being offered when too late  mataafa showed himself facile on small issues inflexible on the main he restored the prisoners he returned with the consuls to apia on a flying visit he gave his word that peace should be preserveda pledge in which perhaps no one believed at the moment but which he has since nobly redeemed  on the rest he was immovable he had cast the die he had declared his candidacy he had gone to malie  thither after his visit to apia he returned again there he has practically since resided  thus was created in the islands a situation strange in the beginning and which as its inner significance is developed becomes daily stranger to observe  on the one hand mataafa sits in malie assumes a regal state receives deputations heads his letters government of samoa tacitly treats the king as a coordinate and yet declares himself and in many ways conducts himself as a lawabiding citizen  on the other the white officials in mulinuu stand contemplating the phenomenon with eyes of growing stupefaction now with symptoms of collapse now with accesses of violence  for long even those well versed in island manners and the island character daily expected war and heard imaginary drums beat in the forest  but for now close upon a year and against every stress of persuasion and temptation mataafa has been the bulwark of our peace  apia lay open to be seized he had the power in his hand his followers cried to be led on his enemies marshalled him the same way by impotent examples and he has never faltered  early in the day a white man was sent from the government of mulinuu to examine and report upon his actions i saw the spy on his return it was only our rebel that saved us he said with a laugh  there is now no honest man in the islands but is well aware of it none but knows that if we have enjoyed during the past eleven months the conveniences of peace it is due to the forbearance of our rebel  nor does this part of his conduct stand alone  he calls his party at malie the governmentour governmentbut he pays his taxes to the government at mulinuu  he takes ground like a king he has steadily and blandly refused to obey all orders as to his own movements or behaviour but upon requisition he sends offenders to be tried under the chief justice  we have here a problem of conduct and what seems an image of inconsistency very hard at the first sight to be solved by any european plainly mataafa does not act at random  plainly in the depths of his samoan mind he regards his attitude as regular and constitutional  it may be unexpected it may be inauspicious it may be undesirable but he thinks itand perhaps it isin full accordance with those laws and customs of samoa ignorantly invoked by the draughtsmen of the berlin act  the point is worth an effort of comprehension a mans life may yet depend upon it  let us conceive in the first place that there are five separate kingships in samoa though not always five different kings and that though one man by holding the five royal names might become king in all parts of samoa there is perhaps no such matter as a kingship of all samoa  he who holds one royal name would be upon this view as much a sovereign person as he who should chance to hold the other four he would have less territory and fewer subjects but the like independence and an equal royalty  now mataafa even if all debatable points were decided against him is still tuiatua and as such on this hypothesis a sovereign prince  in the second place the draughtsmen of the act waxing exceeding bold employed the word election and implicitly justified all precedented steps towards the kingship according with the customs of samoa  i am not asking what was intended by the gentlemen who sat and debated very benignly and on the whole wisely in berlin i am asking what will be understood by a samoan studying their literary work the berlin act i am asking what is the result of taking a word out of one state of society and applying it to another of which the writers know less than nothing and no european knows much  several interpreters and several days were employed last september in the fruitless attempt to convey to the mind of laupepa the sense of the word resignation  what can a samoan gather from the words election election of a king election of a king according to the laws and customs of samoa  what are the electoral measures what is the method of canvassing likely to be employed by two three four or five more or less absolute princelings eager to evince each other  and who is to distinguish such a process from the state of war  in such internationalor i should say interparochialdifferences the nearest we can come towards understanding is to appreciate the cloud of ambiguity in which all parties grope     treading the crude consistence half on foot    half flying  now in one part of mataafas behaviour his purpose is beyond mistake towards the provisions of the berlin act his desire to be formally obedient is manifest  the act imposed the tax  he has paid his taxes although he thus contributes to the ways and means of his immediate rival  the act decreed the supreme court and he sends his partisans to be tried at mulinuu although he thus places them as i shall have occasion to show in a position far from wholly safe  from this literal conformity in matters regulated to the terms of the berlin plenipotentiaries we may plausibly infer in regard to the rest a no less exact observance of the famous and obscure laws and customs of samoa  but though it may be possible to attain in the study to some such adumbration of an understanding it were plainly unfair to expect it of officials in the hurry of events  our two white officers have accordingly been no more perspicacious than was to be looked for and i think they have sometimes been less wise  it was not wise in the president to proclaim mataafa and his followers rebels and their estates confiscated  such words are not respectable till they repose on force on the lips of an angry white man standing alone on a small promontory they were both dangerous and absurd they might have provoked ruin thanks to the character of mataafa they only raised a smile and damaged the authority of government  and again it is not wise in the government of mulinuu to have twice attempted to precipitate hostilities once in savaii once here in the tuamasanga  the fate of the savaii attempt i never heard it seems to have been stillborn  the other passed under my eyes  a warparty was armed in apia and despatched across the island against mataafa villages where it was to seize the women and children it was absent for some days engaged in feasting with those whom it went out to fight and returned at last innocuous and replete  in this fortunate though undignified ending we may read the fact that the natives on laupepas side are sometimes more wise than their advisers  indeed for our last twelve months of miraculous peace under what seem to be two rival kings the credit is due first of all to mataafa and second to the halfheartedness or the forbearance or both of the natives in the other camp  the voice of the two whites has ever been for war  they have published at least one incendiary proclamation they have armed and sent into the field at least one samoan warparty they have continually besieged captains of warships to attack malie and the captains of the warships have religiously refused  thus in the last twelve months our european rulers have drawn a picture of themselves as bearded like the pard full of strange oaths and gesticulating like semaphores while over against them mataafa reposes smilingly obstinate and their own retainers surround them frowningly inert  into the question of motive i refuse to enter but if we come to war in these islands and with no fresh occasion it will be a manufactured war and one that has been manufactured against the grain of opinion by two foreigners  for the last and worst of the mistakes on the laupepa side it would be unfair to blame any but the king himself  capable both of virtuous resolutions and of fits of apathetic obstinacy his majesty is usually the whiptop of competitive advisers and his conduct is so unstable as to wear at times an appearance of treachery which would surprise himself if he could see it  take for example the experience of lieutenant ulfsparre late chief of police and so to speak commander of the forces  his men were under orders for a certain hour he found himself almost alone at the place of muster and learned the king had sent the soldiery on errands  he sought an audience explained that he was here to implant discipline that with this purpose in view his men could only receive orders through himself and if that condition were not agreed to and faithfully observed he must send in his papers  the king was as usual easily persuaded the interview passed and ended to the satisfaction of all parties engagedand the bargain was kept for one day  on the day after the troops were again dispersed as postrunners and their commander resigned  with such a sovereign i repeat it would be unfair to blame any individual minister for any specific fault  and yet the policy of our two whites against mataafa has appeared uniformly so excessive and implacable that the blame of the last scandal is laid generally at their doors  it is yet fresh  lauati towards the end of last year became deeply concerned about the situation and by great personal exertions and the charms of oratory brought savaii and manono into agreement upon certain terms of compromise laupepa still to be king mataafa to accept a high executive office comparable to that of our own prime minister and the two governments to coalesce  intractable manono was a party  malie was said to view the proposal with resignation if not relief  peace was thought secure  the night before the king was to receive lauati i met one of his companythe family chief iinaand we shook hands over the unexpected issue of our troubles  what no one dreamed was that laupepa would refuse  and he did  he refused undisputed royalty for himself and peace for these unhappy islands and the two whites on mulinuu rightly or wrongly got the blame of it  but their policy has another and a more awkward side  about the time of the secession to malie many ugly things were said i will not repeat that which i hope and believe the speakers did not wholly mean let it suffice that if rumour carried to mataafa the language i have heard used in my own house and before my own native servants he would be highly justified in keeping clear of apia and the whites  one gentleman whose opinion i respect and am so bold as to hope i may in some points modify will understand the allusion and appreciate my reserve  about the same time there occurred an incident upon which i must be more particular a was a gentleman who had long been an intimate of mataafas and had recently upon account indeed of the secession to malie more or less wholly broken off relations  to him came one whom i shall call b with a dastardly proposition  it may have been bs own in which case he were the more unpardonable but from the closeness of his intercourse with the chief justice as well as from the terms used in the interview men judged otherwise  it was proposed that a should simulate a renewal of the friendship decoy mataafa to a suitable place and have him there arrested  what should follow in those days of violent speech was at the least disputable and the proposal was of course refused  you do not understand was the base rejoinder  you will have no discredit  the germans are to take the blame of the arrest  of course upon the testimony of a gentleman so depraved it were unfair to hang a dog and both the germans and the chief justice must be held innocent  but the chief justice has shown that he can himself be led by his animosity against mataafa into questionable acts  certain natives of malie were accused of stealing pigs the chief justice summoned them through mataafa several were sent and along with them a written promise that if others were required these also should be forthcoming upon requisition  such as came were duly tried and acquitted and mataafas offer was communicated to the chief justice who made a formal answer and the same day in pursuance of his constant design to have malie attacked by warships reported to one of the consuls that his warrant would not run in the country and that certain of the accused had been withheld  at least this is not fair dealing and the next instance i have to give is possibly worse  for one blunder the chief justice is only so far responsible in that he was not present where it seems he should have been when it was made  he had nothing to do with the silly proscription of the mataafas he has always disliked the measure and it occurred to him at last that he might get rid of this dangerous absurdity and at the same time reap a further advantage  let mataafa leave malie for any other district in samoa it should be construed as an act of submission and the confiscation and proscription instantly recalled  this was certainly well devised the government escaped from their own false position and by the same stroke lowered the prestige of their adversaries  but unhappily the chief justice did not put all his eggs in one basket  concurrently with these negotiations he began again to move the captain of one of the warships to shell the rebel village the captain conceiving the extremity wholly unjustified not only refused these instances but more or less publicly complained of their being made the matter came to the knowledge of the white resident who was at that time playing the part of intermediary with malie and he in natural anger and disgust withdrew from the negotiation  these duplicities always deplorable when discovered are never more fatal than with men imperfectly civilised  almost incapable of truth themselves they cherish a particular score of the same fault in whites  and mataafa is besides an exceptional native  i would scarce dare say of any samoan that he is truthful though i seem to have encountered the phenomenon but i must say of mataafa that he seems distinctly and consistently averse to lying  for the affair of the manono prisoners the chief justice is only again in so far answerable as he was at the moment absent from the seat of his duties and the blame falls on baron senfft von pilsach president of the municipal council  there were in manono certain dissidents loyal to laupepa  being manono people i daresay they were very annoying to their neighbours the majority as they belonged to the same island were the more impatient and one fine day fell upon and destroyed the houses and harvests of the dissidents according to the laws and customs of samoa the president went down to the unruly island in a warship and was landed alone upon the beach  to one so much a stranger to the mansuetude of polynesians this must have seemed an act of desperation and the barons gallantry met with a deserved success  the six ringleaders acting in mataafas interest had been guilty of a delict with mataafas approval they delivered themselves over to be tried  on friday september 4 1891 they were convicted before a native magistrate and sentenced to six months imprisonment or i should rather say detention for it was expressly directed that they were to be used as gentlemen and not as prisoners that the door was to stand open and that all their wishes should be gratified  this extraordinary sentence fell upon the accused like a thunderbolt  there is no need to suppose perfidy where a careless interpreter suffices to explain all but the six chiefs claim to have understood their coming to apia as an act of submission merely formal that they came in fact under an implied indemnity and that the president stood pledged to see them scatheless  already on their way from the courthouse they were tumultuously surrounded by friends and clansmen who pressed and cried upon them to escape lieutenant ulfsparre must order his men to load and with that the momentary effervescence died away  next day saturday 5th the chief justice took his departure from the islandsa step never yet explained and in view of the doings of the day before and the remonstrances of other officials hard to justify  the president an amiable and brave young man of singular inexperience was thus left to face the growing difficulty by himself the clansmen of the prisoners to the number of near upon a hundred lay in vaiusu a village half way between apia and malie there they talked big thence sent menacing messages the gaol should be broken in the night they said and the six martyrs rescued  allowance is to be made for the character of the people of manono turbulent fellows boastful of tongue but of late days not thought to be answerably bold in person  yet the moment was anxious  the government of mulinuu had gained an important moral victory by the surrender and condemnation of the chiefs and it was needful the victory should be maintained  the guard upon the gaol was accordingly strengthened a warparty was sent to watch the vaiusu road under asi and the chiefs of the vaimaunga were notified to arm and assemble their men  it must be supposed the president was doubtful of the loyalty of these assistants  he turned at least to the warships where it seems he was rebuffed thence he fled into the arms of the wrecker gang where he was unhappily more successful  the government of washington had presented to the samoan king the wrecks of the trenton and the vandalia an american syndicate had been formed to break them up an experienced gang was in consequence settled in apia and the report of submarine explosions had long grown familiar in the ears of residents  from these artificers the president obtained a supply of dynamite the needful mechanism and the loan of a mechanic the gaol was mined and the manono people in vaiusu were advertised of the fact in a letter signed by laupepa  partly by the indiscretion of the mechanic who had sought to embolden himself like lady macbeth with liquor for his somewhat dreadful task the story leaked immediately out and raised a very general or i might say almost universal reprobation  some blamed the proposed deed because it was barbarous and a foul example to set before a race half barbarous itself others because it was illegal others again because in the face of so weak an enemy it appeared pitifully pusillanimous almost all because it tended to precipitate and embitter war  in the midst of the turmoil he had raised and under the immediate pressure of certain indignant white residents the baron fell back upon a new expedient certainly less barbarous perhaps no more legal and on monday afternoon september 7th packed his six prisoners on board the cutter lancashire lass and deported them to the neighbouring lowisland group of the tokelaus  we watched her put to sea with mingled feelings  anything were better than dynamite but this was not good  the men had been summoned in the name of law they had surrendered the law had uttered its voice they were under one sentence duly delivered and now the president by no right with which we were acquainted had exchanged it for another  it was perhaps no less fortunate though it was more pardonable in a stranger that he had increased the punishment to that which in the eyes of samoans ranks next to deathexile from their native land and friends  and the lancashire lass appeared to carry away with her into the uttermost parts of the sea the honour of the administration and the prestige of the supreme court  the policy of the government towards mataafa has thus been of a piece throughout always wouldbe violent it has been almost always defaced with some appearance of perfidy or unfairness  the policy of mataafa though extremely bewildering to any white appears everywhere consistent with itself and the mans bearing has always been calm  but to represent the fulness of the contrast it is necessary that i should give some description of the two capitals or the two camps and the ways and means of the regular and irregular government  mulinuu  mulinuu the reader may remember is a narrow finger of land planted in cocoapalms which runs forth into the lagoon perhaps three quarters of a mile  to the east is the bay of apia  to the west there is first of all a mangrove swamp the mangroves excellently green the mud inkblack and its face crawled upon by countless insects and black and scarlet crabs  beyond the swamp is a wide and shallow bay of the lagoon bounded to the west by faleula point  faleula is the next village to malie so that from the top of some tall palm in malie it should be possible to descry against the eastern heavens the palms of mulinuu  the trade wind sweeps over the low peninsula and cleanses it from the contagion of the swamp  samoans have a quaint phrase in their language when out of health they seek exposed places on the shore to eat the wind say they and there can be few better places for such a diet than the point of mulinuu  two european houses stand conspicuous on the harbour side in europe they would seem poor enough but they are fine houses for samoa  one is new it was built the other day under the apologetic title of a government house to be the residence of baron senfft  the other is historical it was built by brandeis on a mortgage and is now occupied by the chief justice on conditions never understood the rumour going uncontradicted that he sits rent free  i do not say it is true i say it goes uncontradicted and there is one peculiarity of our officials in a nutshelltheir remarkable indifference to their own character  from the one house to the other extends a scattering village for the faipule or native parliament men  in the days of tamasese this was a brave place both his own house and those of the faipule good and the whole excellently ordered and approached by a sanded way  it is now like a neglected bushtown and speaks of apathy in all concerned  but the chief scandal of mulinuu is elsewhere  the house of the president stands just to seaward of the isthmus where the watch is set nightly and armed men guard the uneasy slumbers of the government  on the landward side there stands a monument to the poor german lads who fell at fangalii just beyond which the passerby may chance to observe a little house standing backward from the road  it is such a house as a commoner might use in a bush village none could dream that it gave shelter even to a family chief yet this is the palace of malietoanatoaiteletamasoalii laupepa king of samoa  as you sit in his company under this humble shelter you shall see between the posts the new house of the president  his majesty himself beholds it daily and the tenor of his thoughts may be divined  the fine house of a samoan chief is his appropriate attribute yet after seventeen months the government well housed themselves have not yet foundhave not yet soughta rooftree for their sovereign  and the lodging is typical  i take up the presidents financial statement of september 8 1891  i find the kings allowance to figure at seventyfive dollars a month and i find that he is further though somewhat obscurely debited with the salaries of either two or three clerks  take the outside figure and the sum expended on or for his majesty amounts to ninetyfive dollars in the month  lieutenant ulfsparre and dr hagberg the chief justices swedish friends drew in the same period one hundred and forty and one hundred dollars respectively on account of salary alone  and it should be observed that dr hagberg was employed or at least paid from government funds in the face of his majestys express and reiterated protest  in another column of the statement one hundred and seventyfive dollars and seventyfive cents are debited for the chief justices travelling expenses  i am of the opinion that if his majesty desired or dared to take an outing he would be asked to bear the charge from his allowance but although i think the chief justice had done more nobly to pay for himself i am far from denying that his excursions were well meant he should indeed be praised for having made them and i leave the charge out of consideration in the following statement     on the one hand     salary of chief justice cedarkrantz 500    salary of president baron senfft von pilsach about 415    salary of lieutenant ulfsparre chief of police 140    salary of dr hagberg private secretary to the chief justice 100     total monthly salary to four whites one of them paid against his    majestys protest 1155     on the other hand     total monthly payments to and for his majesty the king including    allowance and hire of three clerks one of these placed under the    rubric of extraordinary expenses 95  this looks strange enough and mean enough already  but we have ground of comparison in the practice of brandeis     brandeis white prime minister 200    tamasese about 160    white chief of police 100  under brandeis in other words the king received the second highest allowance on the sheet and it was a good second and the third was a bad third  and it must be borne in mind that tamasese himself was pointed and laughed at among natives  judge then what is muttered of laupepa housed in his shanty before the presidents doors like lazarus before the doors of dives receiving not so much of his own taxes as the private secretary of the law officer and in actual salary little more than half as much as his own chief of police  it is known besides that he has protested in vain against the charge for dr hagberg it is known that he has himself applied for an advance and been refused  money is certainly a grave subject on mulinuu but respect costs nothing and thrifty officials might have judged it wise to make up in extra politeness for what they curtailed of pomp or comfort  one instance may suffice laupepa appeared last summer on a public occasion the president was there and not even the president rose to greet the entrance of the sovereign  since about the same period besides the monarch must be described as in a state of sequestration  a white man an irishman the true type of all that is most gallant humorous and reckless in his country chose to visit his majesty and give him some excellent advice to make up his difference with mataafa couched unhappily in vivid and figurative language  the adviser now sleeps in the pacific but the evil that he chanced to do lives after him  his majesty was greatly and i must say justly offended by the freedom of the expressions used he appealed to his white advisers and these whether from want of thought or by design issued an ignominious proclamation  intending visitors to the palace must appear before their consuls and justify their business the majesty of buried samoa was henceforth only to be viewed like a private collection under special permit and was thus at once cut off from the company and opinions of the self respecting  to retain any dignity in such an abject state would require a man of very different virtues from those claimed by the not unvirtuous laupepa  he is not designed to ride the whirlwind or direct the storm rather to be the ornament of private life  he is kind gentle patient as job conspicuously wellintentioned of charming manners and when he pleases he has one accomplishment in which he now begins to be alonei mean that he can pronounce correctly his own beautiful language  the government of brandeis accomplished a good deal and was continually and heroically attempting more  the government of our two whites has confined itself almost wholly to paying and receiving salaries  they have built indeed a house for the president they are believed if that be a merit to have bought the local newspaper with government funds and their rule has been enlivened by a number of scandals into which i feel with relief that it is unnecessary i should enter  even if the three powers do not remove these gentlemen their absurd and disastrous government must perish by itself of inanition  native taxes except perhaps from mataafa true to his own private policy have long been beyond hope  and only the other day may 6th 1892 on the expressed ground that there was no guarantee as to how the funds would be expended and that the president consistently refused to allow the verification of his cash balances the municipal council has negatived the proposal to call up further taxes from the whites  all is well that ends even ill so that it end and we believe that with the last dollar we shall see the last of the last functionary  now when it is so nearly over we can afford to smile at this extraordinary passage though we must still sigh over the occasion lost        malie  the way to malie lies round the shores of faleula bay and through a succession of pleasant groves and villages  the road one of the works of brandeis is now cut up by pig fences  eight times you must leap a barrier of cocoa posts the takeoff and the landing both in a patch of mire planted with big stones and the stones sometimes reddened with the blood of horses that have gone before  to make these obstacles more annoying you have sometimes to wait while a black boar clambers sedately over the socalled pig fence  nothing can more thoroughly depict the worst side of the samoan character than these useless barriers which deface their only road  it was one of the first orders issued by the government of mulinuu after the coming of the chief justice to have the passage cleared  it is the disgrace of mataafa that the thing is not yet done  the village of malie is the scene of prosperity and peace  in a very good account of a visit there published in the australasian the writer describes it to be fortified she must have been deceived by the appearance of some pig walls on the shore  there is no fortification no parade of war  i understand that from one to five hundred fighting men are always within reach but i have never seen more than five together under arms and these were the kings guard of honour  a sabbath quiet broods over the wellweeded green the picketed horses the troops of pigs the round or oval native dwellings  of these there are a surprising number very fine of their sort yet more are in the building and in the midst a tall house of assembly by far the greatest samoan structure now in these islands stands about half finished and already makes a figure in the landscape  no bustle is to be observed but the work accomplished testifies to a still activity  the centrepiece of all is the high chief himself malietoatuiatuatuiaana mataafa kingor not kingor kingclaimantof samoa  all goes to him all comes from him  native deputations bring him gifts and are feasted in return  white travellers to their indescribable irritation are on his approach waved from his path by his armed guards  he summons his dancers by the note of a bugle  he sits nightly at home before a semicircle of talkingmen from many quarters of the islands delivering and hearing those ornate and elegant orations in which the samoan heart delights  about himself and all his surroundings there breathes a striking sense of order tranquillity and native plenty  he is of a tall and powerful person sixty years of age whitehaired and with a white moustache his eyes bright and quiet his jaw perceptibly underhung which gives him something of the expression of a benevolent mastiff his manners dignified and a thought insinuating with an air of a catholic prelate  he was never married and a natural daughter attends upon his guests  long since he made a vow of chastityto live as our lord lived on this earth and polynesians report with bated breath that he has kept it  on all such points true to his catholic training he is inclined to be even rigid  lauati the pivot of savaii has recently repudiated his wife and taken a fairer and when i was last in malie mataafa with a strange superiority to his own interests had but just despatched a reprimand  in his immediate circle in spite of the smoothness of his ways he is said to be more respected than beloved and his influence is the child rather of authority than popularity  no samoan grandee now living need have attempted that which he has accomplished during the last twelve months with unimpaired prestige not only to withhold his followers from war but to send them to be judged in the camp of their enemies on mulinuu  and it is a matter of debate whether such a triumph of authority were ever possible before speaking for myself i have visited and dwelt in almost every seat of the polynesian race and have met but one man who gave me a stronger impression of character and parts  about the situation mataafa expresses himself with unshaken peace  to the chief justice he refers with some bitterness to laupepa with a smile as my poor brother  for himself he stands upon the treaty and expects sooner or later an election in which he shall be raised to the chief power  in the meanwhile or for an alternative he would willingly embrace a compromise with laupepa to which he would probably add one condition that the joint government should remain seated at malie a sensible but not inconvenient distance from white intrigues and white officials  one circumstance in my last interview particularly pleased me  the kings chief scribe esela is an old employe under tamasese and the talk ran some while upon the character of brandeis  loyalty in this world is after all not thrown away brandeis was guilty in samoan eyes of many irritating errors but he stood true to tamasese in the course of time a sense of this virtue and of his general uprightness has obliterated the memory of his mistakes and it would have done his heart good if he could have heard his old scribe and his old adversary join in praising him  yes concluded mataafa i wish we had planteisa back again  a quelque chose malheur est bon  so strong is the impression produced by the defects of cedarcrantz and baron senfft that i believe mataafa far from singular in this opinion and that the return of the upright brandeis might be even welcome to many  i must add a last touch to the picture of malie and the pretenders life about four in the morning the visitor in his house will be awakened by the note of a pipe blown without very softly and to a soothing melody this is mataafas private luxury to lead on pleasant dreams  we have a bird here in samoa that about the same hour of darkness sings in the bush  the father of mataafa while he lived was a great friend and protector to all living creatures and passed under the byname of the king of birds  it may be it was among the woodland clients of the sire that the son acquired his fancy for this morning music        i have now sought to render without extenuation the impressions received of dignity plenty and peace at malie of bankruptcy and distraction at mulinuu  and i wish i might here bring to an end ungrateful labours  but i am sensible that there remain two points on which it would be improper to be silent  i should be blamed if i did not indicate a practical conclusion and i should blame myself if i did not do a little justice to that tried company of the land commissioners  the land commission has been in many senses unfortunate  the original german member a gentleman of the name of eggert fell early into precarious health his work was from the first interrupted he was at last to the regret of all that knew him invalided home and his successor had but just arrived  in like manner the first american commissioner henry c ide a man of character and intelligence was recalled i believe by private affairs when he was but just settling into the spirit of the work and though his place was promptly filled by exgovernor ormsbee a worthy successor distinguished by strong and vivacious common sense the break was again sensible  the english commissioner my friend bazett michael haggard is thus the only one who has continued at his post since the beginning  and yet in spite of these unusual changes the commission has a record perhaps unrivalled among international commissions  it has been unanimous practically from the first until the last and out of some four hundred cases disposed of there is but one on which the members were divided  it was the more unfortunate they should have early fallen in a difficulty with the chief justice  the original ground of this is supposed to be a difference of opinion as to the import of the berlin act on which as a layman it would be unbecoming if i were to offer an opinion  but it must always seem as if the chief justice had suffered himself to be irritated beyond the bounds of discretion  it must always seem as if his original attempt to deprive the commissioners of the services of a secretary and the use of a safe were even senseless and his step in printing and posting a proclamation denying their jurisdiction were equally impolitic and undignified  the dispute had a secondary result worse than itself  the gentleman appointed to be natives advocate shared the chief justices opinion was his close intimate advised with him almost daily and drifted at last into an attitude of opposition to his colleagues  he suffered himself besides being a layman in law to embrace the interest of his clients with something of the warmth of a partisan  disagreeable scenes occurred in court the advocate was more than once reproved he was warned that his consultations with the judge of appeal tended to damage his own character and to lower the credit of the appellate court having lost some cases on which he set importance it should seem that he spoke unwisely among natives  a sudden cry of colour prejudice went up and samoans were heard to assure each other that it was useless to appear before the land commission which was sworn to support the whites  this deplorable state of affairs was brought to an end by the departure from samoa of the natives advocate  he was succeeded pro tempore by a young new zealander e w gurr not much more versed in law than himself and very much less so in samoan  whether by more skill or better fortune gurr has been able in the course of a few weeks to recover for the natives several important tracts of land and the prejudice against the commission seems to be abating as fast as it arose i should not omit to say that in the eagerness of the original advocate there was much that was amiable nor must i fail to point out how much there was of blindness  fired by the ardour of pursuit he seems to have regarded his immediate clients as the only natives extant and the epitome and emblem of the samoan race  thus in the case that was the most exclaimed against as an injustice to natives his client puaauli was certainly nonsuited  but in that intricate affair who lost the money the german firm  and who got the land  other natives  to twist such a decision into evidence either of a prejudice against samoans or a partiality to whites is to keep one eye shut and have the other bandaged  and lastly one word as to the future  laupepa and mataafa stand over against each other rivals with no third competitor  they may be said to hold the great name of malietoa in commission each has borne the style each exercised the authority of a samoan king one is secure of the small but compact and fervent following of the catholics the other has the sympathies of a large part of the protestant majority and upon any sign of catholic aggression would have more  with men so nearly balanced it may be asked whether a prolonged successful exercise of power be possible for either  in the case of the feeble laupepa it is certainly not we have the proof before us  nor do i think we should judge from what we see today that it would be possible or would continue to be possible even for the kingly mataafa  it is always the easier game to be in opposition  the tale of david and saul would infallibly be reenacted once more we shall have two kings in the landthe latent and the patent and the house of the first will become once more the resort of every one that is in distress and every one that is in debt and every one that is discontented  against such odds it is my fear that mataafa might contend in vain it is beyond the bounds of my imagination that laupepa should contend at all  foreign ships and bayonets is the cure proposed in mulinuu  and certainly if people at home desire that money should be thrown away and blood shed in samoa an effect of a kind and for the time may be produced  its nature and prospective durability i will ask readers of this volume to forecast for themselves  there is one way to peace and unity that laupepa and mataafa should be again conjoined on the best terms procurable  there may be other ways although i cannot see them but not even malevolence not even stupidity can deny that this is one  it seems indeed so obvious and sure and easy that men look about with amazement and suspicion seeking some hidden motive why it should not be adopted  to laupepas opposition as shown in the case of the lauati scheme no dweller in samoa will give weight for they know him to be as putty in the hands of his advisers  it may be right it may be wrong but we are many of us driven to the conclusion that the stumblingblock is fangalii and that the memorial of that affair shadows appropriately the house of a king who reigns in right of it  if this be all it should not trouble us long  germany has shown she can be generous it now remains for her only to forget a natural but certainly illgrounded prejudice and allow to him who was sole king before the plenipotentiaries assembled and who would be sole king tomorrow if the berlin act could be rescinded a fitting share of rule  the future of samoa should lie thus in the hands of a single man on whom the eyes of europe are already fixed  great concerns press on his attention the samoan group in his view is but as a grain of dust and the country where he reigns has bled on too many august scenes of victory to remember for ever a blundering skirmish in the plantation of vailele  it is to himto the sovereign of the wise stuebel and the loyal brandeisthat i make my appeal  may
