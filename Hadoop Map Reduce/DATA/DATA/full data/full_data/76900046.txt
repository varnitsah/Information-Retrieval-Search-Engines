76900046	my friend the murderer  by a conan doyle   number 481 is no better doctor said the headwarder in a slightly reproachful accent looking in round the corner of my door  confound 481 i responded from behind the pages of the australian sketcher  and 61 says his tubes are paining him couldnt you do anything for him  he is a walking drugshop said i he has the whole british pharmacopaæ inside him i believe his tubes are as sound as yours are  then theres 7 and 108 they are chronic continued the warder glancing down a blue slip of paper and 28 knocked off work yesterdaysaid lifting things gave him a stitch in the side i want you to have a look at him if you dont mind doctor theres 81 toohim that killed john adamson in the corinthian brighes been carrying on awful in the night shrieking and yelling he has and no stopping him either  all right ill have a look at him afterward i said tossing my paper carelessly aside and pouring myself out a cup of coffee nothing else to report i suppose warder  the official protruded his head a little further into the room beg pardon doctor he said in a confidential tone but i notice as 82 has a bit of a cold and it would be a good excuse for you to visit him and have a chat maybe  the cup of coffee was arrested halfway to my lips as i stared in amazement at the mans serious face  an excuse i said an excuse what the deuce are you talking about mcpherson you see me trudging about all day at my practise when im not looking after the prisoners and coming back every night as tired as a dog and you talk about finding an excuse for doing more work  youd like it doctor said warder mcpherson insinuating one of his shoulders into the room that mans storys worth listening to if you could get him to tell it though hes not what youd call free in his speech maybe you dont know who 82 is  no i dont and i dont care either i answered in the conviction that some local ruffian was about to be foisted upon me as a celebrity  hes maloney said the warder him that turned queens evidence after the murders at bluemansdyke  you dont say so i ejaculated laying down my cup in astonishment i had heard of this ghastly series of murders and read an account of them in a london magazine long before setting foot in the colony i remembered that the atrocities committed had thrown the burke and hare crimes completely into the shade and that one of the most villainous of the gang had saved his own skin by betraying his companions are you sure i asked  oh yes its him right enough just you draw him out a bit and hell astonish you hes a man to know is maloney thats to say in moderation and the head grinned bobbed and disappeared leaving me to finish my breakfast and ruminate over what i had heard  the surgeonship of an australian prison is not an enviable position it may be endurable in melbourne or sydney but the little town of perth has few attractions to recommend it and those few had been long exhausted the climate was detestable and the society far from congenial sheep and cattle were the staple support of the community and their prices breeding and diseases the principal topic of conversation now as i being an outsider possessed neither the one nor the other and was utterly callous to the new dip and the rot and other kindred topics i found myself in a state of mental isolation and was ready to hail anything which might relieve the monotony of my existence maloney the murderer had at least some distinctiveness and individuality in his character and might act as a tonic to a mind sick of the commonplaces of existence i determined that i should follow the warders advice and take the excuse for making his acquaintance when therefore i went upon my usual matutinal round i turned the lock of the door which bore the convicts number upon it and walked into the cell  the man was lying in a heap upon his rough bed as i entered but uncoiling his long limbs he started up and stared at me with an insolent look of defiance on his face which augured badly for our interview he had a pale set face with sandy hair and a steelyblue eye with something feline in its expression his frame was tall and muscular though there was a curious bend in his shoulders which almost amounted to a deformity an ordinary observer meeting him in the street might have put him down as a welldeveloped man fairly handsome and of studious habitseven in the hideous uniform of the rottenest convict establishment he imparted a certain refinement to his carriage which marked him out among the inferior ruffians around him  im not on the sicklist he said gruffly there was something in the hard rasping voice which dispelled all softer illusions and made me realize that i was face to face with the man of the lena valley and bluemansdyke the bloodiest bushranger that ever stuck up a farm or cut the throats of its occupants  i know youre not i answered warder mcpherson told me you had a cold though and i thought id look in and see you  blast warder mcpherson and blast you too yelled the convict in a paroxysm of rage oh thats right he added in a quieter voice hurry away report me to the governor do get me another six months or sothats your game  im not going to report you i said  eight square feet of ground he went on disregarding my protest and evidently working himself into a fury again eight square feet and i cant have that without being talked to and stared at andoh blast the whole crew of you and he raised his two clinched hands above his head and shook them in passionate invective  youve got a curious idea of hospitality i remarked determined not to lose my temper and saying almost the first thing that came to my tongue  to my surprise the words had an extraordinary effect upon him he seemed completely staggered at my assuming the proposition for which he had been so fiercely contendingnamely that the room in which he stood was his own  i beg your pardon he said i didnt mean to be rude wont you take a seat and he motioned toward a rough trestle which formed the headpiece of his couch  i sat down rather astonished at the sudden change i dont know that i liked maloney better under this new aspect the murderer had it is true disappeared for the nonce but there was something in the smooth tones and obsequious manner which powerfully suggested the witness of the queen who had stood up and sworn away the lives of his companions in crime  hows your chest i asked putting on my professional air  come drop it doctordrop it he answered showing a row of white teeth as he resumed his seat upon the side of the bed it wasnt anxiety after my precious health that brought you along here that story wont wash at all you came to have a look at wolf tone maloney forger murderer sydneyslider ranger and government peach thats about my figure aint it there it is plain and straight theres nothing mean about me  he paused as if he expected me to say something but as i remained silent he repeated once or twice theres nothing mean about me  and why shouldnt i he suddenly yelled his eyes gleaming and his whole satanic nature reasserting itself we were bound to swing one and all and they were none the worse if i saved myself by turning against them every man for himself say i and the devil take the luckiest you havent a plug of tobacco doctor have you  he tore at the piece of barretts which i handed him as ravenously as a wild beast it seemed to have the effect of soothing his nerves for he settled himself down in the bed and reassumed his former deprecating manner  you wouldnt like it yourself you know doctor he said its enough to make any man a little queer in his temper im in for six months this time for assault and very sorry i shall be to go out again i can tell you my minds at ease in here but when im outside what with the government and what with tattooed tom of hawkesbury theres no chance of a quiet life  who is he i asked  hes the brother of john grimthorpe the same that was condemned on my evidence and an infernal scamp he was too spawn of the devil both of them this tattooed one is a murderous ruffian and he swore to have my blood after that trial its seven year ago and hes following me yet i know he is though he lies low and keeps dark he came up to me in ballarat in 75 you can see on the back of my hand here where the bullet clipped me he tried again in 76 at port philip but i got the drop on him and wounded him badly he knifed me in 79 though in a bar at adelaide and that made our account about level hes loafing round again now and hell let daylight into meunlessunless by some extraordinary chance some one does as much for him and maloney gave a very ugly smile  i dont complain of him so much he continued looking at it in his way no doubt it is a sort of family matter that can hardly be neglected its the government that fetches me when i think of what ive done for this country and then of what this country has done for me it makes me fairly wildclean drives me off my head theres no gratitude nor common decency left doctor  he brooded over his wrongs for a few minutes and then proceeded to lay them before me in detail  heres nine men he said theyve been murdering and killing for a matter of three years and maybe a life a week wouldnt more than average the work that theyve done the government catches them and the government tries them but they cant convict and whybecause the witnesses have all had their throats cut and the whole jobs been very neatly done what happens then up comes a citizen called wolf tone maloney he says the country needs me and here i am and with that he gives his evidence convicts the lot and enables the beaks to hang them thats what i did theres nothing mean about me and now what does the country do in return dogs me sir spies on me watches me night and day turns against the very man that worked so very hard for it theres something mean about that anyway i didnt expect them to knight me nor to make me colonial secretary but damn it i did expect that they would let me alone  well i remonstrated if you choose to break laws and assault people you cant expect it to be looked over on account of former services  i dont refer to my present imprisonment sir said maloney with dignity its the life ive been leading since that cursed trial that takes the soul out of me just you sit there on that trestle and ill tell you all about it and then look me in the face and tell me that ive been treated fair by the police  i shall endeavor to transcribe the experience of the convict in his own words as far as i can remember them preserving his curious perversions of right and wrong i can answer for the truth of his facts whatever may be said for his deductions from them months afterward inspector h w hann formerly governor of the jail at dunedin showed me entries in his ledger which corroborated every statement maloney reeled the story off in a dull monotonous voice with his head sunk upon his breast and his hands between his knees the glitter of his serpentlike eyes was the only sign of the emotions which were stirred up by the recollection of the events which he narrated    youve read of bluemansdyke he began with some pride in his tone we made it hot while it lasted but they ran us to earth at last and a trap called braxton with a damned yankee took the lot of us that was in new zealand of course and they took us down to dunedin and there they were convicted and hanged one and all they put up their hands in the dock and cursed me till your blood would have run cold to hear themwhich was scurvy treatment seeing that we had all been pals together but they were a blackguard lot and thought only of themselves i think it is as well that they were hung  they took me back to dunedin jail and clapped me into the old cell the only difference they made was that i had no work to do and was well fed i stood this for a week or two until one day the governor was making his rounds and i put the matter to him  hows this i said my conditions were a free pardon and youre keeping me here against the law  he gave a sort of a smile should you like very much to get out he asked  so much said i that unless you open that door ill have an action against you for illegal detention  he seemed a bit astonished by my resolution  youre very anxious to meet your death he said  what dye mean i asked  come here and youll know what i mean he answered and he led me down the passage to a window that overlooked the door of the prison look at that said he  i looked out and there were a dozen or so roughlooking fellows standing outside the street some of them smoking some playing cards on the pavement when they saw me they gave a yell and crowded round the door shaking their fists and hooting  they wait for you watch and watch about said the governor theyre the executive of the vigilance committee however since you are determined to go i cant stop you  dye call this a civilized land i cried and let a man be murdered in cold blood in open daylight  when i said this the governor and the warder and every fool in the place grinned as if a mans life was a rare good joke  youve got the law on your side says the governor so we wont detain you any longer show him out warder  hed have done it too the blackhearted villain if i hadnt begged and prayed and offered to pay for my board and lodging which is more than any prisoner ever did before me he let me stay on those conditions and for three months i was caged up there with every larrikin in the township clamoring at the other side of the wall that was pretty treatment for a man that had served his country  at last one morning up came the governor again  well maloney he said how long are you going to honor us with your society  i could have put a knife into his cursed body and would too if we had been alone in the bush but i had to smile and smooth him and flatter for i feared that he might have me sent out  youre an infernal rascal he said those were his very words to a man that had helped him all he knew how i dont want any rough justice here though and i think i see my way to getting you out of dunedin  ill never forget you governor said i and by god i never will  i dont want your thanks nor your gratitude he answered its not for your sake that i do it but simply to keep order in the town theres a steamer starts from the west quay to melbourne tomorrow and well get you aboard it she is advertised at five in the morning so have yourself in readiness  i packed up the few things i had and was smuggled out by a back door just before daybreak i hurried down took my ticket under the name of isaac smith and got safely aboard the melbourne boat i remember hearing her screw grinding into the water as the warps were cast loose and looking back at the lights of dunedin as i leaned upon the bulwarks with the pleasant thought that i was leaving them behind me forever it seemed to me that a new world was before me and that all my troubles had been cast off i went down below and had some coffee and came up again feeling better than i had done since the morning that i woke to find that cursed irishman that took me standing over me with a sixshooter  day had dawned by that time and we were steaming along by the coast well out of sight of dunedin i loafed about for a couple of hours and when the sun got well up some of the other passengers came on deck and joined me one of them a little perky sort of fellow took a good long look at me and then came over and began talking  mining i suppose says he  yes i says  made your pile he asks  pretty fair says i  i was at it myself he says i worked at the nelson fields for three months and spent all i made in buying a salted claim which busted up the second day i went at it again though and struck it rich but when the gold wagon was going down to the settlements it was stuck up by those cursed rangers and not a red cent left  that was a bad job i says  broke meruined me clean never mind ive seen them all hanged for it that makes it easier to bear theres only one leftthe villain that gave the evidence id die happy if i could come across him there are two things i have to do if i meet him  whats that says i carelessly  ive got to ask him where the money liesthey never had time to make away with it and its cachéd somewhere in the mountainsand then ive got to stretch his neck for him and send his soul down to join the men that he betrayed  it seemed to me that i knew something about that caché and i felt like laughing but he was watching me and it struck me that he had a nasty vindictive kind of mind  im going up on the bridge i said for he was not a man whose acquaintance i cared much about making  he wouldnt hear of my leaving him though were both miners he says and were pals for the voyage come down to the bar im not too poor to shout  i couldnt refuse him well and we went down together and that was the beginning of the trouble what harm was i doing any one on the ship all i asked for was a quiet life leaving others alone and getting left alone myself no man could ask fairer than that and now just you listen to what came of it  we were passing the front of the ladies cabin on our way to the saloon when out comes a servant lassa freckled currency shedevilwith a baby in her arms we were brushing past her when she gave a scream like a railway whistle and nearly dropped the kid my nerves gave a sort of a jump when i heard that scream but i turned and begged her pardon letting on that i thought i might have trod on her foot i knew the game was up though when i saw her white face and her leaning against the door and pointing  its him she cried its him i saw him in the courthouse oh dont let him hurt the baby  who is it asked the steward and half a dozen others in a breath  its himmaloneymaloney the murdereroh take him awaytake him away  i dont rightly remember what happened just at that moment the furniture and me seemed to get kind of mixed and there was cursing and smashing and some one shouting for his gold and a general stamping round when i got steadied a bit i found somebodys hand in my mouth from what i gathered afterward i concluded that it belonged to that same little man with the vicious way of talking he got some of it out again but that was because the others were choking me a poor chap can get no fair play in this world when once he is downstill i think he will remember me till the day of his deathlonger i hope  they dragged me out on to the poop and held a damned courtmartialon me mind you me that had thrown over my pals in order to serve them what were they to do with me some said this some said that but it ended by the captain deciding to send me ashore the ship stopped they lowered a boat and i was hoisted in the whole gang of them hooting at me from over the bulwarks i saw the man i spoke of tying up his hand though and i felt that things might be worse  i changed my opinion before we got to the land i had reckoned on the shore being deserted and that i might make my way inland but the ship had stopped too near the heads and a dozen beachcombers and such like had come down to the waters edge and were staring at us wondering what the boat was after when we got to the edge of the surf the cockswain hailed them and after singing out who i was he and his men threw me into the water you may well look surprisedneck and crop into ten feet of water with sharks as thick as green parrots in the bush and i heard them laughing as i floundered to the shore  i soon saw it was a worse job than ever as i came scrambling out through the weeds i was collared by a big chap with a velveteen coat and half a dozen others got round me and held me fast most of them looked simple fellows enough and i was not afraid of them but there was one in a cabbagetree hat that had a very nasty expression on his face and the big man seemed to be chummy with him  they dragged me up the beach and then they let go their hold of me and stood round in a circle  well mate says the man with the hat weve been looking out for you some time in these parts  and very good of you too i answers  none of your jaw says he come boys what shall it behanging drowning or shooting look sharp  this looked a bit too like business no you dont i said ive got government protection and itll be murder  thats what they call it answered the one in the velveteen coat as cheery as a piping crow  and youre going to murder me for being a ranger  ranger be damned said the man were going to hang you for peaching against your pals and thats an end of the palaver  they slung a rope round my neck and dragged me up to the edge of the bush there were some big sheoaks and bluegums and they pitched on one of these for the wicked deed they ran the rope over a branch tied my hands and told me to say my prayers it seemed as if it was all up but providence interfered to save me it sounds nice enough sitting here and telling about it sir but it was sick work to stand with nothing but the beach in front of you and the long white line of surf with the steamer in the distance and a set of bloodyminded villains round you thirsting for your life  i never thought id owe anything good to the police but they saved me that time a troop of them were riding from hawkes point station to dunedin and hearing that something was up they came down through the bush and interrupted the proceedings ive heard some bands in my time doctor but i never heard music like the jingle of those traps spurs and harness as they galloped out on to the open they tried to hang me even then but the police were too quick for them and the man with the hat got one over the head with the flat of a sword i was clapped on to a horse and before evening i found myself in my old quarters in the city jail  the governor wasnt to be done though he was determined to get rid of me and i was equally anxious to see the last of him he waited a week or so until the excitement had begun to die away and then he smuggled me aboard a threemasted schooner bound to sydney with tallow and hides  we got far away to sea without a hitch and things began to look a bit more rosy i made sure that i had seen the last of the prison anyway the crew had a sort of an idea who i was and if thered been any rough weather theyd have hove me overboard like enough for they were a rough ignorant lot and had a notion that i brought bad luck to the ship we had a good passage however and i was landed safe and sound upon sydney quay  now just you listen to what happened next youd have thought they would have been sick of illusing me and following me by this timewouldnt you now well just you listen it seems that a cursed steamer started from dunedin to sydney on the very day we left and got in before us bringing news that i was coming blessed if they hadnt called a meetinga regular massmeetingat the docks to discuss about it and i marched right into it when i landed they didnt take long about arresting me and i listened to all the speeches and resolutions if id been a prince there couldnt have been more excitement the end of all was that they agreed that it wasnt right that new zealand should be allowed to foist her criminals upon her neighbors and that i was to be sent back again by the next boat so they posted me off again as if i was a damned parcel and after another eighthundredmile journey i found myself back for the third time moving in the place that i started from  by this time i had begun to think that i was going to spend the rest of my existence traveling about from one port to another every mans hand seemed turned against me and there was no peace or quiet in any direction i was about sick of it by the time i had come back and if i could have taken to the bush id have done it and chanced it with my old pals they were too quick for me though and kept me under lock and key but i managed in spite of them to negotiate that caché i told you of and sewed the gold up in my belt i spent another month in jail and then they slipped me aboard a bark that was bound for england  this time the crew never knew who i was but the captain had a pretty good idea though he didnt let on to me that he had any suspicions i guessed from the first that the man was a villain we had a fair passage except a gale or two off the cape and i began to feel like a free man when i saw the blue loom of the old country and the saucy little pilotboat from falmouth dancing toward us over the waves we ran down the channel and before we reached gravesend i had agreed with the pilot that he should take me ashore with him when he left it was at this time that the captain showed me that i was right in thinking him a meddling disagreeable man i got my things packed such as they were and left him talking earnestly to the pilot while i went below for my breakfast when i came up again we were fairly into the mouth of the river and the boat in which i was to have gone ashore had left us the skipper said the pilot had forgotten me but that was too thin and i began to fear that all my old troubles were going to commence once more  it was not long before my suspicions were confirmed a boat darted out from the side of the river and a tall cove with a long black beard came aboard i heard him ask the mate whether they didnt need a mudpilot to take them up in the reaches but it seemed to me that he was a man who would know a deal more about handcuffs than he did about steering so i kept away from him he came across the deck however and made some remark to me taking a good look at me the while i dont like inquisitive people at any time but an inquisitive stranger with glue about the roots of his beard is the worst of all to stand especially under the circumstances i began to feel that it was time for me to go  i soon got a chance and made good use of it a big collier came athwart the bows of our steamer and we had to slacken down to dead slow there was a barge astern and i slipped down by a rope and was into the barge before any one missed me of course i had to leave my luggage behind me but i had the belt with the nuggets round my waist and the chance of shaking the police off my track was worth more than a couple of boxes it was clear to me now that the pilot had been a traitor as well as the captain and had set the detectives after me i often wish i could drop across those two men again  i hung about the barge all day as she drifted down the stream there was one man in her but she was a big ugly craft and his hands were too full for much looking about toward evening when it got a bit dusky i struck out for the shore and found myself in a sort of marsh place a good many miles to the east of london i was soaking wet and half dead with hunger but i trudged into the town got a new rigout at a slopshop and after having some supper engaged a bed at the quietest lodgings i could find  i woke pretty earlya habit you pick up in the bushand lucky for me that i did so the very first thing i saw when i took a look through a chink in the shutter was one of these infernal policemen standing right opposite and staring up at the windows he hadnt epaulets nor a sword like our traps but for all that there was a sort of family likeness and the same busybody expression whether they followed me all the time or whether the woman that let me the bed didnt like the looks of me is more than i have ever been able to find out he came across as i was watching him and noted down the address of the house in a book i was afraid that he was going to ring at the bell but i suppose his orders were simply to keep an eye on me for after another good look at the windows he moved on down the street  i saw that my only chance was to act at once i threw on my clothes opened the window softly and after making sure that there was nobody about dropped out onto the ground and made off as hard as i could run i traveled a matter of two or three miles when my wind gave out and as i saw a big building with people going in and out i went in too and found that it was a railway station a train was just going off for dover to meet the french boat so i took a ticket and jumped into a thirdclass carriage  there were a couple of other chaps in the carriage innocentlooking young beggars both of them they began speaking about this and that while i sat quiet in the corner and listened then they started on england and foreign countries and such like look ye now doctor this is a fact one of them begins jawing about the justice of englands laws its all fair and aboveboard says he there aint any secret police nor spying like they have abroad and a lot more of the same sort of wash rather rough on me wasnt it listening to the damned young fool with the police following me about like my shadow  i got to paris right enough and there i changed some of my gold and for a few days i imagined id shaken them off and began to think of settling down for a bit of rest i needed it by that time for i was looking more like a ghost than a man youve never had the police after you i suppose well you neednt look offended i didnt mean any harm if ever you had youd know that it wastes a man away like a sheep with the rot  i went to the opera one night and took a box for i was very flush i was coming out between the acts when i met a fellow lounging along in the passage the light fell on his face and i saw that it was the mudpilot that had boarded us in the thames his beard was gone but i recognized the man at a glance for ive a good memory for faces  i tell you doctor i felt desperate for a moment i could have knifed him if we had been alone but he knew me well enough never to give me the chance it was more than i could stand any longer so i went right up to him and drew him aside where wed be free from all the loungers and theatergoers  how long are you going to keep it up i asked him  he seemed a bit flustered for a moment but then he saw there was no use beating about the bush so he answered straight  until you go back to australia he said  dont you know i said that i have served the government and got a free pardon  he grinned all over his ugly face when i said this  we know all about you maloney he answered if you want a quiet life just you go back where you came from if you stay here youre a marked man and when you are found tripping itll be a lifer for you at the least free trades a fine thing but the markets too full of men like you for us to need to import any  it seemed to me that there was something in what he said though he had a nasty way of putting it for some days back id been feeling a sort of homesick the ways of the people werent my ways they stared at me in the street and if i dropped into a bar theyd stop talking and edge away a bit as if i was a wild beast id sooner have had a pint of old stringybark too than a bucketful of their rotgut liquors there was too much damned propriety what was the use of having money if you couldnt dress as you liked nor bust in properly there was no sympathy for a man if he shot about a little when he was halfover ive seen a man dropped at nelson many a time with less row than theyd make over a broken windowpane the thing was slow and i was sick of it  you want me to go back i said  ive my order to stick fast to you until you do he answered  well i said i dont care if i do all i bargain is that you keep your mouth shut and dont let on who i am so that i may have a fair start when i get there  he agreed to this and we went over to southampton the very next day where he saw me safely off once more i took a passage round to adelaide where no one was likely to know me and there i settled right under the nose of the police id been there ever since leading a quiet life but for little difficulties like the one im in for now and for that devil tattooed tom of hawkesbury i dont know what made me tell you all this doctor unless it is that being lonely makes a man inclined to jaw when he gets a chance just you take warning from me though never put yourself out to serve your country for your country will do precious little for you just you let them look after their own affairs and if they find difficulty in hanging a set of scoundrels never mind chipping in but let them alone to do as best they can maybe theyll remember how they treated me after im dead and be sorry for neglecting me i was rude to you when you came in and swore a trifle promiscuous but dont you mind me its only my way youll allow though that i have cause to be a bit touchy now and again when i think of all thats passed youre not going are you well if you must you must but i hope you will look me up at odd times when you are going your rounds oh i say youve left the balance of that cake of tobacco behind you havent you no its in your pocketthats all right thank ye doctor youre a good sort and as quick at a hint as any man ive met  a couple of months after narrating his experiences wolf tone maloney finished his term and was released for a long time i neither saw him nor heard of him and he had almost slipped from my memory until i was reminded in a somewhat tragic manner of his existence i had been attending a patient some distance off in the country and was riding back guiding my tired horse among the boulders which strewed the pathway and endeavoring to see my way through the gathering darkness when i came suddenly upon a little wayside inn as i walked my horse up toward the door intending to make sure of my bearings before proceeding further i heard the sound of a violent altercation within the little bar  there seemed to be a chorus of expostulation or remonstrance above which two powerful voices rang out loud and angry as i listened there was a momentary hush two pistol shots sounded almost simultaneously and with a crash the door burst open and a pair of dark figures staggered out into the moonlight they struggled for a moment in a deadly wrestle and then went down together among the loose stones i had sprung off my horse and with the help of half a dozen rough fellows from the bar dragged them away from one another  a glance was sufficient to convince me that one of them was dying fast he was a thickset burly fellow with a determined cast of countenance the blood was welling from a deep stab in his throat and it was evident that an important artery had been divided i turned away from him in despair and walked over to where his antagonist was lying he was shot through the lungs but managed to raise himself up on his hand as i approached and peered anxiously up into my face to my surprise i saw before me the haggard features and flaxen hair of my prison acquaintance maloney  ah doctor he said recognizing me how is he will he die  he asked the question so earnestly that i imagined he had softened at the last moment and feared to leave the world with another homicide upon his conscience truth however compelled me to shake my head mournfully and to intimate that the wound would prove a mortal one  maloney gave a wild cry of triumph which brought the blood welling out from between his lips here boys he gasped to the little group around him theres money in my inside pocket damn the expense drinks round theres nothing mean about me id drink with you but im going give the doc my share for hes as good here his head fell back with a thud his eye glazed and the soul of wolf tone maloney forger convict ranger murderer and government peach drifted away into the great unknown  i cannot conclude without borrowing the account of the fatal quarrel which appeared in the column of the west australian sentinel the curious will find it in the issue of october 41881       fatal affrayw t maloney a wellknow citizen of new      montrose and proprietor of the yellow boy gambling saloon      has met with his death under rather painful circumstances      mr maloney was a man who had led a checkered existence and      whose past history is replete with interest some of our      readers may recall the lena valley murders in which he      figured as the principal criminal it is conjectured that      during the seven months that he owned a bar in that region      from twenty to
