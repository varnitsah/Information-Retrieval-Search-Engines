58868364	by shore and sedge   by  bret harte     contents    an apostle of the tules   sarah walker   a ship of 49     by shore and sedge    an apostle of the tules  i  on october 10 1856 about four hundred people were camped in tasajara valley california  it could not have been for the prospect since a more barren dreary monotonous and uninviting landscape never stretched before human eye it could not have been for convenience or contiguity as the nearest settlement was thirty miles away it could not have been for health or salubrity as the breath of the aguehaunted tules in the outlying stockton marshes swept through the valley it could not have been for space or comfort for encamped on an unlimited plain men and women were huddled together as closely as in an urban tenementhouse without the freedom or decency of rural isolation it could not have been for pleasant companionship as dejection mental anxiety tears and lamentation were the dominant expression it was not a hurried flight from present or impending calamity for the camp had been deliberately planned and for a week pioneer wagons had been slowly arriving it was not an irrevocable exodus for some had already returned to their homes that others might take their places  it was simply a religious revival of one or two denominational sects known as a campmeeting  a large central tent served for the assembling of the principal congregation smaller tents served for prayermeetings and classrooms known to the few unbelievers as sideshows while the actual dwellings of the worshipers were rudely extemporized shanties of boards and canvas sometimes mere corrals or inclosures open to the cloudless sky or more often the unhitched covered wagon which had brought them there  the singular resemblance to a circus already profanely suggested was carried out by a straggling fringe of boys and halfgrown men on the outskirts of the encampment acrimonious with disappointed curiosity lazy without the careless ease of vagrancy and vicious without the excitement of dissipation  for the coarse poverty and brutal economy of the larger arrangements the dreary panorama of unlovely and unwholesome domestic details always before the eyes were hardly exciting to the senses  the circus might have been more dangerous but scarcely more brutalizing  the actors themselves hard and aggressive through practical struggles often warped and twisted with chronic forms of smaller diseases or malformed and crippled through carelessness and neglect and restless and uneasy through some vague mental distress and inquietude that they had added to their burdens were scarcely amusing performers  the rheumatic parkinsons from green springs the ophthalmic filgees from alder creek the aguestricken harneys from martinez bend and the feeblelimbed steptons from sugar mill might in their combined families have suggested a hospital rather than any other social assemblage  even their companionship which had little of cheerful fellowship in it would have been grotesque but for the pathetic instinct of some mutual vague appeal from the hardness of their lives and the helplessness of their conditions that had brought them together  nor was this appeal to a higher power any the less pathetic that it bore no reference whatever to their respective needs or deficiencies but was always an invocation for a light which when they believed they had found it to unregenerate eyes scarcely seemed to illumine the rugged path in which their feet were continually stumbling  one might have smiled at the idea of the vendettafollowing ferguses praying for justification by faith but the actual spectacle of old simon fergus whose shotgun was still in his wagon offering up that appeal with streaming eyes and agonized features was painful beyond a doubt  to seek and obtain an exaltation of feeling vaguely known as it or less vaguely veiling a sacred name was the burden of the general appeal  the large tent had been filled and between the exhortations a certain gloomy enthusiasm had been kept up by singing which had the effect of continuing in an easy rhythmical impersonal and irresponsible way the sympathies of the meeting  this was interrupted by a young man who rose suddenly with that spontaneity of impulse which characterized the speakers but unlike his predecessors he remained for a moment mute trembling and irresolute  the fatal hesitation seemed to check the unreasoning monotonous flow of emotion and to recall to some extent the reason and even the criticism of the worshipers  he stammered a prayer whose earnestness was undoubted whose humility was but too apparent but his words fell on faculties already benumbed by repetition and rhythm  a slight movement of curiosity in the rear benches and a whisper that it was the maiden effort of a new preacher helped to prolong the interruption  a heavy man of strong physical expression sprang to the rescue with a hysterical cry of glory and a tumultuous fluency of epithet and sacred adjuration  still the meeting wavered  with one final paroxysmal cry the powerful man threw his arms around his nearest neighbor and burst into silent tears  an anxious hush followed the speaker still continued to sob on his neighbors shoulder  almost before the fact could be commented upon it was noticed that the entire rank of worshipers on the bench beside him were crying also the second and third rows were speedily dissolved in tears until even the very youthful scoffers in the last benches suddenly found their halfhysterical laughter turned to sobs  the danger was averted the reaction was complete the singing commenced and in a few moments the hapless cause of the interruption and the man who had retrieved the disaster stood together outside the tent  a horse was picketed near them  the victor was still panting from his late exertions and was more or less diluvial in eye and nostril but neither eye nor nostril bore the slightest tremor of other expression  his face was stolid and perfectly in keeping with his physiqueheavy animal and unintelligent  ye oughter trusted in the lord he said to the young preacher  but i did responded the young man earnestly  thats it  justifyin yourself by works instead o leanin onto him find him sez you  git him sez you  works is vain  glory glory he continued with fluent vacuity and wandering dull observant eyes  but if i had a little more practice in class brother silas more education  the letter killeth interrupted brother silas  here his wandering eyes took dull cognizance of two female faces peering through the opening of the tent  no yer mishun brother gideon is to seek him in the byways in the wildernesswhere the foxes hev holes and the ravens hev their youngbut not in the temples of the people  wot sez sister parsons  one of the female faces detached itself from the tent flaps which it nearly resembled in color and brought forward an angular figure clothed in faded fustian that had taken the various shades and odors of household service  brother silas speaks well said sister parsons with stridulous fluency  its foreordained  foreordinashun is better nor ordinashun saith the lord  he shall go forth turnin neither to the right hand nor the left hand and seek him among the lost tribes and the ungodly  he shall put aside the temptashun of mammon and the flesh  her eyes and those of brother silas here both sought the other female face which was that of a young girl of seventeen  wot sez little sister meelywot sez meely parsons continued brother silas as if repeating an unctuous formula  the young girl came hesitatingly forward and with a nervous cry of oh gideon threw herself on the breast of the young man  for a moment they remained locked in each others arms  in the promiscuous and fraternal embracings which were a part of the devotional exercises of the hour the act passed without significance the young man gently raised her face  she was young and comely albeit marked with a halffrightened halfvacant sorrow  amen said brother gideon gravely  he mounted his horse and turned to go  brother silas had clasped his powerful arms around both women and was holding them in a ponderous embrace  go forth young man into the wilderness  the young man bowed his head and urged his horse forward in the bleak and barren plain  in half an hour every vestige of the camp and its unwholesome surroundings was lost in the distance  it was as if the strong desiccating wind which seemed to spring up at his horses feet had cleanly erased the flimsy structures from the face of the plain swept away the lighter breath of praise and plaint and dried up the easyflowing tears  the air was harsh but pure the grim economy of form and shade and color in the level plain was coarse but not vulgar the sky above him was cold and distant but not repellent the moisture that had been denied his eyes at the prayermeeting overflowed them here the words that had choked his utterance an hour ago now rose to his lips  he threw himself from his horse and kneeling in the withered grassa mere atom in the boundless plainlifted his pale face against the irresponsive blue and prayed  he prayed that the unselfish dream of his bitter boyhood his disappointed youth might come to pass  he prayed that he might in higher hands become the humble instrument of good to his fellowman he prayed that the deficiencies of his scant education his selftaught learning his helpless isolation and his inexperience might be overlooked or reinforced by grace  he prayed that the infinite compassion might enlighten his ignorance and solitude with a manifestation of the spirit in his very weakness he prayed for some special revelation some sign or token some visitation or gracious unbending from that coldly lifting sky  the low sun burned the black edge of the distant tules with dull eating fires as he prayed lit the dwarfed hills with a brief but ineffectual radiance and then died out the lingering trade winds fired a few volleys over its grave and then lapsed into a chilly silence  the young man staggered to his feet it was quite dark now but the coming night had advanced a few starry vedettes so near the plain they looked like human watchfires  for an instant he could not remember where he was  then a light trembled far down at the entrance of the valley  brother gideon recognized it  it was in the lonely farmhouse of the widow of the last circuit preacher    ii  the abode of the late reverend marvin hiler remained in the disorganized condition he had left it when removed from his sphere of earthly uselessness and continuous accident  the straggling fence that only half inclosed the house and barn had stopped at that point where the two deacons who had each volunteered to do a days work on it had completed their allotted time  the building of the barn had been arrested when the half load of timber contributed by sugar mill brethren was exhausted and three windows given by christian seekers at martinez painfully accented the boarded spaces for the other three that unknown friends in tasajara had promised but not yet supplied in the clearing some trees that had been felled but not taken away added to the general incompleteness  something of this unfinished character clung to the widow hiler and asserted itself in her three children one of whom was consistently posthumous  prematurely old and prematurely disappointed she had all the inexperience of girlhood with the cares of maternity and kept in her family circle the freshness of an old maids misogynistic antipathies with a certain guilty and remorseful consciousness of widowhood  she supported the meagre household to which her husband had contributed only the extra mouths to feed with reproachful astonishment and weary incapacity  she had long since grown tired of trying to make both ends meet of which she declared the lord had taken one  during her two years widowhood she had waited on providence who by a pleasing local fiction had been made responsible for the disused and castoff furniture and clothing which accompanied with scriptural texts found their way mysteriously into her few habitable rooms  the providential manna was not always fresh the ravens who fed her and her little ones with flour from the sugar mills did not always select the best quality  small wonder that sitting by her lonely hearthstonea borrowed stove that supplemented the unfinished fireplacesurrounded by her mismatched furniture and clad in misfitting garments she had contracted a habit of sniffling during her dreary watches  in her weaker moments she attributed it to grief in her stronger intervals she knew that it sprang from damp and draught  in her apathy the sound of horses hoofs at her unprotected door even at that hour neither surprised nor alarmed her  she lifted her head as the door opened and the pale face of gideon deane looked into the room she moved aside the cradle she was rocking and taking a saucepan and teacup from a chair beside her absently dusted it with her apron and pointing to the vacant seat said take a chair as quietly as if he had stepped from the next room instead of the outer darkness  ill put up my horse first said gideon gently  so do responded the widow briefly  gideon led his horse across the inclosure stumbling over the heaps of rubbish dried chips and weatherbeaten shavings with which it was strewn until he reached the unfinished barn where he temporarily bestowed his beast  then taking a rusty axe by the faint light of the stars he attacked one of the fallen trees with such energy that at the end of ten minutes he reappeared at the door with an armful of cut boughs and chips which he quietly deposited behind the stove observing that he was still standing as if looking for something the widow lifted her eyes and said ef its the bucket i reckon yell find it at the spring where one of them foolish filgee boys left it ive been that tuckered out sens sundown i aint had the ambition to go and tote it back without a word gideon repaired to the spring filled the missing bucket replaced the hoop on the loosened staves of another he found lying useless beside it and again returned to the house the widow once more pointed to the chair and gideon sat down its quite a spell sens you wos here said the widow hiler returning her foot to the cradlerocker not sens yer was ordained  ben practicin i reckon at the meetin  a slight color came into his cheek  my place is not there sister hiler he said gently its for those with the gift o tongues i go forth only a common laborer in the vineyard  he stopped and hesitated he might have said more but the widow who was familiar with that kind of humility as the ordinary perfunctory expression of her class suggested no sympathetic interest in his mission  thars a deal o talk over there she said dryly and thars folks ez thinks thars a deal o money spent in picnicking the gospel that might be given to them ez wish to spread it or to their widows and children  but that dont consarn you brother gideon  sister parsons hez money enough to settle her darter meely comfortably on her own land and ive heard tell that you and meely was only waitin till you was ordained to be jined together youll hev an easier time of it brother gideon than poor marvin hiler had she continued suppressing her tears with a certain astringency that took the place of her lost pride but the lord wills that some should be tried and some not  but i am not going to marry meely parsons said gideon quietly  the widow took her foot from the rocker  not marry meely she repeated vaguely  but relapsing into her despondent mood she continued then i reckon its true what other folks sez of brother silas braggley makin up to her and his powerful exhortin influence over her ma  folks sez ez sister parsons hez just resigned her soul inter his keepin  brother silas hez a heavenly gift said the young man with gentle enthusiasm and perhaps it may be so  if it is it is the lords will  but i do not marry meely because my life and my ways henceforth must lie far beyond her sphere of strength  i oughtnt to drag a young inexperienced soul with me to battle and struggle in the thorny paths that i must tread  i reckon you know your own mind said sister hiler grimly  but thars folks ez might allow that meely parsons aint any better than others that she shouldnt have her share o trials and keers and crosses  riches and bringin up dont exempt folks from the shadder i married marvin hiler outer a house ez good ez sister parsons and at a time when old cyrus parsons hadnt a roof to his head but the cover of the emigrant wagon he kem across the plains in  i might say ez marvin knowed pretty well wot it was to have a helpmeet in his ministration if it wasnt vanity of sperit to say it now  but the flesh is weak brother gideon  her influenza here resolved itself into unmistakable tears which she wiped away with the first article that was accessible in the workbag before her  as it chanced to be a black silk neckerchief of the deceased hiler the result was funereal suggestive but practically ineffective  you were a good wife to brother hiler said the young man gently everybody knows that  its suthin to think of since hes gone continued the widow bringing her work nearer to her eyes to adjust it to their teardimmed focus  its suthin to lay to heart in the lonely days and nights when thars no man round to fetch water and wood and lend a hand to doin chores its suthin to remember with his three children to feed and little selby the eldest that vain and useless that he cant even tote the baby round while i do the work of a hired man  its a hard trial sister hiler said gideon but the lord has his appointed time  familiar as consolation by vague quotation was to sister hiler there was an occult sympathy in the tone in which this was offered that lifted her for an instant out of her narrower self  she raised her eyes to his  the personal abstraction of the devotee had no place in the deep dark eyes that were lifted from the cradle to hers with a sad discriminating and almost womanly sympathy surprised out of her selfish preoccupation she was reminded of her apparent callousness to what might be his present disappointment perhaps it seemed strange to her too that those tender eyes should go abegging  yer takin a christian view of yer own disappointment brother gideon she said with less astringency of manner but every heart knoweth its own sorrer  ill be gettin supper now that the babys sleepin sound and yell sit by and eat  if you let me help you sister hiler said the young man with a cheerfulness that belied any overwhelming heart affection and awakened in the widow a feminine curiosity as to his real feelings to meely but her further questioning was met with a frank amiable and simple brevity that was as puzzling as the most artful periphrase of tact accustomed as she was to the loquacity of grief and the confiding prolixity of disappointed lovers she could not understand her guests quiescent attitude  her curiosity however soon gave way to the habitual contemplation of her own sorrows and she could not forego the opportune presence of a sympathizing auditor to whom she could relieve her feelings  the preparations for the evening meal were therefore accompanied by a dreary monotone of lamentation  she bewailed her lost youth her brief courtship the struggles of her early married life her premature widowhood her penurious and helpless existence the disruption of all her present ties the hopelessness of the future she rehearsed the unending plaint of those long evenings set to the music of the restless wind around her bleak dwelling with something of its stridulous reiteration  the young man listened and replied with softly assenting eyes but without pausing in the material aid that he was quietly giving her  he had removed the cradle of the sleeping child to the bedroom quieted the sudden wakefulness of pinkey rearranged the straggling furniture of the sittingroom with much order and tidiness repaired the hinges of a rebellious shutter and the lock of an unyielding door and yet had apparently retained an unabated interest in her spoken woes surprised once more into recognizing this devotion sister hiler abruptly arrested her monologue  well if you aint the handiest man i ever seed about a house  am i said gideon with suddenly sparkling eyes  do you really think so  i do  then you dont know how glad i am  his frank face so unmistakably showed his simple gratification that the widow after gazing at him for a moment was suddenly seized with a bewildering fancy  the first effect of it was the abrupt withdrawal of her eyes then a sudden effusion of blood to her forehead that finally extended to her cheekbones and then an interval of forgetfulness where she remained with a plate held vaguely in her hand  when she succeeded at last in putting it on the table instead of the young mans lap she said in a voice quite unlike her own  sho  i mean it said gideon cheerfully  after a pause in which he unostentatiously rearranged the table which the widow was abstractedly disorganizing he said gently after tea when youre not so much flustered with work and worry and more composed in spirit well have a little talk sister hiler  im in no hurry tonight and if you dont mind ill make myself comfortable in the barn with my blanket until sunup tomorrow  i can get up early enough to do some odd chores round the lot before i go  you know best brother gideon said the widow faintly and if you think its the lords will and no speshal trouble to you so do  but sakes alive its time i tidied myself a little she continued lifting one hand to her hair while with the other she endeavored to fasten a buttonless collar leavin alone the vanities o dress its ez much as one can do to keep a clean rag on with the children climbin over ye  sit by and ill be back in a minit  she retired to the back room and in a few moments returned with smoothed hair and a palmleaf broche shawl thrown over her shoulders which not only concealed the ravages made by time and maternity on the gown beneath but to some extent gave her the suggestion of being a casual visitor in her own household  it must be confessed that for the rest of the evening sister hiler rather lent herself to this idea possibly from the fact that it temporarily obliterated the children and quite removed her from any responsibility in the unpicturesque household this effect was only marred by the absence of any impression upon gideon who scarcely appeared to notice the change and whose soft eyes seemed rather to identify the miserable woman under her forced disguise he prefaced the meal with a fervent grace to which the widow listened with something of the conscious attitude she had adopted at church during her late husbands ministration and during the meal she ate with a like consciousness of company manners  later that evening selby hiler woke up in his little truckle bed listening to the rising midnight wind which in his childish fancy he confounded with the sound of voices that came through the open door of the livingroom  he recognized the deep voice of the young minister gideon and the occasional tearful responses of his mother and he was fancying himself again at church when he heard a step and the young preacher seemed to enter the room and going to the bed leaned over it and kissed him on the forehead and then bent over his little brother and sister and kissed them too  then he slowly reentered the livingroom  lifting himself softly on his elbow selby saw him go up towards his mother who was crying with her head on the table and kiss her also on the forehead then he said goodnight and the front door closed and selby heard his footsteps crossing the lot towards the barn  his mother was still sitting with her face buried in her hands when he fell asleep  she sat by the dying embers of the fire until the house was still again then she rose and wiped her eyes  ets a good thing she said going to the bedroom door and looking in upon her sleeping children ets a mercy and a blessing for them andforme butbuthe mighthevsaidheloved me    iii  although gideon deane contrived to find a nest for his blanket in the mouldy straw of the unfinished barn loft he could not sleep he restlessly watched the stars through the cracks of the boarded roof and listened to the wind that made the halfopen structure as vocal as a seashell until past midnight  once or twice he had fancied he heard the tramp of horsehoofs on the faroff trail and now it seemed to approach nearer mingled with the sound of voices gideon raised his head and looked through the doorway of the loft he was not mistaken two men had halted in the road before the house and were examining it as if uncertain if it were the dwelling they were seeking and were hesitating if they should rouse the inmates  thinking he might spare the widow this disturbance to her slumbers and possibly some alarm he rose quickly and descending to the inclosure walked towards the house as he approached the men advanced to meet him and by accident or design ranged themselves on either side  a glance showed him they were strangers to the locality  were lookin fer the preacher that lives here said one who seemed to be the elder  a man by the name o hiler i reckon  brother hiler has been dead two years responded gideon  his widow and children live here  the two men looked at each other  the younger one laughed the elder mumbled something about its being three years ago and then turning suddenly on gideon said  praps youre a preacher  i am  can you come to a dying man  i will  the two men again looked at each other  but continued gideon softly youll please keep quiet so as not to disturb the widow and her children while i get my horse  he turned away the younger man made a movement as if to stop him but the elder quickly restrained his hand  he isnt goin to run away he whispered  look he added as gideon a moment later reappeared mounted and equipped  do you think well be in time asked the young preacher as they rode quickly away in the direction of the tules  the younger repressed a laugh the other answered grimly i reckon  and is he conscious of his danger  i reckon  gideon did not speak again  but as the onus of that silence seemed to rest upon the other two the last speaker after a few moments silent and rapid riding continued abruptly you dont seem curious  of what said gideon lifting his soft eyes to the speaker  you tell me of a brother at the point of death who seeks the lord through an humble vessel like myself  he will tell me the rest  a silence still more constrained on the part of the two strangers followed which they endeavored to escape from by furious riding so that in half an hour the party had reached a point where the tules began to sap the arid plain while beyond them broadened the lagoons of the distant river  in the foreground near a clump of dwarfed willows a campfire was burning around which fifteen or twenty armed men were collected their horses picketed in an outer circle guarded by two mounted sentries  a blasted cottonwood with a single black arm extended over the tules stood ominously against the dark sky  the circle opened to receive them and closed again  the elder man dismounted and leading gideon to the blasted cottonwood pointed to a pinioned man seated at its foot with an armed guard over him he looked up at gideon with an amused smile  you said it was a dying man said gideon recoiling  he will be a dead man in half an hour returned the stranger  and you  we are the vigilantes from alamo  this man pointing to the prisoner is a gambler who killed a man yesterday  we hunted him here tried him an hour ago and found him guilty  the last man we hung here three years ago asked for a parson  we brought him the man who used to live where we found you  so we thought wed give this man the same show and brought you  and if i refuse said gideon  the leader shrugged his shoulders  thats his lookout not ours  weve given him the chance  drive ahead boys he added turning to the others the parson allows he wont take a hand  one moment said gideon in desperation one moment for the sake of that god you have brought me here to invoke in behalf of this wretched man  one moment for the sake of him in whose presence you must stand one day as he does now  with passionate earnestness he pointed out the vindictive impulse they were mistaking for divine justice with pathetic fervency he fell upon his knees and implored their mercy for the culprit  but in vain as at the campmeeting of the day before he was chilled to find his words seemed to fall on unheeding and unsympathetic ears  he looked around on their abstracted faces in their gloomy savage enthusiasm for expiatory sacrifice he was horrified to find the same unreasoning exaltation that had checked his exhortations then only one face looked upon his half mischievously half compassionately  it was the prisoners  yer wastin time on us said the leader dryly wastin his time hadnt you better talk to him  gideon rose to his feet pale and cold  he may have something to confess  may i speak with him alone he said gently  the leader motioned to the sentry to fall back  gideon placed himself before the prisoner so that in the faint light of the campfire the mans figure was partly hidden by his own  you meant well with your little bluff pardner said the prisoner not unkindly but theyve got the cards to win  kneel down with your back to me said gideon in a low voice the prisoner fell on his knees  at the same time he felt gideons hand and the gliding of steel behind his back and the severed cords hung loosely on his arms and legs  when i lift my voice to god brother said gideon softly drop on your face and crawl as far as you can in a straight line in my shadow then break for the tules  i will stand between you and their first fire  are you mad said the prisoner  do you think they wont fire lest they should hurt you  man theyll kill you the first thing  so be itif your chance is better  still on his knees the man grasped gideons two hands in his own and devoured him with his eyes  you mean it  i do  then said the prisoner quietly i reckon ill stop and hear what youve got to say about god until theyre ready  you refuse to fly  i reckon i was never better fitted to die than now said the prisoner still grasping his hand  after a pause he added in a lower tone i cant praybuti think he hesitated i think i could manage to ring in a hymn  will you try brother  yes  with their hands tightly clasped together gideon lifted his gentle voice  the air was a common one familiar in the local religious gatherings and after the first verse one or two of the sullen lookerson joined unkindly in the refrain  but as he went on the air and words seemed to offer a vague expression to the dull lowering animal emotion of the savage concourse and at the end of the second verse the refrain augmented in volume and swelled by every voice in the camp swept out over the hollow plain  it was met in the distance by a faroff cry  with an oath taking the place of his supplication the leader sprang to his feet  but too late  the cry was repeated as a nearer slogan of defiancethe plain shookthere was the tempestuous onset of furious hoofsa dozen shotsthe scattering of the embers of the campfire into a thousand vanishing sparks even as the lurid gathering of savage humanity was dispersed and dissipated over the plain and gideon and the prisoner stood alone  but as the sheriff of contra costa with his rescuing posse swept by the man they had come to save fell forward in gideons arms with a bullet in his breastthe parthian shot of the flying vigilante leader  the eager crowd that surged around him with outstretched helping hands would have hustled gideon aside  but the wounded man roused himself and throwing an arm around the young preachers neck warned them back with the other  stand back he gasped  he risked his life for mine  look at him boys  wanted ter stand up twixt them hounds and me and draw their fire on himself  aint he just hell he stopped an apologetic smile crossed his lips  i clean forgot pardner but its all right  i said i was ready to go and i am  his arm slipped from gideons neck he slid to the ground he had fainted  a dark militarylooking man pushed his way through the crowdthe surgeon one of the posse accompanied by a younger man fastidiously dressed  the former bent over the unconscious prisoner and tore open his shirt the latter followed his movements with a flush of anxious inquiry in his handsome careless face  after a moments pause the surgeon without looking up answered the young mans mute questioning better send the sheriff here at once jack  he is here responded the official joining the group  the surgeon looked up at him  i am afraid theyve put the case out of your jurisdiction sheriff he said grimly  its only a matter of a day or two at bestperhaps only a few hours  but he wont live to be taken back to jail  will he live to go as far as martinez asked the young man addressed as jack  with care perhaps  will you be responsible for him jack hamlin said the sheriff suddenly  i will  then take him  stay hes coming to  the wounded man slowly opened his eyes  they fell upon jack hamlin with a pleased look of recognition but almost instantly and anxiously glanced around as if seeking another  leaning over him jack said gayly theyve passed you over to me old man are you willing  the wounded mans eyes assented but still moved restlessly from side to side  is there any one you want to go with you  yes said the eyes  the doctor of course  the eyes did not answer  gideon dropped on his knees beside him a ray of light flashed in the helpless mans eyes and transfigured his whole face  you want him said jack incredulously  yes said the eyes  whatthe preacher  the lips struggled to speak  everybody bent down to hear his reply  you bet he said faintly    iv  it was early morning when the wagon containing the wounded man gideon jack hamlin and the surgeon crept slowly through the streets of martinez and stopped before the door of the palmetto shades  the upper floor of this saloon and hostelry was occupied by mr hamlin as his private lodgings and was fitted up with the usual luxury and more than the usual fastidiousness of his extravagant class  as the dusty and travelworn party trod the soft carpets and brushed aside their silken hangings in their slow progress with their helpless burden to the lacecanopied and snowy couch of the young gambler it seemed almost a profanation of some feminine seclusion  gideon to whom such luxury was unknown was profoundly troubled  the voluptuous ease and sensuousness the refinements of a life of irresponsible indulgence affected him with a physical terror to which in his late moment of real peril he had been a stranger the gilding and mirrors blinded his eyes even the faint perfume seemed to him an unhallowed incense and turned him sick and giddy  accustomed as he had been to disease and misery in its humblest places and meanest surroundings the wounded desperado lying in laces and fine linen seemed to him monstrous and unnatural it required all his selfabnegation all his sense of duty all his deep pity and all the instinctive tact which was born of his gentle thoughtfulness for others to repress a shrinking  but when the miserable cause of all again opened his eyes and sought gideons hand he forgot it all  happily hamlin who had been watching him with wondering but critical eyes mistook his concern  dont you worry about that ginmill and hashgymnasium downstairs he said  ive given the proprietor a thousand dollars to shut up shop as long as this thing lasts that this was done from some delicate sense of respect to the preachers domiciliary presence and not entirely to secure complete quiet and seclusion for the invalid was evident from the fact that mr hamlins drawing and dining rooms and even the hall were filled with eager friends and inquirers  it was discomposing to gideon to find himself almost an equal subject of interest and curiosity to the visitors  the story of his simple devotion had lost nothing by report hats were doffed in his presence that might have grown to their wearers heads the boldest eyes dropped as he passed by he had only to put his pale face out of the bedroom door and the loudest discussion heated by drink or affection fell to a whisper  the surgeon who had recognized the one dominant wish of the hopelessly sinking man gravely retired leaving gideon a few simple instructions and directions for their use  hell last as long as he has need of you he said respectfully  my art is only second here  god help you both  when he wakes make the most of your time  in a few moments he did waken and as before turned his fading look almost instinctively on the faithful gentle eyes that were watching him  how gideon made the most of his time did not transpire but at the end of an hour when the dying man had again lapsed into unconsciousness he softly opened the door of the sittingroom  hamlin started hastily to his feet  he had cleared the room of his visitors and was alone  he turned a moment towards the window before he faced gideon with inquiring but curiouslyshining eyes  well he said hesitatingly  do you know kate somers asked gideon  hamlin opened his brown eyes  yes  can you send for her  what here  yes here  what for  to marry him said gideon gently  theres no time to lose  to marry him  he wishes it  but sayoh come now said hamlin confidentially leaning back with his hands on the top of a chair  aint this playing it a littlejust a littletoo low down  of course you mean well and all that but come now saycouldnt you just let up on him there  why shehamlin softly closed the doorshes got no character  the more reason he should give her one  a cynical knowledge of matrimony imparted to him by the wives of others evidently colored mr hamlins views  well perhaps its all the same if hes going to die  but isnt it rather rough on her  i dont know he added reflectively she was sniveling round here a little while ago until i sent her away  you sent her away echoed gideon  i did  why  because you were here  nevertheless mr hamlin departed and in half an hour reappeared with two brilliantly dressed women  one hysterical tearful frightened and pallid was the destined bride the other highly colored excited and pleasedly observant was her friend  two men hastily summoned from the anteroom as witnesses completed the group that moved into the bedroom and gathered round the bed  the ceremony was simple and brief  it was well for of all who took part in it none was more shaken by emotion than the officiating priest the brilliant dresses of the women the contrast of their painted faces with the waxen pallor of the dying man the terrible incongruity of their voices inflections expressions and familiarity the mingled perfume of cosmetics and the faint odor of wine the eyes of the younger woman following his movements with strange absorption so affected him that he was glad when he could fall on his knees at last and bury his face in the pillow of the sufferer  the hand that had been placed in the brides cold fingers slipped from them and mechanically sought gideons again  the significance of the unconscious act brought the first spontaneous tears into the womans eyes  it was his last act for when gideons voice was again lifted in prayer the spirit for whom it was offered had risen with it as it were still lovingly hand in hand from the earth forever  the funeral was arranged for two days later and gideon found that his services had been so seriously yet so humbly counted upon by the friends of the dead man that he could scarce find it in his heart to tell them that it was the function of the local preacheran older and more experienced man than himself  if it is said jack hamlin coolly im afraid he wont get a yaller dog to come to his church but if you say youll preach at the grave there aint a man woman or child that will be kept away  dont you go back on your luck now its something awful and niggerlike youve got this crowd where the hair is short excuse me but its so  talk of revivals  you could give that onehorse show in tasajara a hundred points and skunk them easily  indeed had gideon been accessible to vanity the spontaneous homage he met with everywhere would have touched him more sympathetically and kindly than it did but in the utter unconsciousness of his own power and the quality they worshiped in him he felt alarmed and impatient of what he believed to be their weak sympathy with his own human weakness  in the depth of his unselfish heart lit it must be confessed only by the scant inefficient lamp of his youthful experience he really believed he had failed in his apostolic mission because he had been unable to touch the hearts of the vigilantes by oral appeal and argument  feeling thus the reverence of these irreligious people that surrounded him the facile yielding of their habits and prejudices to his halfuttered wish appeared to him only a temptation of the flesh  no one had sought him after the manner of the campmeeting he had converted the wounded man through a common weakness of their humanity  more than that he was conscious of a growing fascination for the truthfulness and sincerity of that class particularly of mr jack hamlin whose conversion he felt he could never attempt yet whose strange friendship alternately thrilled and frightened him  it was the evening before the funeral  the coffin half smothered in wreaths and flowers stood upon trestles in the anteroom a large silver plate bearing an inscription on which for the second time gideon read the name of the man he had converted  it was a name associated on the frontier so often with reckless hardihood dissipation and blood that even now gideon trembled at his presumption and was chilled by a momentary doubt of the efficiency of his labor  drawing unconsciously nearer to the mute subject of his thoughts he threw his arms across the coffin and buried his face between them  a stream of soft music the echo of some forgotten song seemed to gideon to suddenly fill and possess the darkened room and then to slowly die away like the opening and shutting of a door upon a flood of golden radiance  he listened with hushed breath and a beating heart  he had never heard anything like it before  again the strain arose the chords swelled round him until from their midst a tenor voice broke high and steadfast like a star in troubled skies  gideon scarcely breathed  it was a hymnbut such a hymn  he had never conceived there could be such beautiful words joined to such exquisite melody and sung with a grace so tender and true  what were all other hymns to this ineffable yearning for light for love and for infinite rest  thrilled and exalted gideon felt his doubts pierced and scattered by that illuminating cry  suddenly he rose and with a troubled thought pushed open the door to the sittingroom  it was mr jack hamlin sitting before a parlor organ  the music ceased  it was you stammered gideon  jack nodded struck a few chords by way of finish and then wheeled round on the musicstool towards gideon  his face was slightly flushed  yes  i used to be the organist and tenor in our church in the states  i used to snatch the sinners baldheaded with that do you know i reckon ill sing that tomorrow if you like and maybe afterwards wellbuthe stoppedwell talk of that after the funeral  its business  seeing gideon still glancing with a troubled air from the organ to himself he said would you like to try that hymn with me  come on  he again struck the chords  as the whole room seemed to throb with the music gideon felt himself again carried away  glancing over jacks shoulders he could read the words but not the notes yet having a quick ear for rhythm he presently joined in with a deep but uncultivated baritone  together they forgot everything else and at the end of an hour were only recalled by the presence of a silently admiring concourse of votiveoffering friends who had gathered round them  the funeral took place the next day at the grave dug in the public cemeterya green area fenced in by the palisading tules  the words of gideon were brief but humble the strongest partisan of the dead man could find no fault in a confession of human frailty in which the speaker humbly confessed his share and when the hymn was started by hamlin and taken up by gideon the vast multitude drawn by interest and curiosity joined as in a solemn amen  later when those two strangelyassorted friends had returned to mr hamlins rooms previous to gideons departure the former in a manner more serious than his habitual cynical goodhumor began i said i had to talk business with you  the boys about here want to build a church for you and are ready to plank the money down if youll say its a go you understand they arent asking you to run in opposition to that gospel sharpexcuse methats here now nor do they want you to run a side show in connection with it  they want you to be independent they dont pin you down to any kind of religion you know whatever you care to give themmethodist roman catholic presbyterianis mighty good enough for them if youll expound it  you might give a little of each or one on one day and one anothertheyll never know the difference if you only mix the drinks yourself  theyll give you a house and guarantee you fifteen hundred dollars the first year  he stopped and walked towards the window  the sunlight that fell upon his handsome face seemed to call back the careless smile to his lips and the reckless fire to his brown eyes  i dont suppose theres a man among them that wouldnt tell you all this in a great deal better way than i do  but the darned foolsexcuse mewould have me break it to you  why i dont know  i neednt tell you i like younot only for what you did for georgebut i like you for your stylefor yourself  and i want you to accept  you could keep these rooms till they got a house ready for you  togetheryou and mewed make that organ howl  but because i like itbecause its everything to usand nothing to you it dont seem square for me to ask it  does it  gideon replied by taking hamlins hand  his face was perfectly pale but his look collected  he had not expected this offer and yet when it was made he felt as if he had known it beforeas if he had been warned of itas if it was the great temptation of his life  watching him with an earnestness only slightly overlaid by his usual manner hamlin went on  i know it would be lonely here and a man like you ought to have a wife for he slightly lifted his eyebrowsfor examples sake i heard there was a young lady in the case over there in tasajarabut the old people didnt see it on account of your position theyd jump at it now  eh  no  well continued jack with a decent attempt to conceal his cynical relief perhaps those boys have been so eager to find out all they could do for you that theyve been sold  perhaps were making equal fools of ourselves now in asking you to stay  but dont say no just yettake a day or a week to think of it  gideon still pale but calm cast his eyes around the elegant room at the magic organ then upon the slight handsome figure before him  i will think of it he said in a low voice as he pressed jacks hand and if i accept you will find me here tomorrow afternoon at this time if i do not you will know that i keep with me wherever i go the kindness the brotherly love and the grace of god that prompts your offer even though he withholds from me his blessed light which alone can make me know his wish  he stopped and hesitated  if you love me jack dont ask me to stay but pray for that light which alone can guide my feet back to you or take me hence for ever  he once more tightly pressed the hand of the embarrassed man before him and was gone  passersby on the martinez road that night remembered a mute and ghostly rider who heedless of hail or greeting moved by them as in a trance or vision  but the widow hiler the next morning coming from the spring found no abstraction or preoccupation in the soft eyes of gideon deane as he suddenly appeared before her and gently relieved her of the bucket she was carrying  a quick flash of color over her brow and cheekbone as if a hot iron had passed there and a certain astringent coyness would have embarrassed any other man than him  sho its you  i reckned id seen the last of you  you dont mean that sister hiler said gideon with a gentle smile  well what with the report of your goins on at martinez and improvin the occasion of that sinners death and leadin a revival i reckoned yould hev forgotten low folks at tasajara and if your goin to be settled there in a new church with new hearers i reckon youll want new surroundings too  things change and young folks change with em  they had reached the house  her breath was quick and short as if she and not gideon had borne the burden  he placed the bucket in its accustomed place and then gently took her hand in his  the act precipitated the last drop of feeble coquetry she had retained and the old tears took its place  let us hope for the last time for as gideon stooped and lifted her ailing babe in his strong arms he said softly whatever god has wrought for me since we parted i know now he has called me to but one work  and that work she asked tremulously  to watch over the widow and fatherless  and with gods blessing sister and his holy ordinance i am here to stay     sarah walker  it was very hot  not a breath of air was stirring throughout the western wing of the greyport hotel and the usual feverish life of its four hundred inmates had succumbed to the weather  the great veranda was deserted the corridors were desolated no footfall echoed in the passages the lazy rustle of a wandering skirt or a passing sigh that was half a pant seemed to intensify the heated silence  an intoxicated bee disgracefully unsteady in wing and leg who had been holding an inebriated conversation with himself in the corner of my window pane had gone to sleep at last and was snoring  the errant prince might have entered the slumberous halls unchallenged and walked into any of the darkened rooms whose open doors gaped for more air without awakening the veriest greyport flirt with his salutation  at times a drowsy voice a lazily interjected sentence an incoherent protest a longdrawn phrase of saccharine tenuity suddenly broke off with a gasp came vaguely to the ear as if indicating a halfsuspended halfarticulated existence somewhere but not definite enough to indicate conversation  in the midst of this there was the sudden crying of a child  i looked up from my work  through the camera of my jealously guarded window i could catch a glimpse of the vivid quivering blue of the sky the glittering intensity of the ocean the long motionless leaves of the horsechestnut in the roadall utterly inconsistent with anything as active as this lamentation  i stepped to the open door and into the silent hall  apparently the noise had attracted the equal attention of my neighbors a vague chorus of sarah walker in querulous recognition of o lord that child again in hopeless protest rose faintly from the different rooms  as the lamentations seemed to approach nearer the visitors doors were successively shut swift footsteps hurried along the hall past my open door came a momentary vision of a heated nursemaid carrying a tumultuous chaos of frilled skirts flying sash rebellious slippers and tossing curls there was a moments rallying struggle before the room nearly opposite mine and then a door opened and shut upon the vision  it was sarah walker  everybody knew her few had ever seen more of her than this passing vision  in the great hall in the diningroom in the vast parlors in the garden in the avenue on the beach a sound of lamentation had always been followed by this same brief apparition was there a sudden pause among the dancers and a subjugation of the loudest bassoons in the early evening hop the explanation was given in the words sarah walker  was there a wild confusion among the morning bathers on the sands people whispered sarah walker  a panic among the waiters at dinner an interruption in the sunday sacred concert a disorganization of the afterdinner promenade on the veranda was instantly referred to sarah walker nor were her efforts confined entirely to public life in cozy corners and darkened recesses bearded lips withheld the amorous declaration to mutter sarah walker between their clenched teeth coy and bashful tongues found speech at last in the rapid formulation of sarah walker  nobody ever thought of abbreviating her full name  the two people in the hotel otherwise individualized but known only as sarah walkers father and sarah walkers mother and never as mr and mrs walker addressed her only as sarah walker two animals that were occasionally a part of this passing pageant were known as sarah walkers dog and sarah walkers cat and later it was my proud privilege to sink my own individuality under the title of that friend of sarah walkers  it must not be supposed that she had attained this baleful eminence without some active criticism  every parent in the greyport hotel had held his or her theory of the particular defects of sarah walkers education every virgin and bachelor had openly expressed views of the peculiar discipline that was necessary to her subjugation  it may be roughly estimated that she would have spent the entire nine years of her active life in a dark cupboard on an exclusive diet of bread and water had this discipline obtained while on the other hand had the educational theories of the parental assembly prevailed she would have ere this shone an etherealized essence in the angelic host  in either event she would have ceased from troubling which was the general greyport idea of higher education  a paper read before our literary society on sarah walker and other infantile diseases was referred to in the catalogue as walker sarah prevention and cure while the usual burlesque legislation of our summer season culminated in the act entitled an act to amend an act entitled an act for the abatement of sarah walker  as she was hereafter exclusively to be fed on the provisions of this act some idea of its general tone may be gathered it was a singular fact in this point of her history that her natural progenitors not only offered no resistance to the doubtful celebrity of their offspring but by hopelessly accepting the situation to some extent posed as sarah walkers victims  mr and mrs walker were known to be rich respectable and indulgent to their only child  they themselves had been evolved from a previous generation of promiscuously acquired wealth into the repose of inherited property but it was currently accepted that sarah had cast back and reincarnated some waif on the deck of an emigrant ship at the beginning of the century  such was the child separated from me by this portentous history a narrow passage and a closed nursery door  presently however the door was partly opened again as if to admit the air  the crying had ceased but in its place the monotonous voice of conscience for the moment personated by sarah walkers nursemaid kept alive a drowsy recollection of sarah walkers transgressions  you see said the voice what a dreadful thing it is for a little girl to go on as you do  i am astonished at you sarah walker  so is everybody so is the good ladies next door so is the kind gentleman opposite so is all  where you expect to go to evin only knows  how you expect to be forgiven saints alone can tell  but so it is always and yet you keep it up  and wouldnt you like it different sarah walker  wouldnt you like to have everybody love you  wouldnt you like them good ladies next door and that nice gentleman opposite all to kinder rise up and say oh what a dear good little girl sarah walker is  the interpolation of a smacking sound of lips as if in unctuous anticipation of sarah walkers virtue here ensuedoh what a dear good sweet lovely little girl sarah walker is  there was a dead silence  it may have been fancy but i thought that some of the doors in the passage creaked softly as if in listening expectation  then the silence was broken by a sigh  had sarah walker ingloriously succumbed  rash and impotent conclusion  i dont said sarah walkers voice slowly rising until it broke on the crest of a mountainous sob idontwantemtolove me idont wantemto saywhat adeargoodlittle girlsarah walker is  she caught her breath  iwantemto saywhat a naughtybaddirtyhorridfilthylittle girl sarah walker isso i do  there  the doors slammed all along the passages  the dreadful issue was joined  i softly crossed the hall and looked into sarah walkers room  the light from a halfopened shutter fell full upon her rebellious little figure  she had stiffened herself in a large easychair into the attitude in which she had been evidently deposited there by the nurse whose tornoff apron she still held rigidly in one hand  her shapely legs stood out before her jointless and inflexible to the point of her tiny shoesa pose copied with pathetic fidelity by the french doll at her feet  the attitude must have been dreadfully uncomfortable and maintained only as being replete with some vague insults to the person who had put her down as exhibiting a wild indecorum of silken stocking  a mystified kittensarah walkers inseparablewas held as rigidly under one arm with equal dumb aggressiveness  following the stiff line of her halfrecumbent figure her head suddenly appeared perpendicularly erectyet the only mobile part of her body  a dazzling sunburst of silky hair the color of burnished copper partly hid her neck and shoulders and the back of the chair  her eyes were a darker shade of the same colorthe orbits appearing deeper and larger from the rubbing in of habitual tears from long wet lashes  nothing so far seemed inconsistent with her infelix reputation but strange to say her other features were marked by delicacy and refinement and her mouththat sorely exercised and justly dreaded memberwas small and pretty albeit slightly dropped at the corners  the immediate effect of my intrusion was limited solely to the nursemaid  swooping suddenly upon sarah walkers too evident deshabille she made two or three attempts to pluck her into propriety but the child recognizing the cause as well as the effect looked askance at me and only stiffened herself the more sarah walker im shocked  it aint his room anyway said sarah eying me malevolently whats he doing here  there was so much truth in this that i involuntarily drew back abashed the nursemaid ejaculated sarah and lifted her eyes in hopeless protest  and he neednt come seeing you continued sarah lazily rubbing the back of her head against the chair my papa dont allow it he warned you bout the other gentleman you know  sarah walker  i felt it was necessary to say something  dont you want to come with me and look at the sea i said with utter feebleness of invention  to my surprise instead of actively assaulting me sarah walker got up shook her hair over her shoulders and took my hand  with your hair in that state almost screamed the domestic  but sarah walker had already pulled me into the hall  what particularly offensive form of opposition to authority was implied in this prompt assent to my proposal i could only darkly guess for myself i knew i must appear to her a weak impostor  what would there possibly be in the sea to interest sarah walker  for the moment i prayed for a waterspout a shipwreck a whale or any marine miracle to astound her and redeem my character  i walked guiltily down the hall holding her hand bashfully in mine  i noticed that her breast began to heave convulsively if she cried i knew i should mingle my tears with hers we reached the veranda in gloomy silence  as i expected the sea lay before us glittering in the sunvacant staring flat and hopelessly and unquestionably uninteresting  i knew it all along said sarah walker turning down the corners of her mouth there never was anything to see  i know why you got me to come here  you want to tell me if im a good girl youll take me to sail some day  you want to say if im bad the sea will swallow me up thats all you want you horrid thing you  hush i said pointing to the corner of the veranda  a desperate idea of escape had just seized me  bolt upright in the recess of a window sat a nursemaid who had succumbed to sleep equally with her helpless charge in the perambulator beside her  i instantly recognized the infanta popular organism known as baby bucklythe prodigy of the greyport hotel the pet of its enthusiastic womanhood fat and featureless pink and pincushiony it was borrowed by gushing maidenhood exchanged by idiotic maternity and had grown unctuous and tumefacient under the kisses and embraces of half the hotel  even in its present repose it looked moist and shiny from indiscriminate and promiscuous osculation  lets borrow baby buckly i said recklessly  sarah walker at once stopped crying  i dont know how she did it but the cessation was instantaneous as if she had turned off a tap somewhere  and put it in mr peters bed i continued  peters being notoriously a grim bachelor the bare suggestion bristled with outrage  sarah walkers eyes sparkled  you dont mean itgo wayshe said with affected coyness  but i do  come  we extracted it noiselessly togetherthat is sarah walker did with deft womanlinesscarried it darkly along the hall to no 27 and deposited it in peters bed where it lay like a freshly opened oyster we then returned hand in hand to my room where we looked out of the window on the sea  it was observable that there was no lack of interest in sarah walker now  before five minutes had elapsed some one breathlessly passed the open door while we were still engaged in marine observation  this was followed by return footsteps and a succession of swiftly rustling garments until the majority of the women in our wing had apparently passed our room and we saw an irregular stream of nursemaids and mothers converging towards the hotel out of the grateful shadow of arbors trees and marquees  in fact we were still engaged in observation when sarah walkers nurse came to fetch her away and to inform her that by rights baby bucklys nurse and mr peters should both be made to leave the hotel that very night  sarah walker permitted herself to be led off with dry but expressive eyes  that evening she did not cry but on being taken into the usual custody for disturbance was found to be purple with suppressed laughter  this was the beginning of my intimacy with sarah walker  but while it was evident that whatever influence i obtained over her was due to my being particeps criminis i think it was accepted that a regular abduction of infants might become in time monotonous if not dangerous so she was satisfied with the knowledge that i could not now without the most glaring hypocrisy obtrude a moral superiority upon her  i do not think she would have turned state evidence and accused me but i was by no means assured of her disinterested regard  she contented herself for a few days afterwards with meeting me privately and mysteriously communicating unctuous reminiscences of our joint crime without suggesting a repetition  her intimacy with me did not seem to interfere with her general relations to her own species in the other children in the hotel  perhaps i should have said before that her popularity with them was by no means prejudiced by her infelix reputation  but while she was secretly admired by all she had few professed followers and no regular associates  whether the few whom she selected for that baleful preeminence were either torn from her by horrified guardians or came to grief through her dangerous counsels or whether she really did not care for them i could not say  their elevation was brief their retirement unregretted  it was however permitted me through felicitous circumstances to become acquainted with the probable explanation of her unsociability  the very hot weather culminated one afternoon in a dead faint of earth and sea and sky  an alpine cloudland of snow that had mocked the upturned eyes of greyport for hours began to darken under the folding shadow of a black and velvety wing  the atmosphere seemed to thicken as the gloom increased the lazy dust thrown up by hurrying feet that sought a refuge hung almost motionless in the air  suddenly it was blown to the four quarters in one fierce gust that as quickly dispersed the loungers drooping in shade and cover for a few seconds the long avenue was lost in flying clouds of dust and then was left bare of life or motion  raindrops in huge stars and rosettes appeared noiselessly and magically upon the sidewalksgouts of moisture apparently dropped from midair  and then the ominous hush returned  a mile away along the rocks i turned for shelter into a cavernous passage of the overhanging cliff where i could still watch the coming storm upon the sea  a murmur of voices presently attracted my attention  i then observed that the passage ended in a kind of open grotto where i could dimly discern the little figures of several children who separated from their nurses in the sudden onset of the storm had taken refuge there  as the gloom deepened they became silent again until the stillness was broken by a familiar voice there was no mistaking itit was sarah walkers but it was not lifted in lamentation it was raised only as if resuming a suspended narrative  her name said sarah walker gloomily was kribbles  she was the only childofof orphaned parentage and fair to see but she was bad and god did not love her  and one day she was separated from her nurse on a desert island like to this  and then came a hidgeous thunderstorm  and a great big thunderbolt came galumping after her and it ketched her and rolled all over herso and then it came back and ketched her and rolled her overso  and when they came to pick her up there was not so much as that left of her  all burnt up  wasnt there just a little bit of her shoe suggested a cautious auditor  not a bit said sarah walker firmly  all the other children echoed not a bit indignantly in evident gratification at the completeness of kribbles catastrophe  at this moment the surrounding darkness was suddenly filled with a burst of blue celestial fire the heavy inky sea beyond the blackedged mourning horizon the gleaming sands each nook and corner of the dripping cave with the frightened faces of the huddled group of children started into vivid life for an instant and then fell back with a deafening crash into the darkness  there was a slight sound of whimpering  sarah walker apparently pounced upon the culprit for it ceased  sniffling tracts lectricity she said sententiously  but you thaid it wath dod lisped a casuist of seven  its all the same said sarah sharply and sos asking questions  this obscure statement was however apparently understood for the casuist lapsed into silent security  lots of things tracts it continued sarah walker  gold and silver and metals and knives and rings  and pennies  and pennies most of all  kribbles was that vain she used to wear jewelry and fly in the face of providence  but you thaid  will youthere you hear that  there was another blinding flash and bounding roll of thunder along the shore  i wonder you didnt ketch it  you wouldonly im here  all was quiet again but from certain indications it was evident that a collection of those dangerous articles that had proved fatal to the unhappy kribbles was being taken up  i could hear the clink of coins and jingle of ornaments  that sarah herself was the custodian was presently shown  but wont the lightning come to you now asked a timid voice  no said sarah promptly cause i aint afraid  look  a frightened protest from the children here ensued but the next instant she appeared at the entrance of the grotto and ran down the rocks towards the sea  skipping from bowlder to bowlder she reached the furthest projection of the ledge now partly submerged by the rising surf and then turned half triumphantly half defiantly towards the grotto  the weird phosphorescence of the storm lit up the resolute little figure standing there gorgeously bedecked with the chains rings and shiny trinkets of her companions  with a tiny hand raised in mock defiance of the elements she seemed to lean confidingly against the panting breast of the gale with fluttering skirt and flying tresses  then the vault behind her cracked with three jagged burning fissures a weird flame leaped upon the sand there was a cry of terror from the grotto echoed by a scream of nurses on the cliff a deluge of rain a terrific onset from the galeandsarah walker was gone nothing of the kind  when i reached the ledge after a severe struggle with the storm i found sarah on the leeward side drenched but delighted  i held her tightly while we waited for a lull to regain the cliff and took advantage of the sympathetic situation  but you know you were frightened sarah i whispered you thought of what happened to poor kribbles  do you know who kribbles was she asked confidentially  no  well she whispered i made kribbles up  and the hidgeous storm and thunderboltand the burning  all out of my own head  the only immediate effect of this escapade was apparently to precipitate and bring into notoriety the growing affection of an obscure lover of sarah walkers hitherto unsuspected  he was a mild inoffensive boy of twelve known as warts solely from an inordinate exhibition of these youthful excrescences  on the day of sarah walkers adventure his passion culminated in a sudden and illogical attack upon sarahs nurse and parents while they were bewailing her conduct and in assaulting them with his feet and hands  whether he associated them in some vague way with the cause of her momentary peril or whether he only wished to impress her with the touching flattery of a general imitation of her style i cannot say  for his lovemaking was peculiar  a day or two afterwards he came to my open door and remained for some moments bashfully looking at me  the next day i found him standing by my chair in the piazza with an embarrassed air and in utter inability to explain his conduct  at the end of a rapid walk on the sand one morning i was startled by the sound of hurried breath and looking around discovered the staggering warts quite exhausted by endeavoring to keep up with me on his short legs at last the daily recurrence of his haunting presence forced a dreadful suspicion upon me  warts was courting me for sarah walker  yet it was impossible to actually connect her with these mute attentions you want me to give them to sarah walker i said cheerfully one afternoon as he laid upon my desk some peculiarly uninviting crustacea which looked not unlike a few detached excrescences from his own hands  he shook his head decidedly  i understand i continued confidently you want me to keep them for her  no said warts doggedly  then you only want me to tell her how nice they are  the idea was apparently so shamelessly true that he blushed himself hastily into the passage and ceased any future contribution  naturally still more ineffective was the slightest attempt to bring his devotion into the physical presence of sarah walker  the most ingenious schemes to lure him into my room while she was there failed utterly  yet he must have at one time basked in her baleful presence  do you like warts i asked her one day bluntly  yes said sarah walker with cheerful directness aint he got a lot of emthough he used to have more but she added reflectively do you know the little ilsey boy  i was compelled to admit my ignorance  well she said with a reminiscent sigh of satisfaction hes got only two toes on his left footshowed em to me  and he was born so  need it be said that in these few words i read the dismal sequel of warts unfortunate attachment his accidental eccentricity was no longer attractive  what were his evanescent accretions subject to improvement or removal beside the hereditary and settled malformations of his rival  once only in this brief summer episode did sarah walker attract the impulsive and general sympathy of greyport  it is only just to her consistency to say it was through no fault of hers unless a characteristic exposure which brought on a chill and diphtheria could be called her own act  howbeit towards the close of the season when a sudden suggestion of the coming autumn had crept one knew not how into the heart of a perfect day when even a return of the summer warmth had a suspicion of hecticon one of these days sarah walker was missed with the bees and the butterflies  for two days her voice had not been heard in hall or corridor nor had the sunshine of her french marigold head lit up her familiar places  the two days were days of relief yet mitigated with a certain uneasy apprehension of the return of sarah walker ormore alarming thoughtthe sarah walker element in a more appalling form  so strong was this impression that an unhappy infant who unwittingly broke this interval with his maiden outcry was nearly lynched  were not going to stand that from you you know was the crystallized sentiment of a brutal bachelor  in fact it began to be admitted that greyport had been accustomed to sarah walkers ways  in the midst of this it was suddenly whispered that sarah walker was lying dangerously ill and was not expected to live  then occurred one of those strange revulsions of human sentiment which at first seem to point the dawning of a millennium of poetic justice but which in this case ended in merely stirring the languid pulses of society into a hectic fever and in making sympathy for sarah walker an insincere and exaggerated fashion morning and afternoon visits to her apartment with extravagant offerings were de rigueur bulletins were issued three times a day an allusion to her condition was the recognized preliminary to all conversation advice suggestions and petitions to restore the baleful existence flowed readily from the same facile invention that had once proposed its banishment until one afternoon the shadow had drawn so close that even folly withheld its careless feet before it and laid down its feeble tinkling bells and gaudy cap tremblingly on the threshold  but the sequel must be told in more vivid words than mine  whin i saw that angel lyin there said sarah walkers nurse as white if ye plaze as if the whole blessed blood of her body had gone to make up the beautiful glory of her hair speechless as she was i thought i saw a sort of longin in her eyes  is it anythin youll be wantin sarah darlint sez her mother with a thremblin voice afore its lavin us ye are  is it the ministher yer askin for love sez she  and sarah looked at me and if it was the last words i spake her lips moved and she whispered scotty  wirra wirra sez the mother its wanderin she is the darlin for scotty dont ye see was the grand barkeeper of the hotel  savin yer presence maam sez i and the childs here ez is half a saint already its thruth shes spakinits scotty she wants and with that my angel blinks wid her black eyes yes  bring him says the docthor at once  and they bring him in wid all the mustachios and moighty fine curls of him and his diamonds rings and pins all aglistening just like his eyes when he set em on that suffering saint  is it anythin youre wantin sarah dear sez he thryin to spake firm  and sarah looks at him and then looks at a tumbler on the table  is it a bit of a cocktail the likes of the one i made for ye last sunday unbeknownst sez he looking round mortal afraid of the parents  and sarah walkers eyes said it is  then the ministher groaned but the docthor jumps to his feet  bring it sez he and howld your jaw an yes a christian sowl and he brought it  an afther the first sip the child lifts herself up on one arm and sez with a swate smile and a toss of the glass  i looks towards you scotty sez she  i observes you and bows miss sez he makin as if he was dhrinkin wid her  heres another nail in yer coffin old man sez she winkin  and heres the hair all off your head miss sez he quite aisily tossin back the joke betwixt em  and with that she dhrinks it off and lies down and goes to sleep like a lamb and wakes up wid de rosy dawn in her cheeks and the morthal seekness gone forever                                                 thus sarah walker recovered  whether the fact were essential to the moral conveyed in these pages i leave the reader to judge  i was leaning on the terrace of the kronprinzenhof at rolandseck one hot summer afternoon lazily watching the groups of tourists strolling along the road that ran between the hof and the rhine there was certainly little in the place or its atmosphere to recall the greyport episode of twenty years before when i was suddenly startled by hearing the name of sarah walker  in the road below me were three figuresa lady a gentleman and a little girl  as the latter turned towards the lady who addressed her i recognized the unmistakable coppercolored tresses trim figure delicate complexion and refined features of the friend of my youth  i seized my hat but by the time i had reached the road they had disappeared  the utter impossibility of its being sarah walker herself and the glaring fact that the very coincidence of name would be inconsistent with any conventional descent from the original sarah i admit confused me  but i examined the book of the kronprinzenhof and the other hotels and questioned my portier  there was no mees nor madame walkiere extant in rolandseck  yet might not monsieur have heard incorrectly  the czara walka was evidently russian and rolandseck was a resort for russian princes  but pardon  did monsieur really mean the young demoiselle now approaching  ah that was a different affair she was the daughter of the italian prince and princess monte castello staying here  the lady with her was not the princess but a foreign friend  the gentleman was the prince  would he present monsieurs card  they were entering the hotel  the prince was a little inoffensivelooking man the lady an evident countrywoman of my own and the childwas yet was not sarah  there was the face the outline the figurebut the life the verve the audacity was wanting  i could contain myself no longer  pardon an inquisitive compatriot madam i said but i heard you a few moments ago address this young lady by the name of a very dear young friend whom i knew twenty years agosarah walker  am i right  the prince stopped and gazed at us both with evident affright then suddenly recognizing in my freedom some wild american indecorum doubtless provoked by the presence of another of my species which he really was not expected to countenance retreated behind the portier the circumstance by no means increased the goodwill of the lady as she replied somewhat haughtily  the principessina is named sarah walker after her mothers maiden name  then this is sarah walkers daughter i said joyfully  she is the daughter of the prince and princess of monte castello corrected the lady frigidly  i had the pleasure of knowing her mother very well  i stopped and blushed  did i really know sarah walker very well  and would sarah walker know me now  or would it not be very like her to go back on me there was certainly anything but promise in the feebleminded vacuous copy of sarah before me  i was yet hesitating when the prince who had possibly received some quieting assurance from the portier himself stepped forward stammered that the princess would without doubt be charmed to receive me later and skipped upstairs leaving the impression on my mind that he contemplated ordering his bill at once there was no excuse for further prolonging the interview  say goodby to the strange gentleman sarah suggested sarahs companion stiffly i looked at the child in the wild hope of recognizing some prompt resistance to the suggestion that would have identified her with the lost sarah of my youthbut in vain  goodby sir said the affected little creature dropping a mechanical curtsey  thank you very much for remembering my mother  goodby sarah  it was indeed goodby forever  for on my way to my room i came suddenly upon the prince in a recess of the upper hall addressing somebody through an open door with a querulous protest whose wild extravagance of statement was grotesquely balanced by its utter feeble timidity of manner  it is said the prince indeed a grave affair  we have here hundreds of socialists emissaries from lawless countries and impossible places who travel thousands of miles to fall upon our hearts and embrace us  they establish an espionage over us they haunt our walks in incredible numbers they hang in droves upon our footsteps heaven alone saves us from a public osculation at any moment  they openly allege that they have dandled us on their knees at recent periods washed and dressed us and would do so still  our happiness our security  dont be a fool prince  do shut up  the prince collapsed and shrank away and i hurried past the open door a tall magnificentlooking woman was standing before a glass arranging her heavy red hair  the face which had been impatiently turned towards the door had changed again to profile with a frown still visible on the bent brow  our eyes met as i passed  the next moment the door slammed and i had seen the last of sarah walker     a ship of 49  i  it had rained so persistently in san francisco during the first week of january 1854 that a certain quagmire in the roadway of long wharf had become impassable and a plank was thrown over its dangerous depth indeed so treacherous was the spot that it was alleged on good authority that a hastily embarking traveler had once hopelessly lost his portmanteau and was fain to dispose of his entire interest in it for the sum of two dollars and fifty cents to a speculative stranger on the wharf  as the strangers search was rewarded afterwards only by the discovery of the body of a casual chinaman who had evidently endeavored wickedly to anticipate him a feeling of commercial insecurity was added to the other eccentricities of the locality  the plank led to the door of a building that was a marvel even in the chaotic frontier architecture of the street  the houses on either sideirregular frames of wood or corrugated ironbore evidence of having been quickly thrown together to meet the requirements of the goods and passengers who were once disembarked on what was the muddy beach of the infant city  but the building in question exhibited a certain elaboration of form and design utterly inconsistent with this idea  the structure obtruded a bowed front to the street with a curving line of small windows surmounted by elaborate carvings and scroll work of vines and leaves while below in faded gilt letters appeared the legend pontiacmarseilles  the effect of this incongruity was startling  it is related that an inebriated miner impeded by mud and drink before its door was found gazing at its remarkable facade with an expression of the deepest despondency  i hev lived a free life pardner he explained thickly to the samaritan who succored him and every time since ive been on this six weeks jamboree might have kalkilated it would come to this  snakes ive seen afore now and rats im not unfamiliar with but when it comes to the starn of a ship risin up out of the street i reckon its time to pass in my checks  it is a ship you blasted old soaker said the samaritan curtly  it was indeed a ship  a ship run ashore and abandoned on the beach years before by her goldseeking crew with the debris of her scattered stores and cargo overtaken by the wild growth of the strange city and the reclamation of the muddy flat wherein she lay hopelessly imbedded her retreat cut off by wharves and quays and breakwater jostled at first by sheds and then impacted in a block of solid warehouses and dwellings her rudder port and counter boarded in and now gazing hopelessly through her cabin windows upon the busy street before her but still a ship despite her transformation  the faintest line of contour yet left visible spoke of the buoyancy of another element the balustrade of her roof was unmistakably a taffrail  the rain slipped from her swelling sides with a certain lingering touch of the sea the soil around her was still treacherous with its suggestions and even the wind whistled nautically over her chimney  if in the fury of some southwesterly gale she had one night slipped her strange moorings and left a shining track through the lower town to the distant sea no one would have been surprised  least of all perhaps her present owner and possessor mr abner nott for by the irony of circumstances mr nott was a far western farmer who had never seen a ship before nor a larger stream of water than a tributary of the missouri river  in a spirit half of fascination half of speculation he had bought her at the time of her abandonment and had since mortgaged his ranch at petaluma with his live stock to defray the expenses of filling in the land where she stood and the improvements of the vicinity he had transferred his household goods and his only daughter to her cabin and had divided the space between decks and her hold into lodgingrooms and lofts for the storage of goods  it could hardly be said that the investment had been profitable  his tenants vaguely recognized that his occupancy was a sentimental rather than a commercial speculation and often generously lent themselves to the illusion by not paying their rent  others treated their own tenancy as a jokea quaint recreation born of the childlike familiarity of frontier intercourse  a few had left carelessly abandoning their unsalable goods to their landlord with great cheerfulness and a sense of favor  occasionally mr abner nott in a practical relapse raged against the derelicts and talked of dispossessing them or even dismantling his tenement but he was easily placated by a compliment to the dear old ship or an effort made by some tenant to idealize his apartment  a photographer who had ingeniously utilized the forecastle for a gallery accessible from the bows in the next street paid no further tribute than a portrait of the pretty face of rosey nott the superstitious reverence in which abner nott held his monstrous fancy was naturally enhanced by his purely bucolic exaggeration of its real functions and its native element  this yer keel has sailed and sailed and sailed he would explain with some incongruity of illustration in a bee line makin tracks for days runnin  i reckon more storms and blizzards hez tackled her then you ken shake a stick at  shes stampeded whales afore now and sloshed round with pirates and freebooters in and outer the spanish main and across lots from marcelleys where she was rared and yer she sits peacefullike just ez if shed never been outer a pertater patch and hadnt ploughed the sea with fosails and studdin sails and them things cavortin round her masts  abner notts enthusiasm was shared by his daughter but with more imagination and an intelligence stimulated by the scant literature of her fathers emigrant wagon and the few books found on the cabin shelves  but to her the strange shell she inhabited suggested more of the great world than the rude chaotic civilization she saw from the cabin windows or met in the persons of her fathers lodgers shut up for days in this quaint tenement she had seen it change from the enchanted playground of her childish fancy to the theatre of her active maidenhood but without losing her ideal romance in it  she had translated its history in her own way read its quaint nautical hieroglyphics after her own fashion and possessed herself of its secrets  she had in fancy made voyages in it to foreign lands had heard the accents of a softer tongue on its decks and on summer nights from the roof of the quarterdeck had seen mellower constellations take the place of the hard metallic glitter of the californian skies  sometimes in her isolation the long cylindrical vault she inhabited seemed like some vast seashell to become musical with the murmurings of the distant sea  so completely had it taken the place of the usual instincts of feminine youth that she had forgotten she was pretty or that her dresses were old in fashion and scant in quantity  after the first surprise of admiration her fathers lodgers ceased to follow the abstracted nymph except with their eyespartly respecting her spiritual shyness partly respecting the jealous supervision of the paternal nott  she seldom penetrated the crowded centre of the growing city her rare excursions were confined to the old ranch at petaluma whence she brought flowers and plants and even extemporized a hanginggarden on the quarterdeck  it was still raining and the wind which had increased to a gale was dashing the drops against the slanting cabin windows with a sound like spray when mr abner nott sat before a table seriously engaged with his accounts  for it was steamer nightas that momentous day of reckoning before the sailing of the regular mail steamer was briefly known to commercial san franciscoand mr nott was subject at such times to severely practical relapses  a swinging light seemed to bring into greater relief that peculiar encased casketlike security of the lowtimbered tightlyfitting apartment with its toylike utilities of space and made the pretty oval face of rosey nott appear a characteristic ornament the sliding door of the cabin communicated with the main deck now roofed in and partitioned off so as to form a small passage that led to the open starboard gangway where a narrow inclosed staircase built on the ships side took the place of the ships ladder under her counter and opened in the street  a dash of rain against the window caused rosey to lift her eyes from her book  its much nicer here than at the ranch father she said coaxingly even leaving alone its being a beautiful ship instead of a shanty the wind dont whistle through the cracks and blow out the candle when youre reading nor the rain spoil your things hung up against the wall  and you look more like a gentleman sitting in his ownshipyou know looking over his bills and getting ready to give his orders  vague and general as miss roseys compliment was it had its full effect upon her father who was at times dimly conscious of his hopeless rusticity and its incongruity with his surroundings yes he said awkwardly with a slight relaxation of his aggressive attitude yes in course its more bangup style but it dont payroseyit dont pay  yers the pontiac that oughter be bringin in ez rents go at least three hundred a month dont make her taxes  i bin thinkin seriously of sellin her  as rosey knew her father had experienced this serious contemplation on the first of every month for the last two years and cheerfully ignored it the next day she only said im sure the vacant rooms and lofts are all rented father  thats it returned mr nott thoughtfully plucking at his bushy whiskers with his fingers and thumb as if he were removing dead and sapless incumbranees in their growth thats just what it isthems ez in it themselves dont pay and them ez haz left their goodsthe goods dont pay  the feller ez stored them iron sugar kettles in the forehold after trying to get me to make another advance on em sez he believes hell have to sacrifice em to me after all and only begs id give him a chance of buying back the half of em ten years from now at double what i advanced him  the chap that left them five hundred cases of hair dye tween decks and then skipped out to sacramento met me the other day in the street and advised me to use a bottle ez an advertisement or try it on the starn of the pontiac for fireproof paint  that foolishness ez all hes good for  and yet thar might be suthin in the paint if a feller had nigger luck  thers that new york chap ez bought up them damaged boxes of plug terbaker for fifty dollars a thousand and sold em for foundations for that new building in sansome street at a thousand clear profit  its all luck rosey  the girls eyes had wandered again to the pages of her book perhaps she was already familiar with the text of her fathers monologue  but recognizing an additional querulousness in his voice she laid the book aside and patiently folded her hands in her lap  thats rightfor ive suthin to tell ye  the fact is sleight wants to buy the pontiac out and out just ez she stands with the two fifty vara lots she stands on  sleight wants to buy her  sleight echoed rosey incredulously  you bet  sleightthe big financier the smartest man in frisco  what does he want to buy her for asked rosey knitting her pretty brows  the apparently simple question suddenly puzzled mr nott  he glanced feebly at his daughters face and frowned in vacant irritation thats so he said drawing a long breath theres suthin in that  what did he say continued the young girl impatiently  not much  youve got the pontiac nott sez he  you bet sez i whatll you take for her and the lot she stands on sez he short and sharp  some fellers rosey said nott with a cunning smile would hev blurted out a big figger and been cotched  that aint my style  i just looked at him  ill wait fur your figgers until next steamer day sez he and off he goes like a shot  hes awfully sharp rosey  but if he is sharp father and he really wants to buy the ship returned rosey thoughtfully its only because he knows its valuable property and not because he likes it as we do  he cant take that value away even if we dont sell it to him and all the while we have the comfort of the dear old pontiac dont you see  this exhaustive commercial reasoning was so sympathetic to mr notts instincts that he accepted it as conclusive  he however deemed it wise to still preserve his practical attitude  but that dont make it pay by the month rosey  suthin must be done  im thinking ill clean out that photographer  not just after hes taken such a pretty view of the cabin front of the pontiac from the street father  no hes going to give us a copy and put the other in a shop window in montgomery street  thats so said mr nott musingly its no slouch of an advertisement  the pontiac the property of a nott esq of st jo missouri  send it on to your aunt phoebe sorter make the old folks open their eyesoh  well seein hes been to some expense fittin up an entrance from the other street well let him slide  but as to that dd old frenchman ferrers in the next loft with his stuckup airs and highfalutin style we must get quit of him hes regularly gouged me in that ere horsehair spekilation  how can you say that father said rosey with a slight increase of color  it was your own offer  you know those bales of curled horsehair were left behind by the late tenant to pay his rent when mr de ferrieres rented the room afterwards you told him youd throw them in in the place of repairs and furniture  it was your own offer  yes but i didnt reckon therd ever be a big price per pound paid for the darned stuff for sofys and cushions and sich  how do you know he knew it father responded rosey  then why did he look so silly at first and then put on airs when i joked him about it eh  perhaps he didnt understand your joking father  hes a foreigner and shy and proud andnot like the others  i dont think he knew what you meant then any more than he believed he was making a bargain before  he may be poor but i think hes beenaagentleman  the young girls animation penetrated even mr notts slow comprehension  her novel opposition and even the prettiness it enhanced gave him a dull premonition of pain  his small round eyes became abstracted his mouth remained partly open even his fresh color slightly paled  you seem to have been takin stock of this yer man rosey he said with a faint attempt at archness if he warnt ez old ez a crow for all his young feathers id think he was makin up to you  but the passing glow had faded from her young cheeks and her eyes wandered again to her book  he pays his rent regularly every steamer night she said quietly as if dismissing an exhausted subject and hell be here in a moment i dare say  she took up her book and leaning her head on her hand once more became absorbed in its pages  an uneasy silence followed  the rain beat against the windows the ticking of a clock became audible but still mr nott sat with vacant eyes fixed on his daughters face and the constrained smile on his lips  he was conscious that he had never seen her look so pretty before yet he could not tell why this was no longer an unalloyed satisfaction  not but that he had always accepted the admiration of others for her as a matter of course but for the first time he became conscious that she not only had an interest in others but apparently a superior knowledge of them  how did she know these things about this man and why had she only now accidentally spoken of them  he would have done so  all this passed so vaguely through his unreflective mind that he was unable to retain any decided impression but the farreaching one that his lodger had obtained some occult influence over her through the exhibition of his baleful skill in the horsehair speculation them tricks is likely to take a young girls fancy  i must look arter her he said to himself softly  a slow regular step in the gangway interrupted his paternal reflections  hastily buttoning across his chest the peajacket which he usually wore at home as a single concession to his nautical surroundings he drew himself up with something of the assumption of a shipmaster despite certain bucolic suggestions of his boots and legs the footsteps approached nearer and a tall figure suddenly stood in the doorway  it was a figure so extraordinary that even in the strange masquerade of that early civilization it was remarkable a figure with whom father and daughter were already familiar without abatement of wonderthe figure of a rejuvenated old man padded powdered dyed and painted to the verge of caricature but without a single suggestion of ludicrousness or humor  a face so artificial that it seemed almost a mask but like a mask more pathetic than amusing  he was dressed in the extreme of fashion of a dozen years before his pearl gray trousers strapped tightly over his varnished boots his voluminous satin cravat and high collar embraced his rouged cheeks and dyed whiskers his closelybuttoned frock coat clinging to a waist that seemed accented by stays  he advanced two steps into the cabin with an upright precision of motion that might have hid the infirmities of age and said deliberately with a foreign accent  yourr accoumpt  in the actual presence of the apparition mr notts dignified resistance wavered  but glancing uneasily at his daughter and seeing her calm eyes fixed on the speaker without embarrassment he folded his arms stiffly and with a lofty simulation of examining the ceiling said  ahem  rosa  the gentlemans account  it was an infelicitous action  for the stranger who evidently had not noticed the presence of the young girl before started took a step quickly forward bent stiffly but profoundly over the little hand that held the account raised it to his lips and with a thousand pardons mademoiselle laid a small canvas bag containing the rent before the disorganized mr nott and stiffly vanished  that night was a troubled one to the simpleminded proprietor of the good ship pontiac  unable to voice his uneasiness by further discussion but feeling that his late discomposing interview with his lodger demanded some marked protest he absented himself on the plea of business during the rest of the evening happily to his daughters utter obliviousness of the reason  lights were burning brilliantly in countingrooms and offices the feverish life of the mercantile city was at its height  with a vague idea of entering into immediate negotiations with mr sleight for the sale of the shipas a direct way out of his present perplexity he bent his steps towards the financiers office but paused and turned back before reaching the door  he made his way to the wharf and gazed abstractedly at the lights reflected in the dark tremulous jellylike water  but wherever he went he was accompanied by the absurd figure of his lodgera figure he had hitherto laughed at or half pitied but which now to his bewildered comprehension seemed to have a fateful significance  here a new idea seized him and he hurried back to the ship slackening his pace only when he arrived at his own doorway here he paused a moment and slowly ascended the staircase  when he reached the passage he coughed slightly and paused again  then he pushed open the door of the darkened cabin and called softly  rosey  what is it father said roseys voice from the little stateroom on the rightroseys own bower  nothing said mr nott with an affectation of languid calmness i only wanted to know if you was comfortable  its an awful busy night in town  yes father  i reckon thars tons o gold goin to the states tomorrow  yes father  pretty comfortable eh  yes father  well ill browse round a spell and turn in myself soon  yes father  mr nott took down a hanging lantern lit it and passed out into the gangway  another lamp hung from the companion hatch to light the tenants to the lower deck whence he descended  this deck was divided fore and aft by a partitioned passagethe lofts or apartments being lighted from the ports and one or two by a door cut through the ships side communicating with an alley on either side  this was the case with the loft occupied by mr notts strange lodger which besides a door in the passage had this independent communication with the alley nott had never known him to make use of the latter door on the contrary it was his regular habit to issue from his apartment at three oclock every afternoon dressed as he has been described stride deliberately through the passage to the upper deck and thence into the street where his strange figure was a feature of the principal promenade for two or three hours returning as regularly at eight oclock to the ship and the seclusion of his loft  mr nott paused before the door under the pretence of throwing the light before him into the shadows of the forecastle all was silent within  he was turning back when he was impressed by the regular recurrence of a peculiar rustling sound which he had at first referred to the rubbing of the wires of the swinging lantern against his clothing  he set down the light and listened the sound was evidently on the other side of the partition the sound of some prolonged rustling scraping movement with regular intervals  was it due to another of mr notts unprofitable tenantsthe rats  no  a bright idea flashed upon mr notts troubled mind  it was de ferrieres snoring  he smiled grimly wonder if roseyd call him a gentleman if she heard that he chuckled to himself as he slowly made his way back to the cabin and the small stateroom opposite to his daughters during the rest of the night he dreamed of being compelled to give rosey in marriage to his strange lodger who added insult to the outrage by snoring audibly through the marriage service  meantime in her cradlelike nest in her nautical bower miss rosey slumbered as lightly  waking from a vivid dream of venicea childs veniceseen from the swelling deck of the proudlyriding pontiac she was so impressed as to rise and cross on tiptoe to the little slanting porthole  morning was already dawning over the flat straggling city but from every countinghouse and magazine the votive tapers of the feverish worshipers of trade and mammon were still flaring fiercely    ii  the day following steamer night was usually stale and flat at san francisco  the reaction from the feverish exaltation of the previous twentyfour hours was seen in the listless faces and lounging feet of promenaders and was notable in the deserted offices and warehouses still redolent of last nights gas and strewn with the dead ashes of last nights fires  there was a brief pause before the busy life which ran its course from steamer day to steamer day was once more taken up  in that interval a few anxious speculators and investors breathed freely some critical situation was relieved or some impending catastrophe momentarily averted  in particular a singular stroke of good fortune that morning befell mr nott  he not only secured a new tenant but as he sagaciously believed introduced into the pontiac a counteracting influence to the subtle fascinations of de ferrieres  the new tenant apparently possessed a combination of business shrewdness and brusque frankness that strongly impressed his landlord you see rosey said nott complacently describing the interview to his daughter when i sorter intimated in a keerless kind o way that sugar kettles and hair dye was about played out ez securities he just planked down the money for two months in advance  there sez he thats your securitynow wheres mine  i reckon i dont hitch on pardner sez i security what for  spose you sell the ship sez he afore the two months is up  ive heard that old sleight wants to buy her  then you gets back your money sez i  and lose my room sez he not much old man  you sign a paper that whoever buys the ship inside o two months hez to buy me ez a tenant with it thats on the square so i sign the paper  it was mighty cute in the young feller wasnt it he said scanning his daughters pretty puzzled face a little anxiously and dont you see ez i aint goin to sell the pontiac its just about ez cute in me eh  hes a contractor somewhere around yer and wants to be near his work  so he takes the room next to the frenchman that that ship captain quit for the mines and succeeds naterally to his chest and things  hes might peartlookin that young feller roseylong black moustaches all his own color roseyand hes a regular highstepper you bet  i reckon hes not only been a gentleman but ez now  some o them contractors are very hightoned  i dont think we have any right to give him the captains chest father said rosey there may be some private things in it there were some letters and photographs in the hairdye mans trunk that you gave the photographer  thats just it rosey returned abner nott with sublime unconsciousness photographs and love letters you cant sell for cash and i dont mind givin em away if they kin make a feller creature happy  but father have we the right to give em away  theyre collateral security rosey said her father grimly colateral he continued emphasizing each syllable by tapping the fist of one hand in the open palm of the other  colateral is the word the big business sharps yer about call em  you cant get round that  he paused a moment and then as a new idea seemed to be painfully borne in his round eyes continued cautiously was that the reason why you wouldnt touch any of them dresses from the trunks of that opery gal ez skedaddled for sacramento  and yet them trunks i regularly bought at auctionroseyat auction on specand they didnt realize the cost of drayage  a slight color mounted to roseys face  no she said hastily not that  hesitating a moment she then drew softly to his side and placing her arms around his neck turned his broad foolish face towards her own  father she began when mother died would you have liked anybody to take her trunks and paw around her things and wear them  when your mother died just this side o sweetwater rosey said mr nott with beaming unconsciousness she hadnt any trunks  i reckon she hadnt even an extra gown hanging up in the wagin cept the petticoat ez she had wrapped around yer  it was about ez much ez we could do to skirmish round with injins alkali and cold and we sorter forgot to dress for dinner  she never thought rosey that you and me would live to be inhabitin a paliss of a real ship  ef she had she would have died a proud woman  he turned his small loving boarlike eyes upon her as a preternaturally innocent and trusting companion of ulysses might have regarded the transforming circe  rosey turned away with the faintest sigh  the habitual look of abstraction returned to her eyes as if she had once more taken refuge in her own ideal world unfortunately the change did not escape either the sensitive observation or the fatuous misconception of the sagacious parent yell be mountin a few furbelows and fixins rosey i reckon ez only natural  mabbee yell have to prink up a little now that weve got a gentleman contractor in the ship  ill see what i kin pick up in montgomery street  and indeed he succeeded a few hours later in accomplishing with equal infelicity his generous design when she returned from her household tasks she found on her berth a purple velvet bonnet of extraordinary make and a pair of white satin slippers  theyll do for a start off rosey he explained and i got em at my figgers  but i go out so seldom father and a bonnet  thats so interrupted mr nott complacently it might be jest ez well for a young gal like yer to appear ez if she did go out or would go out if she wanted to  so you kin be wearin that ar headstall kinder like this evening when the contractors here ez if youd jest come in from a pasear  miss rosey did not however immediately avail herself of her fathers purchase but contented herself with the usual scarlet ribbon that like a snood confined her brown hair when she returned to her tasks  the space between the galley and the bulwarks had been her favorite resort in summer when not actually engaged in household work  it was now lightly roofed over with boards and tarpaulin against the winter rain but still afforded her a verandalike space before the gallery door where she could read or sew looking over the bow of the pontiac to the tossing bay or the further range of the contra costa hills  hither miss rosey brought the purple prodigy partly to please her father partly with a view of subjecting it to violent radical changes but after trying it on before the tiny mirror in the galley once or twice her thoughts wandered away and she fell into one of her habitual reveries seated on a little stool before the galley door  she was roused from it by the slight shaking and rattling of the doors of a small hatch on the deck not a dozen yards from where she sat  it had been evidently fastened from below during the wet weather but as she gazed the fastenings were removed the doors were suddenly lifted and the head and shoulders of a young man emerged from the deck partly from her fathers description and partly from the impossibility of its being anybody else she at once conceived it to be the new lodger  she had time to note that he was young and goodlooking graver perhaps than became his sudden pantomimic appearance but before she could observe him closely he had turned closed the hatch with a certain familiar dexterity and walked slowly towards the bows  even in her slight bewilderment she observed that his step upon the deck seemed different to her fathers or the photographers and that he laid his hand on various objects with a halfcaressing ease and habit presently he paused and turned back and glancing at the galley door for the first time encountered her wondering eyes  it seemed so evident that she had been a curious spectator of his abrupt entrance on deck that he was at first disconcerted and confused but after a second glance at her he appeared to resume his composure and advanced a little defiantly towards the galley  i suppose i frightened you popping up the fore hatch just now  the what asked rosey  the fore hatch he repeated impatiently indicating it with a gesture  and thats the fore hatch she said abstractedly  you seem to know ships  yesa little he said quietly  i was below and unfastened the hatch to come up the quickest way and take a look round  ive just hired a room here he added explanatorily  i thought so said rosey simply youre the contractor  the contractoroh yes  you seem to know it all  fathers told me  oh hes your fathernott  certainly  i see now he continued looking at her with a half repressed smile  certainly miss nott good morning he half added and walked towards the companion way something in the direction of his eyes as he turned away made rosey lift her hands to her head  she had forgotten to remove her fathers baleful gift  she snatched it off and ran quickly to the companion way  sir she called  the young man turned half way down the steps and looked up  there was a faint color in her cheeks and her pretty brown hair was slightly disheveled from the hasty removal of the bonnet  fathers very particular about strangers being on this deck she said a little sharply  ohahim sorry i intruded  iithought id tell you said rosey frightened by her boldness into a feeble anticlimax  thank you  she came back slowly to the galley and picked up the unfortunate bonnet with a slight sense of remorse  why should she feel angry with her poor fathers unhappy offering  and what business had this strange young man to use the ship so familiarly  yet she was vaguely conscious that she and her father with all their love and their domestic experience of it lacked a certain instinctive ease in its possession that the half indifferent stranger had shown on first treading its deck  she walked to the hatchway and examined it with a new interest succeeding in lifting the hatch she gazed at the lower deck  as she already knew the ladder had long since been removed to make room for one of the partitions the only way the stranger could have reached it was by leaping to one of the rings  to make sure of this she let herself down holding on to the rings and dropped a couple of feet to the deck below  she was in the narrow passage her father had penetrated the previous night before her was the door leading to de ferrieress loft always locked  it was silent within it was the hour when the old frenchman made his habitual promenade in the city  but the light from the newlyopened hatch allowed her to see more of the mysterious recesses of the forward bulkhead than she had known before and she was startled by observing another yawning hatchway at her feet from which the closelyfitting door had been lifted and which the new lodger had evidently forgotten to close again the young girl stooped down and peered cautiously into the black abyss  nothing was to be seen nothing heard but the distant gurgle and click of water in some remoter depth  she replaced the hatch and returned by way of the passage to the cabin  when her father came home that night she briefly recounted the interview with the new lodger and her discovery of his curiosity she did this with a possible increase of her usual shyness and abstraction and apparently more as a duty than a colloquial recreation  but it pleased mr nott also to give it more than his usual misconception looking round the ship was heeh rosey he said with infinite archness  in course kinder sweepin round the galley and offerin to fetch you wood and water eh  even when the young girl had picked up her book with the usual faint smile of affectionate tolerance and then drifted away in its pages mr nott chuckled audibly  i reckon old frenchy didnt come by when the young one was bedevlin you there  what father said rosey lifting her abstracted eyes to his face  at the moment it seemed impossible that any human intelligence could have suspected deceit or duplicity in roseys clear gaze but mr notts intelligence was superhuman  i was sayin that mr ferrieres didnt happen in while the young feller was thereeh  no father answered rosey with an effort to follow him out of the pages of her book  why  but mr nott did not reply  later in the evening he awkwardly waylaid the new lodger before the cabin door as that gentleman would have passed on to his room  im afraid said the young man glancing at rosey that i intruded upon your daughter today  i was a little curious to see the old ship and i didnt know what part of it was private  there aint no private part to this yer shipthat ez cepting the rooms and lofts said mr nott authoritatively  then subjecting the anxious look of his daughter to his usual faculty for misconception he added thar aint no place whar you havent as much right to go ez any other man thar aint any man furriner or amerykan young or old dyed or undyed ez hev got any better rights  you hear me young fellow mr renshawmy darter  my dartermr renshaw  rosey give the gentleman a chair  shes only jest come in from a promeynade and hez jest taken off her bonnet he added with an arch look at rosey and a hurried look around the cabin as if he hoped to see the missing gift visible to the general eye  so take a seat a minit wont ye  but mr renshaw after an observant glance at the young girls abstracted face brusquely excused himself ive got a letter to write he said with a half bow to rosey  good night  he crossed the passage to the room that had been assigned to him and closing the door gave way to some irritability of temper in his efforts to light the lamp and adjust his writing materials  for his excuse to mr nott was more truthful than most polite pretexts he had indeed a letter to write and one that being yet young in duplicity the near presence of his host rendered difficult  for it ran as follows   dear sleight  as i found i couldnt get a chance to make any examination of the ship except as occasion offered i just went in to rent lodgings in her from the godforsaken old ass who owns her and here i am a tenant for two months  i contracted for that time in case the old fool should sell out to some one else before  except that shes cut up a little between decks by the partitions for lofts that that pike county idiot has put into her she looks but little changed and her forehold as far as i can judge is intact  it seems that nott bought her just as she stands with her cargo half out but he wasnt here when she broke cargo  if anybody else had bought her but this cursed missourian who hasnt got the hayseed out of his hair i might have found out something from him and saved myself this kind of fooling which isnt in my line  if i could get possession of a loft on the main deck well forward just over the forehold i could satisfy myself in a few hours but the loft is rented by that crazy frenchman who parades montgomery street every afternoon and though old pike county wants to turn him out im afraid i cant get it for a week to come  if anything should happen to me just you waltz down here and corral my things at once for this old frontier pirate has a way of confiscating his lodgers trunks  yours   dick    iii  if mr renshaw indulged in any further curiosity regarding the interior of the pontiac he did not make his active researches manifest to rosey  nor in spite of her fathers invitation did he again approach the galleya fact which gave her her first vague impression in his favor  he seemed also to avoid the various advances which mr nott appeared impelled to make whenever they met in the passage but did so without seemingly avoiding her and marked his half contemptuous indifference to the elder nott by an increase of respect to the young girl  she would have liked to ask him something about ships and was sure his conversation would have been more interesting than that of old captain bower to whose cabin he had succeeded who had once told her a ship was the devils hencoop  she would have liked also to explain to him that she was not in the habit of wearing a purple bonnet  but her thoughts were presently engrossed by an experience which interrupted the even tenor of her young life  she had been as she afterwards remembered impressed with a nervous restlessness one afternoon which made it impossible for her to perform her ordinary household duties or even to indulge her favorite recreation of reading or castle building  she wandered over the ship and impelled by the same vague feeling of unrest descended to the lower deck and the forward bulkhead where she had discovered the open hatch  it had not been again disturbed nor was there any trace of further exploration  a little ashamed she knew not why of revisiting the scene of mr renshaws researches she was turning back when she noticed that the door which communicated with de ferrieress loft was partly open  the circumstance was so unusual that she stopped before it in surprise  there was no sound from within it was the hour when its queer occupant was always absent he must have forgotten to lock the door or it had been unfastened by other hands  after a moment of hesitation she pushed it further open and stepped into the room  by the dim light of two portholes she could see that the floor was strewn and piled with the contents of a broken bale of curled horse hair of which a few untouched bales still remained against the wall a heap of morocco skins some already cut in the form of chair cushion covers and a few cushions unfinished and unstuffed lay in the light of the ports and gave the apartment the appearance of a cheap workshop a rude instrument for combing the horse hair awls buttons and thread heaped on a small bench showed that active work had been but recently interrupted  a cheap earthenware ewer and basin on the floor and a pallet made of an open bale of horse hair on which a ragged quilt and blanket were flung indicated that the solitary worker dwelt and slept beside his work  the truth flashed upon the young girls active brain quickened by seclusion and fed by solitary books  she read with keen eyes the miserable secret of her fathers strange guest in the povertystricken walls in the mute evidences of menial handicraft performed in loneliness and privation in this piteous adaptation of an accident to save the conscious shame of premeditated toil she knew now why he had stammeringly refused to receive her fathers offer to buy back the goods he had given him she knew now how hardly gained was the pittance that paid his rent and supported his childish vanity and grotesque pride  from a peg in the corner hung the familiar masquerade that hid his povertythe pearlgray trousers the black frock coat the tall shining hatin hideous contrast to the penury of his surroundings but if they were here where was he and in what new disguise had he escaped from his poverty  a vague uneasiness caused her to hesitate and return to the open door  she had nearly reached it when her eye fell on the pallet which it partly illuminated  a singular resemblance in the ragged heap made her draw closer  the faded quilt was a dressinggown and clutching its folds lay a white wasted hand  the emigrant childhood of rose nott had been more than once shadowed by scalping knives and she was acquainted with death she went fearlessly to the couch and found that the dressinggown was only an enwrapping of the emaciated and lifeless body of de ferrieres  she did not retreat or call for help but examined him closely  he was unconscious but not pulseless he had evidently been strong enough to open the door for air or succor but had afterward fallen in a fit on the couch  she flew to her fathers locker and the galley fire returned and shut the door behind her and by the skillful use of hot water and whisky soon had the satisfaction of seeing a faint color take the place of the faded rouge in the ghastly cheeks  she was still chafing his hands when he slowly opened his eyes  with a start he made a quick attempt to push aside her hands and rise  but she gently restrained him  ehwhat he stammered throwing his face back from hers with an effort and trying to turn it to the wall  you have been ill she said quietly  drink this  with his face still turned away he lifted the cup to his chattering teeth  when he had drained it he threw a trembling glance around the room and at the door  theres no one been here but myself she said quickly  i happened to see the door open as i passed  i didnt think it worth while to call any one  the searching look he gave her turned into an expression of relief which to her infinite uneasiness again feebly lightened into one of antiquated gallantry  he drew the dressinggown around him with an air  ah it is a goddess mademoiselle that has deigned to enter the cell wherewhereiamuse myself  it is drollis it not  i came here to makewhat you callthe experiment of your fathers fabric  i make myselfha halike a workman  ah bah the heat the darkness the plebeian motion make my head to go round i stagger i faint i cry out i fall  but what of that  the great god hears my cry and sends me an angel  voila  he attempted an easy gesture of gallantry but overbalanced himself and fell sideways on the pallet with a gasp  yet there was so much genuine feeling mixed with his grotesque affectation so much piteous consciousness of the ineffectiveness of his falsehood that the young girl who had turned away came back and laid her hand upon his arm  you must lie still and try to sleep she said gently  i will return again  perhaps she added there is some one i can send for  he shook his head violently  then in his old manner added after mademoiselleno one  i mean she hesitatedhave you no friends  friendsah without doubt  he shrugged his shoulders  but mademoiselle will comprehend  you are better now said rosey quickly and no one need know anything if you dont wish it  try to sleep  you need not lock the door when i go i will see that no one comes in  he flushed faintly and averted his eyes  it is too droll mademoiselle is it not  of course it is said rosey glancing round the miserable room  and mademoiselle is an angel  he carried her hand to his lips humblyhis first purely unaffected action  she slipped through the door and softly closed it behind her  reaching the upper deck she was relieved to find her father had not returned and her absence had been unnoticed  for she had resolved to keep de ferrieress secret to herself from the moment that she had unwittingly discovered it and to do this and still be able to watch over him without her fathers knowledge required some caution  she was conscious of his strange aversion to the unfortunate man without understanding the reason but as she was in the habit of entertaining his caprices more from affectionate tolerance of his weakness than reverence of his judgment she saw no disloyalty to him in withholding a confidence that might be disloyal to another  it wont do father any good to know it she said to herself and if it did it oughtnt to she added with triumphant feminine logic  but the impression made upon her by the spectacle she had just witnessed was stronger than any other consideration  the revelation of de ferrieress secret poverty seemed a chapter from a romance of her own weaving for a moment it lifted the miserable hero out of the depths of his folly and selfishness  she forgot the weakness of the man in the strength of his dramatic surroundings  it partly satisfied a craving she had felt it was not exactly the story of the ship as she had dreamed it but it was an episode in her experience of it that broke its monotony  that she should soon learn perhaps from de ferrieress own lips the true reason of his strange seclusion and that it involved more than appeared to her now she never for a moment doubted  at the end of an hour she again knocked softly at the door carrying some light nourishment she had prepared for him  he was asleep but she was astounded to find that in the interval he had managed to dress himself completely in his antiquated finery  it was a momentary shock to the illusion she had been fostering but she forgot it in the pitiable contrast between his haggard face and his pomatumed hair and beard the jauntiness of his attire and the collapse of his invalid figure  when she had satisfied herself that his sleep was natural she busied herself softly in arranging the miserable apartment  with a few feminine touches she removed the slovenliness of misery and placed the loose material and ostentatious evidences of his work on one side finding that he still slept and knowing the importance of this natural medication she placed the refreshment she had brought by his side and noiselessly quitted the apartment  hurrying through the gathering darkness between decks she once or twice thought she had heard footsteps and paused but encountering no one attributed the impression to her overconsciousness  yet she thought it prudent to go to the galley first where she lingered a few moments before returning to the cabin  on entering she was a little startled at observing a figure seated at her fathers desk but was relieved at finding it was mr renshaw  he rose and put aside the book he had idly picked up  i am afraid i am an intentional intruder this time miss nott  but i found no one here and i was tempted to look into this shipshape little snuggery you see the temptation got the better of me  his voice and smile were so frank and pleasant so free from his previous restraint yet still respectful so youthful yet manly that rosey was affected by them even in her preoccupation  her eyes brightened and then dropped before his admiring glance  had she known that the excitement of the last few hours had brought a wonderful charm into her pretty face had aroused the slumbering life of her halfawakened beauty she would have been more confused  as it was she was only glad that the young man should turn out to be nice perhaps he might tell her something about ships perhaps if she had only known him longer she might with de ferrieress permission have shared her confidence with him and enlisted his sympathy and assistance  she contented herself with showing this anticipatory gratitude in her face as she begged him with the timidity of a maiden hostess to resume his seat  but mr renshaw seemed to talk only to make her talk and i am forced to admit that rosey found this almost as pleasant  it was not long before he was in possession of her simple history from the day of her baby emigration to california to the transfer of her childish life to the old ship and even of much of the romantic fancies she had woven into her existence there  whatever ulterior purpose he had in view he listened as attentively as if her artless chronicle was filled with practical information  once when she had paused for breath he said gravely i must ask you to show me over this wonderful ship some day that i may see it with your eyes  but i think you know it already better than i do said rosey with a smile  mr renshaws brow clouded slightly  ah he said with a touch of his former restraint and why  well said rosey timidly i thought you went round and touched things in a familiar way as if you had handled them before  the young man raised his eyes to roseys and kept them there long enough to bring back his gentler expression  then because i found you trying on a very queer bonnet the first day i saw you he said mischievously i ought to believe you were in the habit of wearing one  in the first flush of mutual admiration young people are apt to find a laugh quite as significant as a sigh for an expression of sympathetic communion and this masterstroke of wit convulsed them both  in the midst of it mr nott entered the cabin  but the complacency with which he viewed the evident perfect understanding of the pair was destined to suffer some abatement  rosey suddenly conscious that she was in some way participating in ridicule of her father through his unhappy gift became embarrassed  mr renshaws restraint returned with the presence of the old man  in vain at first abner nott strove with profound levity to indicate his arch comprehension of the situation and in vain later becoming alarmed he endeavored with cheerful gravity to indicate his utter obliviousness of any but a business significance in their teteatete  i oughtnt to hev intruded rosey he said when you and the gentleman were talkin of contracts mebbee but dont mind me im on the fly anyhow rosey dear hevin to see a man round the corner  but even the attitude of withdrawing did not prevent the exit of renshaw to his apartment and of rosey to the galley  left alone in the cabin abner nott felt in the knots and tangles of his beard for a reason  glancing down at his prodigious boots which covered with mud and gravel strongly emphasized his agricultural origin and gave him a general appearance of standing on his own broad acres he was struck with an idea  its them boots he whispered to himself softly they somehow dont seem xactly to trump or follow suit in this yer cabin they dont hitch into anythin but jist slosh round loose and so to speak play it alone  and them young critters natrally feels it and gets out o the way  acting upon this instinct with his usual precipitate caution he at once proceeded to the nearest secondhand shop and purchasing a pair of enormous carpet slippers originally the property of a gouty seacaptain reappeared with a strong suggestion of newly upholstering the cabin  the improvement however was fraught with a portentous circumstance  mr notts footsteps which usually announced his approach all over the ship became stealthy and inaudible  meantime miss rosey had taken advantage of the absence of her father to visit her patient  to avoid attracting attention she did not take a light but groped her way to the lower deck and rapped softly at the door  it was instantly opened by de ferrieres  he had apparently appreciated the few changes she had already made in the room and had himself cleared away the pallet from which he had risen to make two low seats against the wall  two bits of candle placed on the floor illuminated the beams above the dressinggown was artistically draped over the solitary chair and a pile of cushions formed another seat with elaborate courtesy he handed miss rosey to the chair  he looked pale and weak though the gravity of the attack had evidently passed yet he persisted in remaining standing  if i sit he explained with a gesture i shall again disgrace myself by sleeping in mademoiselles presence yes  i shall sleepi shall dreamand wake to find her gone  more embarrassed by his recovery than when he was lying helplessly before her she said hesitatingly that she was glad he was better and that she hoped he liked the broth  it was manna from heaven mademoiselle  see i have taken it allevery precious drop  what else could i have done for mademoiselles kindness  he showed her the empty bowl  a swift conviction came upon her that the man had been suffering from want of food  the thought restored her selfpossession even while it brought the tears to her eyes  i wish you would let me speak to fatheror some one she said impulsively and stopped  a quick and half insane gleam of terror and suspicion lit up his deep eyes  for what mademoiselle  for an accidentthat is nothingabsolutely nothing for i am strong and well nowsee he said tremblingly  or for a whimfor a folly you may say that they will misunderstand  no mademoiselle is good is wise  she will say to herself i understand my friend monsieur de ferrieres for the moment has a secret  he would seem poor he would take the role of artisan he would shut himself up in these wallsperhaps i may guess why but it is his secret  i think of it no more  he caught her hand in his with a gesture that he would have made one of gallantry but that in its tremulous intensity became a piteous supplication  i have said nothing and will say nothing if you wish it said rosey hastily but others may find out how you live here  this is not fit work for you  you seem to be aa gentleman  you ought to be a lawyer or a doctor or in a bank she continued timidly with a vague enumeration of the prevailing degrees of local gentility  he dropped her hand  ah does not mademoiselle comprehend that it is because i am a gentleman that there is nothing between it and this look he continued almost fiercely  what if i told you it is the lawyer it is the doctor it is the banker that brings me a gentleman to this eh  ah bah  what do i say  this is honest what i do  but the lawyer the banker the doctor what are they he shrugged his shoulders and pacing the apartment with a furtive glance at the half anxious half frightened girl suddenly stopped dragged a small portmanteau from behind the heap of bales and opened it  look mademoiselle he said tremulously lifting a handful of worn and soiled letters and papers  lookthese are the tools of your banker your lawyer your doctor  with this the banker will make you poor the lawyer will prove you a thief the doctor will swear you are crazy eh what shall you call the work of a gentlemanthishe dragged the pile of cushions forwardor this  to the young girls observant eyes some of the papers appeared to be of a legal or official character and others like bills of lading with which she was familiar  their halftheatrical exhibition reminded her of some play she had seen they might be the clue to some story or the mere worthless hoardings of a diseased fancy  whatever they were de ferrieres did not apparently care to explain further indeed the next moment his manner changed to his old absurd extravagance  but this is stupid for mademoiselle to hear  what shall we speak of  ah what should we speak of in mademoiselles presence  but are not these papers valuable asked rosey partly to draw her hosts thoughts back to their former channel  perhaps  he paused and regarded the young girl fixedly  does mademoiselle think so  i dont know said rosey  how should i  ah if mademoiselle thought soif mademoiselle would deign  he stopped again and placed his hand upon his forehead  it might be so he muttered  i must go now said rosey hurriedly rising with an awkward sense of constraint  father will wonder where i am  i shall explain  i will accompany you mademoiselle  no no said rosey quickly he must not know i have been here she stopped  the honest blush flew to her cheek and then returned again because she had blushed  de ferrieres gazed at her with an exalted look  then drawing himself to his full height he said with an exaggerated and indescribable gesture go my child go  tell your father that you have been alone and unprotected in the abode of poverty and suffering butthat it was in the presence of armand de ferrieres  he threw open the door with a bow that nearly swept the ground but did not again offer to take her hand  at once impressed and embarrassed at this crowning incongruity her pretty lip trembled between a smile and a cry as she said goodnight and slipped away into the darkness  erect and grotesque de ferrieres retained the same attitude until the sound of her footsteps was lost when he slowly began to close the door  but a strong arm arrested it from without and a large carpeted foot appeared at the bottom of the narrowing opening  the door yielded and mr abner nott entered the room    iv  with an exclamation and a hurried glance around him de ferrieres threw himself before the intruder  but slowly lifting his large hand and placing it on his lodgers breast he quietly overbore the sick mans feeble resistance with an impact of power that seemed almost as moral as it was physical  he did not appear to take any notice of the room or its miserable surroundings indeed scarcely of the occupant  still pushing him with abstracted eyes and immobile face to the chair that rosey had just quitted he made him sit down and then took up his own position on the pile of cushions opposite  his usually underdone complexion was of watery blueness but his dull abstracted glance appeared to exercise a certain dumb narcotic fascination on his lodger  i mout said nott slowly hev laid ye out here on sight without enny warnin or dropped ye in yer tracks in montgomery street wherever ther was room to work a sixshooter in comfably johnson of petalunyhim ye know ez had a game eyefetched flynn comin outer meetin one sunday and it was only on account of his wife and she a secondhand one so to speak  there was walker of contra costa plugged that young sacramento chap whose name i disremember full o holes just ez he was sayin good by to his darter  i mout hev done all this if it had settled things to please me  for while you and flynn and that sacramento chap ez all about the same sort o men roseys a different kind from their sort o women  mademoiselle is an angel said de ferrieres suddenly rising with an excess of extravagance  a saint  look  i cram the lie ha down his throat who challenges it  ef by mamselle ye mean my rosey said nott quietly laying his powerful hands on de ferrieress shoulders and slowly pinning him down again upon his chair yere about right though she aint mamselle yet  ez i was sayin i might hev killed you offhand if i hed thought it would hev been a good thing for rosey  for her  ah well  look i am ready interrupted de ferrieres again springing to his feet and throwing open his coat with both hands  see here at my heartfire  ez i was sayin continued nott once more pressing the excited man down in his chair i might hev wiped ye outand mebbee ye wouldnt hev keeredor you might hev wiped me out and i mout hev said thankee but i reckon this aint a case for whats comfable for you and me  its whats good for rosey  and the thing to kalkilate is whats to be done  his small round eyes for the first time rested on de ferrieress face and were quickly withdrawn  it was evident that this abstracted look which had fascinated his lodger was merely a resolute avoidance of de ferrieress glance and it became apparent later that this avoidance was due to a ludicrous appreciation of de ferrieress attractions  and after weve done that we must kalkilate what rosey is and what rosey wants  praps ye allow you know what rosey is praps youve seen her prance round in velvet bonnets and white satin slippers and sich  praps youve seen her readin tracks and vyages without waitin to spell a word or catch her breath but that aint the rosey ez i know  its a little child ez uster crawl in and out the tailboard of a mizzouri wagon on the alcali pizoned plains where there wasnt another bit of gods mercy on yearth to be seen for miles and miles  its a little gal as uster hunger and thirst ez quiet and mannerly ez she now eats and drinks in plenty whose voice was ez steady with injins yelling round her nest in the leaves on sweetwater ez in her purty cabin up yonder thats the gal ez i know  thats the rosey ez my ole woman puts into my arms one night arter we left laramie when the fever was high and sez abner sez she the chariot is swingin low for me tonight but thar aint room in it for her or you to git in or hitch on  take her and rare her so we kin all jine on the other shore sez she  and id knowed the other shore wasnt no kaliforny  and that night praps the chariot swung lower than ever before and my ole woman stepped into it and left me and rosey to creep on in the old wagon alone  its them kind o things added mr nott thoughtfully that seem to pint to my killin you on sight ez the best thing to be done  and yet rosey mightnt like it  he had slipped one of his feet out of his huge carpet slippers and as he reached down to put it on again he added calmly and ez to yer marrying her it aint to be done  the utterly bewildered expression which transfigured de ferrieress face at this announcement was unobserved by notts averted eyes nor did he perceive that his listener the next moment straightened his erect figure and adjusted his cravat  ef rosey he continued hez read in vyges and tracks in eyetalian and french countries of such chaps ez you and kalkilates youre the right kind to tie to mebbee it mout hev done if youd been livin over thar in a pallis but somehow it dont jibe in over here and agree with a shipand that ship lying comfable ashore in san francisco  you dont seem to suit the climate you see and your general gait is likely to stampede the other cattle agin said nott with an ostentation of looking at his companion but really gazing on vacancy this fixed up antique style of yours goes better with them ivy kivered ruins in rome and palmyry that roseys mixed you up with than it would yere  i aint saying he added as de ferrieres was about to speak i aint sayin ez that child aint smitten with ye  it aint no use to lie and say she dont prefer you to her old father or young chaps of her own age and kind  ive seed it afor now  i suspicioned it afor i seed her slip out o this place tonight  thar keep your hair on such ez it is he added as de ferrieres attempted a quick deprecatory gesture  i aint askin yer how often she comes here nor what she sez to you nor you to her  i aint asked her and i dont ask you  ill allow ez youve settled all the preliminaries and bought her the ring and sich im only askin you now kalkilatin youve got all the keerds in your own hand what youll take to step out and leave the board  the dazed look of de ferrieres might have forced itself even upon notts oneidead fatuity had it not been a part of that gentlemans system delicately to look another way at that moment so as not to embarrass his adversarys calculation  pardon stammered de ferrieres but i do not comprehend  he raised his hand to his head i am not welli am stupid  ah mon dieu  i aint sayin added nott more gently ez you dont feel bad its natral  but it aint business  im asking you he continued taking from his breastpocket a large wallet how much youll take in cash now and the rest next steamer day to give up rosey and leave the ship  de ferrieres staggered to his feet despite notts restraining hand to leave mademoiselle and leave the ship he said huskily is it not  in course  yer can leave things yer just ez you found em when you came you know continued nott for the first time looking around the miserable apartment  its a business job  ill take the bales back agin and you kin reckon up what youre out countin rosey and loss o time  he wishes me to gohe has said repeated de ferrieres to himself thickly  ef you mean me when you say him and ez thar aint any other man around i reckon you doyes  and he asks mehethis man of the feet and the daughterasks mede ferriereswhat i will take continued de ferrieres buttoning his coat  no it is a dream  he walked stiffly to the corner where his portmanteau lay lifted it and going to the outer door a cut through the ships side that communicated with the alley unlocked it and flung it open to the night  a thick mist like the breath of the ocean flowed into the room  you ask me what i shall take to go he said as he stood on the threshold  i shall take what you cannot give monsieur but what i would not keep if i stood here another moment  i take my honor monsieur andi take my leave  for a moment his grotesque figure was outlined in the opening and then disappeared as if he had dropped into an invisible ocean below stupefied and disconcerted at this complete success of his overtures abner nott remained speechless gazing at the vacant space until a cold influx of the mist recalled him  then he rose and shuffled quickly to the door  hi  ferrers  look yersay  wots your hurry pardner  but there was no response  the thick mist which hid the surrounding objects seemed to deaden all sound also  after a moments pause he closed the door but did not lock it and retreating to the centre of the room remained blinking at the two candles and plucking some perplexing problem from his beard suddenly an idea seized him  rosey where was she  perhaps it had been a preconcerted plan and she had fled with him  putting out the lights he stumbled hurriedly through the passage to the gangway above  the cabindoor was open there was the sound of voicesrenshaws and roseys  mr nott felt relieved but not unembarrassed  he would have avoided his daughters presence that evening  but even while making this resolution with characteristic infelicity he blundered into the room  rosey looked up with a slight start renshaws animated face was changed to its former expression of inward discontent  you came in so like a ghost father said rosey with a slight peevishness that was new to her  and i thought you were in town dont go mr renshaw  but mr renshaw intimated that he had already trespassed upon miss notts time and that no doubt her father wanted to talk with her to his surprise and annoyance however mr nott insisted on accompanying him to his room and without heeding renshaws cold goodnight entered and closed the door behind him  praps said mr nott with a troubled air you disremember that when you first kem here you asked me if you could hev that er loft that the frenchman had down stairs  no i dont remember it said renshaw almost rudely  but he added after a pause with an air of a man obliged to revive a stale and unpleasant memory if i didwhat about it  nuthin only that you kin hev it tomorrow ez that ere frenchman is movin out responded nott  i thought you was sorter keen about it when you first kem  umph well talk about it tomorrow  something in the look of wearied perplexity with which mr nott was beginning to regard his own mal a propos presence arrested the young mans attention whats the reason you didnt sell this old ship long ago take a decent house in the town and bring up your daughter like a lady he asked with a sudden blunt good humor  but even this implied blasphemy against the habitation he worshiped did not prevent mr nott from his usual misconstruction of the question  i reckon now roseys got highflown ideas of livin in a castle with ruins eh he said cunningly  havent heard her say returned renshaw abruptly  goodnight  firmly convinced that rosey had been unable to conceal from mr renshaw the influence of her dreams of a castellated future with de ferrieres he regained the cabin  satisfying himself that his daughter had retired he sought his own couch  but not to sleep the figure of de ferrieres standing in the ship side and melting into the outer darkness haunted him and compelled him in dreams to rise and follow him through the alleys and byways of the crowded city  again it was a part of his morbid suspicion that he now invested the absent man with a potential significance and an unknown power  what deeplaid plans might he not form to possess himself of rosey of which he abner nott would be ignorant unchecked by the restraint of a fathers roof he would now give full license to his power  said hed take his honor with him muttered abner to himself in the dim watches of the night lookin at that sayin in its right light it looks bad    v  the elaborately untruthful account which mr nott gave his daughter of de ferrieress sudden departure was more fortunate than his usual equivocations  while it disappointed and slightly mortified her it did not seem to her inconsistent with what she already knew of him said his doctor had ordered him to quit town under an hour owing to a comin attack of hay fever and he had a friend from furrin parts waitin him at the springs rosey explained nott hesitating between his desire to avoid his daughters eyes and his wish to observe her countenance  was he worsei mean did he look badly father inquired rosey thoughtfully  i reckon not exackly bad  kinder looked ez if he mout be worse soon ef he didnt hump hisself  did you see himin his room asked rosey anxiously  upon the answer to this simple question depended the future confidential relations of father and daughter  if her father had himself detected the means by which his lodger existed she felt that her own obligations to secrecy had been removed  but mr notts answer disposed of this vain hope  it was a response after his usual fashion to the question he imagined she artfully wished to ask i e if he had discovered their rendezvous of the previous night this it was part of his peculiar delicacy to ignore  yet his reply showed that he had been unconscious of the one miserable secret that he might have read easily  i was there an hour or sohim and me alonediscussin trade  i reckon hes got a good thing outer that curled horse hair for i see hes got in an invoice o cushions  ive stored em all in the forrard bulkhead until he sends for em ez mr renshaw hez taken the loft  but although mr renshaw had taken the loft he did not seem in haste to occupy it  he spent part of the morning in uneasily pacing his room in occasional sallies into the street from which he purposelessly returned and once or twice in distant and furtive contemplation of rosey at work in the galley  this last observation was not unnoticed by the astute nott who at once conceiving that he was nourishing a secret and hopeless passion for rosey began to consider whether it was not his duty to warn the young man of her preoccupied affections  but mr renshaws final disappearance obliged him to withhold his confidence till morning  this time mr renshaw left the ship with the evident determination of some settled purpose  he walked rapidly until he reached the countinghouse of mr sleight when he was at once shown into a private office  in a few moments mr sleight a brusque but passionless man joined him  well said sleight closing the door carefully  what news  none said renshaw bluntly  look here sleight he added turning to him suddenly  let me out of this game  i dont like it  does that mean youve found nothing asked sleight sarcastically  it means that i havent looked for anything and that i dont intend to without the full knowledge of that dd fool who owns the ship  youve changed your mind since you wrote that letter said sleight coolly producing from a drawer the note already known to the reader renshaw mechanically extended his hand to take it mr sleight dropped the letter back into the drawer which he quietly locked  the apparently simple act dyed mr renshaws cheek with color but it vanished quickly and with it any token of his previous embarrassment he looked at sleight with the convinced air of a resolute man who had at last taken a disagreeable step but was willing to stand by the consequences  i have changed my mind he said coolly  i found out that it was one thing to go down there as a skilled prospector might go to examine a mine that was to be valued according to his report of the indications but that it was entirely another thing to go and play the spy in a poor devils house in order to buy something he didnt know he was selling and wouldnt sell if he did  and something that the man he bought of didnt think of selling something he himself never paid for and never expected to buy sneered sleight  but something that we expect to buy from our knowledge of all this and it is that which makes all the difference  but you knew all this before  i never saw it in this light before  i never thought of it until i was living there face to face with the old fool i was intending to overreach  i never was sure of it until this morning when he actually turned out one of his lodgers that i might have the very room i required to play off our little game in comfortably  when he did that i made up my mind to drop the whole thing and im here to do it  and let somebody else take the responsibilitywith the percentageunless youve also felt it your duty to warn nott too said sleight with a sneer  you only dare say that to me sleight said renshaw quietly because you have in that drawer an equal evidence of my folly and my confidence but if you are wise you will not presume too far on either let us see how we stand  through the yarn of a drunken captain and a mutinous sailor you became aware of an unclaimed shipment of treasure concealed in an unknown ship that entered this harbor  you are enabled through me to corroborate some facts and identify the ship you proposed to me as a speculation to identify the treasure if possible before you purchased the ship i accepted the offer without consideration on consideration i now decline it but without prejudice or loss to any one but myself as to your insinuation i need not remind you that my presence here today refutes it  i would not require your permission to make a much better bargain with a good natured fool like nott than i could with you  or if i did not care for the business i could have warned the girl  the girlwhat girl  renshaw bit his lip but answered boldly the old mans daughtera poor girlwhom this act would rob as well as her father  sleight looked at his companion attentively  you might have said so at first and let up on this campmeetin exhortation  well thenadmitting youve got the old man and the young girl on the same string and that youve played it pretty low down in the short time youve been therei suppose dick renshaw ive got to see your bluff well how much is it  whats the figure you and she have settled on  for an instant mr sleight was in physical danger  but before he had finished speaking renshaws quick sense of the ludicrous had so far overcome his first indignation as to enable him even to admire the perfect moral insensibility of his companion  as he rose and walked towards the door he half wondered that he had ever treated the affair seriously  with a smile he replied  far from bluffing sleight i am throwing my cards on the table consider that ive passed out  let some other man take my hand rake down the pot if you like old man i leave for sacramento tonight adios  when the door had closed behind him mr sleight summoned his clerk  is that petition for grading pontiac street ready  ive seen the largest property holders sir theyre only waiting for you to sign first  mr sleight paused and then affixed his signature to the paper his clerk laid before him  get the other names and send it up at once  if mr nott doesnt sign sir  no matter  he will be assessed all the same  mr sleight took up his hat  the lascar seaman that was here the other day has been wanting to see you sir  i said you were busy  mr sleight put down his hat  send him up  nevertheless mr sleight sat down and at once abstracted himself so completely as to be apparently in utter oblivion of the man who entered  he was lithe and indianlooking bearing in dress and manner the careless slouch without the easy frankness of a sailor  well said sleight without looking up  i was only wantin to know ef you had any news for me boss  news echoed sleight as if absently news of what  that little matter of the pontiac we talked about boss returned the lascar with an uneasy servility in the whites of his teeth and eyes  oh said sleight thats played out  its a regular fraud its an old forecastle yarn my man that you cant reel off in the cabin  the sailors face darkened  the man who was looking into it has thrown the whole thing up  i tell you its played out repeated sleight without raising his head  its true bossevery word said the lascar with an appealing insinuation that seemed to struggle hard with savage earnestness you can swear me boss i wouldnt lie to a gentleman like you your man hasnt half looked or elseit must be there or  thats just it said sleight slowly whos to know that your friends havent been there alreadythat seems to have been your style  but no one knew it but me until i told you i swear to god  i aint lying boss and i aint drunk  saydont give it up boss that man of yours likely dont believe it because he dont know anything about it  i doi could find it  a silence followed  mr sleight remained completely absorbed in his papers for some moments  then glancing at the lascar he took his pen wrote a hurried note folded it addressed it and holding it between his fingers leaned back in his chair  if you choose to take this note to my man he may give it another show  mind i dont say that he will  hes going to sacramento tonight but you could go down there and find him before he starts hes got a room there i believe  while youre waiting for him you might keep your eyes open to satisfy yourself  ay ay sir said the sailor eagerly endeavoring to catch the eye of his employer  but mr sleight looked straight before him and he turned to go  the sacramento boat goes at nine said mr sleight quietly  this time their glances met and the lascars eye glistened with subtle intelligence  the next moment he was gone and mr sleight again became absorbed in his papers  meanwhile renshaw was making his way back to the pontiac with that lighthearted optimism that had characterized his parting with sleight it was this quality of his nature fostered perhaps by the easy civilization in which he moved that had originally drawn him into relations with the man he had just quitted a quality that had been troubled and darkened by those relations yet when they were broken at once returned  it consequently did not occur to him that he had only selfishly compromised with the difficulty it seemed to him enough that he had withdrawn from a compact he thought dishonorable he was not called upon to betray his partner in that compact merely to benefit others  he had been willing to incur suspicion and loss to reinstate himself in his selfrespect more he could not do without justifying that suspicion  the view taken by sleight was after all that which most business men would takewhich even the unbusinesslike nott would takewhich the girl herself might be tempted to listen to  clearly he could do nothing but abandon the pontiac and her owner to the fate he could not in honor avert  and even that fate was problematical  it did not follow that the treasure was still concealed in the pontiac nor that nott would be willing to sell her  he would make some excuse to notthe smiled to think he would probably be classed in the long line of absconding tenantshe would say goodby to rosey and leave for sacramento that night  he ascended the stairs to the gangway with a freer breast than when he first entered the ship  mr nott was evidently absent and after a quick glance at the halfopen cabin door renshaw turned towards the galley  but miss rosey was not in her accustomed haunt and with a feeling of disappointment which seemed inconsistent with so slight a cause he crossed the deck impatiently and entered his room  he was about to close the door when the prolonged rustle of a trailing skirt in the passage attracted his attention  the sound was so unlike that made by any garment worn by rosey that he remained motionless with his hand on the door  the sound approached nearer and the next moment a white veiled figure with a trailing skirt slowly swept past the room renshaws pulses halted for an instant in half superstitious awe  as the apparition glided on and vanished in the cabin door he could only see that it was the form of a beautiful and graceful womanbut nothing more  bewildered and curious he forgot himself so far as to follow it and impulsively entered the cabin  the figure turned uttered a little cry threw the veil aside and showed the half troubled half blushing face of rosey  ibegyour pardon stammered renshaw i didnt know it was you  i was trying on some things said rosey recovering her composure and pointing to an open trunk that seemed to contain a theatrical wardrobesome things father gave me long ago  i wanted to see if there was anything i could use  i thought i was all alone in the ship but fancying i heard a noise forward i came out to see what it was  i suppose it must have been you  she raised her clear eyes to his with a slight touch of womanly reserve that was so incompatible with any vulgar vanity or girlish coquetry that he became the more embarrassed  her dress too of a slightly antique shape rich but simple seemed to reveal and accent a certain repose of gentlewomanliness that he was now wishing to believe he had always noticed  conscious of a superiority in her that now seemed to change their relations completely he alone remained silent awkward and embarrassed before the girl who had taken care of his room and who cooked in the galley  what he had thoughtlessly considered a merely vulgar business intrigue against her stupid father now to his extravagant fancy assumed the proportions of a sacrilege to herself  youve had your revenge miss nott for the fright i once gave you he said a little uneasily for you quite startled me just now as you passed  i began to think the pontiac was haunted  i thought you were a ghost  i dont know why such a ghost should frighten anybody he went on with a desperate attempt to recover his position by gallantry let me seethats donna elviras dressis it not  i dont think that was the poor womans name said rosey simply she died of yellow fever at new orleans as signora somebody  her ignorance seemed to mr renshaw so plainly to partake more of the nun than the provincial that he hesitated to explain to her that he meant the heroine of an opera  it seems dreadful to put on the poor things clothes doesnt it she added  mr renshaws eyes showed so plainly that he thought otherwise that she drew a little austerely towards the door of her stateroom  i must change these things before any one comes she said dryly  that means i must go i suppose  but couldnt you let me wait here or in the gangway until then miss nott  i am going away tonight and i maynt see you again  he had not intended to say this but it slipped from his embarrassed tongue  she stopped with her hand on the door  you are going away  ithinki must leave tonight  i have some important business in sacramento  she raised her frank eyes to his  the unmistakable look of disappointment that he saw in them gave his heart a sudden throb and sent the quick blood to his cheeks  its too bad she said abstractedly  nobody ever seems to stay here long  captain bower promised to tell me all about the ship and he went away the second week  the photographer left before he finished the picture of the pontiac monsieur de ferrieres has only just gone and now you are going  perhaps unlike them i have finished my season of usefulness here he replied with a bitterness he would have recalled the next moment but rosey with a faint sigh saying i wont be long entered the stateroom and closed the door behind her  renshaw bit his lip and pulled at the long silken threads of his moustache until they smarted  why had he not gone at once  why was it necessary to say he might not see her againand if he had said it why should he add anything more  what was he waiting for now  to endeavor to prove to her that he really bore no resemblance to captain bower the photographer the crazy frenchman de ferrieres  or would he be forced to tell her that he was running away from a conspiracy to defraud her fathermerely for something to say  was there ever such folly  rosey was not long as she had said but he was beginning to pace the narrow cabin impatiently when the door opened and she returned  she had resumed her ordinary calico gown but such was the impression left upon renshaws fancy that she seemed to wear it with a new grace at any other time he might have recognized the change as due to a new corset which strict veracity compels me to record rosey had adopted for the first time that morning  howbeit her slight coquetry seemed to have passed for she closed the open trunk with a return of her old listless air and sitting on it rested her elbows on her knees and her oval chin in her hands  i wish you would do me a favor she said after a reflective pause  let me know what it is and it shall be done replied renshaw quickly  if you should come across monsieur de ferrieres or hear of him i wish you would let me know  he was very poorly when he left here and i should like to know if he was better  he didnt say where he was going  at least he didnt tell father but i fancy he and father dont agree  i shall be very glad of having even that opportunity of making you remember me miss nott returned renshaw with a faint smile i dont suppose either that it would be very difficult to get news of your friendeverybody seems to know him  but not as i did said rosey with an abstracted little sigh  mr renshaw opened his brown eyes upon her  was he mistaken was this romantic girl only a little coquette playing her provincial airs on him  you say he and your father didnt agree  that means i suppose that you and he agreedand that was the result  i dont think father knew anything about it said rosey simply  mr renshaw rose  and this was what he had been waiting to hear perhaps he said grimly you would also like news of the photographer and captain bower or did your father agree with them better  no said rosey quietly  she remained silent for a moment and lifting her lashes said father always seemed to agree with you and that she hesitated  thats why you dont  i didnt say that said rosey with an incongruous increase of coldness and color  i only meant to say it was that which makes it seem so hard you should go now  notwithstanding his previous determination renshaw found himself sitting down again  confused and pleased wishing he had said moreor lesshe said nothing and rosey was forced to continue  its strange isnt itbut father was urging me this morning to make a visit to some friends at the old ranch  i didnt want to go  i like it much better here  but you cannot bury yourself here forever miss nott said renshaw with a sudden burst of honest enthusiasm  sooner or later you will be forced to go where you will be properly appreciated where you will be admired and courted where your slightest wish will be law  believe me without flattery you dont know your own power  it doesnt seem strong enough to keep even the little i like here said rosey with a slight glistening of the eyes  but she added hastily you dont know how much the dear old ship is to me its the only home i think i ever had  but the ranch said renshaw  the ranch seemed to be only the old wagon halted in the road  it was a very little improvement on outdoors said rosey with a little shiver  but this is so cozy and snug and yet so strange and foreign do you know i think i began to understand why i like it so since you taught me so much about ships and voyages  before that i only learned from books  books deceive you i think more than people do  dont you think so  she evidently did not notice the quick flush that covered his cheeks and apparently dazzled his troubled eyelid for she went on confidentially  i was thinking of you yesterday  i was sitting by the galley door looking forward  you remember the first day i saw you when you startled me by coming up out of the hatch  i wish you wouldnt think of that said renshaw with more earnestness than he would have made apparent  i dont want to either said rosey gravely for ive had a strange fancy about it  i saw once when i was younger a picture in a print shop in montgomery street that haunted me  i think it was called the pirate  there was a number of wickedlooking sailors lying around the deck and coming out of a hatch was one figure with his hands on the deck and a cutlass in his mouth  thank you said renshaw  you dont understand  he was horridlooking not at all like you i never thought of him when i first saw you but the other day i thought how dreadful it would have been if some one like him and not like you had come up then  that made me nervous sometimes of being alone  i think father is too  he often goes about stealthily at night as if he was watching for something  renshaws face grew suddenly dark  could it be possible that sleight had always suspected him and set spies to watchor was he guilty of some double intrigue  he thinks continued rosey with a faint smile that some one is looking around the ship and talks of setting beartraps  i hope youre not mad mr renshaw she added suddenly catching sight of his changed expression at my foolishness in saying you reminded me of the pirate  i meant nothing  i know youre incapable of meaning anything but good to anybody miss nott perhaps to me more than i deserve said renshaw with a sudden burst of feeling  i wishi wishyou would do me a favor you asked me one just now  he had taken her hand  it seemed so like a mere illustration of his earnestness that she did not withdraw it  your father tells you everything  if he has any offer to dispose of the ship will you write to me at once before anything is concluded  he winced a littlethe sentence of sleight whats the figure you and she have settled upon flashed across his mind  he scarcely noticed that rosey had withdrawn her hand coldly  perhaps you had better speak to father as it is his business besides i shall not be here  i shall be at the ranch  but you said you didnt want to go  ive changed my mind said rosey listlessly  i shall go tonight  she rose as if to indicate that the interview was ended  with an overpowering instinct that his whole future happiness depended upon his next act he made a step towards her with eager outstretched hands but she slightly lifted her own with a warning gesture i hear father comingyou will have a chance to talk business with him she said and vanished into her stateroom    vi  the heavy tread of abner nott echoed in the passage  confused and embarrassed renshaw remained standing at the door that had closed upon rosey as her father entered the cabin  providence which always fostered mr notts characteristic misconceptions left that perspicacious parent but one interpretation of the situation rosey had evidently just informed mr renshaw that she loved another  i was just saying goodby to miss nott said renshaw hastily regaining his composure with an effort  i am going to sacramento tonight and will not return  i  in course in course interrupted nott soothingly thats wot you say now and thats what you allow to do  thats wot they allus do  i mean said renshaw reddening at what he conceived to be an allusion to the absconding propensities of notts previous tenantsi mean that you shall keep the advance to cover any loss you might suffer through my giving up the rooms  certingly said nott laying his hand with a large sympathy on renshaws shoulder but well drop that just now  we wont swap hosses in the middle of the river  well square up accounts in your room he added raising his voice that rosey might overhear him after a preliminary wink at the young man  yes sir well just square up and settle in there  come along mr renshaw pushing him with paternal gentleness from the cabin with his hand still upon his shoulder he followed him into the passage  half annoyed at his familiarity yet not altogether displeased by this illustration of roseys belief of his preference renshaw wonderingly accompanied him nott closed the door and pushing the young man into a chair deliberately seated himself at the table opposite  its just as well that rosey reckons that you and me is settlin our accounts he began cunningly and mebbee its just ez well ez she should reckon youre goin away  but i am going interrupted renshaw impatiently  i leave tonight  surely surely said nott gently thats wot you kalkilate to do thats just natral in a young feller  thats about what i reckon id hev done to her mother if anythin like this hed ever cropped up which it didnt  not but what almiry jane had young fellers enough round her but cept ole judge peter ez was lamed in the war of 1812 there aint no similarity ez i kin see he added musingly  i am afraid i cant see any similarity either mr nott said renshaw struggling between a dawning sense of some impending absurdity and his growing passion for rosey  for heavens sake speak out if youve got anything to say  mr nott leaned forward and placed his large hand on the young mans shoulder  thats it  thats what i sed to myself when i seed how things were pintin  speak out sez i abner  speak out if youve got anything to say  you kin trust this yer mr renshaw  he aint the kind of man to creep into the bosom of a mans ship for pupposes of his own  he aint a man that would hunt round until he discovered a poor mans treasure and then try to rob  stop said renshaw with a set face and darkening eyes  what treasure what man are you speaking of  why rosey and mr ferrers returned nott simply  renshaw sank into his seat again  but the expression of relief which here passed swiftly over his face gave way to one of uneasy interest as nott went on  praps its a little highfalutin talkin of rosey ez a treasure but considerin mr renshaw ez shes the only propty ive kept by me for seventeen years ez hez paid interest and increased in valooe it aint sayin too much to call her so  and ez ferrers knows this he oughter been content with gougin me in that horsehair spec without goin for rosey  praps yer surprised at hearing me speak o my own flesh and blood ez if i was talkin hosstrade but you and me is busness men mr renshaw and we discusses ez such  we aint goin to slosh round and slop over in potry and sentiment continued nott with a tremulous voice and a hand that slightly shook on renshaws shoulder we aint goin to git up and sing thoust larned to love another thoust broken every vow weve parted from each other and my bozoms lonely now oh is it well to sever such hearts as ourn for ever kin i forget thee never farewell farewell farewell  ye never happend to hear jim baker sing that at the moosic hall on dupont street mr renshaw continued mr nott enthusiastically when he had recovered from that complete absence of punctuation which alone suggested verse to his intellect  he sorter struck water down here indicating his heart every time  but what has miss nott to do with m de ferrieres asked renshaw with a faint smile  mr nott regarded him with dumb round astonished eyes  heznt she told yer  certainly not  and she didnt let on anythin about him he continued feebly  she said shed liked to know where  he stopped with the reflection that he was betraying her confidences  a dim foreboding of some new form of deceit to which even the man before him was a consenting party almost paralyzed notts faculties then she didnt tell yer that she and ferrers was sparkin and keepin kimpany together that she and him was engaged and was kalkilatin to run away to furrin parts that she cottoned to him more than to the ship or her father  she certainly did not and i shouldnt believe it said renshaw quickly  nott smiled  he was amused he astutely recognized the usual trustfulness of love and youth  there was clearly no deceit here renshaws attentive eyes saw the smile and his brow darkened  i like to hear yer say that mr renshaw said nott and its no more than rosey deserves ez its suthing onnatral and spelllike thats come over her through ferrers  it aint my rosey  but its gospel truth whether shes bewitched or not whether its them damn fool stories she readsand its like ez not hes just the kind o snipe to write em hisself and sorter advertise hisself dont yer seeshes allus stuck up for him  theyve had clandesent interviews and when i taxed him with it he ez much ez allowed it was so and reckoned he must leave so ez he could run her off you knowkinder stampede her with honor  thems his very words  but that is all past he is gone and miss nott does not even know where he is said renshaw with a laugh which however concealed a vague uneasiness  mr nott rose and opened the door carefully  when he had satisfied himself that no one was listening he came back and said in a whisper thats a lie  not ez rosey means to lie but its a trick hes put upon that poor child  that man mr renshaw hez been hangin round the pontiac ever since  ive seed him twice with my own eyes pass the cabin windys  more than that ive heard strange noises at night and seen strange faces in the alley over yer  and only jist now ez i kem in i ketched sight of a furrin lookin chinee nigger slinking round the back door of what useter be ferrerss loft  did he look like a sailor asked renshaw quickly with a return of his former suspicion  not more than i do said nott glancing complacently at his peajacket  he had rings on his yeers like a wench  mr renshaw started  but seeing notts eyes fixed on him he said lightly but what have these strange faces and this strange manprobably only a lascar sailor out of a jobto do with ferrieres  friends o hisfeller furrin citizensspies on rosey dont you see but they cant play the old man mr renshaw  ive told rosey she must make a visit to the old ranch  once ive got her ther safe i reckon i kin manage mr ferrers and any number of chinee niggers he kin bring along  renshaw remained for a few moments lost in thought  then rising suddenly he grasped mr notts hand with a frank smile but determined eyes  i havent got the hang of this mr nottthe whole thing gets me  i only know that ive changed my mind  im not going to sacramento  i shall stay here old man until i see you safe through the business or my names not dick renshaw theres my hand on it dont say a word  maybe it is no more than i ought to doperhaps not half enough  only remember not a word of this to your daughter  she must believe that i leave tonight and the sooner you get her out of this cursed ship the better  deacon flints girls are goin up in tonights boat  ill send rosey with them said nott with a cunning twinkle  renshaw nodded  nott seized his hand with a wink of unutterable significance  left to himself renshaw tried to review more calmly the circumstances in these strange revelations that had impelled him to change his resolution so suddenly  that the ship was under the surveillance of unknown parties and that the description of them tallied with his own knowledge of a certain lascar sailor who was one of sleights informantsseemed to be more than probable  that this seemed to point to sleights disloyalty to himself while he was acting as his agent or a double treachery on the part of sleights informants was in either case a reason and an excuse for his own interference  but the connection of the absurd frenchman with the case which at first seemed a characteristic imbecility of his landlord bewildered him the more he thought of it  rejecting any hypothesis of the girls affection for the antiquated figure whose sanity was a question of public criticism he was forced to the equally alarming theory that ferrieres was cognizant of the treasure and that his attentions to rosey were to gain possession of it by marrying her  might she not be dazzled by a picture of this wealth  was it not possible that she was already in part possession of the secret and her strange attraction to the ship and what he had deemed her innocent craving for information concerning it a consequence  why had he not thought of this before  perhaps she had detected his purpose from the first and had deliberately checkmated him  the thought did not increase his complacency as nott softly returned  its all right he began with a certain satisfaction in this rare opportunity for machiavellian diplomacy its all fixed now rosey tumbled to it at once partiklerly when i said you was bound to go but wot makes mr renshaw go father sez she wot makes everybody run away from the ship sez she rather peart like and sassy for her mr renshaw hez contractin business sez i got a big thing up in sacramento thatll make his fortun sez ifor i wasnt goin to give yer away dont ye see  he had some business to talk to you about the ship sez she lookin at me under the corner of her pocket handkerchief  lots o business sez i  then i reckon he dont care to hev me write to him sez she  not a bit sez i he wouldnt answer ye if ye did  yell never hear from that chap agin  but what the devil interrupted the young man impetuously  keep yer hair on remonstrated the old man with dark intelligence ef youd seen the way she flounced into her stateroomshe rosey ez allus moves ez softly ez a spirityoud hev wished id hev unloaded a little more  no sir gals is gals in some things all the time  renshaw rose and paced the room rapidly  perhaps id better speak to her again before she goes he said impulsively  praps youd better not replied the imperturbable nott  irritated as he was renshaw could not avoid the reflection that the old man was right  what indeed could he say to her with his present imperfect knowledge  how could she write to him if that knowledge was correct  ef said nott kindly with a laying on of large benedictory and paternal hands ef yer are willin to see rosey agin without speakin to her i reckon i ken fix it for yer  im goin to take her down to the boat in half an hour  ef yer should happenmind ef yer should happen to be down there seein some friends off and sorter promenadin up and down the wharf like them hightoned chaps on montgomery streetye might ketch her eye unconscious like  or ye might do this  he rose after a moments cogitation and with a face of profound mystery opened the door and beckoned renshaw to follow him  leading the way cautiously he brought the young man into an open unpartitioned recess beside her stateroom  it seemed to be used as a storeroom and renshaws eye was caught by a trunk the size and shape of the one that had provided rosey with the materials of her masquerade  pointing to it mr nott said in a grave whisper this yer trunk is the companion trunk to roseys shes got the things them opery women wears this yer contains the he things the duds and fixins o the men o the same stripe throwing it open he continued now mr renshaw gals is gals its natral they should be took by fancy dress and store clothes on young chaps as on theirselves  that man ferrers hez got the dead wood on all of ye in this sort of thing and hez been playing so to speak a lone hand all along  and ef thars anythin in thar he added lifting part of a theatrical wardrobe that you think youd fancyanythin youd like to put on when ye promenade the wharf down yonderits yours  dont ye be bashful but help yourself  it was fully a minute before renshaw fairly grasped the old mans meaning  but when he didwhen the suggested spectacle of himself arrayed a la ferrieres gravely promenading the wharf as a last gorgeous appeal to the affections of rosey rose before his fancy he gave way to a fit of genuine laughter  the nervous tension of the past few hours relaxed he laughed until the tears came into his eyes he was still laughing when the door of the cabin was suddenly opened and rosey appeared cold and distant on the threshold  ibeg your pardon stammered renshaw hastily  i didnt meanto disturb youi  without looking at him rosey turned to her father  i am ready she said coldly and closed the door again  a glance of artful intelligence came into notts eyes which had remained blankly staring at renshaws apparently causeless hilarity turning to him he winked solemnly  that keerless kind o hosslaff jist fetched her he whispered and vanished before his chagrined companion could reply  when mr nott and his daughter departed renshaw was not in the ship neither did he make a spectacular appearance on the wharf as mr nott had fondly expected nor did he turn up again until after nine oclock when he found the old man in the cabin awaiting his return with some agitation  a minit ago he said mysteriously closing the door behind renshaw i heard a voice in the passage and goin out who should i see agin but that darned furrin nigger ez i told yer bout kinder hidin in the dark his eyes shinin like a catamount i was jist reachin for my weppins when he riz up with a grin and handed me this yer letter  i told him i reckoned youd gone to sacramento but he said he wez sure you was in your room and to prove it i went thar  but when i kem back the dd skunk had vamoosedgot frightened i reckonand wasnt nowhar to be seen  reashaw took the letter hastily  it contained only a line in sleights hand  if you change your mind the bearer may be of service to you  he turned abruptly to nott  you say it was the same lascar you saw before  it was  then all i can say is he is no agent of de ferrieress said renshaw turning away with a disappointed air  mr nott would have asked another question but with an abrupt goodnight the young man entered his room locked the door and threw himself on his bed to reflect without interruption  but if he was in no mood to stand notts fatuous conjectures he was less inclined to be satisfied with his own  had he been again carried away through his impulses evoked by the caprices of a pretty coquette and the absurd theories of her half imbecile father  had he broken faith with sleight and remained in the ship for nothing and would not his change of resolution appear to be the result of sleights note but why had the lascar been haunting the ship before  in the midst of these conjectures he fell asleep    vii  between three and four in the morning the clouds broke over the pontiac and the moon riding high picked out in black and silver the long hulk that lay cradled between the iron shells of warehouses and the wooden frames of tenements on either side  the galley and covered gangway presented a mass of undefined shadow against which the white deck shone brightly stretching to the forecastle and bows where the tiny glass roof of the photographer glistened like a gem in the pontiacs crest  so peaceful and motionless she lay that she might have been some petrifaction of a past age now first exhumed and laid bare to the cold light of the stars  nevertheless this calm security was presently invaded by a sense of stealthy life and motion  what had seemed a fixed shadow suddenly detached itself from the deck and began to slip stanchion by stanchion along the bulwarks toward the companion way  at the cabin door it halted and crouched motionless  then rising it glided forward with the same staccato movement until opposite the slight elevation of the forehatch  suddenly it darted to the hatch unfastened and lifted it with a swift familiar dexterity and disappeared in the opening  but as the moon shone upon its vanishing face it revealed the whitening eyes and teeth of the lascar seaman  dropping to the lower deck lightly he felt his way through the dark passage between the partitions evidently less familiar to him halting before each door to listen  returning forward he reached the second hatchway that had attracted roseys attention and noiselessly unclosed its fastenings  a penetrating smell of bilge arose from the opening drawing a small bullseye lantern from his breast he lit it and unhesitatingly let himself down to the further depth  the moving flash of his light revealed the recesses of the upper hold the abyss of the well amidships and glanced from the shining backs of moving zigzags of rats that seemed to outline the shadowy beams and transoms disregarding those curious spectators of his movements he turned his attention eagerly to the inner casings of the hold that seemed in one spot to have been strengthened by fresh timbers  attacking this stealthily with the aid of some tools hidden in his oilskin clothing in the light of the lantern he bore a fanciful resemblance to the predatory animals around him  the low continuous sound of rasping and gnawing of timber which followed heightened the resemblance  at the end of a few minutes he had succeeded in removing enough of the outer planking to show that the entire filling of the casing between the stanchions was composed of small boxes  dragging out one of them with feverish eagerness to the light the lascar forced it open  in the rays of the bullseye a wedged mass of discolored coins showed with a lurid glow the story of the pontiac was truethe treasure was there  but mr sleight had overlooked the logical effect of this discovery on the natural villainy of his tool  in the very moment of his triumphant execution of his patrons suggestions the idea of keeping the treasure to himself flashed upon his mind  he had discovered itwhy should he give it up to anybody  he had run all the risks if he were detected at that moment who would believe that his purpose there at midnight was only to satisfy some one else that the treasure was still intact no  the circumstances were propitious he would get the treasure out of the ship at once drop it over her side hastily conceal it in the nearest lot adjacent and take it away at his conveniencewho would be the wiser for it  but it was necessary to reconnoitre first  he knew that the loft overhead was empty  he knew that it communicated with the alley for he had tried the door that morning  he would convey the treasure there and drop it into the alley  the boxes were heavy each one would require a separate journey to the ships side but he would at least secure something if he were interrupted  he stripped the casing and gathered the boxes together in a pile  ah yes it was funny too that hethe lascar houndthe dd niggershould get what bigger and bullier men than he had died for the mates blood was on those boxes if the salt water had not washed it out  it was a hell of a fight when they dragged the captainoh what was that  was it the splash of a rat in the bilge or what  a superstitious terror had begun to seize him at the thought of blood the stifling hold seemed again filled with struggling figures he had known the air thick with cries and blasphemies that he had forgotten he rose to his feet and running quickly to the hatchway leaped to the deck above  all was quiet  the door leading to the empty loft yielded to his touch  he entered and gliding through unbarred and opened the door that gave upon the alley  the cold air and moonlight flowed in silently the way of escape was clear  bah  he would go back for the treasure  he had reached the passage when the door he had just opened was suddenly darkened  turning rapidly he was conscious of a gaunt figure grotesque silent and erect looming on the threshold between him and the sky  hidden in the shadow he made a stealthy step towards it with an iron wrench in his uplifted hand  but the next moment his eyes dilated with superstitious horror the iron fell from this hand and with a scream like a frightened animal he turned and fled into the passage  in the first access of his blind terror he tried to reach the deck above through the forehatch but was stopped by the sound of a heavy tread overhead the immediate fear of detection now overcame his superstition he would have even faced the apparition again to escape through the loft but before he could return there other footsteps approached rapidly from the end of the passage he would have to traverse there was but one chance of escape left nowthe forehold he had just quitted  he might hide there until the alarm was over  he glided back to the hatch lifted it and it closed softly over his head as the upper hatch was simultaneously raised and the small round eyes of abner nott peered down upon it  the other footsteps proved to be renshaws but attracted by the open door of the loft he turned aside and entered  as soon as he disappeared mr nott cautiously dropped through the opening to the deck below and going to the other hatch through which the lascar had vanished deliberately refastened it  in a few moments renshaw returned with a light and found the old man sitting on the hatch  the loft door was open said renshaw  theres little doubt whoever was here escaped that way  surely said nott  there was a peculiar look of machiavellian sagacity in his face which irritated renshaw  then youre sure it was ferrieres you saw pass by your window before you called me he asked  nott nodded his head with an expression of infinite profundity  but you say he was going from the ship  then it could not have been he who made the noise we heard down here  mebbee no and mebbee yes returned nott cautiously  but if he was already concealed inside the ship as that open door which you say you barred from the inside would indicate what the devil did he want with this said renshaw producing the monkeywrench he had picked up  mr nott examined the tool carefully and shook his head with momentous significance  nevertheless his eyes wandered to the hatch on which he was seated  did you find anything disturbed there said renshaw following the direction of his eye  was that hatch fastened as it is now  it was said nott calmly  but ye wouldnt mind fetchin me a hammer and some o them big nails from the locker would yer while i hang round here just so ez to make sure against another attack  renshaw complied with his request but as nott proceeded to gravely nail down the fastenings of the hatch he turned impatiently away to complete his examination of the ship  the doors of the other lofts and their fastenings appeared secure and undisturbed  yet it was undeniable that a felonious entrance had been made but by whom or for what purpose still remained uncertain  even now renshaw found it difficult to accept notts theory that de ferrieres was the aggressor and rosey the object nor could he justify his own suspicion that the lascar had obtained a surreptitious entrance under sleights directions  with a feeling that if rosey had been present he would have confessed all and demanded from her an equal confidence he began to hate his feeble purposeless and inefficient alliance with her father who believed but dare not tax his daughter with complicity in this outrage  what could be done with a man whose only idea of action at such a moment was to nail up an undisturbed entrance in his invaded house  he was so preoccupied with these thoughts that when nott rejoined him in the cabin he scarcely heeded his presence and was entirely oblivious of the furtive looks which the old man from time to time cast upon his face  i reckon ye wouldnt mind broke in nott suddenly ef i asked a favor of ye mr renshaw  mebbee yell allow its askin too much in the matter of expense mebbee yell allow its askin too much in the matter o time  but i kalkilate to pay all the expense and if youd let me know what yer vally yer time at i reckon i could stand that what id be askin is this  would ye mind takin a letter from me to rosey and bringin back an answer  renshaw stared speechlessly at this absurd realization of his wish of a moment before  i dont think i understand you he stammered  praps not returned nott with great gravity  but thats not so much matter to you ez your time and expenses  i meant i should be glad to go if i can be of any service to you said renshaw hastily  you kin ketch the seven oclock boat this morning and youll reach san rafael at ten  but i thought miss rosey went to petaluma interrupted renshaw quickly  nott regarded him with an expression of patronizing superiority thats what we ladled out to the public ginrally and to ferrers and his gang in partickler  we said petalumey but if you go to madrono cottage san rafael youll find rosey thar  if mr renshaw required anything more to convince him of the necessity of coming to some understanding with rosey at once it would have been this last evidence of her fathers utterly dark and supremely inscrutable designs  he assented quickly and nott handed him a note  yell be partickler to give this inter her own hands and wait for an answer said nott gravely  resisting the proposition to enter then and there into an elaborate calculation of the value of his time and the expenses of the trip renshaw found himself at seven oclock on the san rafael boat brief as was the journey it gave him time to reflect upon his coming interview with rosey  he had resolved to begin by confessing all the attempt of last night had released him from any sense of duty to sleight besides he did not doubt that notts letter contained some reference to this affair only known to notts dark and tortuous intelligence    viii  madrono cottage lay at the entrance of a little canada already green with the early winter rains and nestled in a thicket of the harlequin painted trees that gave it a name  the young man was a little relieved to find that rosey had gone to the postoffice a mile away and that he would probably overtake her or meet her returningalone  the roadlittle more than a trailwound along the crest of the hill looking across the canada to the long dark heavilywooded flank of mount tamalpais that rose from the valley a dozen miles away  a cessation of the warm rain a rift in the sky and the rare spectacle of cloud scenery combined with a certain sense of freedom restored that lighthearted gayety that became him most  at a sudden turn of the road he caught sight of roseys figure coming towards him and quickened his step with the impulsiveness of a boy  but she suddenly disappeared and when he again saw her she was on the other side of the trail apparently picking the leaves of a manzanita  she had already seen him  somehow the frankness of his greeting was checked  she looked up at him with cheeks that retained enough of their color to suggest why she had hesitated and said you here mr renshaw  i thought you were in sacramento  and i thought you were in petaluma he retorted gayly  i have a letter from your father  the fact is one of those gentlemen who has been haunting the ship actually made an entry last night  who he was and what he came for nobody knows  perhaps your father gives you his suspicions  he could not help looking at her narrowly as he handed her the note  except that her pretty eyebrows were slightly raised in curiosity she seemed undisturbed as she opened the letter  presently she raised her eyes to his  is this all father gave you  all  youre sure you havent dropped anything  nothing  i have given you all he gave me  and that is all it is  she exhibited the missive a perfectly blank sheet of paper folded like a note  renshaw felt the angry blood glow in his cheeks  this is unpardonable  i assure you miss nott there must be some mistake he himself has probably forgotten the inclosure he continued yet with an inward conviction that the act was perfectly premeditated on the part of the old man  the young girl held out her hand frankly  dont think any more of it mr renshaw  father is forgetful at times  but tell me about last night  in a few words mr renshaw briefly but plainly related the details of the attempt upon the pontiac from the moment that he had been awakened by nott to his discovery of the unknown trespassers flight by the open door to the loft  when he had finished he hesitated and then taking roseys hand said impulsively you will not be angry with me if i tell you all  your father firmly believes that the attempt was made by the old frenchman de ferrieres with a view of carrying you off  a dozen reasons other than the one her father would have attributed it to might have called the blood to her face  but only innocence could have brought the look of astonished indignation to her eyes as she answered quickly  so that was what you were laughing at  not that miss nott said the young man eagerly though i wish to god i could accuse myself of nothing more disloyal  do not speak i beg he added impatiently as rosey was about to reply i have no right to hear you i have no right to even stand in your presence until i have confessed everything  i came to the pontiac i made your acquaintance miss nott through a fraud as wicked as anything your father charges to de ferrieres  i am not a contractor  i never was an honest lodger in the pontiac  i was simply a spy  but you didnt mean to beit was some mistake wasnt it said rosey quite white but more from sympathy with the offenders emotion than horror at the offense  i am afraid i did mean it  but bear with me for a few moments longer and you shall know all  its a long story  will you walk on andtake my arm  you do not shrink from me miss nott  thank you  i scarcely deserve the kindness  indeed so little did rosey shrink that he was conscious of a slight reassuring pressure on his arm as they moved forward and for the moment i fear the young man felt like exaggerating his offense for the sake of proportionate sympathy  do you remember he continued one evening when i told you some sea tales you said you always thought there must be some story about the pontiac there was a story of the pontiac miss notta wicked storya terrible storywhich i might have told you which i ought to have told youwhich was the story that brought me there  you were right too in saying that you thought i had known the pontiac before i stepped first on her deck that day  i had  he laid his disengaged hand across lightly on roseys as if to assure himself that she was listening  i was at that time a sailor  i had been fool enough to run away from college thinking it a fine romantic thing to ship before the mast for a voyage round the world  i was a little disappointed perhaps but i made the best of it and in two years i was second mate of a whaler lying in a little harbor of one of the uncivilized islands of the pacific  while we were at anchor there a french trading vessel put in apparently for water  she had the dregs of a mixed crew of lascars and portuguese who said they had lost the rest of their men by desertion and that the captain and mate had been carried off by fever  there was something so queer in their story that our skipper took the law in his own hands and put me on board of her with a salvage crew  but that night the french crew mutinied cut the cables and would have got to sea if we had not been armed and prepared and managed to drive them below  when we had got them under hatches for a few hours they parleyed and offered to go quietly ashore  as we were short of hands and unable to take them with us and as we had no evidence against them we let them go took the ship to callao turned her over to the authorities lodged a claim for salvage and continued our voyage when we returned we found the truth of the story was known  she had been a french trader from marseilles owned by her captain her crew had mutinied in the pacific killed their officers and the only passengerthe owner of the cargo  they had made away with the cargo and a treasure of nearly half a million of spanish gold for trading purposes which belonged to the passenger  in course of time the ship was sold for salvage and put into the south american trade until the breaking out of the californian gold excitement when she was sent with a cargo to san francisco  that ship was the pontiac which your father bought  a slight shudder ran through the girls frame  i wishi wish you hadnt told me she said  i shall never close my eyes again comfortably on board of her i know  i would say that you had purified her of all stains of her pastbut there may be one that remains  and that in most peoples eyes would be no detraction  you look puzzled miss nottbut i am coming to the explanation and the end of my story  a ship of war was sent to the island to punish the mutineers and pirates for such they were but they could not be found  a private expedition was sent to discover the treasure which they were supposed to have buried but in vain  about two months ago mr sleight told me one of his shipmates had sent him a lascar sailor who had to dispose of a valuable secret regarding the pontiac for a percentage  that secret was that the treasure was never taken by the mutineers out of the pontiac  they were about to land and bury it when we boarded them  they took advantage of their imprisonment under hatches to bury it in the ship  they hid it in the hold so securely and safely that it was never detected by us or the callao authorities  i was then asked as one who knew the vessel to undertake a private examination of her with a view of purchasing her from your father without awakening his suspicions  i assented you have my confession now miss nott  you know my crime  i am at your mercy  roseys arm only tightened around his own  her eyes sought his and you didnt find anything she said  the question sounded so oddly like sleights that renshaw returned a little stiffly  i didnt look  why asked rosey simply  because stammered renshaw with an uneasy consciousness of having exaggerated his sentiment it didnt seem honorable it didnt seem fair to you  oh you silly you might have looked and told me  but said renshaw do you think that would have been fair to sleight  as fair to him as to us  for dont you see it wouldnt belong to any of us  it would belong to the friends or the family of the man who lost it  but there were no heirs said renshaw  that was proved by some impostor who pretended to be his brother and libelled the pontiac at callao but the courts decided he was a lunatic  then it belongs to the poor pirates who risked their own lives for it rather than to sleight who did nothing  she was silent for a moment and then resumed with energy i believe he was at the bottom of that attack last night  i have thought so too said renshaw  then i must go back at once she continued impulsively  father must not be left alone  nor must you said renshaw quickly  do let me return with you and share with you and your father the trouble i have brought upon you  do not he added in a lower tone deprive me of the only chance of expiating my offense of making myself worthy your forgiveness  i am sure said rosey lowering her lids and half withdrawing her arm i am sure i have nothing to forgive  you did not believe the treasure belonged to us any more than to anybody else until you knew me  that is true said the young man attempting to take her hand  i mean said rosey blushing and showing a distracting row of little teeth in one of her infrequent laughs oh you know what i mean  she withdrew her arm gently and became interested in the selection of certain wayside bay leaves as they passed along  all the same i dont believe in this treasure she said abruptly as if to change the subject  i dont believe it ever was hidden inside the pontiac  that can easily be ascertained now said renshaw  but its a pity you didnt find it out while you were about it said rosey  it would have saved so much talk and trouble  i have told you why i didnt search the ship responded renshaw with a slight bitterness  but it seems i could only avoid being a great rascal by becoming a great fool  you never intended to be a rascal said rosey earnestly and you couldnt be a fool except in heeding what a silly girl says i only meant if you had taken me into your confidence it would have been better  might i not say the same to you regarding your friend the old frenchman returned renshaw  what if i were to confess to you that i lately suspected him of knowing the secret and of trying to gain your assistance  instead of indignantly repudiating the suggestion to the young mans great discomfiture rosey only knit her pretty brows and remained for some minutes silent  presently she asked timidly  do you think it wrong to tell another persons secret for their own good  no said renshaw promptly  then ill tell you monsieur de ferrieress  but only because i believe from what you have just said that he will turn out to have some right to the treasure  then with kindling eyes and a voice eloquent with sympathy rosey told the story of her accidental discovery of de ferrieress miserable existence in the loft  clothing it with the unconscious poetry of her fresh young imagination she lightly passed over his antique gallantry and grotesque weakness exalting only his lonely sufferings and mysterious wrongs  renshaw listened lost between shame for his late suspicions and admiration for her thoughtful delicacy until she began to speak of de ferrieress strange allusions to the foreign papers in his portmanteau  i think some were law papers and i am almost certain i saw the word callao printed on one of them  it may be so said renshaw thoughtfully  the old frenchman has always passed for a harmless wandering eccentric  i hardly think public curiosity has ever even sought to know his name much less his history  but had we not better first try to find if there is any property before we examine his claims to it  as you please said rosey with a slight pout but you will find it much easier to discover him than his treasure  its always easier to find the thing youre not looking for  until you want it said renshaw with sudden gravity  how pretty it looks over there said rosey turning her conscious eyes to the opposite mountain  very  they had reached the top of the hill and in the near distance the chimney of madrono cottage was even now visible  at the expected sight they unconsciously stoppedunconsciously disappointed rosey broke the embarrassing silence  theres another way home but its a roundabout way she said timidly  let us take it said renshaw  she hesitated  the boat goes at four and we must return tonight  the more reason why we should make the most of our time now said renshaw with a faint smile  tomorrow all things may be changed tomorrow you may find yourself an heiress miss nott  tomorrow he added with a slight tremor in his voice i may have earned your forgiveness only to say farewell to you forever  let me keep this sunshine this picture this companionship with you long enough to say now what perhaps i must not say tomorrow  they were silent for a moment and then by a common instinct turned together into a narrow trail scarce wide enough for two that diverged from the straight practical path before them  it was indeed a roundabout way home so roundabout in fact that as they wandered on it seemed even to double on its track occasionally lingering long and becoming indistinct under the shadow of madrono and willow at one time stopping blindly before a fallen tree in the hollow where they had quite lost it and had to sit down to recall it a rough way often requiring the mutual help of each others hands and eyes to tread together in security an uncertain way not to be found without whispered consultation and concession and yet a way eventually bringing them hand in hand happy and hopeful to the gate of madrono cottage  and if there was only just time for rosey to prepare to take the boat it was due to the deviousness of the way  if a stray curl was lying loose on roseys cheek and a long hair had caught in renshaws button it was owing to the roughness of the way and if in the tones of their voices and in the glances of their eyes there was a maturer seriousness it was due to the dim uncertainty of the path they had traveled and would hereafter tread together    ix  when mr nott had satisfied himself of renshaws departure he coolly bolted the door at the head of the companion way thus cutting off any communication with the lower deck  taking a long rifle from the rack above his berth he carefully examined the hammer and cap and then cautiously let himself down through the forehatch to the deck below after a deliberate survey of the still intact fastenings of the hatch over the forehold he proceeded quietly to unloose them again with the aid of the tools that still lay there  when the hatch was once more free he lifted it and withdrawing a few feet from the opening sat himself down rifle in hand  a profound silence reigned throughout the lower deck  ye kin rize up out o that said nott gently  there was a stealthy rustle below that seemed to approach the hatch and then with a sudden bound the lascar leaped on the deck but at the same instant nott covered him with his rifle  a slight shade of disappointment and surprise had crossed the old mans face and clouded his small round eyes at the apparition of the lascar but his hand was none the less firm upon the trigger as the frightened prisoner sank on his knees with his hands clasped in the attitude of supplication for mercy  ef youre thinkin o skippin afore ive done with yer said nott with labored gentleness i oughter warn ye that its my style to drop injins at two hundred yards and this deck aint anywhere morn fifty its an uncomfortable style a nasty stylebut its my style  i thought id tell yer so yer could take it easy where you air  wheres ferrers  even in the mans insane terror his utter bewilderment at the question was evident  ferrers he gasped dont know him i swear to god boss  praps said nott with infinite cunning yer dont know the man ez kem into the loft from the alley last nightpraps yer didnt see an airy frenchman with a dyed moustache eh  i thought that would fetch ye he continued as the man started at the evidence that his vision of last night was a living man  praps you and him didnt break into this ship last night jist to run off with my darter rosey  praps yer dont know rosey eh  praps yer dont know ez ferrers wants to marry her and hez been hangin round yer ever since he lefteh  scarcely believing the evidence of his senses that the old man whose treasure he had been trying to steal was utterly ignorant of his real offense and yet uncertain of the penalty of the other crime of which he was accused the lascar writhed his body and stammered vaguely mercy  mercy  well said nott cautiously ez i reckon the hide of a dead chinee nigger aint any more vallyble than that of a dead injin i dont care ef i let up on yerseein the cussedness aint yours but ef i let yer off this once you must take a message to ferrers from me  let me off this time boss and i swear to god i will said the lascar eagerly  ye kin say to ferrerslet me see deliberated nott leaning on his rifle with cautious reflection  ye kin say to ferrers like thissez you ferrers sez you the old man sez that afore you went away you sez to him sez you i take my honor with me sez youhave you got that interrupted nott suddenly  yes boss  i take my honor with me sez you repeated nott slowly now sez youthe old man sez sez hetell ferrers sez he that his honor havin run away agin he sends it back to him and ef he ever ketches it around after this hell shoot it on sight hev yer got that  yes stammered the bewildered captive  then git  the lascar sprang to his feet with the agility of a panther leaped through the hatch above him and disappeared over the bow of the ship with an unhesitating directness that showed that every avenue of escape had been already contemplated by him  slipping lightly from the cutwater to the ground he continued his flight only stopping at the private office of mr sleight  when mr renshaw and rosey nott arrived on board the pontiac that evening they were astonished to find the passage before the cabin completely occupied with trunks and boxes and the bulk of their household goods apparently in the process of removal  mr nott who was superintending the work of two chinamen betrayed not only no surprise at the appearance of the young people but not the remotest recognition of their own bewilderment at his occupation  kalkilatin he remarked casually to his daughter youd rather look arter your fixins rosey ive left em till the last praps yer and mr renshaw wouldnt mind sittin down on that locker until ive strapped this yer box  but what does it all mean father said rosey taking the old man by the lapels of his seajacket and slightly emphasizing her question what in the name of goodness are you doing  breakin camp rosey dear breakin camp jist ez we uster replied nott with cheerful philosophy  kinder like old times aint it lord rosey he continued stopping and following up the reminiscence with the end of the rope in his hand as if it were a clue dont ye mind that day we started outer livermore pass and seed the hull o the californy coast stretchin yondereh but dont ye be skeered rosey dear he added quickly as if in recognition of the alarm expressed in her face  i aint turning ye outer house and home ive jist hired that ere madrono cottage from the peters ontil we kin look round  but youre not leaving the ship father continued rosey impetuously  you havent sold it to that man sleight  mr nott rose and carefully closed the cabin door  then drawing a large wallet from his pocket he said its singlar ye should hev got the name right the first pop aint it rosey but its sleight sure enough all the time  this yer check he added producing a paper from the depths of the wallet this yer check for 25000 dollars is wot he paid for it only two hours ago  but said renshaw springing to his feet furiously youre duped swindledbetrayed  young man said nott throwing a certain dignity into his habitual gesture of placing his hands on renshaws shoulders i bought this yer ship five years ago jist ez she stood for 8000 dollars  kalkilatin wot she cost me in repairs and taxes and wot she brought me in since then accordin to my figgerin i dont call a clear profit of 15000 dollars much of a swindle  tell him all said rosey quickly more alarmed at renshaws despairing face than at the news itself  tell him everything dickmr renshaw it may not be too late  in a voice half choked with passionate indignation renshaw hurriedly repeated the story of the hidden treasure and the plot to rescue it prompted frequently by roseys tenacious memory and assisted by roseys deft and tactful explanations  but to their surprise the imperturbable countenance of abner nott never altered a slight moisture of kindly paternal tolerance of their extravagance glistened in his little eyes but nothing more  ef there was a part o this ship a plank or a bolt ez i dont know ez i hevnt touched with my own hand and looked into with my own eyes thar might be suthin in that story  i dont let on to be a sailor like you but ez i know the ship ez a boy knows his first hoss as a woman knows her first babby i reckon thar aint no treasure yer onless it was brought into the pontiac last night by them chaps  but are you mad  sleight would not pay three times the value of the ship today if he were not positive  and that positive knowledge was gained last night by the villain who broke into the pontiacno doubt the lascar  surely said nott meditatively  the lascar  theres suthin in that  that lascar i fastened down in the hold last night unbeknownst to you mr renshaw and let him out again this morning ekally unbeknownst  and you let him carry his information to sleightwithout a word said renshaw with a sickening sense of notts utter fatuity  i sent him back with a message to the man he kem from said nott winking both his eyes at renshaw significantly and making signs behind his daughters back  rosey conscious of her lovers irritation and more eager to soothe his impatience than from any faith in her suggestion interfered  why not examine the place where he was concealed he may have left some traces of his search  the two men looked at each other  seem ez ive turned the pontiac over to sleight jist ez it stands i dont know ez its xactly on the square said nott doubtfully  youve a right to know at least what you deliver to him interrupted renshaw brusquely bring a lantern  followed by rosey renshaw and nott hurriedly sought the lower deck and the open hatch of the forehold  the two men leaped down first with the lantern and then assisted rosey to descend  renshaw took a step forward and uttered a cry  the rays of the lantern fell on the ships side  the lascar had during his forced seclusion put back the boxes of treasure and replaced the planking yet not so carefully but that the quick eye of renshaw had discovered it  the next moment he had stripped away the planking again and the hurriedlyrestored box which the lascar had found fell to the deck scattering part of its ringing contents  rosey turned pale renshaws eyes flashed fire only abner nott remained quiet and impassive  are you satisfied you have been duped said renshaw passionately  to their surprise mr nott stooped down and picking up one of the coins handed it gravely to renshaw  would ye mind heftin that ere coin in your handfeelin it bitin it scrapin it with a knife and kinder seein how it compares with other coins  what do you mean said renshaw  i mean that that yer cointhat all the coins in this yer box that all the coins in them other boxesand thers forty on emis all and every one of em counterfeits  the piece
