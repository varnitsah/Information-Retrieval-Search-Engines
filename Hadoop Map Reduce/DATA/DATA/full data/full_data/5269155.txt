5269155	jarwin and cuffy by rm ballantyne    chapter one  adrift on the ocean  on a certain morning not very long ago the sun according to his ancient and admirable custom rose at a very early hour and casting his bright beams far and wide over the pacific lighted up the yellow sands and the verdant hills of one of the loveliest of the islands of that mighty sea  it was early morning as we have said and there was plenty of life animal as well as vegetableto be seen on land and sea and in the warm hazy atmosphere  but there were no indications of mans presence in that beautiful scene  the air was perfectly calm yet the gentle swell of the ocean terminated in great waves which came rolling in like walls of glass and fell on the coralreef like rushing snowwreaths with a roar as loud as thunder  thousands of seabirds screamed and circled in the sky  fish leaped high out of their native element into the air as if they wished to catch the gulls while the gulls seemingly smitten with a similar desire dived into the water as if they wished to catch the fish  it might have been observed however that while the fish never succeeded in catching the gulls the latter very frequently caught the fish and without taking the trouble to kill them bolted them down alive  cocoanutpalms cast the shadows of their long stems and graceful tops upon the beach while farther inland a dense forest of tropical plantsbreadfruit trees bananas etceterarose up the mountainsides  here and there open patches might be seen that looked like fields and lawns but there were no cottages or villas  droves of pigs rambled about the valleys and on the hillsides but they were wild pigs  no man tended them  the breadfruits the cocoanuts the bananas the plantains the plums all were beautiful and fit for food but no man owned them or used them for like many other spots in that sea of coral isles and savage men the island was uninhabited  in all the wide expanse of ocean that surrounded that island there was nothing visible save one small solitary speck on the faroff horizon it might have been mistaken for a seagull but it was in reality a rafta mass of spars and planks rudely bound together with ropes  a boats mast rose from the centre of it on which hung a rag of sail and a small red flag drooped motionless from its summit  there were a few casks on the highest part of the raft but no living soul was visible nevertheless it was not without tenants  in a hollow between two of the spars under the shadow of one of the casks lay the form of a man the canvas trousers cotton shirt blue jacket and open necktie bespoke him a sailor but it seemed as though there were nothing left save the dead body of the unfortunate tar so pale and thin and ghastly were his features  a terrier dog lay beside him so shrunken that it looked like a mere scrap of doormatting  both man and dog were apparently dead but they were not so in reality for after lying about an hour quite motionless the man slowly opened his eyes  ah reader it would have touched your heart to have seen those eyes they were so deep set as if in dark caverns and so unnaturally large they gazed round in a vacant way for a few moments until they fell on the dog  then a gleam of fire shot through them and their owner raised his large gaunt wasted frame on one elbow while he gazed with a look of eagerness which was perfectly awful at his dumb companion  not dead yet he said drawing a long sigh  there was a strange incongruous mixture of satisfaction and discontent in the remark which was muttered in a faint whisper  another gleam shot through the large eyes  it was not a pleasant look slowly and as if with difficulty the man drew a claspknife from his pocket and opened it  as he did so his brows lowered and his teeth became clenched  it was quite plain what he meant to do  as he held the open knife over the dogs head he muttered am i to die for the sake of a dog  either the terriers slumbers had come to an end naturally at a fortunate moment or the masters voice had awakened it for it opened its eyes raised its head and looked up in the sailors face  the hand with the knife drooped a little  the dog rose and licked it  hunger had done its work on the poor creature for it could hardly stand yet it managed to look in its masters face with that grave simple gaze of selfforgetting love which appears to be peculiar to the canine race the savage glare of the seamans eyes vanished  he dropped the knife  thanks cuffy thanks for stoppin me  it would have been murder no no my doggie you and i shall die together  his voice sank into a murmur partly from weakness and partly from the ideas suggested by his concluding words  die together he repeated surely it aint come to that yet  wot john jarwin youre not goin to give in like that are you to haul down your colours on a fine day with a clear sky like this overhead come cheer up lad youre young and can hold out a good while yet hey old dog wot say you  the dog made a motion that would in ordinary circumstances have resulted in the wagging of its tail but the tail was powerless to respond  at that moment a gull flew towards the raft jarwin watched it eagerly as it approached  ah he muttered clasping his bony hand as tightly over his heart as his strength would allow and addressing the gull if i only had hold of you id tear you limb from limb and drink your blood  he watched the bird intently as it flew straight over him  leaning back he continued slowly to follow its flight until his head rested on the block of wood which had served him for a pillow  the support felt agreeable he forgot the gull closed his eyes and sank with a deep sigh into a slumber that strongly resembled death  presently he awoke with a start and once more raising himself gazed round upon the sea  no ship was to be seen  how often he had gazed round the watery circle with the same anxious look only to meet with disappointment  the hills of the coral island were visible like a blue cloud on the horizon but jarwins eyes were too dim and worn out to observe them  come he exclaimed suddenly scrambling to his feet rouse up cuffy you an i aint agoin to die without a good fight for life come along my hearty well have another glass of grogadams grog it is but it has been good grog to you an me doggiean then we shall have another inspection o the locker mayhap theres the half of a crumb left  the comparatively cheery tone in which the sailor said this seemed to invigorate the dog for it rose and actually succeeded in wriggling its tail as it staggered after its masterindubitable sign of hope and love not yet subdued  jarwin went to a cask which still contained a small quantity of fresh water  three weeks before the point at which we take up his story a storm had left him and his dog the sole survivors on the raft of the crew of a barque which had sprung a leak and gone to the bottom  his provision at the time was a very small quantity of biscuit and a cask of fresh water  several days before this the last biscuit had been consumed but the water had not yet failed  hitherto john jarwin had husbanded his provisions but now feeling desperate he drank deeply of the few remaining drops of that liquid which at the time was almost as vital to him as his lifeblood  he gave a full draught also to the little dog  share and share alike doggie he said patting its head as it eagerly lapped up the water but theres no wittles cuffy an ye dont care for baccy or ye should be heartily welcome to a quid  so saying the sailor supplied his own cheek with a small piece of his favourite weed and stood up on the highest part of the raft to survey the surrounding prospect  he did so without much hope for hope deferred had at last made his heart sick  suddenly his wandering gaze became fixed and intense  he shaded his eyes with one hand and steadied himself against the mast with the other  there could be no doubt of it  land ho he shouted with a degree of strength that surprised himself and even drew from cuffy the ghost of a bark  on the strength of the discovery jarwin and his dumb friend immediately treated themselves to another glass of adams grog  but poor jarwin had his patience further tried  hours passed away and still the island seemed as far off as ever  night drew on and it gradually faded from his view  but he had unquestionably seen land so with this to comfort him the starving tar lay down beside his dog to spend another nightas he had already spent many days and nightsa castaway on the wide ocean  morning dawned and the sailor rose with difficulty  he had forgotten for a moment the discovery of land on the previous night but it was brought suddenly to his remembrance by the roar of breakers near at hand  turning in the direction whence the sound came he beheld an island quite close to him with heavy rollers breaking furiously on the encircling ring of the coralreef  the still water between the reef and the shore which was about a quarter of a mile wide reflected every tree and crag of the island as if in a mirror  it was a grand a glorious sight and caused jarwins heart to swell with emotions that he had never felt before but his attention was quickly turned to a danger which was imminent and which seemed to threaten the total destruction of his raft and the loss of his life  a very slight breezea mere zephyrwhich had carried him during the night towards the island was now bearing him straight though slowly down on the reef where if he had once got involved in the breakers the raft must certainly have been dashed to pieces and he knew full well that in his weak condition he was utterly incapable of contending with such a surf  being a man of promptitude his first act on making this discovery was to lower the sail  this was fortunately done in time had he kept it up a few minutes longer he must inevitably have passed the only opening in the reef that existed on that side of the island  this opening was not more than fifty yards wide  to the right and left of it the breakers on the reef extended in lines of seething foam  already the raft was rolling in the commotion caused by these breakers as it drifted towards the opening  jarwin was by no means devoid of courage  many a time in days gone by when his good ship was tossing on the stormy sea or scudding under bare poles had he stood on the deck with unshaken confidence and a calm heart but now he was face to face with the seamans most dreaded enemybreakers aheadnay worse breakers around him everywhere save at that one narrow passage which appeared so small and so involved in the general turmoil as to afford scarcely an element of hope  for the first time in his life jarwins heart sank within himat least so he said in after years while talking of the eventbut we suspect that john was underrating himself  at all events he showed no symptoms of fear as he sat there calmly awaiting his fate  as the raft approached the reef each successive roller lifted it up and dropped it behind more violently until at last the top of one of the glittering green walls broke just as it passed under the end of the raft nearest the shore  jarwin now knew that the next billow would seal his fate  there was a wide space between each of those mighty waves  he looked out to sea and beheld the swell rising and taking form and increasing in speed as it came on  calmly divesting himself of his coat and boots he sat down beside his dog and awaited the event  at that moment he observed with intense gratitude to the almighty that the raft was drifting so straight towards the middle of the channel in the reef that there seemed every probability of being carried through it but the hope thus raised was somewhat chilled by the feeling of weakness which pervaded his frame  now cuffy said he patting the terrier gently rouse up my doggie we must make a brave struggle for life  its neck or nothing this time if we touch that reef in passing cuff you an i shall be food for the sharks tonight an its my opinion that the shark as gits us wont have much occasion to boast of his supper  the sailor ceased speaking abruptly  as he looked back at the approaching roller he felt solemnised and somewhat alarmed for it appeared so perpendicular and so high from his low position that it seemed as if it would fall on and overwhelm the raft  there was indeed some danger of this  glancing along its length jarwin saw that here and there the edge was lipping over while in one place not far off the thunder of its fall had already begun  another moment and it appeared to hang over his head the raft was violently lifted at the stern caught up and whirled onward at railway speed like a cork in the midst of a boiling cauldron of foam  the roar was deafening  the tumultuous heaving almost overturned it several times  jarwin held on firmly to the mast with his right arm and grasped the terrier with his left hand for the poor creature had not strength to resist such furious motion  it all passed with bewildering speed  it seemed as if in one instant the raft was hurled through the narrows and launched into the calm harbour within  an eddy at the inner side of the opening swept it round and fixed the end of one of the largest spars of which it was composed on the beach  there were fifty yards or so of sandy coralreef between the beach outside that faced the sea and the beach inside which faced the land yet how great the difference  the one beach buffeted for ever day and night by the breakersin calm by the grand successive rollers that as it were symbolised the oceans latent powerin storm by the mad deluge of billows which displayed that power in all its terrible grandeur  the other beach a smooth sloping circlet of fair white sand laved only by the ripples of the lagoon or by its tiny wavelets when a gale chanced to sweep over it from the land  jarwin soon gained this latter beach with cuffy in his arms and sat down to rest for his strength had been so much reduced that the mere excitement of passing through the reef had almost exhausted him  cuffy however seemed to derive new life from the touch of earth again for it ran about in a staggering drunken sort of way wagged its tail at the rootwithout however being able to influence the pointand made numerous futile efforts to bark  in the midst of its weakly gambols the terrier chanced to discover a dead fish on the sands  instantly it darted forward and began to devour it with great voracity  halo  cuffy shouted jarwin who observed him ho hold on you rascal share and share alike you know  here fetch it here  cuffy had learned the first great principle of a good and useful life whether of man or beastnamely prompt obedience  that meek but jovial little dog on receiving this order restrained its appetite lifted the fish in its longing jaws and carrying it to his master humbly laid it at his feet  he was rewarded with a hearty pat on the head and a full half of the coveted fishfor jarwin appeared to regard the shareandsharealike principle as a point of honour between them  the fish was not good neither was it large and of course it was raw besides being somewhat decayed nevertheless both man and dog ate it bones and all with quiet satisfaction  nay reader do not shudder if you were reduced to similar straits you would certainly enjoy with equal gusto a similar meal supposing that you had the good fortune to get it  small though it was it sufficed to appease the appetite of the two friends and to give them a feeling of strength which they had not experienced for many a day  under the influence of this feeling jarwin remarked to cuffy that a man could eat amost anything when hard put to it and that it wos now high time to think about goin ashore  to which cuffy replied with a bark which one might imagine should come from a dog in the last stage of whoopingcough and with a wag of his tailnot merely at the root thereof but a distinct wagthat extended obviously along its entire length to the extreme point  jarwin observed the successful effort laughed feebly and said brayvo cuffy with evident delight for it reminded him of the days when that little shred of a doormat in the might of its vigour was wont to wag its tail so violently as to convulse its whole body insomuch that it was difficult to decide whether the tail wagged the body or the body the tail  but although jarwin made light of his sufferings his gaunt wasted frame would have been a sad sight to any pitiful spectator as with weary aspect and unsteady gait he moved about on the sandy ridge in search of more food or gazed with longing eyes on the richlywooded island  for it must be remembered that our castaway had not landed on the island itself but on that narrow ring of coralreef which almost encircled it and from which it was separated by the lagoon or enclosed portion of the sea which was as we have said about a quarter of a mile wide  john jarwin would have thought little of swimming over that narrow belt of smooth water in ordinary circumstances but now he felt that his strength was not equal to such a feat  moreover he knew that there were sharks in these waters so he dismissed the idea of swimming and cast about in his mind how he should manage to get across  with jarwin action soon followed thought  he resolved to form a small raft out of portions of the large one  fortunately his claspknife had been attached as seamen frequently have it to his waistbelt when he forsook his ship  this was the only implement that he possessed but it was invaluable  with it he managed to cut the thick ropes that he could not have untied and in the course of two hoursfor he laboured with extreme difficultya few broken planks and spars were lashed together embarking on this frail vessel with his dog he pushed off and using a piece of plank for an oar sculled himself over the lagoon  it was touching even to himself to observe the slowness of his progress  all the strength that remained in him was barely sufficient to move the raft  but the lagoon was as still as a millpond  looking down into its clear depths he could see the rich gardens of coral and seaweed among which fish of varied and brilliant colours sported many fathoms below  the air too was perfectly calm  very slowly he left the reef astern the middle of the lagoon was gained then gradually he neared the islandshore but oh it was a long weary pull although the space was so short and to add to the poor mans misery the fish which he had eaten caused him intolerable thirst  but he reached the shore at last  the first thing that greeted his eye as he landed was the sparkle of a clear spring at the foot of some cocoanuttrees  he staggered eagerly towards it and fell down beside a hollow in the rock like a large cup or bowl which had been scooped out by it  who shall presume to describe the feelings of that shipwrecked sailor as he and his dog drank from the same cup at that sparkling crystal fountain  delicious odours of lime and citron trees and wellnigh forgotten herbage filled his nostrils and the twitter of birds thrilled his ears seeming to bid him welcome to the land as he sank down on the soft grass and raised his eyes in thanksgiving to heaven an irresistible tendency to sleep then seized him  if theres a heaven upon earth im in it now he murmured as he laid down his head and closed his eyes  cuffy nestling into his breast placed his chin on his neck and heaved a deep contented sigh  this was the last sound the sailor recognised as he sank into profound repose    chapter two  island life  there are few of the minor sweets of life more agreeable than to awake refreshed and to become gradually impressed with the conviction that you are a perfectly free agentthat you may rise when you choose or lie still if you please or do what you like without let or hindrance  so thought our hero john jarwin when he awoke on the same spot where he had thrown himself down after several hours of lifegiving slumber he was still weak but his weakness did not now oppress him  the slight meal the long draught and the deep sleep had restored enough of vigour to his naturally robust frame to enable him while lying on his back to enjoy his existence once more  he was on first awaking in that happy condition of mind and body in which the former does not care to think and the latter does not wish to moveyet both are pleased to be largely conscious of their own identity  that he had not moved an inch since he lay down became somewhat apparent to jarwin from the fact that cuffys chin still rested immovable on his neck but his mind was too indolent to pursue the thought  he had not the most remote idea as to where he was but he cared nothing for that  he was in absolute ignorance of the time of day but he cared if possible still less for that  food he knew was necessary to his existence but the thought gave him no anxiety  in short john and his dog were in a state of quiescent felicity and would probably have remained so for some hours to come had not the setting sun shone forth at that moment with a farewell gleam so intense that it appeared to set the world of clouds overhead on fire converting them into hills and dales and towering domes and walls and battlements of molten glass and gold  even to the wearied seamans sleepy vision the splendour of the scene became so fascinating that he shook off his lethargy and raised himself on one elbow  why cuffy he exclaimed to the yawning dog seems to me that the heavens is afire  hope it wont come on dirty weather before you an i get up somethin in the shape o a hut  that minds me doggie he added glancing slowly round him that we must look after prokoorin of our supper  i do believe weve bin an slep away a whole day  well well it dont much matter seein that we haint got no dooty for to dono trick at the wheel no greasin the mastswust of all no splicin the main brace and no grub  this latter remark appeared to reach the understanding of the dog for it uttered a melancholy howl as it gazed into its masters eyes  ah cuffy continued the sailor with a sigh youve good reason to yowl for the half of a rotten fish aint enough for a dog o your appetite  come lets see if we cant find somethin more to our tastes  saying this the man rose stretched himself yawned looked helplessly round for a few seconds and then with a cheery hallo  cuff come along my hearty went down to the beach in quest of food  in this search he was not unsuccessful for the beach abounded with shellfish of various kinds but jarwin ate sparingly of these having been impressed in former years by some stories which he had heard of shipwrecked sailors having been poisoned by shellfish  for the same reason he administered a moderate supply to cuffy telling him that it warnt safe wittles an that if they was to be pisoned it was as well to be pisoned in moderation  the dog however did not appear to agree with its master on this point for it went picking up little titbits here and there and selfishly ignoring the shareandsharealike compact until it became stuffed alarmingly and could scarcely follow its master back to the fountain  arrived there the two slaked their thirst together and then jarwin sat down to enjoy a pipe and cuffy lay down to suffer the wellmerited reward of gluttony  we have said that jarwin sat down to enjoy a pipe but he did not enjoy it that night for he discovered that the muchloved little implement which he had cherished tenderly while on the raft was broken to atoms in his coatpocket  in his eagerness to drink on first landing he had thrown himself down on it and now smoking was an impossibility at least for that night  he reflected however that it would not be difficult to make a wooden pipe and that cigarettes might perhaps be made by means of leaves or bark while his tobacco lasted so he consoled himself in the meantime with hopeful anticipations and a quid  being still weak and weary he lay down again beside the fountain and almost immediately fell into a sleep which was not at all disturbed by the starts and groans and frequent yelps of cuffy whose sufferings could scarcely have been more severe if he had supped on turtlesoup and venison washed down with port and claret  thus did those castaways spend the first night on their island  it must not be supposed however that we are going to trace thus minutely every step and sensation in the career of our unfortunate friends  we have too much to tell that is important to devote our valuable space to everyday incidents  nevertheless as it is important that our readers should understand our hero thoroughly and the circumstances in which we find him it is necessary that we should draw attention to some incidentstrifling in themselves but important in their effectswhich occurred to john jarwin soon after his landing on the island  the first of these incidents was that john one day slipped his foot on a tanglecovered rock and fell into the sea  a small matter this you will say to a man who could swim and in a climate so warm that a dip with or without clothes was a positive luxury  most true and had the wetting been all jarwin would have had nothing to annoy him for at the time the accident occurred he had been a week on the island had managed to pull and crack many cocoanuts and had found various excellent wildfruits so that his strength as well as cuffys had been much restored  in fact when jarwins head emerged from the brine after his tumble he gave vent to a shout of laughter and continued to indulge in hilarious demonstrations all the time he was wringing the water out of his garments while the terrier barked wildly round him  but suddenly in the very midst of a laugh he became grave and pale so pale that a more obtuse creature than cuffy might have deemed him ill  while his mouth and eyes slowly opened wider and wider his hands slapped his pockets first his trousers then his vest then his coat after which they fell like pistolshots on his thighs and he exclaimed in a voice of horrorgone  ay there could be no doubt about it every particle of his tobacco was gone  it had never been much only three or four plugs but it was strong and he had calculated that what with careful husbanding and mixing it with other herbs it would last him for a considerable length of time  in a state bordering on frenzy the sailor rushed back to the rock from which he had fallen  the baccy was not there  he glanced right and leftno sign of it floating on the sea  in he went head foremost like a determined suicide down down to the bottom for he was an expert diver and rioted among the coral groves and horrified the fish until he wellnigh burst and rose to the surface with a groan and splutter that might have roused envy in a porpoise  then down he went again while cuffy stood on the shore regarding him with mute amazement  never did pearldiver grope for the treasures of the deep with more eager intensity than did john jarwin search for that lost tobacco  he remained under water until he became purple in the face and coming to the surface after each dive stayed only long enough to recharge his lungs with air  how deeply he regretted at that time the fact that mans life depended on so frequent and regular a supply of atmospheric air  how enviously he glanced at the fish which with open eyes and mouths appeared to regard him with inexpressible astonishmentas well they might  at last jarwins powers of endurance began to give way and he was compelled to return to the shore to the great relief of cuffy which miserable dog if it had possessed the smallest amount of reasoning power must have deemed its master hopelessly insane  but why so much ado about a piece of tobacco we hear some ladyreader or nonsmoker exclaim  just because our hero was and had been since his childhood an inveterate smoker  of course we cannot prove our opinion to be correct but we are inclined to believe that if all the smoke that had issued from jarwins lips from the period of his commencing down to that terrible day when he lost his last plug could have been collected in one vast cloud it would have been sufficient to have kept a factory chimney going for a month or six weeks  the poor man knew his weakness he had several times tried to get rid of the habit which had enslaved him and by failing had come to know the tyrannical power of his master  he had once been compelled by circumstances to forego his favourite indulgence for three entire days and retained so vivid a recollection of his sufferings that he made up his mind never more to strive for freedom but to enjoy his pipe as long as he livedto swim with the current in fact and take it easy  it was of no use that several men who objected to smoking from principle and had themselves gone through the struggle and come off victorious pointed out that if he went on at his present rate it would cut short his life  jarwin didnt believe that  he felt well and hearty and said that he was too tough by a long way to be floored by baccy besides if his life was to be short he saw no reason why it should not be a pleasant one it was vain for these disagreeable men of principle to urge that when his health began to give way he would not find life very pleasant and then baccy would fail to relieve him  stuff and nonsense  did not jarwin know that hundreds of thousands of old men enjoyed their pipes to the very last  he also knew that a great many men had filled early graves owing to the use of tobacco but he chose to shut his eyes to this factmoreover although a great truth it was a difficult truth to prove  it was of still less use that those tiresome men of principle demonstrated that the money spent in tobacco would if accumulated form a snug little fortune to retire upon in his old age  john only laughed at this  wot did he want with a fortin in his old age he would say he would rather work to the last for his three bshis bread and beer and baccyan die in harness  a man couldnt get on like a man without them three bs and he wosnt goin for to deprive hisself of none of em not he besides his opponents were bad argifiers he was wont to say with a chuckle for if as they said baccy would be the means of cuttin his life short why then he wouldnt never come to old age to use his fortin even if he should manage to save it off his baccy  this last argument always brought jarwin off with flying coloursno wonder for it was unanswerable and thus he came to love his beer and baccy so much that he became thoroughly enslaved to both  his brief residence on the southsea island had taught him by painful experience that he was capable of existing without at least two of his three bsbread and beer  he had suffered somewhat from the change of diet and now that his third b was thus suddenly unexpectedly and hopelessly wrenched from him he sat himself down on the beach beside cuffy and gazed out to sea in absolute despair  we must guard the reader at this point from supposing that john jarwin had ever been what is called an intemperate man  he was one of those honest straightforward tars who do their duty like men and who although extremely fond of their pipe and their glass of grog never lower themselves below the level of the brutes by getting drunk  at the same time we feel constrained to add that jarwin acted entirely from impulse and kindly feeling  he had little to do with principle and did not draw towards those who professed to be thus guided  he was wont to say that they was troublesome fellers always shovin in their oars when they werent wanted to an settin themselves up for better than everybody else  had one of those troublesome fellows presented john jarwin with a pound of tobacco in his forlorn circumstances at that time he would probably have slapped him on the shoulder and called him one of the best fellows under the sun  cuffy my friend exclaimed jarwin at last with an explosive sigh all the baccys gone so well have to smoke seaweed for the futur the terrier said bowwow to this cocked its ears and looked earnest as if waiting for more  come along exclaimed the man overturning his dog as he leaped up well go home and have summat to eat  jarwin had erected a rude hut composed of boughs and turf near the fountain where he had first landed  it was the home to which he referred  at first he had devoted himself entirely to the erection of this shelter and to collecting various roots and fruits and shellfish for food intending to delay the examination of the island until his strength should be sufficiently restored to enable him to scale the heights without more than ordinary fatigue  he had been so far recruited as to have fixed for his expedition the day following that on which he sustained his irreparable loss  entering his hut he proceeded to kindle a fire by means of a small burningglass with which in happier times he had been wont to light his pipe  very soon he had several roots resembling small potatoes baking in the hot ashes  with these a handful of plums a dozen of oysterlike fish of which there were plenty on the shore and a draught of clear cold water he made a hearty repast cuffy coming in for a large share of it as a matter of course  then he turned all his pockets inside out and examined them as carefully as if diamonds lurked in the seams  no not a speck of tobacco was to be found  he smelt them  the odour was undoubtedly strongvery strong  on the strength of it he shut his eyes and endeavoured to think that he was smoking but it was a weak substitute for the pipe and not at all satisfying thereafter he sallied forth and wandered about the seashore in a miserable condition and went to bed that nightas he remarked to his dogin the blues  reader it is not possible to give you an adequate conception of the sensations and sufferings of john jarwin on that first night of his bereaved condition  he dreamed continuously of tobacco  now he was pacing the deck of his old ship with a splendid pipe of cut cavendish between his lips  anon he was smoking a meerschaum the size of a hogshead with a stem equal to the length and thickness of the maintopmast of a seventyfour but somehow the meerschaum wouldnt draw whereupon john in a passion pronounced it worthy of its name and hove it overboard when it was instantly transformed into a shark with a cutty pipe in its mouth  to console himself our hero endeavoured to thrust into his mouth a quid of negrohead which however suddenly grew as big as the cabinskylight and became as tough as guttapercha so that it was utterly impossible to bite off a piece and stranger still when the poor sailor had by struggling got it in it dwindled down into a point so small that he could not feel it in his mouth at all  on reaching this the vanishingpoint jarwin awoke to a consciousness of the dread reality of his destitute condition  turning on his other side with a deep groan he fell asleep again to dream of tobacco in some new and tantalising form until sunrise when he awoke unrefreshed  leaping up he cast off his clothes rushed down the beach and plunged into sea by way of relieving his feelings  during the day john jarwin brooded much over his dreams for his mind was of a reflective turn and cuffy looked often inquiringly into his face  that sympathetic doggie would evidently have besought him to pour his sorrows into his cocked ears if he could have spoken butalas for people who are cast away on desert islandsthe gift of speech has been denied to dogs  besides being moody jarwin was uncommonly taciturn that day  he did not tell cuffy the result of his cogitations so that we cannot say anything further about them  all that we are certainly sure of is that he was profoundly miserable that daythat he postponed his intended expedition to the top of the neighbouring hillthat he walked about the beach slowly with his chin on his breast and his hands in his pockets that he made various unsuccessful attempts to smoke dried leaves and bark and wildflowers mixing with those substances shreds of his trousers pockets in order that they might have at least the flavour of tobaccothat he became more and more restive as the day wore on became more submissive in the evening paid a few apologetic attentions to cuffy at suppertime and finally went to bed in a better frame of mind though still craving painfully for the weed which had enslaved him  that night his dreams were still of tobacco  no lover was ever assailed more violently with dreams of his absent mistress than was john jarwin with longings for his adorable pipe  but there was no hope for himthe beloved one was effectually and permanently gone so like a sensible man he awoke next morning with a stern resolve to submit to his fate with a good grace  in pursuance of this resolution he began the day with a cold bath in which cuffy joined him  then he breakfasted on chestnuts plums citrons oysters and shrimps the former of which abounded in the woods the latter on the shore  jarwin caught the shrimps in a net extemporised out of his pockethandkerchief  while engaged with his morning meal he was earnestly watched by several green paroquets with blue heads and crimson breasts and during pauses in the meal he observed flocks of brightlycoloured doves and woodpigeons besides many other kinds of birds the names of which he did not know as well as waterhens plover and wild ducks  lost your appetite this morning cuff said jarwin offering his companion a citron which he decidedly refused  ah he continued patting the dogs sides i see how it is youve had breakfast already this morning bin at it when i was asleepin  for shame cuffyyou should have waited for me an youve bin an overate yourself again you greedy dog  this was evidently the case  the guilty creature forgetful of its past experiences had again gorged itself with dead fish which it had found on the beach and looked miserable  well never mind doggie said jarwin finishing his meal and rising ill give you a little exercise today for the good of your health we shant go sulking as we did yesterday so come along  the sailor left his bower as he spoke and set off at a round pace with his hands in his pockets and a thick stick under his arm whistling as he went while cuffy followed lovingly at his heels    chapter three  communings of man and beast  it would appear to be almost an essential element in life that man should indulge in speech  of course we cannot prove this seeing that we have never been cast alone on a desert island although we have been next thing to it and cannot positively conclude what would have been the consequences to our castaway if he had rigidly refrained from speech  all that we can ground an opinion on is the fact that john jarwin talked as much and as earnestly to his dog as if he knew that that sagacious creature understood every word he uttered  indeed he got into such a habit of doing this that it is very probable he might have come to believe that cuffy really did understand though he was not gifted with the power to reply  if it be true that jarwin came to this state of credulity certain it is that cuffy was deeply to blame in the matter because the way in which that ridiculous hypocrite sat before his master and looked up in his face with his lustrous intelligent eyes and cocked his ears and wagged his tail and smiled might have deceived a much less superstitious man than a british tar  we have said that cuffy smiled advisedly  some people might object to the word and say that he only snickered or made faces  that we hold is a controvertible question  cuffys facial contortions looked like smiling  they came very often inappropriately and during parts of jarwins discourse when no smile should have been called forth but if that be sufficient to prove that cuffy was not smiling then on the same ground we hold that a large proportion of those ebullitions which convulse the human countenance are not smiles but unmeaning grins  be this as it may cuffy smiled snickered or grinned amazingly during the long discourses that were delivered to him by his master and indeed looked so wonderfully human in his knowingness that it only required a speaking tongue and a shaved face to constitute him an unanswerable proof of the truth of the darwinian theory of the origin of the human species  cuffy said jarwin panting as he reached the summit of his island and sat down on its pinnacle rock thats a splendid view aint it  to any one save a cynic or a misanthrope cuffy replied with eye and tail it is magnificent  but youre not looking at it objected jarwin youre looking straight up in my face so how can you tell what its like doggie  i see it all replied cuffy with a grin all reflected in the depths of your two loving eyes  of course jarwin lost this pretty speech in consequence of its being a mute reply but he appeared to have some intuitive perception of it for he stooped down and patted the dogs head affectionately  after this there was a prolonged silence during which the sailor gazed wistfully round the horizon  the scene was indeed one of surpassing beauty and grandeur  the island on which he had been cast was one of those small coral gems which deck the breast of the pacific  it could not have been more than nine or ten miles in circumference yet within this area there lay a miniature world  the mountaintop on which the seaman sat was probably eight or nine hundred feet above the level of the sea and commanded a view of the whole island  on one side lay three lesser hills covered to their summits with indescribably rich verdure amongst which rose conspicuous the tall stems and graceful foliage of many cocoanutpalms  fruittrees of various kinds glistened in the sunshine and flowering shrubs in abundance lent additional splendour to the scene  on the other side of the mountain a small lake glittered like a jewel among the trees and there numerous flocks of wildfowl disported themselves in peaceful security  from the farther extremity of the lake flowed a rivulet which from the mountaintop resembled a silver thread winding its way through miniature valleys until lost in the light yellow sand of the seashore  on this beach there was not even a ripple because of the deep calm which prevailed but on the ring or coralreef which completely encircled the island those great rollerswhich appear never to go down even in calmfell from time to time with a long solemn roar and left an outer ring of milkwhite foam  the blue lagoon between the reef and the island varied from a few yards to a quarter of a mile in breadth and its quiet waters were like a sheet of glass save where they were ruffled now and then by the diving of a seagull or the fin of a shark  birds of many kinds filled the grove with sweet sounds and tended largely to dispel that feeling of intense loneliness which had been creeping that day over our seamans spirit  come my doggie said jarwin patting his dumb companions head if you and i are to dwell here for long weve got a most splendid estate to look after  i only hope we wont find south sea niggers in possession before us for theyre not hospitable cuffy they aint hospitable bein given so im told to prefer human flesh to most other kinds o wittles  he looked anxiously round in all directions at this point as if the ideas suggested by his words were not particularly agreeable  no he resumed after a short survey it dont seem as if there was any of em here  anyhow i cant see none and most parts of the island are visible from this here masthead  again the seaman became silent as he repeated his survey of the island his hands meanwhile searching slowly as if by instinct round his pockets and into their most minute recesses if haply they might find an atom of tobacco  both hands and eyes however failed in their search so turning once more towards his dog jarwin sat down and addressed it thus  cuff my doggie dont wink in that idiotical way you hanimated bundle of oakum and dont wag yer tail so hard else youll shake it off some fine day  well cuff here you an i are fixedit may be for years an it may be for everas the old song says so it behoves you and me to hold a consultation as to wots the best to be done for to make the most of our sukumstances  ah doggie he continued in a low tone looking pensively towards the horizon its little that my dear wife your missus and mine cuff knows that her john has fallen heir to sitch an estate become so to speak monarch of all he surveys  o molly molly if you was only here wot a paradise it would be  eden over again adam an eve without amost no difference barrin the close by the way for if i aint mistaken adam didnt wear a straw hat and a blue jacket with pumps and canvas ducks  leastwise ive never heard that he did an im quite sure that eve didnt go to church on sundays in a gown wi sleeves like two legs o mutton an a bonnet like a coalscuttle  by the way i dont think they owned a doggie neither    at this point the terrier who had gradually quieted down during the above soliloquy gave a responsive wag of its tail and looked up with a smilea plain obvious unquestionable smile which its master believed in most thoroughly  ah you neednt grin like that cuff replied jarwin its quite certain that adam and eve had no doggie  no doubt they had plenty of wild unsthem as they givd names tobut they hadnt a good little tame un like you cuff no nor nobody else for youre the best dog in the worldif youd only keep yer spankerboom quiet but youll shake it off you will if you go on like that  there lie down an lets get on with our consultation  well as i was sayin when you interrupted me wot a happy life we could live here if wed only got the old girl with us  id be king you know cuff and shed be queen and wed make you prime ministeryoure prime favourite already you know there now if you dont clap a stopper on that ere spankerboom ill have to lash it down  well to proceed wed build a hutor a palace of turf an sticks with a bunk alongside for you an wen our close began for to wear out wed make pants and jackets and petticoats of cocoanutfibre for you must know ive often seed mats made o that stuff an splendid wear theres in it too though it would be rather rough for the skin at first but wed get used to that in coorse o time  only fancy mrs jarwin in a cocoanutfibre petticoat with a palmleaf hat or somethink o that sort  an after all it wouldnt be half so rediklous as some o the canvas shes used to spread on sundays  jarwin evidently thought his ideas somewhat ridiculous for he paused at this point and chuckled while cuffy sprang up and barked responsively  while they were thus engaged a gleam of white appeared on the horizon  sail ho shouted the sailor in the loud full tones with which he was wont to announce such an appearance from the masthead in days gone by  oh how earnestly he strained his eyes in the direction of that little speck  it might have been a sail just as likely it was the wing of a seagull or an albatross  whatever it was it grew gradually less until it sank out of view on the distant horizon  with it sank poor jarwins newlyraised hopes  still he continued to gaze intently in the hope that it might reappear but it did not  with a heavy sigh the sailor rose at length wakened cuffy who had gone to sleep and descended the mountain  this lookout on the summit of the island now became the regular place of resort for jarwin and his dumb but invaluable companion  and so absorbed did the castaway become in his contemplation of the horizon and in his expectation of the heaving in sight of another sail that he soon came to spend most of his time there  he barely gave himself time to cook and eat his breakfast before setting out for the spot and frequently he remained there the livelong day having carried up enough of provision to satisfy his hunger  at first while there he employed himself in the erection of a rude flagstaff and thus kept himself busy and reasonably cheerful  he cut the pole with some difficulty his claspknife being but a poor substitute for an axe then he bored a hole at the top to reave the halliards through  these latter he easily made by plaiting together threads of cocoanutfibre which were both tough and long  when ready he set up and fixed the staff and hoisted thereon several huge leaves of the palmtree which in their natural size and shape formed excellent flags  when however all this was done he was reduced to a state of idleness and his mind began to dwell morbidly on the idea of being left to spend the rest of his days on the island  his converse with cuffy became so sad that the spirits of that sagacious and sympathetic dog were visibly affected  he did indeed continue to lick his masters hand lovingly and to creep close to his side on all occasions but he ceased to wag his expressive tail with the violence that used to characterise that appendage in other days and became less demonstrative in his conduct all this coupled with constant exposure in all sorts of weather although jarwin was not easily affected by a breeze or a wet jacket began at last to undermine the health of the stout seaman  he became somewhat gaunt and hollowcheeked and his beard and moustache which of course he could not shave and which for a long time presented the appearance of stubble added to the lugubriosity of his aspect  as a climax to his distress he one day lost his dog  when it went off or where it went to he could not tell but on rousing up one morning and putting out his hand almost mechanically to give it the accustomed pat of salutation he found that it was gone  a thrill of alarm passed through his frame on making this discovery and leaping up he began to shout its name  but no answering bark was heard  again and again he shouted but in vain  without taking time to put on his coat he ran to the top of the nearest eminence and again shouted loud and long  still no answer  a feeling of desperate anxiety now took possession of the man  the bare idea of being left in utter loneliness drove him almost distracted  for some time he ran hither and thither calling passionately to his dog until he became quite exhausted then he sat down on a rock and endeavoured to calm his spirit and consider what he should do indulging in his tendency to think aloud he said  come now john dont go for to make a downright fool of yerself cuffy has only taken a longer walk than usual  hell be home to breakfast but you may as well look a bit longer theres no sayin wot may have happened  he may have felled over a precepiece or spraind his leg  dont you give way to despair anyhow john jarwin but nail yer colours to the mast and never say die  somewhat calmed by these encouraging exhortations the sailor rose up and resumed his search in a more methodical way  going down to the sea he walked thence up to the edge of the bush gazing with the utmost intensity at the ground all the way in the hope of discovering cuffys fresh footsteps but none were to be seen  come said he its clear that you havent gone to the suthard o yer home now well have a look to the norard  here he was more successful  the prints of cuffys small paws were discovered on the wet sand bearing northward along shore  jarwin followed them up eagerly but coming to a place where the sand was hard and dry and covered with thin grass he lost them  turning back to where they were distinct he recommenced the search  no red indian in pursuit of friend or foe ever followed up a trail with more intense eagerness than poor jarwin followed the track of his lost companion  he even began to develop in quite a surprising way some of the deep sagacity of the savage for he came before that day was over not only to distinguish the prints of cuffys paws on pretty hard sand where the impressions were very faint but even on rough ground where there were no distinct marks at allonly such indications as were afforded by the pressure of a dead leaf into soft ground or the breaking of a fallen twig  nevertheless despite his care anxiety and diligence jarwin failed to find his dog  he roamed all that day until his limbs were weary and shouted till his voice was hoarse but only echoes answered him  at last he sat down overcome with fatigue and grief  it had rained heavily during the latter part of the day and soaked him to the skin but he heeded it not  towards evening the weather cleared up little but the sun descended to the horizon in a mass of black clouds which were gilded with a strange lurid light that presaged a storm while seabirds flew overhead and shrieked in wild excitement as if they were alarmed at the prospect before them  but jarwin observed and cared for none of these things  he buried his face in his hands and sat for some time perfectly motionless  while seated thus a cold shiver passed through his frame once or twice and he felt unusually faint  humph said he the second time this occurred strange sort o feelin  never felt it before  no doubt its in consikince o goin without wittles all day  well well he added with a deep longdrawn sigh whod have thought id lose ee cuff in this fashion  its foolish no doubt to take on like this but i cant help it somehow  i dont believe i could feel much worse if i had lost my old ooman  its kurious but i feels awful lonesome without ee my doggie  he was interrupted by the shivering again and was about to rise when a long low wail struck on his ear  he listened intently  no statue ever sat more motionless on its pedestal than did jarwin during the next three minutes  again the wail rose faint and low at first then swelling out into a prolonged loud cry which strange to say seemed to be both distant and near  john jarwin was not altogether free from superstition  his heart beat hard under the influence of a mingled feeling of hope and fear but when he heard the cry the third time he dismissed his fears and leaping up hurried forward in the direction whence the sound appeared to come the bushes were thick and difficult to penetrate but he persevered on hearing a repetition of the wail and was thus led into a part of the island which he had not formerly visited  presently he came to something that appeared not unlike an old track but although the sun had not quite set the place was so shut in by tangled bushes and trees that he could see nothing distinctly  suddenly he put his right foot on a mass of twigs which gave way under his weight and he made a frantic effort to recover himself  next moment he fell headlong into a deep hole or pit at the bottom of which he lay stunned for some time  recovering he found that no bones were broken and after considerable difficulty succeeded in scrambling out of the hole  just as he did so the wail was again raised but it sounded so strange and so unlike any sound that cuffy could produce that he was tempted to give up the searchall the more that his recent fall had so shaken his exhausted frame that he could scarcely walk  while he stood irresolute the wail was repeated and this time there was a melancholy sort of bowwow mingled with it that sent the blood careering through his veins like wildfire  fatigue and hunger were forgotten  shouting the name of his dog he bounded forward and would infallibly have plunged headforemost into another pit at the bottom of which cuffy lay had not that wise creature uttered a sudden bark of joy which checked his master on the very brink  hallo  cuff is that you my doggie  bow wow wow exclaimed cuffy in tones which there could be no mistaking although the broken twigs and herbage which covered the mouth of the pit muffled them a good deal and accounted for the strangeness of the creatures howls when heard at a distance  why where ever have ee got yourself into said jarwin going down on his knees and groping carefully about the opening of the pit  i do believe youve bin an got into a trap o some sort  the savages must have been here before us doggie and made more than one of em for ive just comed out o one myself  hallo there im into another he exclaimed as the treacherous bank gave way and he slipped in headlong with a dire crash almost smothering cuffy in his fall  fortunately no damage beyond a few scratches resulted either to dog or man and in a few minutes more both stood upon firm ground  it would be vain reader to attempt to give you in detail all that john jarwin said and did on that great occasion as he sat there on the ground caressing his dog as if it had been his own child  we leave it to your imagination  when he had expended the first burst of feeling he got up and was about to retrace his steps when he observed some bones lying near him on examination these proved to be the skeleton of a man  at first jarwin thought it must be that of a native but he was startled to find among the dust on which the skeleton lay several brass buttons with anchors on them  that he stood beside the remains of a brother seaman who had probably been cast on that island as he himself had been seemed very evident and the thought filled him with strange depressing emotions  as it was by that time too dark to make further investigations he left the place intending to return next day and going as cautiously as possible out of the wood returned to his abode where he kindled a fire gave cuffy some food and prepared some for himself but before he had tasted that food another of the shivering fits seized him  a strange feeling of being very ill and a peculiar wandering of his mind induced him to throw himself on his couch  the prolonged strain to which body and mind had been subjected had proved too much for him and before morning he was stricken with a raging fever    chapter four  hopes and fears and stern resolves lead to vigorous action  for several days the sailor lay tossing in helpless misery in his bower without food or fire  indeed he could not have eaten even if food had been offered him and as to fire there was heat enough in his veins poor fellow to more than counterbalance the want of that  during part of the time he became delirious and raved about home and sealife and old companions in a way that evidently quite alarmed cuffy for that sagacious terrier approached his master with caution with his tail between his legs and a pitiful earnest gaze that was quite touching  this was partly owing to the fact that jarwin had several times patted him with such painful violence as to astonish and render him doubtful of the affection displayed by such caresses  jarwin also recurred at these times to his tobacco and beer and apparently suffered a good deal from dreams about those luxuries  in his ravings he often told cuffy to fill a pipe for him and advised him to look sharp about it and he frequently reproached some of his old comrades for not passing the beer  fortunately the fountain was close at hand and he often slaked his burning thirst at it  he also thought frequently of the skeleton in the thicket and sometimes raved with an expression of horror about being left to die alone on a desert island  by degrees the fever reached its climax and then left him almost dead for a whole day and night he lay so absolutely helpless that it cost him an effort to open his eyes and he looked so ill that the poor dog began to whine piteously over him but the day after that a sensation of hunger induced him to make an effort to rouse up  he tried to raise his headit felt as if made of lead  hallo  cuffy somethin wrong i suspect  it was the first time for many days that jarwin had spoken in his natural tones  the effect on the dog was instantaneous and powerful it sprang up and wagged its expressive tail with something of the energy of former times licked the sick mans face and hands whined and barked intelligently ran away in little bursts as if it had resolved to undertake a journey offhand but came back in a few seconds and in many other ways indicated its intense delight at finding that jarwin was himself again  but alas  jarwin was not quite himself yet and cuffy after his first ebullition sat looking in surprise at the invalid as he strove to turn on his side and reach out his heavy hand and skinny arm towards a few scraps of the last meal he had cooked before being struck down  cuffy after eating the portion of that meal that suited his taste had left the remnants there as being unworthy of notice and catered for himself among the dead fish cast up on the beach  although lying within a yard of his couch jarwin had the greatest difficulty in reaching the food and when he did at length succeed in grasping it he fell back on his couch and lay for a long time as if dead  soon however he recovered and with a feeling of gratitude such as he had never before experienced began to gnaw the hard morsels  im in a bad way cuff he said after satisfying the first cravings of hunger  cuffy gave a responsive wag with his tail and cocked his ears for more  howsever seems to me that ive got the turn lets be thankful for that my doggie  wonder how long ive bin ill  months mayhap  dont think i could have come to be sitch a skeleton in a short time  ha that minds me o the skeleton in the wood  have ee seed it cuff since i found ee there  well i must eat and drink too if i would keep the skin on my skeleton  wish you had hands doggie for im greatly in need o help just now  but youre a comfort anyhow even though you haint got no hands  i should have died without you my doggieyou cheer me up dee see and when its nigh low water with a man it dont take much to make him slip his cable  the want of a kind look at this here time cuffy would have sent me adrift i do believe  it must not be supposed that all this was spoken fluently  it came slowly by fits and starts with a long pause at the end of each sentence and with many a sigh between expressive of extreme weakness  i wish i had a drink cuffy said the invalid after a long pause turning a longing look towards the spring which welled up pleasantly close to the opening of the hut  ay thats all very well in its way but bowwowin an waggin yer tail wont fetch me a can o water howsever its o no manner o use wishin  never say die  here goes  so saying he began slowly and painfully but with unyielding perseverance to push and draw and hitch himself while lying at full length towards the spring which he reached at last so exhausted that he had barely put his lips to it and swallowed a mouthful when his head dropped and he almost fainted  he was within an ace of being drowned but with a violent effort he drew his face out of the spring and lay there in a half unconscious condition for some time with the clear cool water playing about his temples  reviving in a little time he took another sip and then crawled back to his couch  immediately he fell into a profound slumber from which cuffy strove in vain to awaken him therefore like a sagacious dog he lay down at his masters side and joined him in repose  from that hour jarwin began to mend rapidly  in a few days he was able to walk about with the aid of a stick  in a few weeks he felt somewhat like his former self and soon after that he was able to ascend to the top of the island and resume his watch for a passing sail  but the first few hours of his watch beside the old flagstaff convinced him that his hopes would in all probability be doomed to disappointment and that he would soon fall back into a state of apathy from which he might perhaps be unable to rouse himself in which case his fate would certainly be that of the poor sailor whose remains he had that day buried in the pit near to which they had been discovered  he resolved therefore to give up watching altogether and to devote all his energies in future to devising some plan of escape from the island but when he bent his mind to this task he felt a deep sinking of the heart for he had no implements wherewith to construct a boat or canoe  suddenly it occurred to him for the first time in his life that he ought in this extremity to pray to god for help  he was as we have said a straightforward man prompt to act as well as ready to conceive he fell on his knees at once humbly confessed his sin in depending so entirely on himself in time past and earnestly asked help and guidance for the future  his prayer was not longneither was the publicans but it was effectual  he arose with feelings of strong resolution and confidence which appeared to himself quite unaccountable for he had not as yet conceived any new idea or method as to escaping from the island  instead of setting his mind to work as he had intended he could not help dwelling on the fact that he had never before deliberately asked help from his maker and this raised a train of selfcondemnatory thoughts which occupied him the remainder of that day at night he prayed again before laying down to rest  next morning he rose like a giant refreshed and after a plunge in the sea and a hearty breakfast set out with cuffy for a meditative walk  great were the thoughts that swelled the seamans broad chest during that walk and numerous as well as wild and quaint were the plans of escape which he conceived and found it necessary to abandon  its harder work to think it out than i had expected cuffy he said sitting down on a cliff that overlooked the sea and thinking aloud if you and i could only swim twenty miles or so at a stretch id risk it but as nothin short o that would be likely to be of sarvice we must give it up  then if i could only cut down trees with my shoe and saw planks with my jacket we might make a boat but i cant do that and we havent no nailsexcept our toenails which aint the right shape or strong enough so we must give that up too  its true that we might burn a canoe out of a solid tree but whos to cut down the solid tree for us doggie  im sure if the waggin of a tail could do it you wouldnt be long about it  why on earth cant ee keep it still for a bit  well then as we cant swim or fly and havent a boat or canoe or the means o makin em whats the next thing to be done  apparently neither man nor dog could return an answer to that question for they both sat for a very long time in profound silence staring at the sea  after some time jarwin suddenly exclaimed ill do it  cuffy startled by the energy with which it was said jumped up and said thats rightor something very like itwith his eyes  yes cuffy ill make a raft and you and i shall get on it some day with a fair wind and make for the island that we think weve seen so often on the horizon  he alluded here to a faint blue line which on unusually fine and clear days he had distinguished on the horizon to the southward and which from its always appearing on the same spot he believed to be land of some sort although it looked nothing more than a lowlying cloud  so thats settled continued jarwin getting up and walking smartly back to his hut with the air of a man who has a purpose in view  we shall make use of the old raft as far as itll go  luckily the sail is left as you and i know cuff for it has been our blanket for many a day and when alls ready we shall go huntin you and i till weve got together a stock of provisions and thenup anchor and away  we can only be drownded once you know and its better that than stopping here to die o the blues  what think ee o that my doggie  whatever the doggie thought of the idea there can be no question what he thought of the cheery vigorous tones of his masters voice for he gambolled wildly round barked with vociferous delight and wagged his spanker boom to such an extent that jarwin warned him to have a care lest it should be carried away an go slap overboard  in pursuance of the designs thus expressed the sailor began the construction of a raft without delay and worked at it diligently the remainder of that day  he found on examination that a considerable portion of the old raft yet remained stranded on the beach though all the smaller spars of which it had been composed had been used for firewood  with great difficulty he rolled these logs one by one into the sea and getting astride of each pushed them by means of a pole towards a point of rocks or natural jetty alongside of which the water was deep  here he fastened them together by means of a piece of rope one of the old fastenings which remained to him the others having been used in the construction of the hut  the raft thus formed was however much too small to weather a gale or float in a rough sea  in whatever way he placed the spars the structure was too narrow for safety seeing therefore that it was absolutely necessary to obtain more logs he set brain and hands to work without delay  many years before he had seen an ancient stone hatchet in a museum the head of which was fastened to the haft by means of a powerful thong of untanned hide  he resolved to make a hatchet of this sort  long did he search the beach for a suitable stone but in vain  at last he found one pretty nearly the proper shape which he chipped and ground into the rude form of an axe  it had no eye for the handle  to have made a hole in it would have weakened the stone too much  he therefore cut a groove in the side of the handle placed the head of the stone into it and completed the fastening by tying it firmly with the tough fibrous roots of a tree  it was strongly and neatly made though clumsy in appearance but do what he would he could not put a sufficiently fine edge on it and although it chipped pretty well when applied to the outside of a tree it made very slow progress indeed as the cut deepened and the work became so toilsome at last that he almost gave it up in despair  suddenly it occurred to him that fire might be made use of to facilitate the work  selecting a tall cocoanuttree he piled dry wood all round the foot of it  before setting it on fire he dipped a quantity of cocoanut fibre in the sea and tied a thick belt of this round the tree just above the pile so as to protect the upper parts of the spar from the flames as much and as long as possible  this done he kindled the pile  a steady breeze fanned the flame into an intense fire which ere long dried up the belt of fibre and finally consumed it the fire was pretty well burnt out by that time however so that the upper part of the stem had been effectually preserved  removing the ashes he was rejoiced to find that the foot of the tree had been so deeply burned that several inches of it were reduced to charcoal which his stone hatchet readily cut away and the operation was so successful that it only required a second fire to enable him to fell the tree  this done he measured it off in lengths  under each point of measurement he piled up dry woodwhich consisted merely of broken brancheswith belts of wet fibre on each side of these piles  then applying a light to the fires he reduced the parts to charcoal as before and completed the work with the hatchet  thus in the course of a single day he felled a tall tree and cut it up into six lengths which he rolled down to the sea and floated off to the end of the jetty  next day jarwin rose with the sun and began to make twine of twisted cocoanut fibreof which there was great abundance to be had everywhere when a sufficient quantity had been made he plaited the twine into cords and the cords into stout ropes which although not so neat as regular ropes were nevertheless sufficiently pliable and very strong several days were spent over this somewhat tedious process and we may mention here that in all these operations the busy seaman was greatly assisted by his dog who stuck close to him all the time encouraging him with looks and wags of approbation  after the ropes were made the raft was put together and firmly lashed there was a mast and yard in the centre of it and also a hollow formed by the omission of a log which was just large enough to permit of the man and his dog lying down  this hollow slight though it was afterwards proved of the utmost service  it is needless to recount all the details of the building and provisioning of this raft  suffice it to say that about three weeks after the idea of it had been conceived it was completed and ready for sea  during his residence on the island although it had only extended over a few months jarwin had become very expert in the use of a sharppointed pole or javelin with which he had become quite an adept in spearing fish  he had also become such a deadshot with a stone that when he managed to get within thirty yards of a bird he was almost certain to hit it  thus he was enabled to procure fish and fowl as much as he required and as the woods abounded with cocoanuts plums and other wild fruits besides many edible roots he had no lack of good fare now that he was about to go to sea he bethought him of drying some of the fruits as well as curing some fish and birds  this he did by degrees while engaged on the raft so that when all was ready he had a store of provisions sufficient to last him several weeks  in order to stow all this he removed another log from the middle of the raft and having deposited the food in the hollowcarefully wrapped in cocoanut leaves and made into compact bundleshe covered it over by laying a layer of large leaves above it and lashing a small spar on the top of them to keep them down  the cask with which he had landed from the original raft and which he had preserved with great care not knowing how soon he might be in circumstances to require it served to hold fresh water  on a fine morning about sunrise jarwin embarked with his little dog and bade farewell to the coral island and although he had not dwelt very long there he felt to his own surprise much regret at quitting it  a fresh breeze was blowing in the direction of the islandor the supposed islandhe wished to reach  this was important because in such a craft it was impossible to sail in any way except before the wind  still by means of a rude oar or paddle he could modify its direction so as to steer clear of the passage through the reef and get out to sea  once outside he squared the sail and ran right before the breeze  of course such a weighty craft went very slowly through the water but the wind was pretty strong and to jarwin who had been for a comparatively long time unaccustomed to moving on the water the speed seemed fast enough  as the island went astern and the raft lifted and fell gently on the long swell of the ocean the seamans heart beat with a peculiar joy to which it had long been a stranger and he thanked god fervently for having so soon answered his prayer  for a long time he sat reclining in the hollow of the raft resting his hand lightly on the steering oar and gazing in silence at the gradually fading woods of his late home  the dog as if it were aware that a great change was being effected in their destiny lay also perfectly stilland apparently contemplativeat his masters feet resting his chin on a log and gazing at the receding land  it was evident however that his thoughts were not absent or wandering for on the slightest motion made by his master his dark eyes turned towards him his ears slightly rose and his tail gave the faintest possible indication of an intention to wag  well cuffy said jarwin at last rousing himself with a sigh wot are ee thinking of  the dog instantly rose made affectionate demonstrations and whined  ah you may well say that cuff replied the man i know you aint easy in yer mind and theres some reason in that too for were off on a raither uncertain viage in a somewhat unseaworthy craft  howsever cheer up doggie  whoever turns up you and i shall sink or swim together  just then the sail flapped  hallo  cuff exclaimed jarwin with a look of anxiety the winds going to shift  this was true  the wind did shift and in a few minutes had veered so much round that the raft was carried away from the blue line on the horizon which jarwin had so fondly hoped would turn out to be an inhabited island  it blew lightly however and when the sun went down had completely died away  in these circumstances jarwin and his dog supped together and then lay down to rest full of sanguine hope  they were awakened during the night by a violent squall which however did no further damage than wash a little spray over them for jarwin had taken the precaution to lower and make fast the sail  he now turned his attention to preparing the raft for rough weather  this consisted in simply drawing over the hollowin which he his dog and his provisions laya piece of canvas that he had cut off the sail which was unnecessarily large  it served as a tarpaulin and effectually shielded them from ordinary sprays but when the breeze freshened to a gale and green seas swept over the raft it leaked so badly that jarwins cabin became a saltwater bath and his provisions by degrees were soaked  at first he did not mind this much for the air and water were sufficiently warm but after being wet for several hours he began feel chilled  as for poor cuffy his trembling body bore testimony to the state of his feelings nevertheless he did not complain being a dog of high spirit and endurance  in these circumstances the seaman hailed the rising sun with great joy even although it rose in the midst of lurid murky clouds and very soon hid its face altogether behind them as if it had made up its mind that the state of things below was so bad as to be not worth shining upon  all that day and night the gale continued and they were driven before it  the waves rushed so continuously and furiously over the raft that it was with the utmost difficulty jarwin could retain his position on it  indeed it would have been impossible for him to have done so if he had not taken the precaution of making the hollow in the centre into which he could crouch and thus avoid the full force of the seas  next day the wind abated a little but the sea still rolled mountains high in order to break their force a little he ventured to show a little corner of the sail  small though it was it almost carried away the slender mast and drove the raft along at a wonderfully rapid rate  at last the gale went down and finally it became a dead calm leaving the raft like a cork heaving on the mighty swell of the pacific ocean weary and wornalmost dead with watching and exposurejohn jarwin lay down and slept but his slumber was uneasy and unrefreshing  sunrise awoke him and he sat up with a feeling of deep thankfulness as he basked once more in its warm rays and observed that the sky above him was bright blue  but other feelings mingled with these when he gazed round on the wide waste of water which still heaved its swelling though now unruffled breast as if panting after its recent burst of fury  ho  cuffywhats that  not a sail eh exclaimed jarwin suddenly starting up while his languid eyes kindled with excitement  he was right  after a long earnest anxious gaze he came to the conclusion that it was a sail which shone white and conspicuous like a speck or a snowflake on the horizon    chapter five  jarwin and cuffy fall into bad company  immediately on discovering the sail jarwin hoisted a small canvas flag which he had prepared for the purpose to the masthead and then sat down to watch with indescribable earnestness the motions of the vessel there was great cause for anxiety he well knew because his raft was a mere speck on the great waste of waters which might easily be overlooked even by a vessel passing at a comparatively short distance and if the vessels course should happen to lie across that of the raft there was every probability she would only be visible for a short time and then pass away like a ray of hope dying out  after gazing in perfect silence for halfanhour jarwin heaved a deep sigh and said  she steers this way cuffy  cuffy acknowledged the remark with a little whine and a very slight wag of his tail  it was evident that his spirits had sunk to a low ebb and that he was not prepared to derive comfort from every trifling circumstance  come well have a bit of summat to eat my doggie said the sailor reaching forward his hand to the provision bundle  thoroughly understanding and appreciating this remark cuffy roused himself and looked on with profound interest while his master cut up a dried fish  having received a large share of it he forgot everything else and devoted all his powers physical and mental to the business in hand  although jarwin also applied himself to the food with the devotion of a man whose appetite is sharp and whose strength needs recruiting he was very far indeed from forgetting other things  he kept his eyes the whole time on the approaching sail and once or twice became so absorbed and so anxious lest the vessel should change her course that he remained with his mouth half open and with the unconsumed morsel reposing therein for a minute or more at a time  but the vessel did not change her course  on she came a fine large schooner with raking masts and so trim and neat in her rig that she resembled a pleasureyacht  as she drew near jarwin rose and holding on to the mast waved a piece of canvas while cuffy who felt that there was now really good ground for rejoicing wagged his tail and barked in an imbecile fashion as if he didnt exactly know whether to laugh or cry  were all safe now doggie exclaimed jarwin as the schooner came cutting through the water before a light breeze leaving a slight track of foam in her wake  when within about two or three hundred yards of the raft the castaway could see that a figure leant on the vessels side and brought a telescope to bear on him  with a feeling of irrepressible gladness he laughed and waved his hand  ay ay take a good squint he shouted an then lower a boateh  he stopped abruptly for at that moment the figure turned towards the steersman the schooners head fell away presenting her stern to the raft and began to leave her behind  the truth flashed upon jarwin like a thunderbolt  it was clear that the commander of the strange vessel had no intention of relieving him  in the first burst of mingled despair and indignation the seaman uttered a bass roar of defiance that might have done credit to the lungs of a small carronade and at the same time shook his fist at the retiring schooner  the effect of this was as sudden as it was unexpected  to his surprise he observed that the schooners head was immediately thrown up into the wind and all her sails shook for a few moments then filling out again the vessel bent gracefully over on the other tack  with returning joy the castaway saw her run straight towards him  in a few minutes she was alongside and her topsails were backed  look out catch hold cried a gruff voice as a sailor sent a coil of rope whirling over the raft  jarwin caught it took a turn round the mast and held on  in a minute the raft was alongside  weak though he was jarwin retained enough of his sailorlike activity to enable him to seize a rope and swing himself on board with cuffy in his arms  he found himself on the pure white deck of a craft which was so well appointed and so well kept that his first impressions were revived namely that she was a pleasureyacht  he knew that she was not a vessel of war because besides the absence of many little things that mark such a vessel the few men on deck were not clothed like manofwarsmen and there was no sign of guns with the exception of one little brass carronade which was probably used as a signalgun  a tall stout man in plain costume which was neither quite that of a seaman nor a landsman stood with his arms crossed on his broad chest near the man at the wheel  to him judging him to be the captain or owner of the vessel jarwin went up and pulling his forelock by way of salutation said  why sir i thought ee was agoin to leave me  so i was answered the captain drily  hold on to the raft he added turning to the man who had thrown the rope to jarwin  well sir said the latter in some surprise in course i dont know why you wos agoin to leave a fellercreetur to his fate but im glad you didnt go for to do it cos it wouldnt have bin christianlike but im bound for to thank ee sir all the same for havin saved me and cuffy  dont be too free with your thanks my good man returned the captain for youre not saved as you call it yet  not saved yet repeated jarwin  no  whether i save you or not depends on your keeping a civil tongue in your head and on your answers to my questions  the captain interlarded his speech with many oaths which of course we omit  this coupled with his rude manners induced jarwin to suspect that the vessel was not a pleasureyacht after all so he wisely held his peace  where do you belong to demanded the captain  to yarmouth sir  what ship did you sail in what has come of her and how came you to be cast adrift  i sailed in the nancy sir from plymouth with a miscellaneous cargo for china  she sprung a leak in a gale and we was bliged to make a raft the boats bein all stove in or washed away  it was barely ready when the ship went down starn foremost  durin the gale all my mates were washed off the raft or died of exposure only me and my dog left  how long ago was that asked the captain  couldnt rightly say sir ive lost count o time but its more than a year gone by anyhow  thats a lie said the captain with an oath  no taint sir replied jarwin reddening its a truth  i was nigh starved on that raft but was cast on an island where ive bin till a few days ago ever since when i put to sea on the raft that now lays astarn there  for a few seconds the captain made no rejoinder but a glance at the raft seemed to satisfy him of the truth of what was said  at length he said abruptly  whats your name  john jarwin sir  well john jarwin ill save you on one condition which is that you become one of my crew and agree to do my bidding and ask no questions what say you  jarwin hesitated  haul up the raft and let this man get aboard of it said the captain coolly but sternly to the seaman who held the rope  youve no occasion to be so sharp sir said john remonstratively if you wos to tell me to cut my own throat you know i could scarce be expected for to do it without puttin a few questions as to the reason why  youre a trader i suppose  yes im a trader replied the captain but i dont choose to be questioned by you  all youve got to do is to agree to my proposal or to walk over the side  to tell you the truth when i saw you first through the glass you looked such a starved wretch that i thought youd be of no use to me and if it hadnt been for the yell you gave that showed there was something in you still id have left you to sink or swim  so you see what sort of man youve got to deal with  im shorthanded but not so short as to engage an unwilling man or a man who wouldnt be ready for any sort of dirty work  you may take your choice  well sir replied jarwin ive no objection to take service with ee  as the sayin goes beggars mustnt be choosers  i aint above doin dirty work if required  john jarwin in the simplicity of his heart imagined that the captain was in need of a man who could and would turn his hand to any sort of work whether nautical or otherwise on board ship or ashore which was his idea of dirty work but the captain appeared to understand him in a different sense for he smiled in a grim fashion nodded his head and turning to the seaman before mentioned bade him cut the raft adrift  the man obeyed and in a few minutes it was out of sight astern  now jarwin go below said the captain isaacs will introduce you to your messmates  isaacs who had just cut away the raft was a short thickset man with a dark expressionless face  he went forward without saying a word and introduced jarwin to the men as a new and  and a green un i spose give us your flipper lad said one of the crew holding out his hand  jarwin shook it took off his cap and sat down while his new friends began as they expressed it to pump him  having no objection to be pumped he had soon related the whole of his recent history  in the course of the narrative he discovered that his new associates were an unusually rough set  their language was interspersed with frightful oaths and their references to the captain showed that his power over them was certainly not founded on goodwill or affection  jarwin also discovered that the freeness of his communication was not reciprocated by his new mates for when he made inquiries as to the nature of the trade in which they were engaged some of the men merely replied with uproarious laughter chaff or curses while others made jocular allusions to sandalwood trading slaving etcetera  i shouldnt wonder now said one if you was to think we was pirates  jarwin smiled as he replied well i dont exactly think that but im bound for to say the schooner has got such a rakish look that it wouldnt seem unnatural like if you were to hoist a black flag at the peak  an youll excuse me shipmets if i say that yer lingo aint just so polished as it might be  and pray who are you that comes here to lecture us about our lingo cried one of the men fiercely starting up and confronting jarwin with clenched fists  why mate replied jarwin quietly folding back the cuffs of his coat and putting himself in an attitude of defence i aint nobody in partikler not the lord chancellor o england anyhow still less the archbishop of canterbury  im only plain jack jarwin seaman but if you or any other man thinks  come come cried one of the men in a tone of authority starting forward and thrusting jarwins assailant violently aside none o that sort o thing here  keep your fists for the niggers bill were all brothers here you know an affectionate family so to speak  there was a general laugh at this  bill retired sulkily and jarwin sat down to a plate of hot lobscouse which proved to be very good and of which he stood much in need  for several days our hero was left very much to himself  the schooner sped on her voyage with a fair wind and the men were employed in light work or idled about the deck  no one interfered with jarwin but at the same time no one became communicative  the captain was a very silent man and it was evident that the crew stood much in awe of him of course jarwins suspicions as to the nature of the craft were increased by all this and from some remarks which he overheard two or three days after his coming on board he felt convinced that he had fallen into bad company  before a week had passed this became so evident that he made up his mind to leave the vessel at the very first opportunity  one day he went boldly to the captain and demanded to know the nature of the trade in which the schooner was employed and their present destination  he was told that that was no business of his that he had better go forward and mind his duty without more ado else he should be pitched overboard  the captain used such forcible language when he said this and seemed so thoroughly in earnest that jarwin felt no longer any doubt as to his true character  ill tell you what it is my lad said the captain my schooner is a trader or a manofwar according to circumstances and im a free man going where i choose and doing what i please  i treat my men well when they do their duty when they dont i make em walk the plank  no doubt you know what that means  if you dont we shall soon teach you  take tonight to think over it  tomorrow morning ill have a question or two to ask you  therego  jarwin bowed submissively and retired  that night the moon shone full and clear on the wide oceans breast and jarwin stood at the bow of the schooner looking sadly over the side and patting his little dog gently on the head  cuffy you and mes in a fix i suspect he murmured in a low tone but cheer up doggie a way to escape will turn up no doubt  he had scarcely uttered the words when his eye fell on the distant outline of land on the lee bow  he started and gazed with fixed intensity for some minutes under the impression that it might perhaps be a fogbank lighted by the moon but in a short time it became so distinct that there could be no doubt it was land  he pointed it out to the watch on deck one of whom said carelessly that he had seen it for some time and that there were plenty more islands of the same sort in these seas  jarwin walked aft and stood near the lee gangway contemplating the island in silence for some time  a small oar lay at his feet  suddenly he conceived the daring idea of seizing this plunging overboard and attempting to swim to land  he was a splendid swimmer and although the island appeared to be more than two miles distant he did not fear failure  a moments reflection however convinced him that the men on deck would certainly hear the plunge heave the ship to and lower a boat in which case he should be immediately overtaken  still being resolved to escape at all hazards he determined to make the venture fastening a rope to a belaying pin he tied the oar to it and lowered it over the side until it trailed in the water he then lifted cuffy who was almost always near him on to the side of the vessel with a whisper to keep still  the watch paced the weather side of the deck conversing in low tones  the steersman could from his position see both gangways and although the light was not strong enough to reveal what jarwin was about it was too strong to admit of his going bodily over the side without being observed  he therefore walked slowly to the head of the vessel where he threw over the end of a small rope  by means of this when the watch were well aft he slid noiselessly into the sea hanging on by one hand and supporting cuffy with the other once fairly in the water he let go the side of the vessel rubbed swiftly past him and he all but missed grasping the oar which trailed at the gangway  by this he held on for a few seconds to untie the rope he had just succeeded and was about to let go when unfortunately the handle of the oar chanced to hit the end of cuffys nose a severe blow the poor dog therefore gave vent to a loud yell of pain  instantly jarwin allowed himself to sink and held his breath as long as he possibly could while cuffy whined and swam on the surface  meanwhile the men on deck ran to the side  hallo cried one its jarwins little dog gone overboard  let it go cried another with a laugh its a useless brute and eats a power o grub  i say wot a splashin it do kick up he added as the little dog was left astern making vain efforts to clamber on the oar  why lads theres somethin else floatin beside it uncommon like a seal  are ee sure bill that jarwin hasnt gone overboard along with his dog  why no replied bill i seed him go forward a little ago besides it aint likely hed go over without givin a shout  i dun know that said the other he might have hit his head again somethin in tumblin over  by this time the objects in question were almost out of sight astern in a few minutes more a dark cloud covered the moon and effectually shut them out from view  just then the captain came on deck and asked what was wrong  fools he exclaimed in a voice of thunder on being told lower the gig  look sharp  dont you see the land you idiots  the mans away as well as the dog  in a few seconds the topsails were backed and the boat lowered manned and pushed off  but jarwin heard and saw nothing of all this  he was now far astern for the vessel had been going rapidly through the water  on coming to the surface after his dive he caught hold of cuffy and with a cheering word or two placed him on his back telling him to hold on by his paws the best way he could  then grasping the end of the oar and pointing the blade landwards he struck out vigorously with his legs  it was a long and weary swim but as his life depended on it the seaman persevered  when he felt his strength giving way he raised not only his heart but his voice in prayer to god and felt restored each time that he did so  just as he neared the shore the sound of oars broke on his ears and presently he heard the wellknown voice of the captain ordering the men to pull hard  fortunately it was by this time very dark  he landed without being discerned  the surf was heavy but he was expert in rough water went in on the top of a billow and was safely launched on a soft sandy beach almost at the same moment with the boat  the latter was however at a considerable distance from him he crept cautiously up the shore until he gained a thicket and then rising he plunged into the woods and ran straight before him until he was exhausted carrying the little dog in his arms  many a fall and bruise did the poor fellow receive in his progress but the fear of being retaken by the piratesfor such he felt convinced they werelent him wings  the captain and his men made a long search but finally gave it up and returning to the boat pushed off  jarwin never saw them again  he and cuffy lay where they had fallen and slept wet though they were till the sun was high  they were still sleeping when a native chief of the island happening to pass along the beach discerned jarwins footsteps and traced him out  this chief was an immensely large powerful man armed with a heavy club  he awoke the sailor with a kick and spoke in a language which he did not understand  his gestures however said plainly enough get up and come along with me so jarwin thought it best to obey  of course whatever jarwin thought cuffy was of precisely the same opinion  they therefore quietly got up and followed the big chief to his village where they were received by a large concourse of savages with much excitement and curiosity    chapter six  our hero becomes a favourite and entertains hopes of escape  the sufferings which jarwin with his little dog had hitherto undergone were as nothing compared to those which he endured for some months after being taken prisoner by the savages  at first he gave himself up for lost feeling assured that ere long he would be sacrificed in the temple of one of their idols and then baked in an oven and consumed as food according to the horrible practice of the southsea islanders  indeed he began to be much astonished that as day after day passed there was no sign of any intention to treat him in this way although several times the natives took him out of the hut in which he was imprisoned and placing him in the centre of a circle held excited and sometimes angry discussions over him  it was not till months afterwards when he had acquired a slight knowledge of their language that he came to understand why he was spared at this time  it appeared that four shipwrecked sailors who had been cast on a neighbouring island had been killed baked and eaten according to usage by the chief and his friends  immediately afterwards those who had partaken of this dreadful food had been seized with severe illness and one or two had died  this fact had been known for some time to jarwins captors and the discussions above referred to had been engaged in with reference to the question whether it was likely that the flesh of the white man who had been thrown on their island would be likely to disagree with their stomachs  it was agreed that this was highly probable and thus the seamans life was spared but he was sometimes tempted to wish that it had not been spared for his master the big chief was a very hard man he put him to the most toilsome labour and treated him with every sort of indignity moreover he was compelled to be a witness of practices so revolting and cruel that he often put the question to himself whether it was possible for devils to display greater wickedness and depravity than these people  jarwin was frequently tempted to resent the treatment he received but fortunately he was prudent enough to bear it submissively for it is certain that if he had rebelled he would have been slain on the spot moreover he set himself to carry out his favourite maximnamely that it was wise in all circumstances to make the best of everything  he laboured therefore with such goodwill that he softened the breast of the big chief who gradually became more amiable and even indulgent to him  thus he came to know experimentally the wisdom of that scripture be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good  john jarwin possessed a remarkably fine sonorous bass voice which in former days had been a source of great delight to his messmates although strong and deep it was very sweet and tender in its tones and eminently suited for pathetic and sentimental songs  indeed jarwins nature was so earnest that although he had a great deal of quiet humour about him and could enjoy comic songs very much he never himself sang anything humorous  now it chanced that the big chief had a good ear for music and soon became so fond of the songs which his slave was wont to hum when at work that he used to make him sit down beside him frequently and sing for hours at a time  fortunately jarwins lungs were powerful and his voice being fulltoned and loud he was able to sing as much as his master desired without much exertion  he gave him his whole budget which was pretty extensiveincluding melodies of the blackeyed susan and ben bolt stamp  when these had been sung over and over again he took to the psalms and paraphrasesmany of which he knew by heart and finally he had recourse to extempore composition which he found much easier than he had expectedthe tones flowing naturally and the words being gibberish  thus he became a sort of david to this remarkable saul  by degrees as he learnt the native tongue he held long conversations with the big chief and told him about his own land and countrymen and religion  in regard to the last the chief was very inquisitive and informed his slave that white men had been for some time in that region trying to teach their religion to the men of an island which though invisible from his island was not very far distant  jarwin said little about this but from that time he began to hope that through the missionaries he might be able to make his escape ere long  during all this time poor cuffy experienced a variety of vicissitudes and made several narrow escapes  at first he had been caught and was on the point of being killed and roasted when he wriggled out of his captors grasp and made off to the mountains terrorstruck  here he dwelt for some weeks in profound melancholy  being unable to stand separation from his master any longer he ventured to return to the village but was immediately hunted out of it and once again fled in horror to the hills  jarwin was not allowed to quit the village alone he therefore never saw his little dog and at length came to the conclusion that it had been killed  when however he had ingratiated himself with his master he was allowed more freedom and one day having wandered a considerable distance into the mountains he came suddenly and unexpectedly upon cuffy  having experienced nothing from man of late but the most violent and cruel treatment cuffy no sooner beheld as he supposed one of his enemies than without giving him a second glance he sprang up put his ears back his tail between his legs and uttering a terrible yell fled on the wings of terror  but jarwin put two fingers in his mouth and gave a peculiarly shrill whistle which brought the dog to a sudden stop  he looked back with ears cocked  again jarwin whistled  instantly cuffy turned and ran at him with a series of mingled yells whines and barks that gave but a faint idea of his tumultuous feelings  it would scarcely be too much to say that he almost ate his master up  he became like an indiarubber ball gone mad  he bounded round him to such an extent that jarwin found it very difficult to get hold of or pat him  it is impossible to do justice to such a meeting  we draw a veil over it only remarking that the sailor took his old favourite back to the village and after much entreaty and a good deal of persuasive song was permitted to keep him  about ten months after this event war broke out between the big chief and a neighbouring tribe of natives who were a very quarrelsome and vindictive set  the tribe with whom jarwin dwelt would gladly have lived at peace but the other tribe was stronger in numbers and thirsted for conquesta consequence of strength which is by no means confined to savages  when war was formally declared the big chief told jarwin to prepare himself for battle  at first our hero had some qualms of conscience about it but on reflecting that on the part of the tribe to which he belonged it was a war of selfdefence his conscience was pacified  the big chief ordered him to throw away his now ragged garments smear his whole body over with oil and red earth paint black spots on his cheeks and a white streak down his nose and put on warriors costume in vain jarwin begged and protested and sang  the big chiefs blood was up and his commands must be obeyed therefore jarwin did as he was bid went out to battle in this remarkable costumeif we may so style it and proved himself such a prodigy of valour that his prowess went far to turn the tide of victory wherever he appeared during the fight  but we pass over all this  suffice it to say that the pugnacious tribe was severely chastised and reduced to a state of quietfor the time at least  one day not long after the cessation of the war a canoe arrived with several natives all of whom wore clothing of a much more civilised description than is usually seen among southsea savages  they had a long earnest talk with the natives but jarwin was not allowed to hear it or to show himself  next day they went away  for some time after that big chief was very thoughtful but silent and jarwin could not induce him to become confidential until he had sung all his melodies and all his psalms several times over and had indulged in extempore melody and gibberish until his brain and throat were alike exhausted  the big chief gave way at last however and told him that his late visitors were christians who with two native teachers had been sent from a distant island by a white chief named williams to try and persuade him and his people to burn their idols  and are ee goin to do it asked jarwin  no replied the chief but i am going to raratonga to see cookee williams  of course they conversed in the native tongue but as this would be unintelligible to the reader we translate  it may also be remarked here that cookee signified a white man and is a word derived from the visit of that great navigator captain cook to these islands by the natives of which he was ultimately murdered  jarwin had heard while in england of the missionary williams  on learning that he was among the islands his heart beat high and he begged earnestly that he might be allowed to go with the chief and his party to raratonga but his wily master would not consent you will run away he said  no i wont said jarwin earnestly  big chief shook his head  they will take you from me he said when they find out who you are  ill not let em replied jarwin with pathetic sincerity and then began to sing in such a touching strain that his master lay back on his couch and rolled his large eyes in rapture  you shall go jowin that was the best he could make of the name if you will make me a promise  name it old boy said jarwin  that you will go dressed like one of my young men and never open your lips to speak a word no more than if you were dumb whether the cookees speak to you or not  jarwin hesitated but reflecting that there was no chance of his seeing the missionary at all if he did not give this promise he consented  a week after that all the preparations were made and four large canoes full of wellarmed men set out for raratonga  at the time we write of the island of raratonga had been recently discovered by the missionary williams  the success of the labours of that devoted man and his native teachers is one of the most marvellous chapters in the history of the isles of the pacific  at raratonga god seemed to have prepared the way for the introduction of the gospel in a wonderful manner for although the native teachers who first went ashore there were roughly handled they were enabled nevertheless to persevere and in not much more than a single year the gospel wrought a change in the feelings and habits of the people which was little short of miraculous  within that brief period they had given up and burnt all their idols had ceased to practise their bloody and horrible rites and had embraced christianitygiving full proof of their sincerity by submitting to a code of laws founded on scripture by agreeing to abandon polygamy by building a large place of worship and by leading comparatively virtuous and peaceful lives  and all this was begun and carried on for a considerable time not by the european missionaries but by two of the devoted native teachers who had previously embraced christianity  the extent of the change thus wrought in the raratongans in so short a time by the gospel may be estimated by a glance at the difficulties with which the missionaries had to contend  in writing of the ancient usages of the people mr williams see williams most interesting work entitled a narrative of missionary enterprises in the southsea islands tells us that one of their customs was an unnatural practice called kukumi anga  as soon as a son reached manhood he would fight and wrestle with his father for the mastery and if he obtained it would take forcible possession of the farm belonging to his parent whom he drove in a state of destitution from his home  another custom was equally unnatural and inhuman  when a woman lost her husband the relatives of the latter instead of paying visits of kindness to the fatherless and widow in their affliction would seize every article of value belonging to the deceased turn the disconsolate mother and her children away and possess themselves of the house food and land  but they had another custom which caused still greater difficulties to the missionaries  it was called landeatingin other words the getting possession of each others lands unjustly and these once obtained were held with the greatest possible tenacity for land was exceedingly valuable at raratonga and on no subject were the contentions of the people more frequent or fierce  from this it will be seen that the raratongans were apparently a most unpromising soil in which to plant the good seed for there is scarcely another race of people on earth so depraved and unnatural as they seem to have been  nevertheless gods blessed word overcame these deeprooted prejudices and put an end to these and many other horrible practices in little more than a year  after this glorious work had been accomplished the energetic missionarywho ultimately laid down his life in one of these islands the island of erramanga for the sake of jesus christresolved to go himself in search of other islands in which to plant the gospel and to send out native teachers with the same end in view  the record of their labours reads more like a romance than a reality but we cannot afford to diverge longer from the course of our narrative  it was one of these searching parties of native teachers that had visited the big chiefs island as already described and it was their glowing words and representations that had induced him to undertake this voyage to raratonga  big chief of course occupied the largest of the four canoes and our friend jarwin sat on a seat in front of himpainted and decorated like a native warrior and wielding a paddle like the rest  of course cuffy had been left behind  poor jarwin had during his captivity undergone the process of being tatooed from head to foot  it had taken several months to accomplish and had cost him inexpressible torture owing to the innumerable punctures made by the comblike instrument with which it was done on the inflamed muscles of his body  by dint of earnest entreaty and much song he had prevailed on big chief to leave his face and hands untouched  it is doubtful if he would have succeeded in this despite the witching power of his melodious voice had he not at the same time offered to paint his own face in imitation of tatooing and accomplished the feat to such perfection that his delighted master insisted on having his own painted forthwith in the same style  during a pause in their progress while the paddlers were resting big chief made his captive sit near him  you tell me that cookeemen by which he meant white men never lie never deceive  i shud lie an deceive myself if i said so replied jarwin bluntly  what did you tell me then asked the chief with a frown  i told you that christian men dont lie or deceiveleastwise they dont do it with a will  are you a christian man jowin  i am replied the sailor promptly  then with a somewhat perplexed air anyhow i hope i am an i try to act as sitch  good i will soon prove it  you will be near the cookeemen of raratonga tomorrow  you will have chance to go with them and leave me but if you do or if you speak one word of cookeetongueyou are not christian  moreover i will batter your skull with my club till it is like the soft pulp of the breadfruit  youre a cute fellar as the yankees say remarked jarwin with a slight smile  this being said in english the chief took no notice of it but glanced at his slave suspiciously  big chief said jarwin after a short silence even before i was a christian i had been taught by my mother to be ashamed of telling a lie so youve no occasion for to doubt me  but its a hard thing to stand by a countryman specially in my pecooliar circumstances an not let him know that you can speak to him  may i not be allowed to palaver a bit with em  i wont ask em to take me from you  no said the chief sternly  you came with me promising that you would not even speak to the cookeemen  well big chief replied jarwin energetically you shall see that a british seaman can stick to his promise  ill be true to you  honour bright  ill not give em a word of the english lingo if they was to try to tear it out o me wi red hot pincers  ill content myself wi lookin at em and listenin to em  itll be a comfort to hear my mothertongue anyhow  good replied the chief i trust you  the interval of rest coming to an end at this point the conversation ceased and the paddles were resumed  it was a magnificent day  the great pacific was in that condition of perfect repose which its name suggests  not a breath of air ruffled the wide sheet of water which lay spread out like a vast circular lookingglass to reflect the sky and it did reflect the sky with such perfect fidelity that the clouds and cloudlets in the deep were exact counterparts of those that floated in the air while the four canoes resting on their own reflections seemed to be suspended in the centre of a crystal world which was dazzlingly lit up by two resplendent suns  this condition of calm lasted the whole of that day and night and the heat was very great nevertheless the warriorsof whom there were from forty to fifty in each canoedid not cease to paddle for an instant save when the short spells of rest came round and when twice during the day they stopped to eat a hasty meal  when the sun set they still continued to paddle onwards the only difference being that instead of passing over a sea of crystal they appeared to traverse an ocean of amber and burnished gold  all night they continued their labours  about daybreak the chief permitted them to enjoy a somewhat longer period of rest during which most of them without lying down indulged in a short but refreshing nap  resuming the paddles they proceeded until sunrise when their hearts were gladdened by the sight of the blue hills of raratonga on the bright horizon  now we shall soon be at the end of our voyage said the chief as he pointed to the distant hills and glanced at jarwin as he might at a prize which he was much afraid of losing  remember the promise you christian  dont be a deceiver you breetish tar he quoted jarwin here  honour bright replied our hero  the savage gazed earnestly into the sailors bright eyes and appeared to think that if his honour was as bright as they were there was not much cause to fear  at all events he looked pleased nodded his head and said good with considerable emphasis  by this time the hills of raratonga were beginning to look less like blue clouds and more like real mountains gradually as the canoes drew nearer the markings on them became more and more defined until at last everything was distinctly visiblerocky eminences and luxuriant valleys through which flowed streams and rivulets that glittered brightly in the light of the ascending sun and almost constrained jarwin to shout with delight for he gazed upon a scene more lovely by far than anything that he had yet beheld in the southern seas    chapter seven  our hero is exposed to stirring influences and trying circumstances  when the four canoes drew near to the island immense numbers of natives were seen to assemble on the beach so that big chief deemed it advisable to advance with caution  presently a solitary figure either dressed or painted black advanced in front of the others and waved a white flag  this seemed to increase the chiefs anxiety for he ordered the men to cease paddling  jarwin whose heart had leaped with delight when he saw the dark figure and the white flag immediately turned round and said  you neednt be afraid old boy thats the missionary ill be bound in his black toggery an a white flag means peace among cookee men  on hearing this the chief gave the order to advance and jarwin seizing a piece of native cloth that lay near him waved it round his head  stop that you breetish tar growled big chief seizing a huge club which bristled with sharks teeth and shaking it at the seaman while his own teeth were displayed in a threatening grin  all right old codger replied the british tar with a submissive look honour bright honour bright he added several times in a low tone as if to keep himself in mind of his promise  we have already said that our hero and his master talked in the native tongue which the former had acquired with wonderful facility but such familiar expressions as old boy old codger etcetera were necessarily uttered in english  fortunately for jarwin who was by nature freeandeasy the savage chief imagined these to be terms of respect and was consequently rather pleased to hear them  similarly big chief said breetish tar and christian in english as he had learned them from his captive  when master and slave began to grow fond of each otheras we have seen that they soon did their manly natures being congenialthey used these expressions more frequently jarwin meaning to express facetious goodwill but his master desiring to express kindly regard except when he was roused to anger in which case he did not however use them contemptuously but as expressive of earnest solemnity  on landing big chief and his warriors were received by the reverend mr williams and his native teachersof whom there were two men and two womenwith every demonstration of kindness and were informed that the island of raratonga had cast away and burned its idols and now worshipped the true god who had sent his son jesus christ to save the world from sin  i know that replied big chief to the teacher who interpreted converts like yourself came to my island not long ago and told me all about it  now i have come to see and hear  a wise man will know and understand before he acts  big chief was then conducted to the presence of the king of that part of the island who stood surrounded by his chief men under a grove of temanu trees  the king whose name was makea was a handsome man in the prime of life about six feet high and very massive and muscular he had a noble appearance and commanding aspect and though not so tall as big chief was obviously a man of superior power in every way  his complexion was light and his body most beautifully tatooed and slightly coloured with a preparation of tumeric and ginger which gave it a light orange tinge and in the estimation of the raratongans added much to the beauty of his appearance  the two chiefs advanced frankly to each other and amiably rubbed noses togetherthe south sea method of salutation  then a long palaver ensued in which big chief explained the object of his visit namely to hear about the new religion and to witness its effects with his own eyes  the missionary gladly gave him a full account of all he desired to know and earnestly urged him to accept the gospel of jesus christ and to throw away his idols  big chief and his men listened with earnest attention and intense gravity and after the palaver was over retired to consult together in private  during all this time poor jarwins heart had been greatly stirred being tatooed and nearly naked as well as painted like the rest of his comrades of course no one took particular notice of him which depressed him greatly for he felt an intense desire to seize the missionary by the hand and claim him as a countryman  indeed this feeling was so strong upon him on first hearing mr williamss english tone of voicealthough the missionary spoke only in the native tongue that he could scarcely restrain himself and had to mutter honour bright several times in order as it were to hold himself in check honour bright became his moral rein or curb on that trying occasion but when in the course of the palaver mrs williams who had accompanied her husband on this dangerous expedition came forward and addressed a few words to the missionary in english he involuntarily sprang forward with an exclamation of delight at hearing once more the old familiar tongue  he glanced however at big chief and checked himself  there was a stern expression on the brow of the savage but his eyes remained fixed on the ground and his form and face were immovable as though he heard and saw nothing  honour bright whispered jarwin as he turned about and retired among his comrades  fortunately his sudden action had only attracted the attention of a few of those who were nearest to him and no notice was taken of it  when big chief retired with his men for consultation he called jarwin aside  jarwin he said with unusual gravity you must not hear our palaver  why not old feller  it is your business to obey not to question replied big chief sternly  gowhen i want you i will find you  you may go and look at the cookee missionary but remember i have your promise  honour bright replied jarwin with a sigh  the promise of a breetish tar  surely replied jarwin  of a christian said big chief with emphasis  aye thats the idee but its a hard case old boy to advise a poor feller to go into the very jaws o temptation  i would rather ee had ordered me to keep away from em  howsever here goes  muttering these words to himself he left his savage friends to hold their palaver and went straight into the jaws of temptation by walking towards the cottage of the missionary  it was a neat wooden erection built and plastered by the natives  jarwin hung about the door sometimes he even ventured to peep in at the windows in his intense desire to see and hear the longlost forms and tones of his native land and as the natives generally were much addicted to such indications of curiosity his doing so attracted no unusual attention  while he was standing near the door mrs williams unexpectedly came out  jarwin feeling ashamed to appear in so very light a costume before a lady turned smartly round and walked away  then reflecting that he was quite as decently clothed as the other natives about he turned again and slowly retraced his steps pretending to be interested in picking stones and plants from the ground  the missionarys wife looked at him for a moment with no greater interest than she would have bestowed on any other native and then gazed towards the seashore as if she expected some one  presently mr williams approached  well have you been successful she asked  yes it has been all arranged satisfactorily so i shall begin at once replied mr williams  the only thing that gives me anxiety is the bellows  poor jarwin drew nearer and nearer  his heart was again stirred in a way that it had not been for many a day and he had to pull the rein pretty tightly in fact it required all his christianity and britishtarhood to prevent him from revealing himself and claiming protection at that moment  as he raised himself and gazed with intense interest at the speakers the missionarys attention became fixed on him and he beckoned him to approach  i think you are one of the strangers who have just arrived are you not  this was spoken in the language of raratonga which was so similar to that which he had already acquired that he opened his mouth to reply yes your honour or your reverence in english  but it suddenly occurred to him that he must translate this into the native tongue if his secret was to be preserved  while he was turning over in his mind the best words to use for this purpose he reflected that the imperfection of his knowledge even the mere tone of his voice would probably betray him he therefore remained dumb with his mouth open  the missionary smiled slightly and repeated his question  jarwin in great perplexity still remained dumb  suddenly an idea flashed across his mind  he pointed to his mouth wagged his tongue and shook his head  ah you are dumb my poor man said the missionary with a look of pity  or tabooed suggested the lady his tongue may have been tabooed  there was some reason and probability in this for the extraordinary custom of tabooing by which various things are supposed to be rendered sacred and therefore not to be used or touched is extended by the south sea islanders to various parts of their bodies as for instance the hands in which case the person so tabooed must for a time be fed by others as he dare not use his hands  jarwin being aware of the custom was so tickled by the idea of his tongue being tabooed that he burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter to the intense amazement of his questioners  while in the midst of this laugh he became horrified by the thought that that of itself would be sufficient to betray him so he cleverly remedied the evil and gave vent to his feelings by tapering the laugh off into a hideous yell and rushed frantically from the spot  strange observed the missionary gazing after the fugitive mariner how like that was to an english laugh  more like the cry of a south sea maniac i think said mrs williams reentering the house followed by her husband  the matter which the missionary said had been arranged so satisfactorily and was to be begun at once was neither more nor less than the building of a ship in which to traverse the great islandstudded breast of the pacific  in case some one accustomed to think of the ponderous vessels which are built constantly in this land with such speed and facility should be inclined to regard the building of a ship a small matter we shall point out a few of the difficulties with which the missionary had to contend in this projected work  in the first place he was on what is sometimes styled a savage islandan island that lay far out of the usual track of ships that had only been discovered a little more than a year at that time and was inhabited by a bloodthirsty savage cruel and ignorant race of human beings who had renounced idolatry and embraced christianity only a few months before  they knew no more of shipbuilding than the celebrated man in the moon and their methods of building canoes were quite inapplicable to vessels of large capacity  besides this mr williams was the only white man on the island and he had no suitable implements for shipbuilding except axes and augurs and a few of the smaller of the carpenters tools  in the building of a vessel timbers and planks are indispensable but he had no pitsaw wherewith to cut these  it is necessary to fasten planks and timbers together but he had no nails to do this  heavy iron forgings were required for some parts of the structure but although he possessed iron he had no smiths anvil or hammer or tongs or bellows wherewith to forge it  in these circumstances he commenced one of the greatest pieces of work ever undertaken by mangreatest not only because of the mechanical difficulties overcome but because of the influence for good that the ship when completed had upon the natives of the southern seas as well as its reflex influence in exciting admiration emulation and enthusiasm in other lands  the first difficulty was the bellows  nothing could be done without these and the forge  there were four goats on the island  three of these were sacrificed their skins were cut up and along with two boards converted into a pair of smiths bellows in four days  no one can imagine the intense interest with which john jarwin looked on while the persevering but inexperienced missionary laboured at this work and tremendous was the struggle which he had to keep his hands idle and his tongue quiet for he was a mechanical genius and could have given the missionary many a useful hint but did not dare to do so lest his knowledge or voice or aptitude for such work or all these put together should betray him  he was therefore fain to content himself with looking on or performing a few trifling acts in the way of lifting carrying and hewing with the axe  his friends frequently came to look on as the work progressed and he could not help fancying that they regarded him with looks of peculiar interest  this perplexed him but supposing that it must result from suspicion of his integrity he took no notice of it save that he became more resolute than ever in reference to honour bright  big chief also came to look on and wonder but although he kept a sharp eye on his slave he did not seem to desire intercourse with him  when the bellows were finished it was found that they did not work properly  the upper box did not fill well and when tried they were not satisfied with blowing wind out but insisted on drawing fire in they were in short a failure  deep were the ponderings of the missionary as to how this was to be remedied and small was the light thrown on the subject by the various encyclopaedias and other books which he possessed but the question was somewhat abruptly settled for him by the rats  these creatures devoured all the leather of the bellows in a single night and left nothing but the bare boards  rats were an absolute plague at that time at raratonga  mr williams tells us in his interesting narrative that he and his family never sat down to a meal without having two or more persons stationed to keep them off the table  when kneeling at family prayer they would run over them in all directions and it was found difficult to keep them out of the beds  on one occasion when the servant was making one of the beds she uttered a scream and on rushing into the room mr williams found that four rats had crept under the pillow and made themselves snug there  they paid for their impudence however with their lives  on another occasion a pair of english shoes which had not been put in the usual place of safety were totally devoured in a night and the same fate befell the covering of a hairtrunk  no wonder then that they did not spare the bellows  poor jarwin sorrowed over this loss fully as much as did the missionary but he was forced to conceal his grief  still bent on discovering some method of raising the wind mr williams appealed to his inventive powers  he considered that if a pump threw water there was no reason why it should not throw wind impressed with this belief he set to work and made a box about eighteen or twenty inches square and four feet high with a valve in the bottom to let air in a hole in the front to let it out and a sort of piston to force it through the hole  by means of a long lever the piston could be raised and by heavy weights it was pushed down  of course considerable power was required to raise the piston and its weights but there was a superabundance of power for thousands of wondering natives were ready and eager to do whatever they were bid  they could have pumped the bellows had they been the size of a house  they worked admirably in some respects but had the same fault as the first pair namely a tendency to suck in the fire  this however was corrected by means of a valve at the back of the pipe which communicated with the fire  another fault lay in the length of interval between the blasts this was remedied by making another box of the same kind and working the two alternately so that when one was blowing the fire the other was as it were taking breath  thus a continuous blast was obtained while eight or ten grinning and delighted natives worked the levers  the great difficulty being thus overcome the work progressed rapidly a large hard stone served for an anvil and a small stone perforated with a handle affixed to it did duty for a hammer  a pair of carpenters pincers served for tongs and charcoal made from the cocoanut and other trees did duty for coals  in order to obtain planks the missionary split trees in half with wedges and then the natives thinned them down with adzes extemporised by fitting crooked handles to ordinary hatchets  when a bent or twisted plank was required having no apparatus for steaming it he bent a piece of bamboo to the required shape and sent natives to scour the woods in search of a suitable crooked tree  thus planks suited to his purpose were obtained  instead of fastening the planks to the timbers of the ship with iron nails large wooden pins or trenails were used and driven into augur holes and thus the fabric was held together  instead of oakum cocoanut husk was used and native cloth and dried banana stumps to caulk the seams and make them watertight  the bark of a certain tree was spun into twine and rope by a ropemachine made for the purpose and a still more complex machine namely a turninglathe was constructed for the purpose of turning the block sheaves while sails were made out of native mats quilted to give them sufficient strength to resist the wind  by these means was completed in about three months a decked vessel of from seventy to eighty tons burdenabout sixty feet long by eighteen broad  she was finally launched and named the messenger of peace and truly a messenger of peace and glad tidings did she afterwards prove to be on many occasions among the islands of the southern seas  but our hero john jarwin was not allowed to remain to see this happy consummation  he only looked on and assisted at the commencement of the work  many and many a time did he during that trying period argue with himself as to the propriety of his conduct in thus refusing the means of escape when it was thrown in his way and there was not wanting now and then a suggestion from somewherehe knew not where but certainly it was not from outside of himthat perhaps the opportunity had been providentially thrown in his way  but jarwin resisted these suggestions  he looked up and reflected that he was there under a solemn promise that but for his promise he should not have been there at all and that therefore it was his peculiar duty at that particular time to whisper to himself continuallyhonour bright  one morning big chief roused jarwin with his toe and said  get up  we go home now  what say ee old man  get ready  we go today  i have seen and heard enough  big chief was very stern so that jarwin thought it wise to hold his tongue and obey  there was a long animated palaver between the chief the missionary and the king but jarwin had been carefully prevented from hearing it by his master who ordered him to keep by the canoes which were launched and ready  once again he was assailed by an intense desire to escape and this sudden approach of the time that was perchance to fix his fate for life rendered him almost desperatebut he still looked up and honour bright carried the day  he remained dumb to the last and did not even allow himself the small comfort of waving a piece of native cloth to the missionary as he and his captors paddled from the raratonga shore    chapter eight  despair is followed by surprises and deliverance  at first john jarwin could not quite realise his true position after leaving raratonga  the excitement consequent on the whole affair remained for some time on his mind causing him to feel as if it were a dream and it was not until he had fairly landed again on big chiefs island and returned to his own little hut there and had met with cuffywhose demonstrations of intense delight cannot by any possibility be describedthat he came fully to understand the value of the opportunity which he had let slip through his fingers  poor jarwin words fail to convey a correct idea of the depth of his despair for now he saw clearly as he thought that perpetual slavery was his doom  under the influence of the feelings that overwhelmed him he became savage  cuff said he on the afternoon of the day of his return its all up with you and me old chap  the tone in which this was uttered was so stern that the terrier drooped its ears lowered its tail and looked up with an expression that was equivalent to dont kick me please dont  jarwin smiled a grim yet a pitiful smile as he looked at the dog  yes its all up with us he continued we shall live and die in slavery wot a fool i was not to cut and run when i had the chance  the remembrance of honour bright flashed upon him here but he was still savage and therefore doggedly shut his eyes to it  at this point a message was brought to him from big chief requesting his attendance in the royal hut  jarwin turned angrily on the messenger and bid him begone in a voice of thunder at the same time intimating by a motion of his foot that if he did not obey smartly he would quicken his motions for him  the messenger vanished and jarwin sat down beside cuffywho looked excessively humbleand vented his feelings thus  i cant stand it no longer cuff  i wont stand it  im goin to bust up i am so look out for squalls  a feeling of uncertainty as to the best method of busting up induced him to clutch his hair with both hands and snort  it must not be supposed that our hero gave way to such rebellious feelings with impunity  on the contrary his conscience pricked him to such an extent that it felt like an internal pincushion or hedgehog  while he was still holding fast to his locks in meditative uncertainty three natives appeared at the entrance of his hut and announced that they had been sent by big chief to take him to the royal hut by force in case he should refuse to go peaceably  uttering a shout of defiance the exasperated man sprang up and rushed at the natives who much too wise to await the onset fled in three different directions  instead of pursuing any of them jarwin went straight to his masters hut where he found him seated on a couch of native cloth  striding up to him he clenched his fist and holding it up in a threatening manner exclaimed  now look ee here big chiefwhich it would be big thief if ee had yer right namei aint goin to stand this sort o thing no longer  i kep my word to you all the time we wos at raratonga but now ill keep it no longer  ill do my best to cut the cable and make sail the wery first chance i gitsso i give ee fair warnin  big chief made no reply for some moments but opened his eyes with such an intense expression of unaffected amazement that jarwins wrath abated in spite of his careful nursing of it to keep it warm  jowin he exclaimed at length you christian breetish tar have your dibbil got into you  this question effectually routed jarwins anger  he knew that the savage to whom he had spoken at various times on the subject of satanic influence was perfectly sincere in his inquiry as well as in his astonishment  moreover he himself felt surprised that big chief who was noted for his readiness to resent insult should have submitted to his angry tones and looks and threatening manner without the slightest evidence of indignation  the two men therefore stood looking at each other in silent surprise for a few moments  big chief said jarwin at last bringing his right fist down heavily into his left palm by way of emphasis theres no dibbil as you call him got possession o me  my own spirit is dibbil enough i find to account for all that ive said and donean a great deal more  but it has bin hard on me to see the door open as it were an not take adwantage of it  howsever its all over now an i ax yer parding ill not mutiny again  youve been a kind feller to me old chap though you are a savagean i aint ongrateful as long as im your slave ill do my dutyhonour bright at the same time i think it fair an above board to let you know that ill make my escape from you when i git the chance  im bound for to sarve you while i eat your wittles but i am free to go if i can manage it  thereyou may roast me alive an eat me if you like but you cant say after this that im sailin under false colours  during this speech a variety of expressions affected the countenance of big chief but that of melancholy predominated  jowin he said slowly i like you  youre a goodhearted old buffer said jarwin grasping the chiefs hand and squeezing it to say the truth im wery fond o yourself but its natral that i should like my freedom better  big chief pondered this for some time and shook his head slowly as if the result of his meditation was not satisfactory  jowin he resumed after a pause sing me a song  well you are a queer codger said jarwin laughing in spite of himself if ever there was a man as didnt feel up to singin thats me at this moment  howsomedever i spose it must be done  wotll you ave  ben bolt blackeyed susan the jolly young waterman jim crow there is a happy land or the old hundred eh  only say the word an ill turn on the steam  big chief made no reply  as he appeared to be lost in meditation jarwin sat down and in a species of desperation began to bellow with all the strength of his lungs one of those nautical ditties with which seamen are wont to enliven the movements of the windlass or the capstan he changed the tune several times and at length slid gradually into a more gentle and melodious vein of song while big chief listened with evident pleasure  still there was perceptible to jarwin a dash of sadness in his masters countenance which he had never seen before wondering at this and changing his tunes to suit his own varying moods he gradually came to plaintive songs and then to psalms and hymns  at last big chief seemed satisfied and bade his slave goodnight  hes a wonderful cracter remarked jarwin to cuffy as he lay down to rest that night a most onaccountable sort o man  theres sumthin workin in is ead tho wot it may be is more nor i can tell  praps hes agoin to spiflicate me in consikence o my impidence  if so cuff whatever will became o you my poor little doggie  cuffy nestled very close to his masters side at this point and whined in a pitiful tone as if he really understood the purport of his remarks  in five minutes more he was giving vent to occasional mild little whines and half barks indicating that he was in the land of dreams and jarwins nose was creating sounds which told that its owner had reached that blessed asylum of the wearyoblivion  next day our sailor awakened to the consciousness of the fact that the sun was shining brightly that paroquets were chattering gaily that cuffy was still sleeping soundly and that the subjects of big chief were making an unusual uproar outside  starting up and pulling on a pair of remarkably ancient canvas trousers which his master had graciously permitted him to retain and wear jarwin looked out at the door of his hut and became aware of the fact that the whole tribe was assembled in the spot where national palavers were wont to be held  the house appeared to be engaged at the time in the discussion of some exceedingly knotty questiona sort of national education bill or church endowment schemefor there was great excitement much gesticulation and very loud talk accompanied with not a little angry demonstration on the part of the disputants  hallo wots up inquired jarwin of a stout savage who stood at his door armed with a club on the head of which human teeth formed a conspicuous ornament  palaver replied the savage  its easy to hear and see that replied jarwin but wot is it all about  the savage vouchsafed no farther reply but continued to march up and down in front of the hut  jarwin therefore essayed to quit his abode but was stopped by the taciturn savage who said that he must consider himself a prisoner until the palaver had come to an end  he was therefore fain to content himself with standing at his door and watching the gesticulations of the members of council  big chief was there of course and appeared to take a prominent part in the proceedings  but there were other chiefs of the tribe whose opinions had much weight though they were inferior to him in position at last they appeared to agree and finally with a loud shout the whole band rushed off in the direction of the temple where their idols were kept  jarwins guard had manifested intense excitement during the closing scene and when this last act took place he threw down his club forsook his post and followed his comrades  of course jarwin availed himself of the opportunity and went to see what was being done  to his great surprise he found that the temple was being dismantled while the idols were carried down to the palaverground if we may so call it and thrown into a heap there with marks of indignity and contempt  knowing as he did the superstitious reverence with which the natives regarded their idols jarwin beheld this state of things with intense amazement and he looked on with increasing interest hoping ere long to discover some clue to the mystery but his hopes were disappointed for big chief caught sight of him and sternly ordered him back to his hut where another guard was placed over him  this guard was more strict than the previous one had been  he would not allow his prisoner even to look on at what was taking place  under the circumstances there was therefore nothing for it but to fall back on philosophic meditation and converse with cuffy  these were rather poor resources however to a man who was surrounded by a tribe of excited savages  despite his natural courage and coolness jarwin felt as he said himself raither oncomfortable  towards the afternoon things became a little more quiet still no notice was taken of our hero save that his meals were sent to him from the chiefs hut  he wondered at this greatly for nothing of the kind had ever happened before and he began to entertain vague suspicions that such treatment might possibly be the prelude to evil of some kind befalling him  he questioned his guard several times but that functionary told him that big chief had bidden him refuse to hold converse with him on any subject whatever  being as the reader knows a practical matteroffact sort of man our hero at last resigned himself to his fate whatever that might be and beguiled the time by making many shrewd remarks and observations to cuffy  when the afternoon meal was brought to him he heaved a deep sigh and apparently with that effort flung off all his anxieties  come along cuff he said in a hearty voice sitting down to dinner lets grub together an be thankful for small mercies anyhow  wotever turns up you and i shall go halves and stick by one another to the last  not that i have any doubts of big chief cuffy you mustnt suppose that but then you see he aint the only chief in the island and if all the rest was to go agin him he couldnt do much to save us  the dog of course replied in its usual facetious manner with eyes and tail and sat down with its ears cocked and its head turned expectantly on one side while the sailor removed the palmleaf covering of the basket which contained the provisions sent to him  wot have we here cuffy he said soliloquising and looking earnestly in let me see bit of baked piggood cuff good thats the stuff to make us fat  wot next  roast fishthats not bad cuffnot bad though hardly equal to the pig  here we have a leaf full of plantains and another of yamsexcellent grub that my doggie nothing could be better  whats this  cocoanut full of its own milkthe best o drink it cheersas the old song or the old poet saysbut it dont inebriate that wos said in regard to tea you know but it holds good in respect of cocoanut milk and its far better than grog cuffy far better though you cant know nothin about that but you may take my word for it happy is the man as drinks nothin stronger than cocoanut milk or tea  hallo wots thisplums  why doggie theyre oncommon good to us today  i wonder wots up  i say jarwin paused as he drew the last dish out of the prolific basket and looked earnestly at his dog while he laid it down i say what if they should have taken it into their heads to fatten us up before killin us  thats not a wery agreeable notion is it eh  apparently cuffy was of the same opinion for he did not wag even the point of his tail and there was something dubious in the glance of his eye as he waited for more  well well it aint no use surmisin observed the seaman with another sigh wot weve got for to do just now is to eat our wittles an hope for the best  here you are cuffcatch  throwing a lump of baked pig to his dog the worthy man fell to with a keen appetite and gave himself no further anxiety as to the probable or possible events of the future  dinner concluded he would fain have gone out for a ramble on the shoreas he had been wont to do in time pastbut his gaoler forbade him to quit the hut  he was therefore about to console himself with a siesta when an unexpected order came from big chief requiring his immediate attendance in the royal hut  jarwin at once obeyed the mandate and in a few minutes stood before his master who was seated on a raised couch enjoying a cup of cocoanut milk  i have send for you began big chief with solemnity to have a palaver  sit down you breetish tar  all right old chap replied jarwin seating himself on a stool opposite to his master  wot is it to be about  jowin rejoined big chief with deepening gravity yous bin well treated here  big chief spoke in broken english now having picked it up with amazing facility from his white slave  well yees im free to confess that i has bin well treated barrin the fact that my libertys bin took away besides which some of your black rascals aint quite so civil as they might be but on the whole ive been well treated anyhow i never received nothin but kindness from you old codger  he extended his hand frankly and big chief who had been taught the meaning of our english method of salutation grasped it warmly and shook it with such vigour that he would certainly have discomposed jarwin had that breetish tar been a less powerful man  he performed this ceremony with the utmost sadness however and continued to shake his head in such a melancholy way that his white slave began to feel quite anxious about him  hallo old feller you aint bin took bad have ee  big chief made no reply but continued to shake his head slowly then as if a sudden idea had occurred to him he rose and grasping jarwin by his whiskers with both hands rubbed noses with him after which he resumed his seat on the couch  just so observed our hero with a smile you shake hands with me english fashioni rub noses with you southsea fashion  give an take all right old codgermay our friendship last for ever as the old song puts it  but wot about this here palaver you spoke of  it warnt merely to rub our beaks together that you sent for me

oh gammon replied jarwin with an unbelieving grin  wot is gammon demanded big chief with a somewhat disappointed look  well it dont matter what it meansits nothin or nonsense if you likebut wot do you mean old man thats the rub as hamblet or some such cracter said to his fatherinlaw you aint in airnest are you  jowin answered the chief with immovable gravity i not onderstan you  wot you mean by airnest  he did not wait for a reply however but seizing jarwin by the wrist and looking into his eyes with an expression of childlike earnestness that effectually solemnised his white slave continued lissen onderstan me  i is a christian  my broder chiefs an i have watch you many days  you have always do wot is right no matter wot trouble follers to you  you do this for love of your god your

jowin  i love your god  i keep you if possible but christian must not have slave  goyou is free  you dont mean that old man cried jarwin starting up with flashing eyes and seizing his masters hand  you is free repeated big chief  we need not relate all that honest john jarwin said and did after that let it suffice to record his closing remarks that night to cuffy  cuff said he patting the shaggy head of his humble friend many a strange thing crops up in this here koorious world but it never did occur to my mind before that while a larned man like a missionary might state the truth the likes o me should have the chance an the power to prove it  thats a wery koorious fact so you an i shall go to sleep on it my doggiegoodnight    chapter nine  the last  that jarwins deliverance from slavery was not a dream but a blessed reality was proved to him next day beyond all doubt by the singular proceedings of big chief and his tribe  such of the native idols as had not been burned on the previous day were brought out collected into a heap and publicly burned after which the whole tribe assembled on the palavering ground and big chief made a long earnest and animated speech in which he related all that he had seen of his white slaves conduct at the island of raratonga and stated how that conduct had proved to him more conclusively than anything else he had heard or seen that the religion of the white missionaries was true  while this was being spoken many sage reflections were passing through jarwins mind and a feeling of solemn thankfulness filled him when he remembered how narrowly he had escaped doing inconceivable damage by giving way to temptation and breaking his word  he could not avoid perceiving that if he had not been preserved in a course of rectitude all through his terrible trial at a time when he thought that no one was thinking about him not only would big chief and his nation have probably remained in heathen superstition and continued to practise all the horrid and bloody rites which that superstition involved but his own condition of slavery would in all probability have been continued and rendered permanent for big chief and his men were numerous and powerful enough to have held their own against the raratongans while at the same time it was probable that he would have lost his masters regard as he would certainly have lost his respect  he could not help reflecting also how much the cause of christianity must often suffer in consequence of the conduct of many seamen calling themselves christians who visit the southsea islands and lead dissolute abandoned lives while there  some of these he knew brought this discredit on the name of jesus thoughtlessly and would perhaps be solemnised and sorry if they knew the terrible results of their conduct while others he also knew cared nothing for christianity or for anything in the world except the gratification of their own selfish desires  while he was yet pondering these things big chief advanced towards him and taking him by the hand led him into the centre of the concourse to his great surprise and confusion the tall chief said  now jowin will palaver to you  he is one breetish tarone christian he can tell us what we shall do  saying this big chief sat down and left jarwin standing in the midst scratching his head and looking with extreme perplexity at the vast sea of black faces and glittering eyes which were directed towards him  wy you know old man it aint fair of you this aint he said addressing himself to big chief youve took me all aback like a white squall  how dee spose that i can tell ee wot to do  i aint a parsonno not even a clerk or a parish beadle  to this big chief vouchsafed no further reply thanpalaver you breetish tar  wery good exclaimed jarwin turning round and looking full at his audience while a bright smile lit up his sunburnt countenance as if a sudden idea had occurred to him ill do my best to palaver  here goes then for a yarn  jarwin spoke of course in the native tongue which we translate into his own language  big chief small chiefs and niggers in general he began with a wave of his right hand youve called on me for a speech  good  im your man im a breetish tar as your great chief says trulythats a fact an im a christiani hope  god knows ive sometimes my own doubts as to that same but the doubts aint with reference to the almighty theyre chiefly as regards myself  howsever to come to the point youve gone and burnt your idols  ho exclaimed the whole assembly with a degree of energy that made a deep impression on the sailorjust as one might be impressed when he has been permitted to become the happy medium of achieving some great end which he had never dreamed of being privileged to accomplish  well then continued jarwin that is a good thing anyhow for its a disgrace to human natur not to speak o commonsense an other things to worship stocks an stones wen the bible distinctly tolls ee not to do it  youve done right in that matter an glad am i to hear from big chief that you intend after this to foller the truth old man an niggers cried jarwin warming up to my mind the highest thing that a man can dewot hisself to is the follerin out an fallin in with the truth  just spose that chemists an ingineers an doctors was to foller lies  wy wot would come of it  confoosion wus confounded  in coorse therefore they carefully tries to foller wots truethough im bound for to say they do git off the track now an then  well if its so with such like its much more so with religion  wot then  wy stand by your colours through thick an thin  hold on to the bible  thats the watchword  thats your sheetanchorthough you havent seed one yet  its good holdin ground is the bibleits the only holdin ground  how does i know that says you  well it aint easy for me to give you an offhand answer to that any more than it is to give you an offhand answer to a complicated question in the rule o three  a parson could do it no doubt but the likes o me can only show a sort o reflected light like the moon nevertheless we may show a true lightthough reflected chiefs an niggers theres asses in every generation young asses chiefly as thinks theyve found out somethin noo in regard to the bible an then runs it down  an them fellers grow old an sticks to their opinions an they think themselves wise an other people thinks em wise cause theyre old as if oldness made em wise  wy are they asses  wy because they formed their opinions early in life in opposition to men wot has studied these matters all through their lives havin hoisted their colours they nails em to the mast an there they are  they never goes at the investigation o the subject as a man investigates mathematics or navigation or logarithms so theyre like a ship at sea without a chart  niggers no man can claim to be wise unless he can render a reason  he may be praps but he cant claim to be  i believe the bibles true because o two facts  fust of all men of the highest intellec have found it true an tried it an practised its teachins an rested their souls on it  in the second place as the parsons say i have tried it an found it true as fur as ive gone  ive sailed accordin to the chart an have struck on no rocks or shoals as yet  ive bin wery near it but thank god i wasnt allowed to take the wrong course altogether though ive got to confess that i wanted to many a time  now wot does all this here come to demanded jarwin gazing round on his audience who were intensely interested though they did not understand much of what he said wot does it come to  wy that havin wisely given up yer idols an taken to the true god the next best thing you can do is to go off at once to raratonga an git the best adwice you can from those wot are trained for to give it  i cant say no fairer than that for as to askin adwice on religious matters from the likes o me wy the things parfitly ridiklous  jarwin sat down amid a murmur of applause  in a few minutes an old chief rose to reply  his words were to the effect that although there was much in their white brothers speech beyond their understanding which was not to be wondered at considering that he was so learned and they so ignorantthere was one part of it which he thoroughly agreed with namely that a party should be sent to raratonga to inform the cookee missionaries as to what had taken place to ask advice and to beg one of the cookees to come and live permanently on their island and teach them the christian religion  another chief followed with words and sentiments to much the same effect  then big chief gave orders that the canoes for the deputation should be got ready without delay and the meeting broke up with loud shouts and other pleasant demonstrations  matters having been thus satisfactorily arranged jarwin returned to his hut with a grateful heart to meditate on the happy turn that had taken place in his prospects  finding the hut not quite congenial to his frame of mind and observing that the day was unusually fine he resolved to ramble in the cool shades of a neighbouring wood  come cuff my doggie you an i shall go for a walk this fine day weve much to think about an talk over dee see which is best done in solitary places  need we say that cuffy responded with intense enthusiasm to this invitation and that his spanker boom became violently demonstrative as he followed his master into the wood  jarwin still wore as we have said his old canvas trousers which had been patched and repatched to such an extent with native cloth that very little of the original fabric was visible  the same may be said of his old flannel shirt to which he clung with affectionate regard long after it had ceased to be capable of clinging to him without patchwork strengthening  the remnants of his straw hat also had been carefully kept together so that with the exception of the paint on his face which big chief insisted on his wearing and the huge southsea club which he carried habitually for protection he was still a fair specimen of a british tar  paroquets were chattering happily rills were trickling down the hillsides fruit and flower trees perfumed the air and everything looked bright and beautifulin pleasant accordance with the state of jarwins feelingswhile the two friends wandered away through the woods in dreamy enjoyment of the past and present and with hopeful anticipations in regard to the future  jarwin said something to this effect to cuffy and put it to him seriously to admit the truth of what he said which that wise dog did at onceif there be any truth in the old saying that silence is consent  after wandering for several hours they came out of the wood at a part of the coast which lay several miles distant from big chiefs village here to his surprise and alarm he discovered two warcanoes in the act of running on the beach  he drew back at once and endeavoured to conceal himself for he knew too well that this was a party from a distant island the principal chief of which had threatened more than once to make an attack on big chief and his tribe  but jarwin had been observed and was immediately pursued and his retreat cut off by hundreds of yelling savages  seeing this he ran down to the beach and taking up a position on a narrow spit of sand flourished his ponderous club and stood at bay  cuffy placed himself close behind his master and glaring between his legs at the approaching savages displayed all his teeth and snarled fiercely  one who appeared to be a chief ran straight at our hero brandishing a club similar to his own jarwin had become by that time well practised in the use of his weapon he evaded the blow dealt at him and fetched the savage such a whack on the small of his back as he passed him that he fell flat on the sand and lay there  cuffy rushed at him and seized him by the throat an act which induced another savage to launch a javelin at the dog  it grazed his back cut it partly open and sent him yelling into the woods meanwhile jarwin was surrounded and although he felled three or four of his assailants was quickly overpowered by numbers gagged lashed tight to a pole so that he could not move and laid in the bottom of one of the warcanoes  even when in this sad plight the sturdy seaman did not lose heart for he knew well that cuffy being wounded and driven from his masters side would run straight home to his masters hut and that big chief would at once suspect from the nature of the wound and the circumstance of the dog being alone that it was necessary for him and his menofwar to take the field jarwin therefore felt very hopeful that he should be speedily rescued  but such hopes were quickly dispelled when after a noisy dispute on the beach the savages who owned the canoe in which he lay suddenly reembarked and pushed off to sea leaving the other canoe and its crew on the beach  hour after hour passed but the canoemen did did not relax their efforts  straight out to sea they went and when the sun set big chiefs island had already sunk beneath the horizon  now indeed a species of wild despair filled the breast of the poor captive  to be thus seized and doomed in all probability to perpetual bondage when the cup of regained liberty had only just touched his lips was very hard to bear  when he first fully realised his situation he struggled fiercely to burst his bonds but the men who had tied him knew how to do their work  he struggled vainly until he was exhausted  then looking up into the starry sky his mind became gradually composed and he had recourse to prayer  slumber ere long sealed his eyes setting him free in imagination and he did not again waken until daylight was beginning to appear  all that day he lay in the same position without water or food cramped by the cords that bound him and almost driven mad by the heat of an unclouded sun  still onward went the canoepropelled by men who appeared to require no rest  night came again and jarwinby that time nearly exhaustedfell into a troubled slumber  from this he was suddenly aroused by loud wild cries and shouts as of men engaged in deadly conflict and he became aware of the fact that the canoe in which he lay was attacked for the warriors had thrown down their paddles and seized their clubs and their feet trod now on his chest now on his face as they staggered to and fro  in a few minutes several dead and wounded men fell on him then he became unconscious  when john jarwins powers of observation returned he found himself lying on his back in a neat little bed with white cotton curtains in a small comfortablyfurnished room that reminded him powerfully of home cuffy lay on the counterpane sound asleep with his chin on his masters breast  at the bedside with her back to him sat a female dressed in european clothes and busy sewing  surely it aint bin all a long dream whispered jarwin to himself  cuffy cocked his ears and head and turned a furtive glance on his masters face while his spanker boom rose with the evident intention to wag if circumstances rendered it advisable but circumstances had of late been rather perplexing to cuffy  at the same time the female turned quickly round and revealed a brown though pleasant face simultaneously a gigantic figure arose at his side and bent over him  yous bedder said the gigantic figure  hallo  big chief  wots up old feller exclaimed jarwin  hold yous tongue said big chief sternly  go way he added to the female who with an acquiescent smile left the room  well this is queer an i feels queer  queerywots the meanin of it asked jarwin  yous bin bad jowin answered big chief gravely wery bad  dead amost  now yous goin to be bedder  doctor say that  doctor exclaimed jarwin in surprise what doctor  doctor of ship  hims come ebbery day for to see you  ship cried jarwin springing up in his bed and glaring at big chief in wonder  lie down you christian breetish tar said the chief sternly at the same time laying his large hand on the sailors chest with a degree of force that rendered resistance useless  hold yous tongue an listen doctor say you not for speak  me tell you all about it  fust place continued big chief yous bin bad konsikince of de blackguards havin jump on yous face an stummick  but we give em awful lickin jowinoh smash um down right and left got you out de canoedead i think but no not jus so  bring you hereraratonga de cookee missionary an his wife not here away in ship you sees im make  native teecher here  dat teechers wife bin nurse you an go away jus now  ship comes here for trade bound for england  ams got doctor  doctor come see you shake ums head looks long time say he put you all right  four week since dat  now yous hall right  the last words he uttered with much anxiety depicted on his countenance for he had been so often deceived of late by jarwin having occasional lucid intervals in the midst of his delirium that his faith in him had been shaken  all right exclaimed jarwin aye right as a trivet  bound for england did ee saythe ship  big chief nodded and looked very sad  you go home he asked softly  jarwin was deeply touched he seized the big mans hand and not being strong failed to restrain a tear or two  big chief being very strongin feelings as well as in frameburst into tears  cuffy being utterly incapable of making head or tail of it gave vent to a prolonged dismal howl which changed to a bark and whine of satisfaction when his master laughed patted him and advised him not to be so free in the use of his spanker boom    four weeks later and jarwin with cuffy by his side stood himself again on the quarterdeck of the nancy of hull while the yo heave ho of the sailors rang an accompaniment to the clatter of the windlass as they weighed anchor big chief held his hand and wept and rubbed noses with himto such an extent that the cabin boy said it was a perfect miracle that they had a scrap of nose left on their facesand would not be consoled by the assurance that he jarwin would certainly make another voyage to the south seas if he should be spared to do so and occasion offered for the express purpose of paying him a visit  at last he tore himself away got into his canoe and remained gazing in speechless sorrow after the homewardbound vessel as she shook out her topsails to the breeze  despite his efforts poor jarwin was so visibly affected at parting from his kind old master that the steward of the ship a sympathetic man was induced to offer him a glass of grog and a pipe  he accepted both mechanically still gazing with earnest looks at the fastreceding canoe  presently he raised the glass to his lips and his nose became aware of the longforgotten odour  the current of his thoughts was violently changed  he looked intently at the glass and then at the pipe  drink said the sympathetic steward and take a whiff  itll do you good  drink whiff exclaimed jarwin while a dark frown gathered on his brow  there old father neptune he cried tossing the glass and pipe overboard you drink and whiff if you choose john jarwin has done wi drinkin an whiffin for ever  thanks to you all the same an no offence meant he added in a gentler tone turning to the astonished steward and patting him on the shoulder but if you had suffered all that i have suffered through bein a slave to the glass and the pipe when i thought i was no slave mark you an would have larfed any one to scorn whod said i wosif youd seed me groanin an yearnin an dreamin of baccy an grog as i have done wen i couldnt get neither of em for love or moneyyou wouldnt wonder that i aint goin to be such a born fool as to go an sell myself over again  turning quickly towards the shore as if regretting that he should for a moment have appeared to forget his old friend he pulled out his handkerchief and waved it over the side  big chief replied energetically with a scrap of native clothnot having got the length of handkerchiefs at that time  look at im cuff exclaimed jarwin placing his dog on the bulwarks of the ship look at him cuff and wag your spanker boom to him too ay thats rightfor hes as kindhearted a nigger as ever owned a breetish tar for a slave  he said no more but continued to wave his handkerchief at intervals until the canoe seemed a mere speck on the horizon and after it was gone he and his little dog continued to gaze sadly at the island as it grew fainter and fainter until it sank at last into the great bosom of the pacific ocean  the next land seen by jarwin and cuffy wasthe white cliffs of old england
