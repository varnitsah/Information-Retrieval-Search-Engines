15021146	the rover of the andes a tale of adventure in south america by rm ballantyne    this book is wellwritten and carries the reader right up to the last chapter always panting to know what ever will happen next it describes a journey across central south america at about the latitude of buenos aires in argentina lots of different sorts of nasty happenings and nasty people are encountered and the problems are overcome one by one it seems quite realistic but at anyrate it is a good product of the writers imagination and research i enjoyed transcribing it very much  robert michael ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894  he was educated at the edinburgh academy and in 1841 he became a clerk with the hudson bay company working at the red river settlement in northen canada until 1847 arriving back in edinburgh in 1848  the letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters  three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade the young fur traders ungava the hudson bay company and were based on his experiences with the hbc  in this period he also wrote the coral island and martin rattler both of these taking place in places never visited by ballantyne  having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about  with these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers  he researched the cornish mines the london fire brigade the postal service the railways the laying down of submarine telegraph cables the construction of lighthouses the lightship service the lifeboat service south africa norway the north sea fishing fleet ballooning deepsea diving algiers and many more experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time and he lived as they lived  he was a very truetolife author depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail  his young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen sometimes four in a year all very good reading  the rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life but the quality never failed  he published over ninety books under his own name and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym comus  for todays taste his books are perhaps a little too religious and what we would nowadays call pi  in part that was the way people wrote in those days but more important was the fact that in his days at the red river settlement in the wilds of canada he had been a little dissolute and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave as he felt he had been  some of his books were quite short little over 100 pages  these books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents having less pocketmoney  these books are particularly wellwritten and researched because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money  they were published as six series three books in each series  typical of these series is on the coast    the rover of the andes a tale of adventure in south america by rm ballantyne    chapter one  a tale of adventure in south america  at the foot of the mountain range  towards the close of a bright and warm day between fifty and sixty years ago a solitary man might have been seen mounted on a mule wending his way slowly up the western slopes of the andes  although decidedly inelegant and unhandsome this specimen of the human family was by no means uninteresting  he was so large and his legs were so long that the contrast between him and the little mule which he bestrode was ridiculous  he was what is sometimes styled loosely put together nevertheless the various parts of him were so massive and muscular that however loosely he might have been built up most men would have found it rather difficult to take him down  although wanting in grace he was by no means repulsive for his face which was ornamented with a soft flaxen beard and moustache of juvenile texture expressed wonderful depths of the milk of human kindness  he wore boots with the trousers tucked into them a grey tunic or hunting coat belted at the waist and a broadbrimmed straw hat or sombrero  evidently the times in which he travelled were troublous for besides having a brace of large pistols in his belt he wore a cavalry sabre at his side  as if to increase the eccentricity of his appearance he carried a heavy cudgel by way of ridingwhip but it might have been observed that however much he flourished this whip about he never actually applied it to his steed  on reaching a turn of the road at the brow of an eminence the mule stopped and letting its head droop till almost as pendent as its tail silently expressed a desire for repose  the cavalier stepped off  it would convey a false impression to say that he dismounted  the mule heaved a sigh  poor little thing murmured the traveller in a soft low voice and in a language which even a mule might have recognised as english you may well sigh  i really feel ashamed of myself for asking you to carry such a mass of flesh and bone  but its your own faultyou know it isfor you wont be led  im quite willing to walk if you will only follow comelet us try  gently insinuatingly persuasively the traveller touched the reins and sought to lead the way  he might as well have tried to lead one of the snowclad peaks of the mighty cordillera which towered into the sky before him  with ears inclining to the neck a resolute expression in the eyes his forelegs thrown forward and a lean slightly backward the mule refused to move  come now do be amiable theres a good little thing  come on said the strong youth applying more force  peruvian mules are not open to flattery  the advance of the forelegs became more decided the lean backward more pronounced the ears went flat down and incipient passion gleamed in the eyes  well well have it your own way exclaimed the youth with a laugh but dont blame me for riding you so much  he once more rem no we forgothe once more lifted his right leg over the saddle and sat down  fired no doubt with the glow of conscious victory the mule moved on and up at a more lively pace than before  thus the pair advanced until they gained a rocky eminence whence the rich peruvian plains could be seen stretching faraway toward the glowing horizon where the sun was about to dip into the pacific  here again the mule stopped and the rider getting off sat down on a rock to take a look at the level horizon of the westfor he had reached a spot where the next turn in the road would partially shut out the plains and enclose him among the giant mountains  as he sat there meditating while the mule cropped the herbage at his side he observed two riders a considerable way down the circuitous road by which he had ascendeda man and a boy apparently  whether it was the fine stalwart figure of the man that influenced him or the mere presence of wayfarers in such a solitary place our traveller could not tell but he certainly felt unusual interest and not only watched the pair as they approached but sat still until they came up  as they drew near he perceived that the smaller of the two whom at a distance he had taken for a boy was an indian girl who according to custom bestrode her mule like a man  her companion was a handsome spanishlooking mana peruvian or it might be a chilianwith fine masculine features and magnificent black eyes  he was wellarmed and to judge from his looks seemed a little suspicious of the tall englishman  the hearty salutation of the latter however in bad spanish at once dissipated his suspicions  replying in the same tongue he then added in good english  you are a stranger in this land i perceive  in truth i am replied the other while the peruvian dismounted nevertheless i ought scarcely to admit the fact for i was born in peru  this perhaps may seem contradictory but it is not more so than your being apparently a native of the soil yet speaking english like an englishman  from which it follows returned the peruvian that men ought not to judge altogether by appearances  but you are wrong in supposing me a native of the soil and yeti am not an englishman  i have got a gift of language howeverat least i feel myself equally at home in english indian spanish and portuguese which is not to be wondered at seeing that i have been forced to talk in all four languages for nigh a quarter of a century  then you must have been but a boy when you came here returned the englishman for you seem to be not yet middleaged  right i was indeed a mere boy when i came to this land  and i was a boy of seven when i left it to be educated in europe returned the englishman  it is sixteen years since then and i had feared that my memory might have failed to recognise the old landmarks but i am rejoiced to find that i remember every turn of the road as if i had left home but yesterday  we have said that the tall youths face was not handsome but the glow of animation which rested on it when he spoke of home seemed for a moment to transform it  your home then cannot be far distant remarked the peruvian with a peculiar look that might have attracted the attention of the younger man if his gaze had not at the moment been directed to the indian girl who during the foregoing conversation had remained motionless on her mule with her eyes looking pensively at the ground like a beautiful statue in bronze  my home is close at hand said the englishman when the question had been repeated unless memory plays me false two more turns in the road will reveal it  the earnest look of the peruvian deepened as he asked if the estate of passamanka was his home  yes you know it then exclaimed the youth eagerly and perhaps you knew my father too  yes indeed there are few people within a hundred miles of the place who did not know the famous sugarmill and its hospitable owner senhor armstrong  but excuse me added the peruvian with some hesitation you are aware i suppose that your father is dead  ay well do i know that returned the other in a deeper tone  it is to take my fathers place at the mills that i have been hastily summoned from england  alas  i know nothing of the work and it will be sorely against the grain to attempt the carrying on of the old business in the desolate old home  of course you also know continued the peruvian that the country is disturbed just nowthat the old smouldering enmity between chili and peru has broken forth again in open war  i could not have passed through the low country without finding that out  indeed said the youth glancing at his belt with a halfapologetic smile these weapons which are so unfamiliar to my hand and so distasteful to my spirit are proof that i at least do not look for a time of peace  i accoutred myself thus on landing at the urgent advice of a friend though my good cudgelwhich has sufficed for all my needs hithertois more to my mind besides being useful as a mountain staff  but why do you ask  is there much probability of the belligerents coming so far among the hills  wherever carrion is to be found there you may be sure the vultures will congregate  there is booty to be got here among the hills and whether the soldiers belong to the welltrained battalions of chili or the wretched levies of peru they are always prepared for plunder ready to make hay while the sun shines  i only hope senhor armstrong thatbut come let us advance and see before the sun sets  turning abruptly as he spoke the man mounted his mule and rode briskly up the winding road followed by the indian girl and our englishman  at the second turning of the road they reached a spot where an opening in the hills revealed the level country below stretching away into illimitable distance  as had been anticipated they here came upon the mills they were in quest of  the peruvian reined up abruptly and looked back  i feared as much he said in a low tone as the englishman rode forward  rendered anxious by the mans manner lawrence armstrong sprang from his mule and pushed forward but suddenly stopped and stood with clasped hands and a gaze of agony  for there stood the ruins of his early homewhere his mother had died while he was yet a child where his father had made a fortune which in his desolation he had failed to enjoy and where he finally died leaving his possessions to his only child  the troops had visited the spot fired no doubt with patriotic fervour and knowing its owner to be wealthy  they had sacked the place feasted on the provisions drunk the wines smashed up by way of pleasantry all the valuables that were too heavy to carry away and finally setting fire to the place had marched off to other fields of glory  it was a tremendous blow to poor lawrence coming as he did fresh from college in a peaceful land and full of the reminiscences of childhood  sitting down on a broken wall he bowed his head and wept bitterly though silentlywhile the peruvian quietly retiring with the indian girl left him alone  the first paroxysm of grief over young armstrong rose and began sadly to wander about the ruins  it had been an extensive structure fitted with all the most approved appliances of mechanism which wealth could purchase  these now helped to enhance the wild aspect of the wreck for iron girders had been twisted by the action of fire into snakelike convolutions in some places while in others their ends stuck out fantastically from the blackened walls  beautiful furniture had been smashed up to furnish firewood for the cooking of the meal with which the heroic troops had refreshed themselves before leaving while a number of broken winebottles at the side of a rosewood writingdesk with an empty bottle on the top of it and heaps of stones and pebbles around suggested the idea that the warriors had mingled light amusement with sterner business  the roofs of most of the buildings had fallen in the windowframes where spared by the fire had been torn out and a pianoforte which lay on its back on the grass showed evidence of having undergone an examination of its internal arrangements with the aid of the buttends of muskets  and this is the result of war muttered the young man at last breaking silence  only one phase of it replied a voice at his side in tones of exceeding bitterness you must imagine a few corpses of slaughtered men and women and children if you would have a perfect picture of war  the speaker was the peruvian who had quietly approached to say that if they wished to reach the next restingplace before dark it was necessary to proceed without delay  but perhaps he added you do not intend to go further  no doubt this was to have been the end of your journey had all been well  it can scarcely i fear be the end of it now  i do not wish to intrude upon your sorrows mr armstrong but my business will not admit of delay  i must push on yet i would not do so without expressing my profound sympathy and offering to aid you if it lies in my power  there was a tone and look about the man which awoke a feeling of gratitude and confidence in the forlorn youths heart  you are very kind he said but it is not in the power of man to help me  as your business is urgent you had better go and leave me  i thank you for the sympathy you expressyet stay  you cannot advance much further tonight why not encamp here  there used to be a small hut or outhouse not faroff in which my father spent much of his leisure perhaps thethe  patriots suggested the peruvian  the scoundrels said lawrence may have spared or overlooked it  the hut would furnish shelter enough and we have provisions with us  after a moments reflection the peruvian assented to this proposal and leaving the ruins together they returned to the road where they found the indian girl holding the youths mule as well as that of her companion  hastening forward lawrence apologised for having in the agitation of the moment allowed his mule to run loose  but i forgot he added of course you do not understand english  try spanish suggested the peruvian she knows a little of that  unfortunately i have forgotten the little that i had picked up here when a boy returned lawrence as he mounted if i can manage to ask for food and lodging in that tongue it is all that i can do  they soon reached an opening in the bushes at the roadside and at the further end of a natural glade or track observed a small wooden hut thatched with rushes  towards this young armstrong led the way  he was evidently much affected for his lips were compressed and he gave no heed to a remark made by his companion  entering the hut he stood for some time looking silently round  it was but a poor place with bare walls a carpenters bench in one corner near to it a smiths forge one or two chairs and a few toolsnot much to interest a stranger but to lawrence full of tender associations  it was here he said in tones of deepest pathos that my father showed me how to handle tools and my mother taught me to read from the word of god  looking at his companions he observed that the large dark eyes of the indian girl were fixed on him with an expression of unmistakable sympathy  he felt grateful at the moment for to most men sympathy is sweet when unobtrusively offered whether it come from rich or poor civilised or savage  come this will do said the peruvian looking round if you will kindle a fire on the forge senhor armstrong manuela will arrange a sleeping chamber for herself in the closet i see there while i look after the beasts  he spoke in cheering tones which had the effect of rousing the poor youth somewhat from his despondency  well then he replied let us to work and it is but just as we are to sup together and you know my name that i should be put on an equal footing with yourself  impossible interrupted the other with a slight curl of his moustache for as i am only six feet one and you are at least six feet four we can never be on an equal footing  nay but i referred to names not to inches  pray by what name shall i call you  pedro returned the spaniard  i am known by several names in these partssome of them complimentary others the reverse according as i am referred to by friends or foes  men often speak of me as a confirmed rover because of my wandering tendencies but im not particular and will answer to any name you choose so long as it is politely uttered the one i prefer is pedro  he went out as he spoke to look after the mules while lawrence set about kindling a small fire and otherwise making preparations for supper  the indian girl manuela with that prompt and humble obedience characteristic of the race to which she belonged had gone at once into the little closet which her companion had pointed out and was by that time busily arranging it as a sleeping chamber for the night    chapter two  compact with the new friend and discovery of an old one  keeping the fire low in order to prevent its being seen by any of the wandering bands of patriotsalias soldiers alias bandittiwho might chance to be in the neighbourhood the three travellers thus thrown unexpectedly together ate their supper in comparative silence lawrence and pedro exchanging a comment on the viands now and then and the handsome indian girl sitting opposite to them with her eyes for the most part fixed on the ground though now and then she raised them to take a quick stealthy glance at the huge youth whose appetite did not seem to be greatly affected by his misfortunes  perhaps she was wondering whether all englishmen possessed such innocent kindly faces and such ungainly though powerful frames  it may be that she was contrasting him with the handsome wellknit pedro at his side  whatever her thoughts might have been the short glances of her lustrous eyes gave no clue to them and her tongue was silent save when she replied by some brief monosyllable to a remark or query put in the indian language occasionally by pedro  sometimes a gleam of the firelight threw her fine brown features into bold relief but on these occasions when lawrence armstrong chanced to observe them they conveyed no expression whatever save that of profound gravity with a touch perhaps of sadness  the bench being awkwardly situated for a table they had arranged a small box bottom up instead  lawrence and his new acquaintance seated themselves on the ground and manuela used her saddle as a chair  towards the end of their meal the two men became more communicative and when pedro had lighted a cigarette they began to talk of their immediate future  you dont smoke remarked pedro in passing  no replied lawrence  not like the most of your countrymen said the other  so much the worse rejoined the youth  the worse for them or for youwhich asked pedro with a significant glance  no matter returned lawrence with a laugh  well now resumed pedro after a few puffs during the emission of which his countenance assumed the expression of seriousness which seemed most natural to it what do you intend to do  it is well to have that point fairly settled tonight so that there may be no uncertainty or delay in the morning  i would not urge the question were it not that in the morning we must either go on together as travelling companions or say our final adieux and part  i am not in the habit of prying into mens private affairs but to speak the bare truth i am naturally interested in one whose father has on more than one occasion done me good service  you need not answer me unless you please senhor added the man with the air of one who is prepared to retire upon his dignity at a moments notice  thanks thanks pedro said the englishman heartily i appreciate your kindness and accept your sympathy with gratitude  moreover i am glad to find that i have been thrown at such a crisis in my fortunes into the company of one who had regard for my dear father  but i scarce know what to do  i will give you my confidence unreservedly  perhaps you may be able to advise  stay interrupted the other on whose countenance a slightly stern expression hovered  before you give me unreserved confidence it is but fair that i should tell you candidly that i cannot pay you back in kind  as to private matters i have none that would be likely to interest any one under the sun  in regard to other thingsmy business is not my own  why i am here and what i mean to do i have no right to reveal  whither i am bound however is not necessarily a secret and if you choose to travel with me you undoubtedly have a right to know  young armstrong expressed himself satisfied  he might have wished to know more but like pedro he had no desire to pry into other mens affairs and being of an open confiding nature was quite ready to take his companion on trust even though he had been less candid and engaging in manner than he was  after explaining that he had been educated in edinburgh and trained to the medical profession he went on to say that he had been hastily summoned to take charge of the sugarmill at his fathers death and that he had expected to find an old overseer who would have instructed him in all that he had to do in a business with which he was totally unacquainted  you see he continued my father always said that he meant to retire on his fortune and did not wish me to carry on the business but being naturally an uncommunicative man on business matters he never gave me any information as to details  of course i had expected that his manager here and his books would reveal all that i required to know but the soldiers have settled that question  mill and books have gone together and as to manager clerks and servants i know not where they are  scattered no doubt said pedro here there and everywhereonly too glad to escape from a neighbourhood which has been given up to fire and sword by way of improving its political condition  i know not returned lawrence sadly  but it would be useless i fear to try to ferret them out  quite useless said pedro  besides what would it avail to talk with any of them about the affairs of a place that is now in ashes  but if your father spoke of his fortune he must have had at least some of it in a bank somewhere  true but i dont know where  all i know is that he once mentioned casually in one of his letters that he was going to buenos ayres where he had some property  indeed exclaimed pedro  come that may help you to decide for i am myself going to buenos ayres and can guide you there if disposed to go only you will have to make up your mind to a pretty long and hard journey for duty requires me to go by a devious route  you must know he continued lighting another cigarette that i am pledged to take that girl to her father who lives not far from buenos ayres  he pointed as he spoke to manuela who having laid her head on her saddle appeared to have fallen asleep  her father must be a chief i should think to judge from her dignified graceful carriage as well as her fine features said lawrence in a low tone  yes he is a chiefa great chief returned pedro gazing at his cigarette in a meditative mooda very great chief  you see she happened to be living with friends on the western side of the mountains when this war between chili and peru broke out and her father naturally wants to get her out of danger  the old chief once saved my life so you see i am bound both by duty and gratitude to rescue his daughter  indeed you are and a pleasant duty it must be returned lawrence with an approving nod but dont you think it might have been wise to have rescued some other female a domestic for instance to keep her company the poor girl will feel very lonely on such a long journey as you speak of  pedro again looked musingly at his cigarette and flipped off the ash with his little finger  you have not had much experience of war young man he said if you think that in cases of rescue men can always arrange things comfortably and according to the rules of propriety  when towns and villages are in flames when plunder and rapine run riot everywhere and little children are spitted on the bayonets of patriots as is often the case even in what men have agreed to term civilised warfare one is glad to escape with the skin of ones teeth  yet i was not as regardless of manuelas comfort as you seem to think  a poor woman who had nursed her when a child volunteered to accompany us and continued with us on the first part of our journey but the exertion as i had feared was too much for her  she caught a fever and died so that we were forced to come on alone  if you join us however i shall be greatly pleased for two can always make a better fight than one and in these unsettled times there is no saying what we may fall in with in crossing the mountains  but why expose the poor girl to such risks asked lawrence  surely there must be some place of safety nearer than buenos ayres to which you might conduct her  senhor armstrong replied the man with a return of his stern expression i have told you that my business is urgent  not even the rescue of my old friends daughter can turn me aside from it  when manuela begged me to take her with me i pointed out the difficulties and dangers of the route and the necessity for my pursuing a long and devious course but she said she feared to remain where she was that being young strong and accustomed to an active life she felt sure she was equal to the journey that she could trust me and that she knew her father would approve of her taking the step  i agreed with some hesitation  it turned out that the girl was right in her fears for before we left the town it was attacked by the troops of chili  the peruvians made but a poor resistance and it was carried by assault when i saw that all hope of saving the place was gone i managed to bring manuela and her nurse away in safety  as i have told you the nurse died and nowhere we are alone  manuela chooses to run the risk  i will not turn aside from my duty  if you choose to join us the girl will be saferat least until we cross the mountains  on the other side i shall be joined by friends if need be  pedro ceased and rekindled his cigarette which had gone out during the explanation  i will go with you said lawrence with decision as he extended his hand  good replied pedro grasping it with a hearty squeeze now i shall have no fears for our little indian for robbers are cowards as a rule  have we then much chance of meeting with robbers  well i should say we have little chance of altogether escaping them for in times of war there are always plenty of deserters and other whitelivered scoundrels who seize the opportunity to work their will besides there are some noted outlaws in the neighbourhood of the pass we are going to cross  theres conrad of the mountains for instance youve heard of him  no never  ah senhor that proves you to be a stranger here for his name is known from the atlantic to the pacificchiefly however on the east side of the cordillera and on the pampas  he is an outlawat least he is said to be so but one cannot believe all one hears  some say that he is cruel others that he is ferocious among men but never hurts women or children  well it is to be hoped we may not fall in with him or any of his band said lawrence for it is better to hear of his qualities than to put them to the test  yet methinks resumed pedro if you fell in with him alone you should have no cause to fear him for you must be more than his match  i dont think i should fear him returned lawrence with a simple look  as to being more than his match i know not for my spirit does not prompt me to light and i cannot boast of much capacity in the use of armsunless you count my good oakcudgel a weapon  i have acquired some facility in the use of that having practised singlestick as an amusement at school  as he spoke the youth was surprised and somewhat startled by his companion suddenly drawing a pistol from his belt and pointing it steadily at the open doorway of the hut  turning his eyes quickly in that direction he beheld with increased astonishment a pair of glaring eyes two rows of glittering teeth and a pair of thick red lips  the flesh which united these striking objects was all but invisible by reason of its being nearly as black as its background  most eyes if human would have got away from a pistols line of fire with precipitancy but the eyes referred to did not disappear  on the contrary they paid no regard whatever to the owner of the pistol but continued to glare steadily at lawrence armstrong  seeing this pedro hesitated to pull the trigger  he was quick to defend himself but not prompt to kill  when he saw that the eyes slowly advanced out of the gloom that they with the lips and teeth belonged to a negro who advanced into the room unarmed and with outspread hands he quietly lowered his weapon and glanced at lawrence  no doubt pedro felt as he certainly looked perplexed when he observed that lawrence returned the intruders gaze with almost equal intensity  suddenly the negro sprang towards the englishman  he was a short thickset and exceedingly powerful man yet lawrence made no move to defend himself  quashy he exclaimed as the black fell on his knees seized one of his hands and covered it with kisses at the same time bursting into tears  oh massa lawrieoh massa lawrie why you no come sooner  why you so long  de sodger brutes nebber dar to touch de ole house if you was dere  oh  massa lawrie yous too latetoo latemy how yous growed  in the midst of his sobs the young negro for he was little more than a youth drew back his head to obtain a better view of his old companion and playmate  need we say that lawrence reciprocated the affection of the man  he was a boy like myself when i was here said lawrence in explanation to the amused peruvian  his father was one of my fathers most attached servants whom he brought from kentucky on his way to this land and to whom he gave his freedom  quashy himself used to be my playmatebut tell me about the attack on the mill quash  were you present  prisint  you bery sure i was an i poke some holes in de varmints fore dey hoed away  and how did you escape quash  come sit down and tell me all about it  the negro willingly complied  meanwhile the indian girl who had been roused by his sudden entrance resumed her seat on the saddle and looking intently into his black face seemed to try to gather from the expression of his features something of what he said  we need not repeat the story  it was a detailed account of murder and destruction the burning of the place and the scattering of the old servants  fortunately lawrence had no relatives to deplore  but dont you know where any of the household have gone he asked when the excited negro paused to recover breath  dont know nuffin  arter i poke de holes in de scoundrils i was bleeged to bolt  when i come back de ole house was in flames an eberybody gonewhat wasnt dead  i hollereday till i was amost bustedbut nobody reply  den i bury de dead ones an ive hoed about eber since slobberin an wringin my hands  was our old clerk among the slain asked lawrence  no massa but i tinks hes a dead one now for he too ole to run far  and i suppose you cant even guess where any of those who escaped went to  couldnt guess more nor a red injins nooborn babby  quashy said lawrence in a low voice be careful how you speak of indians  he glanced as he spoke at manuela who now sat with grave face and downcast eyes having apparently found that the human countenance however expressive failed to make up for the want of language  and truly quashys countenance was unwontedly mobile and expressive every feature seemed to possess the power of independently betraying the thoughts and feelings of the man so that when they all united for that end the effect was marvellous  emotional and full of quick sympathy quashys visage changed from grave to gay pitiful to fierce humorous to savage at a moments notice  when therefore he received the gentle rebuke above referred to his animated countenance assumed a sudden aspect of utter woe and selfcondemnation that may be conceived but cannot be described and when lawrence gave vent to a short laugh at the unexpected change quashys eyes glistened with an arch look and his mouth expanded from ear to ear  and what an expansion that was to be sure when you take into account the display of white teeth and red gums by which it was accompanied  well now quash resumed lawrence what did you do after that  arter what massa  after finding that slobbering and wringing your hands did no good  oh arter dat i not know what to do an den i tried to diei was so misrable  but i couldnt  youve no notion how hard it is to die when you wants to  anyhow i couldnt manage it so i gib up tryin  at this point manuela rose and bidding pedro goodnight in the indian tongue passed into her little chamber and shut the door  and what do you intend to do now quash asked lawrence  stick to you massa troo tick an tin returned the negro with emphatic promptitude which caused even pedro to laugh  my poor fellow that is impossible said lawrence who then explained his position and circumstances showing how it was that he had little money and no immediate prospect of obtaining anythat in short he was about to start out in the wide world friendless and almost penniless to seek his fortune  to all of which the negro listened with a face so utterly devoid of expression of any kind that his old master and playmate could not tell how he took it  and now he asked in conclusion what say you to all that  stick to you troo tick and tin repeated quashy in a tone of what might be styled sulky firmness  but said lawrence i cant pay you any wages  don want no wages said quashy  besides resumed lawrence even if i were willing to take you senhor pedro might object  i no care for senhor pedro one brass buttin retorted the negro  the peruvian smiled rather approvingly at this candid expression of opinion  where you gwine asked quashy abruptly  to buenos ayres  is gwine to bens airies too  is a free nigger an no mortial man kin stop me  as quashy remained obdurate and upon consultation lawrence and pedro came to the conclusion that such a sturdy resolute fellow might be rather useful in the circumstances it was finally arranged to the poor fellows inexpressible delight that he should accompany them in their long journey to the far east    chapter three  lingual difficulties accompanied by physical dangers and followed by the advent of banditti  after several days had passed away our travellers found themselves among the higher passes of the great mountain range of the andes  before reaching that region however they had in one of the villages through which they passed supplied themselves each with a fresh stout mule besides two serviceable animals to carry their provisions and camp equipage  pedro who of course rode ahead in the capacity of guide seemed to possess an unlimited supply of cash and lawrence armstrong had at least sufficient to enable him to bear his fair share of the expenses of the journey  as for quashy being a servant he had no expenses to bear  of course the finest as well as the bestlooking mule had been given to the pretty manuela and despite the masculine attitude of her position she sat and managed her steed with a grace of motion that might have rendered many a white dame envious  although filled with admiration lawrence was by no means surprised for he knew well that in the pampas or plains to which region her father belonged the indians are celebrated for their splendid horsemanship  indeed their little children almost live on horseback commencing their training long before they can mount and overcoming the difficulty of smallness in early youth by climbing to the backs of their steeds by means of a foreleg and not unfrequently by the tail  the costume of the girl was well suited to her present mode of life being a sort of light tunic reaching a little below the knees with loose leggings which were richly ornamented with needlework  a straw hat with a simple feather covered her head beneath which her curling black hair flowed in unconfined luxuriance  she wore no ornament of any kind and the slight shoes that covered her small feet were perfectly plain  in short there was a modest simplicity about the girls whole aspect and demeanour which greatly interested the englishman inducing him to murmur to himself what an uncommonly pretty girl she would be if she were only white  the colour of her skin was indeed unusually dark but that fact did not interfere with the classic delicacy of her features or the natural sweetness of her expression  the order of progress in narrow places was such that manuela rode behind pedro and in front of lawrence quashy bringing up the rear  in more open places the young englishman used occasionally to ride up abreast of manuela and endeavour to engage her in conversation  he was to say truth very much the reverse of what is styled a ladys man and had all his life felt rather shy and awkward in female society but being a sociable kindly fellow he felt it incumbent on him to do what in him lay to lighten the tedium of the long journey to one who he thought must naturally feel very lonely with no companions but men  besides he whispered to himself she is only an indian and of course cannot construe my attentions to mean anything so ridiculous as lovemaking so i will speak to her in a fatherly sort of way  filled with this idea as the party came out upon a wide and beautiful tableland which seemed like a giant emerald set in a circlet of grand blue mountains lawrence pushed up alongside and said  poor girl i fear that such prolonged riding over these rugged passes must fatigue you  manuela raised her dark eyes to the youths face and with a smile that was very slightthough not so slight but that it revealed a double row of bright little teethshe replied softly  wat you say  oh  i forgot you dont speak english  how stupid i am said lawrence with a blush for he was too young to act the fatherly part well  he felt exceedingly awkward but observing that the girls eyes were again fixed pensively on the ground he hoped that she had not noticed the blush and attempted to repeat the phrase in spanish  what he said it is not possible to set down in that tongue nor can we gratify the reader with a translation  whatever it was manuela replied by again raising her dark eyes for a momentthis time without a smileand shaking her head  poor lawrence felt more awkward than ever  in despair he half thought of making trial of latin or greek when pedro came opportunely to the rescue  looking back he began  senhor armstrong  i think interrupted the youth that you may dispense with senhor  nay i like to use it returned the guide  it reminds me so forcibly of the time when i addressed your good old father thus  well senhor pedro call me what you please  what were you about to say  only that we are now approaching one of the dangerous passes of the mountains where baggagemules sometimes touch the cliffs with their packs and so get tilted over the precipices  but our mules are quiet and with ordinary care we have nothing to fear  the gorge in the mountains which the travellers soon afterwards entered fully justified the guides expression dangerous  it was a wild rugged glen high up on one side of which the narrow pathway woundin some places rounding a cliff or projecting boulder which rendered the passage of the baggagemules extremely difficult  indeed one of the mules did slightly graze a rock with its burden and although naturally surefooted was so far thrown off its balance as to be within a hairsbreadth of tumbling over the edge and being dashed to pieces on the rocks below where a turbulent river rushed tumultuously at the bottom of the glen  one of the snowclad peaks of the higher andes lay right before them one or two guanacosanimals of the lama speciesgazed at them from the other side of the gorge and several illomened vultures wheeled in the sky above as if anticipating a catastrophe which would furnish them with a glorious meal  a most suitable place for the depredations of banditti or fellows like conrad of the mountains i should think said lawrence  bandits are sometimes met with here returned pedro quietly  and what if we should meet with such in a place where there is scarcely room to fight  why then returned the guide with a slight curl of his moustache we should have to try who could fight best in the smallest space  not a pleasant prospect in the circumstances said lawrence thinking of manuela  for some time they rode together in silence but quashy who had overheard the conversation and was of a remarkably combative disposition though the reverse of badtempered or quarrelsome could not refrain from asking  wy de guvmint not hab lots ob sojers an pleece in de mountains to squash de raskils  because government has enough to do to squash the rascals nearer home quashy answered pedro  have a care the track gets rather steep here  he glanced over his shoulder at the indian girl as he spoke  she was riding behind with an air of perfect ease and selfpossession  fall to the rear quashy said pedro  the black obeyed at once and a minute later they turned the corner of a jutting rock which had hitherto shut out from view the lower part of the gorge and the track they were following  the sight that met their view was calculated to try the strongest nerves for there not a hundred paces in advance and coming towards them were ten of the most villainouslooking cutthroats that could be imagined all mounted and heavily armed with carbine sword and pistol  taken completely by surprise the banditsfor such pedro knew them to bepulled up  not so our guide  it was one of the peculiarities and strong points of pedros character that he was never taken by surprise or uncertain what to do  instantly he drew his sword with one hand a pistol with the other and driving his spurs deep into his mule dashed down the steep road at the banditti  in the very act he looked back and in a voice that caused the echoes of the gorge to ring shouted in spanish  come on comrades here they are at last close up  a yell of the most fiendish excitement and surprise from quashywho was only just coming into viewassisted the deception  if anything was wanting to complete the effect it was the galvanic upheaval of lawrences long arms and the tremendous flourish of his longer legs as he vaulted over his mules head left it scornfully behind uttered a roar worthy of an african lion and rushed forward on foot  he grasped his great cudgel for sword and pistol had been utterly forgotten  like a human avalanche they descended on the foe  that foe did not await the onset  panicstricken they turned and went helterskelter down the passall except two who seemed made of sterner stuff than their fellows and hesitated  one of these pedro rode fairly down and sent horse and all over the precipice  lawrences cudgel beat down the guard of the other flattened his sombrero and stopping only at his skull stretched him on the ground  as for those who had fled the appalling yells of quashy as he pursued them scattered to the winds any fagends of courage they might have possessed and effectually prevented their return  so tremendous and sudden was the result that manuela felt more inclined to laugh than cry though naturally a good deal frightened  lawrence and pedro were standing in consultation over the fallen bandit when the negro came back panting from the chase  das wan good job dooed anyhow he said  whats you be do wid him  what would you recommend asked pedro  the negro pointed significantly to the precipice but the guide shook his head  no i cannot kill in cold blood though i have no doubt he richly deserves it  well bind his hands and leave him  it may be weakness on my part but we cant take him on you know  while pedro was in the act of binding the robber a wild shriek as of some one in terrible agony startled them  looking cautiously over the precipice where the sound seemed to come from they saw that the man whom pedro had ridden down was hanging over the abyss by the boughs of a small shrub  his steed lay mangled on the rocks of the river bank at the bottom  there was an agonised expression in the mans countenance which would have touched a heart much less soft than that of lawrence armstrong  evidently the mans power of holding on was nearly exhausted and he could not repress a shriek at the prospect of the terrible death which seemed so imminent  being a practised mountaineer lawrence at once without thought of personal danger and moved only by pity slipped over the crags and descending on one or two slight projections the stability of which even a swiss goat might have questioned reached the bush  a look of fierce and deadly hate was on the robbers face for judging of others by himself he thought no doubt that his enemy meant to hasten his destruction  here catch holdill save you cried lawrence extending his strong right hand  a glance of surprise told that he was understood  the bandit let go the hold of one of his hands and made a convulsive grasp at his rescuer their fingers touched but at the same moment the branch gave way and with a cry of wild despair the wretched man went headlong down  not however to destruction  the effort he had made threw him slightly to one side of the line which his horse had taken in its fall  the difference was very slight indeed yet it sufficed to send him towards another bush lower down the cliff  still the height he had to fall would have ensured the breaking of all his bones if the bush had not hurled him off with a violent rebound  lawrence almost felt giddy with horror  next moment a heavy plunge was heard  the man had fallen into a deep dark pool in the river which was scarce distinguishable from the cliffs above  being fringed with bushes it was impossible to note whether he rose again  lawrence was still gazing anxiously at the pool when something touched his cheek it was a lasso which pedro had quietly dropped over his shoulders  hold fast to it senhor youll never get up without it he said in tones so earnest that the youth became suddenly alive to the great danger of his position  in the haste and anxiety of his descent he had failed to note that one or two of the slight projections on which he had placed his feet had broken away and that therefore a return to the top of the almost perpendicular precipice by the same route was impracticable  even the slight ledge on which he stood and from which the little shrub grew seemed to be crumbling away beneath his great weight  with that feeling of alarm which the sudden and unexpected prospect of instant death brings we presume even to the stoutest hearts lawrence clutched the line convulsively  he was ignorant at that time of the great strength of the south american lasso and hesitated to trust his life entirely to it  pedro guessed his feelings  dont fear to trust it he said many a wild bull it has held four times your size but wait till quashy and i get our feet well fixed well haul you up easily  have you made the end fast cried lawrence looking up and encountering the anxious gaze of the indian maiden  yes massa all fast answered quashy whose look of horror can be more easily imagined than described  hold on then and dont haul  the two men obeyed and the active youth pulled himself up hand over hand making good use in passing of any hollow or projection that afforded the slightest hold for his toes  at the top he was roughly grasped by his rescuers and dragged into safety  poor fellow he exclaimed on reaching the top  well massa said quashy with a broad grin das jist wat is agwine to say but yous too quick for me  i meant the bandit not myself said lawrence looking over the cliff at the pool with an expression of great pity  ha dont be uneasy about him said pedro with a short laugh as he resumed the binding of the stunned robber  if hes killed or drowned hes well out o the way  if he has escaped hell be sure to recover and make himself a pest to the neighbourhood for many a day to come no no my good man its of no use you neednt try it  the latter part of this speech was in spanish and addressed to the robber who having recovered consciousness had made a sudden struggle to shake off his captor  as suddenly he ceased the effort on finding that the strength of the guide was greatly superior to his own  in another minute pedro stood up having bound the bandits hands in front of him in a manner that rendered any effort at selfliberation impossibleat least in a short space of time  there said pedro to lawrence ill warrant him to lead a harmless life until tomorrow at any rate  as he spoke he drew the mans pistols knife and carbine and handed them to quashy  there he said you may find these useful  meanwhile the robber lay quietly on his back glancing from one to another of the party with looks of hatred that told clearly enough how he would have acted had he been free  turning to him as he was about to remount and quit the scene pedro said very sternly in spanish  you and i have met before friend and you know my powers with the rifle at longrange  if you offer to rise from the spot where you now lie until we have disappeared round that rocky point half a mile along the road you are a dead man  after we have turned the point you may go where you will and do what you please  i might point out that in refraining from cutting your throat i am showing mercy which you dont deservebut it is useless to throw pearls to swine  the man spoke no word of reply though he did look a little surprised as the party left him and rode away  would it not have been safer to have bound his hands behind his back asked lawrence  no doubt it would but he is secure enough for our purpose as he is if i had bound him as you suggest he would have been almost certain to perish being quite unable to help himself  as it is he can use his tied hands to some extent and by perseverance in sawing the lines against sharp rocks he will set himself free at last  by that time however we shall be beyond his reach  from time to time they all glanced over their shoulders as they rode along but the bound man did not stir  after they had passed beyond the point of rock before referred to lawrences curiosity prompted him to turn back and peep round  the bandit had already risen from the ground and could be seen walking as quickly as circumstances permitted up the track by which they had just descended  in a few minutes his tall figure was seen to pause for a brief space at the summit of the pass  then it disappeared on the other side into the gloomy recesses of the mountains    chapter four  in which quashy is communicative and an enemy is turned into a friend  the pass which our travellers had just crossed merely led them over a mountain chain which may be described as the peruvian cordillera beyond it lay a fruitful valley of considerable extent which terminated at the base of the great range or backbone of the andes  beyond this again lay another valley of greater extent than the first which was bounded by a third range or cordillera of inferior height the eastern slopes of which descended on one hand in varying undulations to the dense forests of equatorial brazil on the other by easy gradations to the level pampas or plains which extend for hundreds of miles through the lands of the argentine confederation to the atlantic  two mountain passes therefore were still to be crossed and lawrence armstrong began to think that if things went on as they had begun a pretty lively experience probably lay before them  but in this he was mistaken at least as regarded banditti though in some other respects the journey was not quite devoid of stirring incidentsas we shall see  we have said that the goodnature of the young englishman induced him to attempt conversation with the indian girl and at first manuela appeared to be amused if not interested by his unsuccessful efforts but after one of these futile attempts pedro made some remarks to the girl in the indian tongue and in a tone of remonstrance which had the effect of rendering her more silent and grave than before  lawrence therefore finally ceased to address her though his natural gallantry prompted him to offer assistance when it seemed necessary and to accost her with a hearty goodnight and goodmorning each day  as pedro in his capacity of guide usually rode a few paces in advance and was frequently in a silent abstracted mood lawrence was thus thrown almost entirely on the negro for companionship  although the young englishman may not have estimated his company very highly nothing could have been more satisfactory to quashy who with delight expressed in every wrinkle and lineament of his black visage fully availed himself of his opportunities  o massa lawrie he exclaimed at the close of one of their conversations how i does lub to talk ob de ole times when me an you was play togidder  yes its very nice to recall old times answered lawrence with a halfsuppressed yawn for they had by that time gone over the old times so often that the novelty had rather worn off  yes bery nice repeated quashy with gleaming eyes when i tink ob de ole fadder an de ole mill an de ole fun what me an you carried onoh my heart goes like to bust  dont let it bust here whatever you do quashy for youll need all the heart you possess to carry you safely over these mountain passes  quashy opened his huge mouth shut his eyes and went off in a high falsettohis usual mode of laughing  he always laughed at lawrences little jokes whether good or bad insomuch that the youth finally abstained from jesting as much as possible  i did not know continued lawrence that there were so many robbers about  pedro tells me that the mountains are swarming with them just now  ho yis massa plenty ob rubbers eberywhar said quashy with a nod more nor nuff ob dem  you see massa chili an proos afightin wid each oder jus now  what deys fightin about no mortial knows an whats more nobody cares  i spose one say

when red injin savages  have a care quashy what you say about indians  ive warned you once already  o massa said the poor black with a look of almost superhuman penitence i beg your pardn  is quite

exaggerate about ten more afore he cut his way troo an scaped to de hills  oh hes an awrful man  truly he must be very awful if all you relate of him be true said lawrence and i sincerely trust that if we fall in with him we may find him friendly  now i shall ride forward and ask pedro if we are far from our haltingplace  this abrupt change of subject was usually understood by the amiable negro to mean that our herowhom he persisted in regarding as his masterhad had enough of his conversation at that time so he reined back his mule while lawrence pushed forward  to his question pedro replied that he expected to reach the next sleepingplace very soon  it will not be as luxurious as the last he said but doubtless one who has traversed the mountains of scotland is prepared to rough it in south america  you speak as if you were yourself somewhat acquainted with the scottish mountains  so i am senhor replied the guide  i had clambered up ben nevis while i was yet a little boy  surely you are not a scot said lawrence with a quick glance  no i am not a scot senhor  to have travelled in a country does not render one a native else might i claim england ireland and switzerland as my native lands  see yonder lies the little farm where i hope to put up for the night  he pointed as he spoke to the head of the glen or valley which was somewhat narrower and more gloomy than the vales through which they had ridden in the earlier part of the day  since crossing the first cordillera on the pacific side of the andes they had indeed traversed a great variety of country  in some places the land was rocky and comparatively barren  in others where the peculiar form of the mountains sheltered the tablelands the country was fertile and numerous farms dotted the landscape but as they ascended higher on the main chain the farms became fewer until they finally disappeared and an occasional hut with a mere patch of cultivated ground was all that remained in the vast solitudes to tell of the presence of man  it was to one of these huts that pedro now directed his companions attention  a most suitable place for the abode of banditti remarked lawrence as they advanced up the winding path  and many a time do the bandits lodge there returned pedro  of course robbers of the andes do not go about with placards on their backs announcing their profession to all the world and as long as they behave themselves farmers are bound to regard them as honest men  you said if i heard rightly observed lawrence that you had formerly met with the rascal whom we let off the other day  yes i know him well  one of the worst men in the land  im almost sorry we did not shoot him but i never could take human life in cold blood even when that life had been forfeited over and over again however hes sure to get his deserts sooner or later  then he is not conrad of the mountains whom you mentioned to me lately  no conrad is a very different stamp of manthough he has not too much to boast of in the way of character if all thats said of him be true the man we let go is a gaucho of the pampas named cruz  he delights in war and has fought in the armies of chili peru and the argentine confederation without much regard to the cause of quarrel  in fact wherever fighting is going on cruz is sure to be there  lately he has taken to the mountains and now fights for his own hand  and the other poor fellow who went over the precipice asked lawrence did you know him  i knew him slightly  antonio is his name i think but he is a villain of no notean inferior bandit though quite equal to his captain no doubt in selfishness and cruelty  on arriving at the hut or small farm at the head of the valley they found its owner a burly goodhumoured creole alone with his mother an old woman whose shrivelledup appearance suggested the idea of a mummy partially thawed into life  she was busy cooking over a small fire the smoke of which seemed congenial to herjudging from the frequency with which she thrust her old head into it while inspecting the contents of an iron pot  there was plenty of room for them the host said with an air of profound respect for pedro whom he saluted as an old acquaintance  the house had been full two days before but the travellers had gone on and the only one who remained was a poor man who lay in an outhouse very sick  who is he asked pedro as he assisted manuela to alight  i know not senhor replied the host  he is a stranger who tells me he has been robbed  i can well believe it for he has been roughly handled and there are some wellknown bandits in the neighbourhood his injuries would not have been so serious however if he had not caught a fever from exposure  indeed returned the guide who however seemed more interested in unsaddling his mules than in listening to the account of the unfortunate man was it near this that he fell in with the bandits  no senhor it was far to the west  the travellers who brought him on said they found him almost insensible on the banks of a stream into which he appeared to have fallen or been thrown  pedro glanced at lawrence  hear you that senhor  my spanish only suffices to inform me that some one has been robbed and injured  explaining fully what their host had said pedro advised lawrence to visit the stranger in his medical character  my friend is a doctor he said turning to the host take him to the sick man for myself i will put up the mules and then assist the old mother for mountain air sharpens appetite  in a rude tumbledown hut close to the main building lawrence found his patient  he lay stretched in a corner on a heap of straw in a state of great exhaustionapparently dyingand with several bandages about his cut and bruised head and face  the first glance told lawrence that it was antonio the robber whom he had tried to rescue but he carefully concealed his knowledge and bending over the man addressed him as if he were a stranger  the start and look of surprise mingled with alarm on the robbers face told that he had recognised lawrence but he also laid restraint on himself and drew one of the bandages lower down on his eyes  feeling his pulse lawrence asked him about his food  he got little he said and that little was not good the people of the farm seemed to grudge it  my poor man said lawrence in his bad spanish they are starving you to death  but ill see to that  he rose and went out quickly  returning with a basin of soup he presented it to the invalid who ate it with relish  then the man began to relate how he had been attacked a few days before by a party of robbers in one of the mountain passes who had cut the throats of all his party in cold blood and had almost killed himself when he was rescued by the opportune arrival of some travellers  lawrence was much disgusted at first by the mans falsehood  observing the poor fellows extreme weakness however and his evident anxiety lest he should be recognised the feeling changed to pity  laying his hand gently on the mans shoulder he said with a look of solemnity which perchance made up to some extent for the baldness of the phraseology  antonio tell not lies you are dying  the startled man looked at his visitor earnestly  am i dying he asked in a low tone  you are perhaps i know not  i will save you if possible  these words were accompanied by a kind look and a comforting pat on the shoulder which it may be did more for the sick man than the best of physic  at all events the result was a sudden grasp of the hand and a look of gratitude which spoke volumes  the robber was about to give vent to his feelings in speech when the door opened and the burly host putting his head in announced that supper was ready  giving his patient another reassuring pat the young doctor left him and returned to the banquetinghall of the mountain farm where he found that manuela pedro and quashy were more or less earnestly engaged with the contents of the iron pot    chapter five  lawrence and quashy become flosuffical and they camp out beside the giants castle  while the party were at supper the first gusts of a storm which had for some time been brewing shook the little hut and before they had all fallen into the profound slumber which usually followed their days journey a heavy gale was howling among the mountain gorges with a noise like the roaring of a thousand lions  for two days the gale raged so furiously that travellingespecially in the higher regions of the andesbecame impossible  the indian girl pedro and the negro bore their detention with that stoicism which is not an infrequent characteristic of mountaineers guides and savages  as for our hero he devoted himself and all his skill to his patientto which duty he was the more reconciled that it afforded him a good opportunity at once for improving his spanish and pointing out to the bandit the error of his ways  to do the man justice he seemed to be fully sensible of the young doctors kindness and thanked him with tears in his eyes not only for his previous intention to save him from the tremendous fall over the cliff but for his subsequent efforts to alleviate the evil consequences thereof  it mattered nothing to the great warmhearted loosejointed englishman that when he mentioned these hopeful signs in his patient to pedro that worthy shook his head and smiled sarcastically or that quashy received the same information with a closing of the eyes and an expansion of the jaws which revealed the red recesses of his throat to their darkest deeps  lawrence being a man of strong opinions was not to be shaken out of them either by sarcasm or goodhumoured contempt  turning to the indian girl for sympathy he related the matter to her at a time when the other inhabitants of the hut had gone out and left them alone  you seemanuela he said with the frown of meditation on his brow and his eyes fixed on the ceiling i have no belief in the very common idea that there is a soft spot in the heart of every man however bad but i do believe that the heart of the very worst of men may be made soft by the spirit of god and that he employs us who call ourselves christians as his agents in bringing about the result  it is quite possible that i may have been thrown in the way of this robber for the very purpose of touching his heart through kindnessgods own motivepowerand that the spirit will soften his heart to receive the touch  he paused and withdrawing his gaze from the ceiling observed that the girls eyes were fixed on his face with an expression of perplexity and earnestness  it then suddenly occurred to him that having spoken in english she could not have understood him  but you do look as if you had some idea of what i have been saying manuela  have you  si senhor some was the reply as she dropped her eyes with an embarrassed look and blushed so as to make her pretty brown face look alarmingly red  endeavouring to convey the same ideas through the medium of spanish lawrence made such a bungle of it that manuela instead of expressing sympathy began to struggle so obviously with her feelings that the poor englishman gave up the attempt and goodnaturedly joined his companion in a little burst of laughter  they were in the midst of this when the door opened and quashy entered  you pears to be jolly observed the genial negro with every wrinkle of his black visage ready to join in sympathetically was de jok a desprit good un  not very desperate quashy said lawrence it was only my bad spanish which made manuela laugh  if you had been here to interpret we might have got on better with our philosophical discourse  o massa returned the blacksolemn remonstrance both in manner and tone putting to sudden flight the beaming look of sympathydont speak of me terpretin spinich  nebber could take kindly to dat stuff ob course i kin talk wid de peons an de gauchos whose convsation am mostly bout grub an hosses an cattle an dollars an murder but when i tries to go in for flosuffy an sitch like i breaks down altogidder  at this point the indian girls tendency to laugh increased but whether because of fresh views of the absurdity of what had passed or because of some faint perception of the negros meaning lawrence had no power to decide  i should have thought quashy he said with a return of his wonted gravity that a man of a thoughtful and contemplative turn of mind like you would have acquired the power of expressing almost any idea in spanish by this time  tank you for de complment massa replied quashy but i not so clebber as you tink  der am some tings in flosuffy dat beats me  when i tries to putt em afore oder peepil in spinich i somehow gits de brainpan into sitch a conglomeration ob fumbustication dat i not able to see quite clar what i mean myselfdough ob course i knows dat im right  indeed  yis but de great consolation i has is dat de peepil im talkin to dont onderstand me a mossel better nor myself an ob course as noting in de wurl could show dem dey was wrong it dont much matter  that is good philosophy at all events  isnt it manuela asked lawrence in spanish  si senhor replied the girl with sparkling eyes and a dazzling display of little teeth which seemed to indicate that she fully appreciated what was said  strange thought lawrenceso grave and pensive yet at times so sprightly so intelligent yet of course so ignorant so very brown and yet so pretty  what a pity she is not white  he only said however with a sigh is the gale abating quashy  to which the negro replied with a responsive sigh yis massait am  after two days delay our travellers were enabled to proceed  while their host was busy saddling the mules lawrence took pedro aside  i am anxious about that bandit he said  it is not his power of recovering i am afraid of but our hosts willingness to take care of him  have you not spoken to him about it senhor and paid him in advance like the good samaritan  truly i have but that does not secure fidelity in our host and the mans life may depend on his treatment during the next few days  i almost wish that we might delay our journey a little  that cannot be returned pedro with decision  besides it is unnecessary for i have spoken to our host and told him to take good care of the fellow  lawrence could scarcely forbear smiling at the quiet assurance with which pedro spoke  surely he said you cannot count on his being influenced by your commands after you are gone  yes senhor i can count on that for he knows me and i occasionally pass this way  pedro turned away as he spoke and went towards the mules the fastenings of whose loads he carefully inspected  lawrence went to look after his own animal with his mind much relieved for the manner of pedro was such as to inspire irresistible almost blind confidence  during the first mile or two as they rode along our hero puzzled himself in a vain attempt to analyse the cause of this confidence  was it the result of that imperturbable selfpossession and invariable readiness of resource which marked the guide or was it the stern truthfulness of his dark eyes coupled with the retiring modesty and gravity of his demeanour  perhaps it was the union of these characteristics  he could not tell  while thus engaged in profound thought he was roused by manuela riding alongside of him and pointing upwards with animated looks while she exclaimed  seelooksenhor  much surprised for this was the first time during the journey that the girl had ventured to attract his attention the youth looked in the direction indicated and certainly the view that met his eyes was calculated to banish not only the surprise but all other feelings save those of admiration of nature and reverence for natures god  they had just rounded one of those rocky bluffs which so frequently interrupted their view during their upward journey and had come upon a scene which they could not find words adequately to describe  as interjectional phrases alone could indicate something of their emotions to each other so fragmentary sentences alone will convey a faint semblance of the truth to the intelligence of the reader  mountains glens and mighty cliffs hideous precipices and yawning gulfs snowclad summits high above them and rockriven gorges far below  distance upon distance ranging backward and upward to infinity where all was mingled with cloudland sunlit here darkest shadowed therewildness weirdness grandeur and magnificence everywhere  in the immediate foreground the serpentine path wound upward among rugged rocks and the riders picking their steps as it were midway up the face of a stupendous precipice looked upward on the left at an apparently summitless wall and downward on the right into an almost bottomless valley through which a river roared as if mad with joy at having escaped its glacierprison though its roaring was softened wellnigh to silence by distance while in appearance it seemed little larger than a silver thread  i could almost believe that to be a giants castle remarked lawrence pointing to the opposite side of the ravine where a huge perpendicular mountain of porphyry was so broken into turrets towers and battlements that it was difficult except for its size to believe it other than the work of man  there were even holes and formations about it that had the appearance of antique windows gates and drawbridges  yes it is a strange place said the guide checking his mule moreover we must spend the night under its shadow for it is impossible to reach a better place of shelter tonight and by good fortune yonder is something fresh for supper  pedro pointed to a spot about seven or eight hundred yards distant where a group of guanacos stood gazing at the intruders with profound attention  how will you get near enough for a shot asked lawrence they will be gone before you can get across the ravine and there is little or no cover  you shall see said pedro cocking his rifle  butbut no weapon short of a cannon will carry so farat least with accuracy exclaimed lawrence in surprise for at the time of which we write breechloaders and the longrange weapons of precision had not been introduced in those regions  indeed the armies of south america and of europe also still slew each other with the familiar brown bess and the clumsy flintlock at that time  pedro paid no attention to the remark but dismounting slowly raised the rifle to his shoulder  the guide was one of those men who seem to live in advance of their age  he had thought out and carried out in a roughandready manner ideas which have since been scientifically reduced to practice  being well aware that any projectile is drawn downward in its flight by the law of gravitation and that if you want to hit a distant point you must aim considerably above it he had by careful experiment found out how high above an object at a given distance one must aim in order to hit and by constant practice in judging distance as well as in taking aim above his mark he had attained to such skill as a longrange marksman that his friends almost believed it impossible for game to get beyond the range of his deadly weapon and foes never felt easy till they were entirely out of his sight  the comparative slowness too of the flintlock in discharging a rifle had necessitated in him a degree of steadiness not only while taking aim but even after pulling the trigger which rendered him what we might term statuesque in his action as he levelled his piece  for a few seconds the rock beside him was not more steady  then the cliffs burst into a fusillade of echoes and the guanacos leaped wildly up the mountainside leaving one of their number on the rocks behind them  it was some time before the young englishman could get over his astonishment at this feat for pedro had pointed his weapon so high that he did not appear to be aiming at the animal at all and he maintained an animated discussion with the mountaineer until they reached a part of the pass which proved to be somewhat dangerous  and here they met with a party of muleteers crossing the mountains in the opposite direction  they were still far above them when first observed descending the same steep and narrow road  we will wait here till they pass said the guide pulling up at a point where the width of the track was considerable  i see by the escort that they carry something of valueprobably bars of silver from one of the mines  they have reached the worst part of the pass  i shouldnt wonder to see one of the mules go overthey often do  and always get killed i suppose said lawrence  not always  now and then they have wonderful escapes but many hundreds have been lost here  see  as he spoke one of the baggagemules of the party touched the cliff with its load  this caused the animal to stagger his hindlegs actually went over the precipice and the loose stones began to roll away from under his hoofs  with his forefeet however still on the narrow track he held on bravely even sticking his nose on the ground so that he had the appearance of holding on by his teeth  two of the peons rushed to render assistance but before they reached him he had slipped and rolled down the awful slope which ended in a sheer perpendicular precipice  here he bounded off into space and next moment fell baggage and all with a tremendous splash into the river  it seemed impossible that the poor animal could have escaped with life but in another moment his head reappeared above water and he made a brave struggle to gain the bank  the current however was too strong for him  down he went below the foaming water his scraggy tail making a farewell flourish as he disappeared  but again his head appeared and once again he struggled for the bank  this time with success for he had been swept into a shallow in which he was able to maintain his foothold and slowly drag himself out of the river  when in safety he stood with drooping head and tail as if in a state of the most thorough dejection at having made such an exhibition of himself  clebber beast shouted quashy who had stood with his ten fingers expanded his great mouth open and his whole emotional soul glaring out of his monstrous eyes  well done echoed lawrence who was scarcely less pleased than his servant  the party now drew near and very striking was their appearancethe variously coloured mules following the bellmare which went in advance as a leader winding slowly down the crooked path and the peons in their picturesque costumes shouting laughing or singing wild snatches of song as they were moved by fury fun or fancy  the men who numbered a dozen or so and were wellarmed were apparently relieved to find that our travellers were not bandits in regard to whom their questions showed that they felt some anxiety  they had witnessed pedros shot from the heights above and looked upon him with no little surprise and much respect as they commented on his power with the rifle  a few questions were asked a few compliments paid and then the two parties passing each other proceeded on their respective ways  crossing the mountain torrent at a rather dangerous ford towards evening pedro led his companions to a spot not far from the ramparts of what lawrence styled the giants castle  it was not an inviting spot at first  there was little pasture for the wearied mules on the almost naked rocks and the stunted trees and gnarled roots told eloquently of the severity of winter in those high regions  there was however a good spring of water and an overarching rock which promised some degree of refreshment and shelter and when firewood was collected a ruddy blaze sent up the kettle put on to boil and several fine cuts of the guanaco set up to roast the feelings of sadness which had at first influenced lawrence were put to flight and he felt more satisfaction in his lodging than he could have experienced if it had been a palatial hotel with its confined air and feather beds and cloying luxuries  there was a species of natural recess in the cliff which pedro screened off as a chamber for manuela while she assisted quashy to prepare the supper  theres nothing like fresh mountain air exclaimed lawrence with a glow of enthusiasm after the first attack on the guanaco steaks had subsided  specially when the said air happens to be quiet and warm and the night fine and the stars bright and the company pleasant added the guide  quashy had a habit when his risible faculties were only gently tickled of shutting his eyes throwing back his head opening his great mouth wide and indulging in a silent laugh  having done so on the present occasion he shut his mouth with a snap and opened his eyes  ho yis he said in a low tone bery nice when it all plisent like now but it am anoder ting when de fresh mountain air goes howlerin an bowlerin about like a wild beast an when it snowses an frozes fit to cut off your noses an shribel up de bery marrow in your bones  oh you got no notion what  hold your tongue quashy interrupted lawrence why your description of such things makes one shiver  let us hope we may have no experience of them and enjoy our comforts while we may  dats true flosuffy massa returned the negro helping himself to more guanaco and offering some on the end of his fork to manuela who accepted the same with her usual ready smile which however on this occasion expanded into an uncontrollable little laugh  lawrence was perplexed and so was quashy for the quiet little indian was not given to giggling at trifles much less to laughing at nothing lawrence observed however that the girl did not reach out her hand with her usual graceful action but on the contrary gave her arm an awkward twist which obliged the negro to stretch needlessly far over towards her in handing the meat  the result was that a pannikin of coffee which quashy had placed on his platethe plate being in his lapbegan to tilt over  before any one could warn him it overturned causing the poor man to spring up with a yell as the hot liquid drenched his legs  of course every one laughed people always do at such mild mishaps  as the coffee was not too hot and there was more in the kettle quashy joined in the laugh while he wiped his garments and afterwards replenished his pannikin  but a new light began to force itself upon lawrence  can it be he thought that she did that on purposethat she saw the pannikin was tilting andno thats impossible  he looked earnestly at the girl  she had recovered her gravity by that time and was quietly eating her supper with downcast eyes impossible he repeated in thought so unlike her and so very unlike the indian character  nevertheless his perplexity remained and when he went to sleep that night after gazing long and earnestly up at the bright stars and at the white summits of the andes which rose in awful grandeur above him he dreamed that while quashy was sitting sound asleep with his head on his knees in front of the fire manuela availed herself of the opportunity to pour an ocean of hot coffee down his back  starting up wide awake at this he found that quashy lay beside him sleeping quietly on his back that pedro was similarly engaged that the indian girl had disappeared into her dormitory that the giants castle looked more splendidly real than ever in the rising moonlight and that no sound was to be heard save the brawling of the escaped river as it fled from its glacierprison to its home in the mighty sea    chapter six  a storm in the mountainsrefuge foundconverse round the fire  the summit of the pass was at last gained and not a moment too soon for the storm which they had experienced a few days before was but the prelude to a gale such as is rarely experienced save in the winter months of the year when most of the mountain passes are closed  it began by mutterings of distant thunder which caused the guide to look round the horizon and up at the sky somewhat anxiously  do you think we shall reach our next shelter before it breaks asked lawrence  i hope so said pedro pausing on a ridge from which an almost illimitable view was had of mountain range and valley in all directions  far over in that direction he continued pointing with his hand lies the land of the incas  you have heard of the incas senhor  yes i have heard of them but cannot say that i am intimately acquainted with their history  it is a strange historya very sad one returned pedro  i will tell you something about it at another time at present it behoves us to push on  there was no question as to that point for just as he spoke a sudden and powerful gust of wind swept quashys straw hat off and sent it spinning gaily along the path  vaulting from his mule with a wild shout the negro gave chase on foot with an amount of anxiety that seemed not justified by the occasion  but as the poet truly puts it things are not what they seem and quashys headpiece which presented much the appearance of a battered old straw hat was in truth an article of very considerable value  it was one of those hats made by the people of south america with a delicate fibre so finely plaited that in texture it resembles fine canvas though in appearance it is like straw  it is exceedingly tough takes a very long time to manufacture and costs many dollarsso many indeed that a hat of the kind is thought worthy of being preserved and left as an heirloom from father to son as long as it lasts  no wonder then that the negro made frantic efforts to regain his propertyall the more frantic that he was well aware if it should pass over one of the neighbouring precipices it would be lost to him for ever  at last a friendly gust sent it into a snowdrift through which quashy plunged and captured it  snow in considerable quantities lay here and there around them in the form of old patches or drifts and this began to be swept up by the fierce wind in spite of its solidity  soon new snow began to fall and mingling with the old drifts rendered the air so thick that it was sometimes difficult to see more than a few yards in advance  lawrence being unused to such scenes began to fear they should get lost in these awful solitudes and felt specially anxious for manuela who despite the vigour of a frame trained as it no doubt had been in all the hardihood incidental to indian camp life seemed to shrink from the fierce blast and to droop before the bitter cold  here put on my poncho said the youth riding suddenly up to the girls side and unceremoniously flinging his ample garment over the slight poncho she already wore  she drew it round her at once and silently accepted the offering with a smile and an inclination of her small head which even in these uncomfortable circumstances were full of grace  why was she born a savage thought the youth with almost petulant exasperation  if she had only been white and civilised i would have wooed and wonat least he added modestly i would have tried to win and wed her in spite of all the opposing world  as it is the thegulf is impassable  you have anticipated me senhor said the guide who had reined in until the rest of the party overtook him  i had halted with the intention of offering my poncho to manuela  poor girl she is a daughter of the warm pampas and unused to the cold of the mountains  he turned to her and said something in the indian tongue which seemed to comfort her greatly for she replied with a look and tone of satisfaction  i have just told her he said to lawrence as they resumed the journey that in half an hour we shall reach a hut of shelter  it is at the foot of a steep descent close ahead and as the wind is fortunately on our backs we shall be partially protected by the hill  surely the place cannot be a farm said lawrence it must be too high up for that  no as you say it is too high for human habitation  the hut is one of those places of refuge which have been built at every two or three leagues to afford protection to travellers when assailed by such snowstorms as that which is about to break on us now  he stopped for the party came at the moment to a slope so steep that it seemed impossible for man or mule to descend  being partly sheltered from the fitful gusts of wind it was pretty clear of snow and they could see that a zigzag track led to the bottom  what made the descent all the more difficult was a loose layer of small stones on which they slipped continually  before they had quite completed the descent the storm burst forth  suddenly dense clouds of snow were seen rushing down from the neighbouring peaks before a hurricane of wind compared with which previous gusts were trifles  come onfastfast shouted the guide looking back and waving his hand  the first deafening roar of the blast drowned the shout but before the snowdrift blinded him lawrence had observed the wave of the hand and the anxious look  dashing the cruel spanish spurs for the first time into the side of his no doubt astonished steed he sprang alongside of manuelas mule seized the bridle and dragged it forward by main force of course the creature objected but the steep road and slipping gravel favoured them so that they reached the bottom in safety  here they found the first of the refugehuts and in a few moments were all safe within its sheltering walls  having been erected for a special purpose the hut was well adapted to resist the wildest storm  it was built of brick and mortar the foundation being very solid and about twelve feet high with a brick staircase outside leading to the doorway  thus the habitable part of the edifice was raised well above the snow  the room was about twelve feet square the floor of brick and the roof arched  it was a dungeonlike place dimly lighted by three loopholes about six inches square and without furniture of any kind  a mark in the wall indicated the place where a small table had originally been fixed but it had been torn down long before as pedro explained by imprisoned and starving travellers to serve for firewood  the remains of some pieces of charred wood lay on the floor where the fire was usually kindled and to pedros great satisfaction they found a small pile of firewood which had been left there by the last travellers  a dismal enough place remarked lawrence looking round after shaking and stamping the snow out of his garments  you have reason to thank god senhor that we have reached it  true senhor pedro and i am not thankless yet do i feel free to repeat that it is a most dismal place  mos horriboble said quashy looking up at the vaulted roof  ay and it could tell many a dismal story if it had a tongue said the guide as he busied himself arranging the saddles and baggage and making other preparations to spend the night as comfortably as circumstances should permit  luckily theres a door this time  is it sometimes without a door then asked lawrence as he assisted in the arrangements while quashy set about kindling a fire  ay the poor fellows who are sometimes stormstaid and starved here have a tendency to use all they can find about the place for firewood  some one has replaced the door however since i was here last  youll find two big nails in the wall manuela he added in indian if you tie one of the baggage cords to them ill give you a rug directly which will make a good screen to cut off your sleeping berth from ours  in a short time quashy had a bright little fire burning with the kettle on it stuffed full of fresh snow the saddles and their furniture made comfortable seats and lounges around it and soon a savoury smell of cooked meat rendered the cold air fragrant while the cheery blaze dispelled the gloom and made a wonderful change in the spirits of all perhaps we should except the guide whose calm grave stern yet kindly aspect rarely underwent much change either in the way of elation or depression whatever the surrounding circumstances might be  his prevailing character reminded one of a rock whether in the midst of a calm or raging seaor of a strong tower whether surrounded by warring elements or by profound calm  need we say that pedros imperturbability was by no means the result of apathy  blow away till you bust your buzzum said quashy apostrophising the gale as he sat down with a beaming display of teeth and spread out his hands before the blaze after having advanced supper to a point which admitted of a pause i don care a buttn how hard you blow now  ah  quashy said the guide shaking his head slowly as seated on his saddle he rolled up a neat cigarette dont be too confident  you little know what sights these four walls have witnessed  true this is not quite the season when one runs much risk of being starved to death but the thing is not impossible  surely said lawrence stretching himself on his saddlecloths and glancing at manuela who was by that time seated on the opposite side of the fire arranging some hard biscuits on a plate surely people have not been starved to death here have they  indeed they haveonly too often senhor  i myself came once to this hut to rescue a party but was nearly too late for most of them were dead  he paused to light his cigarette  the negro after making the door more secure sat down again and gazed at the guide with the glaring aspect of a man who fears but delights in the horrible  manuela letting her clasped hands fall in her lap also gazed at pedro with the intense earnestness that was habitual to her  she seemed to listen  perhaps being unusually intelligent she picked up some information from the guides expressive face  she could hardly have learned much from his speech as her knowledge of english seemed to be little more than yes no and tank you  it was during a change of government senhor said pedro that i chanced to be crossing the mountains  there is usually a considerable row in south america when a change of government takes place  sometimes they cause a change of government to take place in order to get up a considerable row for theyre a lively peoplealmost as fond of fighting as the irish though scarcely so sound in judgment  i had some business on hand on the western side of the cordillera but turned back to give a helping hand to my friends for of course i try never to shirk duty though im not fond of fighting  well when i got to the farm nearest to this hut where we now sit they told me that a tremendous gale had been blowing in the mountains that ten travellers had been snowed up and that they feared they must all have perished since travelling in such weather was impossible  have you made no effort to rescue them  i asked of the farmer  no says he i couldnt get any o my fellows to move because theyve been terrified about a ghost thats been seen up there  what was the ghost like  i asked so he told me that it was a fearful creaturea mulishlooking sort of man who was in the habit of terrifying the arrieros and peons who passed that way but he said they were going to get a priest to put a cross up there and so lay the ghost  meanwhile i said the ten travellers are to be left to starve  its my belief theyre starved already answered the farmer  at this point pedro paused to relight his cigarette and quashy breathed a little more freely  he was a firm believer in ghosts and feared them more than he would have feared an army of redskins or jaguars  indeed it is a question whether quashy could ever have been brought to realise the sensation of fear if it had not been for the existence in his imagination of ghosts  the mere mention of the word in present circumstances had converted him into a sort of human sensitiveplant he gave a little start and glance over his shoulder at every gust of unusual power that rattled the door and had become visibly paler perhaps we should say less black  manuela was evidently troubled by no such fears perhaps because she did not understand the meaning of the word ghost yet she gazed at the speaker in apparently rapt attention  you may believe continued the guide that i was disgusted at their cowardice so to shame them as well as to do what i could for the travellers i loaded a couple of my mules with meat and said i would set off alone  this had the desired effect for three men volunteered to go with me  when we reached the hut we found that six of the ten poor fellows were dead  the bodies of two who had died just before our arrival were lying in the corner over there behind quashy  they were more like skeletons covered with skin than corpses  the four who still lived were in the corner here beside me huddled together for warmth and so worn out by hunger and despair that they did not seem to care at first that we had come to save them  we warmed and fed them however brought them gradually round and at last took them back to the farm they all recovered  during the time they were snowed up the poor fellows had eaten their mules and dogs  i have no doubt that if the ground were clear of snow you would find the bones of these animals scattered about still  this was not a very pleasant anecdote lawrence thought on which to retire to rest so he changed the subject by asking pedro if there were many of the incas still remaining  before he could reply manuela rose and bidding them goodnight in spanish retired to her screenedoff corner  a good many of the incas are still left replied the guide to his companions question and if you were to visit their capital city you would be surprised to see the remains of temples and other evidences of a very advanced civilisation in a people who existed long before the conquest of peru  massa pedro said quashy who would have been glad to have the recollection of ghosts totally banished from his mind is oftin hear ob de incas but i knows noting about dem  who is dey whar dey come fro  it would take a long time quashy to answer these two questions fully nevertheless i think i could give you a roughish outline of a notion in about five minutes if youll promise not to stare so hard and keep your mouth shut  the negro shut his eyes expanded his mouth to its utmost in a silent laugh and nodded his head acquiescently  well then you must know said pedro that in days of oldabout the time that william the conqueror invaded englanda certain manco capac founded the dynasty of the incas  according to an old legend this manco was the son of a white man who was shipwrecked on the coast of peru  he married the daughter of an indian chief and taught the people agriculture architecture and other arts  he must have been a man of great power from the influence he exerted over the natives who styled him the blooming stranger  his hair was of a golden colour and this gave rise to the story that he was a child of the sun who had been sent to rule over the indians and found an empire  another tradition says that manco capac was accompanied by a wife named mama oello huaco who taught the indian women the mysteries of spinning and weaving while her husband taught the arts of civilisation to the men  whatever truth there may be in these legends certain it is that manco capac did become the first of a race of incasor kings or chiefsand it is said laid the foundations of the city of cuzco the remains of which at the present day show the power splendour and wealth to which manco capac and his successors attained  the government of the incas was despotic but of a benignant and patriarchal type which gained the affections of those over whom they ruled and enabled them to extend their sway far and wide over the land so that at the time of the invasion by the spaniards under pizarro the peruvians were found to have reached a high degree of civilisation as was seen by their public worksroads bridges terracegardens fortifications and magnificent buildings and so forth  it is said by those who have studied the matter that this civilisation existed long before the coming of the incas  on this point i can say nothing but no doubt or uncertainty rests on the later history of this race  cuzco on lake titicaca became the capital city of a great and flourishing monarchy and possessed many splendid buildings in spacious squares and streets  it also became the holy city and great temple of the sun to which pilgrims came from all parts of the country  it was defended by a fortress and walls built of stone some blocks of which were above thirty feet long by eighteen broad and six thick  many towns sprang up in the land under good government the people flourished and became rich  they had plenty of gold and silver which they used extensively in the adornment of their temples and palaces  but evil followed in the train of wealth by degrees their simplicity departed from them  their prosperity led to the desire for conquest  then two sons of one of the incas disputed with each other for supremacy and fought  one was conquered and taken prisoner by the other who is reported to have been guilty of excessive cruelties to his relations and caused his brother to be put to death finally in 1532 the spaniards came and accomplished the conquest of perufrom which date not much of peace or prosperity has fallen to the lot of this unhappy land  yes said the guide in conclusion the incas were and some of their descendants still are a very fine race  many of the men are what i call natures gentlemen having thoughtsay and manners too that would grace any society  some of their women also are worthy to  pedro interrupted lawrence eagerly laying his hand on the guides arm for a sudden idea had flashed into his mind  he was rather subject to the flashing of sudden ideas pedro she is a daughter of a chief of the incasis she not a princess of the incas  have i not guessed rightly  he said this in a half whisper and pointed as he spoke to the screen behind which manuela lay  pedro smiled slightly and tipped the ash from the end of his cigarette but made no answer  nay i will not pry into other peoples affairs said lawrence in his usual tone but you once told me she is the daughter of a chief and assuredly no lady in this land could equal her in grace or dignity of carriage and manner to say nothing of modesty which is the invariable evidence  not of high rank interrupted the guide with a quick and slightly sarcastic glance  no but of nobility of mind and heart replied the youth with much enthusiasm  in which feeling he was earnestly backed up by quashy who with eyes that absolutely glowed said  yous right massasure an sartin  modesty am de grandest ting i knows  once i knowed a young nigger gal what libbed near your fadders millsoozn dey calls eran shes so modest sooh  i not kin splain rightlybut i say to er one day when id got my courage screwed up soozn ses i  well ses she  ii lub you ses i more nor myself cause i tink so well ob you  eberybody tinks well ob you soozn  whatwhat i was gitten out o bref by dis time from citement and not knowin what more to say so i ses whatwhat you tink ob youself soozn  nuffin ses she  now wasnt dat modest  it certainly was quashy  couldnt have been more so said pedro and after that we couldnt i think do better than turn in  the fire had by that time burned low and the gale was still raging around them driving the snowdrift wildly against the hut and sometimes giving the door so violent a shake as to startle poor quashy out of sweet memories of soozn into awful thoughts of the ghost that had not yet been laid  each man appropriated a vacant corner of the hut in which to spread his simple couch the negro taking care to secure that furthest from the door  lawrence armstrong thought much over his supposed discovery before falling asleep that night and the more he thought the more he felt convinced that the indian girl was indeed a princess and owed her good looks sweet disposition graceful form and noble carriage to her descent from a race which had at one period been highly civilised when all around them were savage  it was a curious subject of contemplation the colour of his waking thoughts naturally projected itself into the young mans dreams  he was engaged in an interesting anthropological study  he found himself in the ancient capital of the incas  he beheld a princess of great beauty surrounded by courtiers but she was brown he thought what an overwhelming pity it was that she was not white then he experienced a feeling of intense disappointment that he himself had not been born brown  by degrees his thoughts became more confused and less decided in colourwhiteybrown in factand presented a series of complicated regrets and perplexing impossibilities in a vain effort to disentangle which he dropped asleep    chapter seven  things begin to look brighterthe guides story  it was bright day when our travellers awoke but only a dim light penetrated into their dungeonlike dormitory for besides being very small the three windows or loopholes had been so filled up with snow as to shut out much of the light that would naturally have entered  that the gale still raged outside was evident enough to the sense of hearing and sometimes the gusts were so sudden and strong that the little building trembled stout though it was  indeed lawrence at first thought they must be experiencing the shocks of an earthquake a mistake not unnatural in one who besides having had but little experience in regard to such catastrophes knew well that he was at the time almost in the centre of a region celebrated for earthquakes  it was with mingled feelings of interest anxiety and solemnity that he surveyed the scene outside through a hole in the door  it seemed as if an arctic winter had suddenly descended on them  snow completely covered hill and gorge as far as the vision could range but they could not see far for at every fresh burst of the furious wind the restless wreaths were gathered up and whirled madly to the sky or swept wildly down the valleys or dashed with fury against black precipices and beetling cliffs to which they would sometimes cling for a few seconds then falling away would be caught up again by the tormenting gale and driven along in some new direction with intensified violence  no prospect of quitting the hut today observed lawrence turning away from the bewildering scene  none said pedro stretching himself and rising sleepily on one elbow as men are wont to do when unwilling to get up  nebber mind massa lots o grub cried quashy awaking at that moment leaping up like an acrobat and instantly setting about the kindling of the fire  having as quashy truly said lots of grub possessing a superabundance of animal vigour and being gifted with untried as well as unknown depths of intellectual power also with inexhaustible stores of youthful hope our travellers had no difficulty in passing that day in considerable enjoyment despite adverse circumstances but when they awoke on the second morning and found the gale still howling and the snow still madly whirling all except pedro began to express in word and countenance feelings of despondency  manuela did not speak much it is true but she naturally looked somewhat anxious  lawrence began to recall the fate of previous travellers in that very hut and his countenance became unusually grave whereupon quashywhose nature it was to conform to the lead of those whom he loved and in conforming outrageously to overdo his partlooked in his young masters face and assumed such an aspect of woeful depression that his visage became distinctly oval though naturally round  observing this lawrence could not restrain a short laugh whereupon true as the compass to the pole the facile quashy went right round his chin came up his cheeks went out his eyes opened with hopeful sheen and his thick lips expanded into a placid grin  there is no cause for alarm observed pedro who had risen to assist in preparing breakfast  no doubt it is the worst storm i ever met with or even heard of at this season of the year but it cannot last much longer and whatever happens it cant run into winter just now  as if to justify the guides words the hurricane began to diminish in violence and the pauses between blasts were more frequent and prolonged  when breakfast was over appearances became much more hopeful and before noon the storm had ceased to rage  taking advantage of the change without delay they loaded the packmules saddled mounted and set forth  to many travellers it would have been death to have ventured out on such a trackless waste but pedro knew the road and the landmarks so thoroughly that he advanced with his wonted confidence  at first the snow was very deep and despite their utmost care they once or twice strayed from the road and were not far from destruction  as they descended however the intense cold abated and when they came out upon occasional tablelands they found that the snowfall there had been much less than in the higher regions also that it had drifted off the road so much that travelling became more easy  that night they came to a second hutofrefuge and next day had descended into a distinctly warmer region on the eastern slopes of the great range over which they travelled from day to day with ever increasing comfort  sometimes they put up at outlying mountain farms and were always hospitably received sometimes at small hamlets or villages where they could exchange or purchase mules and not unfrequently they encamped on the wild mountain slopes with the green trees or an overhanging cliff or the open sky to curtain them and the voices of the puma and the jaguar for their lullaby  strange to say in crossing the higher parts of the andes not one of the party suffered from the rarity of the air  many travellers experience sickness giddiness and extreme exhaustion from this cause in those regions  some have even died of the effects experienced at the greater heights yet neither manuela nor lawrence nor quashy was affected in the slightest degree  we can assign no reason for their exemptioncan only state the fact  as for the guide he was in this matteras indeed he seemed to be in everythinginvulnerable  one afternoon as they rode along a mountain track enjoying the sunshine which at that hour was not too warm lawrence pushed up alongside of the guide  it seems to me he said that we are wandering wonderfully far out of our way just now  we have been going due north for several days at least so my pocket compass tells me and if my geography is not greatly at fault our backs instead of our faces are turned at present towards buenos ayres  i do not wish to pry into your secrets senhor pedro but if it is not presuming too much i should like to know when we shall begin to move in the direction of our journeys end  there is neither presumption nor impropriety in your wish returned the guide  i told you at starting that we should pursue a devious route for reasons which are immaterial to you but there is no reason why i should not explain that at present i am diverging for only a few miles from our track to visit a localitya cottagewhich is sacred to me  after that we will turn eastward until we reach the headwaters of streams that will conduct us towards our journeys end  with this explanation he was obliged to rest content for pedro spoke like one who did not care to be questioned  indeed there was an unusually absent air about him seeing which lawrence drew rein and fell back until he found himself alongside of quashy  always readynay eagerfor sympathetic discourse the negro received his young master with a bland expansive we might almost say effusive smile  well massa hows you gittin along now  pretty well quashy  how do you  oh fussrate massaonly considrable obercome wid surprise  what surprises you  de way wes agwine to be sure  look dar  he pointed towards the towering mountain peaks and wild precipices that closed in the narrow glen or gorge up which they were slowly proceeding  in all our trabels wes nebber come to a place like dat  it looks like de fag end ob creation  you couldnt git ober de mountaintops cept you had wings an you couldnt climb ober de prespisses cep you was a monkey or a skirlthough it am bery lubly no doubt  the negros comments were strictly correct though somewhat uncouthly expressed  the valley was apparently surrounded in all directions by inaccessible precipices and the white peaks of the andes towered into the skies at its head  within rugged setting lay a fine stretch of undulating land diversified by crag and hillock lake and rivulet with clustering shrubs and trees clinging to the cliffs and clothing the mountain slopes in rich and in many places soft luxuriance  it was one of those scenes of grandeur and loveliness in profound solitude which tend to raise in the thoughtful mind the perplexing but not irreverent question why did the good and bountiful creator form such places of surpassing beauty to remain for thousands of years almost if not quite unknown to man  for as far as could be seen no human habitation graced the mountainsides no sign of cultivation appeared in the valley though myriads of the lower animals sported on and in the waters among the trees and on the ground  perchance man overestimates his own importanceat least underrates that of the animal kingdom below himand is too apt to deem everything in nature wasted that cannot be directly or indirectly connected with himself  is all that glows in beauty in the wilderness doomed to blush unseen  is all the sweetness expended on the desert air wasted  as the guide rode slowly forward he glanced from side to side with thoughtful yet mournful looks as if his mind were engaged in meditating on some such insoluble problems  as he neared the head of the valley however he seemed to awake from a trance suddenly put spurs to his mule and went off at a canter  the rest of the party followed at some distance behind but at so slow a pace compared with that of the guide that the latter was soon lost to sight among the trees  somewhat surprised at his unusual state of mind lawrence pushed on and soon reached an open glade which showed some signs of having been cultivated  at the end of it stood a pretty little cottage in front of which pedro was standing motionless with clasped hands and drooping head  lawrence hesitated to disturb him but as quashy had no such hesitations and rode smartly forward his companions followed  pedro turned with a grave look as they came up and said  my home  i bid you welcome  your home echoed lawrence in surprise  ay a happy home it once wasbutdesolate enough now  come we will sleep here tonight  unload the mules quashy and kindle a fire  go into the room on the right manuela  you will find a couch and other civilised comforts there  senhor armstrong will you come with me  without even awaiting a reply the guide walked smartly into the bushes in rear of his lonely dwelling followed by our hero  in a few minutes they reached a mound or hillock which had been cleared of trees and underwood and from the summit of which one could see over the treetops and the cottage roof away down the valley to the horizon of the tablelands beyond  it was a lovely spot and as lawrence saw it that quiet sunny afternoon was suggestive only of peace and happiness  there was a rustic bower on the mound in which a roughlyconstructed seat was fixed firmly to the ground  in front of the bower was a grave with a headstone on which was carved the single word mariquita  lawrence looked at his companion but refrained from speech on observing that he seemed to be struggling with strong emotion  in a few seconds pedro having mastered his feelings turned and said in a tone that betrayed nothing save profound sadness  the body of my wife lies there  her pure spirit thank god is with its maker  lawrences power of sympathy was so great that he hesitated to reply fearing to hurt the feelings of one for whom by that time he had come to entertain sincere regard  he was about to speak when pedro raised his head gently as if to check him  sit beside me senhor he said seating himself on the rustic seat already referred to  you have from our first meeting given me your confidence so frankly and freely that the least i can do is to give you mine in returnas far at least as that is possible  you are the first human being i have invited to sit there since mariquita left me shall i tell you something of my history senhor armstrong  of course lawrence assented with a look of deep interest  well then said pedro it may perhaps surprise you to learn that i am an irishman  to this lawrence replied with a slight smile that he was not very greatly surprised seeing that the perplexing character of that race was such as to justify him in expecting almost anything of them  im not sure whether to take that remark as complimentary or otherwise returned pedro however the fighting tendency with which my countrymen are credited has departed from me  i wont quarrel with you on the point  at the age of sixteen i was sent to america to seek my fortune  my mother i never knew  she died when i was a child  my father died the year after i left home  how i came to drift here it would be difficult as well as tedious to explain  many of the men with whom i have chummed in years gone by would have said that it was chance which led me to south america  i never could agree with them on this point  the word chance fitly describes the conditions sometimes existing between man and man and is used in scripture in the parable of the good samaritan but there can be no such thing as chance with the almighty  i must have been led or guided here  at all events hither i came and wandered about for some years with that aimless indifference to the future which is but too characteristic of youthcontent to eat and sleep and toil so that i might enjoy life and get plenty of excitement  i went to peru first and of course i joined in the fights that were so frequently stirred up between that country and its neighbour chili  a very little of that however sufficed  the brutal ferocity of the soldiery with whom i was mixed up and their fearful disregard of age sex infirmity or helpless childhood during war disgusted me so much that i finally cut the army and took to hunting and doing a little trade between the countries lying on the east and west sides of the andes  it was while thus engaged that i became acquainted with your good father senhor armstrong who has more than once helped me over financial difficulties and set me on my legs  at last came the grand crisis of my life  one evening when travelling over the pampas of la plata i with a dozen gauchos arrived at a posthouse where we meant to put up for the night  on coming in sight of it we saw that something was wrong for there were a number of indians fighting about the door  on seeing us they made off but one who was in the house struggling with the postmaster did not observe the flight of his comrades or could not get clear of his enemy  we all went madly after the savages  as i was about to pass the door of the house i heard a woman shriek  the gauchos paid no attention but passed on  i glanced inside and saw the indian in the act of cutting a mans throat while a girl strove wildly to prevent him  you may be sure i was inside in a moment and i brained the savage with the butt of a pistol  but it was too late  the knife had already done its work and the poor man only lived long enough to bless his daughter who covered with her fathers blood sank fainting on the floor  it was my first meeting with mariquita  around her continued pedro in deepening tones lay her mother and two brothersall slaughtered  i will not describe the harrowing scene i tried to comfort the poor girl and we took her on with us to the next post where the postmasters wife attended to her  on seeing her next morning i felt that my lifes happiness or sorrow lay in her hands  she was innocence simplicity beauty combined with artless gratitude she grasped and kissed my hand regarding me she said as her deliverer and one who would have saved her father if he had been in time  often before had my comrades twitted me with my indifference to the female sex  to say truth i had myself become impressed with the feeling that i was born to be one of the old bachelors of the worldand i cannot say that the doom gave me much concern  but nowwell if you understand me senhor i need not explain and if you dont understand explanation is useless  mariquita was left alone in the wide world  i would not for all the gold and silver of peru have spoken of love to her at that time but i made arrangements with the postmaster and his wife to take care of the poor girl till i should return  in time i did return  she accepted me  we were married and i brought her up here for i wanted no society but hers  i was content to live in absolute solitude with her  she was much of the same mind dear girl but god had touched her heart and in her sweet talkwithout intending it or dreaming of itshe showed me how selfish i was in thinking only of our own happiness and caring nothing for the woes or the joys of our fellowmen  my conscience reproached me and i began to think how i could manage to live a less selfish life but before i could make up my mind what course to follow an event occurred which caused delay  a little girl was sent to us  i called her mariquita of course and thought no more of leaving our happy home in the mountains  for five years we remained here and the little mariquita grew to be an angel of light and beauty like her mother in all respects except that she was very fair with curly golden hair  about that time war broke outdoubly accursed war  one night a band of deserters came and attacked my cottage  it had always been well prepared for anything of the sort with bolts and bars and shutters and even flanking loopholes as well as plenty of firearms and ammunition but the party was too numerous  the villains forced the door in spite of me and fired a volley before making a rush  from that moment i remembered nothing more until i recovered and found my head supported on the knee of an old man  i knew him at once to be a poor lonely old hunter who ranged about in the mountains here and had paid us occasional visits  when he saw i was able to understand him he told me that he had come suddenly on the villains and shot two of them and that the others perhaps thinking him the advanceguard of a larger party had taken fright and made off  but he said in a low hesitating tone mariquita is dead  i sprang up as if i had been shot but instantly fell again for my leg had been broken  i had seen enough however  my beloved one lay dead on the floor not far from me with a bullet through her brain  and now added pedro pointing in deep despondency to the little mound at their feetshe lies there  not so my friend said lawrence in a low but earnest tone as he grasped the mans hand it is only her dust that lies there and even that is precious in the sight of her lord  thank you senhor for reminding me returned pedro but when the memory of that awful night is strong upon me my faith almost fails  no wonder rejoined lawrence but what of the child  ah that is what i asked the old hunter returned pedro  he started up and searched high and low but could not find her  then he went out calling her by name loudly and searched the bushes  then he returned with a wild look and said the robbers must have taken her awayhe would pursue  i knew it would be useless for the scoundrels were mounted and the old hunter was on foot but i let him go and was not surprised when two hours later he returned quite exhausted  it is in vain he said  yet if i could have come up with them i would have died for her  i was long ill after that  a good while they say i was out of my mind but old ignacio nursed me through  he also buried mariquita where she now lies  the guide paused  and the child asked lawrence anxiously  i have sought her far and wide year after year over mountain and plain  she may be deadshe may be alivebut i have never seen her nor heard of her from that day to this  your story is a very very sad one said lawrence his face expressing the genuine sympathy which he felt  may i askare your wanderings mere haphazard  have you no idea who they were that stole your little one or where they went to  none whatever  the broken leg you know prevented my commencing the search at once and when i was able to go about i found that all trace of the band was gone  no wonder for the country was at war at the time and many marauding parties had traversed the land since then  ii shrink said lawrence with some hesitation from even the appearance of unkindness but i cannot help expressing the fear that this vague undirected wandering will be useless  it would be so returned pedro if god did not direct all human affairs  if it be his will i shall yet find my child on earth  if not i shall find her abovewith her mother  in our intercourse senhor i have observed in you a respect for gods word  is it not written commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he will bring it to pass  most true replied lawrence feeling the reproof yet god works by means  if we do not take the right means we cannot expect to attain our end however much we may trust  right senhor and i have taken the only means open to me  since i cannot give direction to my search i search everywhere  fortunately my business permits of this and also of doing a little service to my fellowmen as i go on my way  periodically i return here to resthe pointed to the little moundand when my powers begin to wane either through disease or age it is my purpose if god permit to return and die beside mariquitas grave    chapter eight  a new acquaintance and a change of scene  on their way back to the cottage they heard dogs barking and a man talking to them  next moment these came in sight  the old hunter exclaimed pedro hastening forward with evident pleasure to meet his friend  it was equally evident that the old man was as much pleased to meet pedro for they grasped each others hands with hearty goodwill  what news asked the old man eagerly as he held up a hand to check the dogs which were leaping round him  pedro shook his head sadly and the expression of the old man became grave  the question referred to pedros search for his lost child  it had long been the first inquiry when these two met after a separation the old man seemed never to lose hope but he had become so accustomed to the reply that his despondency was now of short duration  he had known and loved the child in days gone byhad helped the mother in cultivating her gardenplot and had gone out hunting with the father many a time  he was a finelooking man above seventy years of age with irongrey hair turning in some places to pure white  the hunters spare though still upright figure showed that he must have been a powerful man in his youth and the deeplymarked wrinkles about his mouth and eyes told eloquently that he was a kind one  round his shoulders were twined the cords of the heavy bolas or balls with which he sometimes felled at other times entangled his prey  these balls were covered with clotted blood  he carried a short gun in his hand and a large knife was stuck in his belt  the dogs that leaped around him were a strange packsome being very large some very small and all of different breeds  a few of them had been lamed and all were more or less marked by the wounds received from jaguars and pumas  you expected me ignacio said pedro after the first greetings were over  nonot quite so soon but i chanced to be wandering about in the mountains and came down to take a look at the old place to see that all was right  you know i am fond of our old haunts and never stay long away from them but i did not expect to find you here  the hunter spoke in spanish and lawrence found to his satisfaction that although he by no means understood all that was said he had already improved so much in that tongue through his frequent efforts to converse with manuela that he could follow the drift at least of the hunters remarks  i have come back sooner than i intended returned pedro for war is a wonderful hastener as well as dictator of events but i have to thank war for having given me a new friend  let me introduce senhor lawrence armstrong to you senhor my old comrade ignacio who as i have told you nursed me back to life many years ago  the old man held out a hard bony hand and gave lawrence a hearty squeeze of friendship that had something vicelike in its vigour  he then turned to pedro and began to make anxious inquiries about the war as the two men spoke in undertones lawrence drew back a few paces and followed them towards the cottage  he observed that ignacio shook his head very often and also that he laughed once or twice silently but with apparent heartiness  as he overheard the name of manuela just before one of these laughs he experienced some disagreeable feelings which it was not easy to understand or get rid of so he took to fondling the hunters dogs by way of diversion to his mind  the animals testified indirectly to the character of their master by receiving his advances with effusive demonstrations of joy  at the cottage they found ignacios horsea very fine onewith a lasso hanging from the saddle  beside it stood a loose horse with the carcass of a guanaco flung over it and a gaucho lad who was the hunters only attendant  quashy was engaged in animated conversation with this youth and manuela stood beside him listening  i cannot understand said lawrence to pedro as they approached how men ever acquire dexterity in the use of these bolas  practice makes perfect you know said the guide and it doesnt matter much what sort of weapons you use if you only learn to use them well  of course its not easy to a beginner  when ignacios dogs turn out a jaguar or a puma they follow him hotly till he stops to defend himself  if the dogs fly upon the brute the hunter usually jumps off his horse whirls the three balls about till they get up tremendous momentum and then brings them down on the jaguars skull with a whack that generally drops him  but if the dogs are afraid to go at him ignacio throws the lasso over him gallops away and drags him over the ground while the dogs rush in and tear him  what between bumping and hounds the jaguars career is soon finished  im glad ive met you said pedro to ignacio as they turned aside into the bushes together for ive got news to tell and ill want your help  theres mischief brewing in the air and i am commissioned  thus much did lawrence and quashy overhear before the voice died away in the distance  it was a tantalising point to stop at  lawrence looked at quashy and at manuela who stood near  does manuela know anything of the mischief that is brewing asked lawrence in amazing spanish  noting replied the girl in english but she trust pedro  so do i with all my heart returned lawrence my question was prompted by curiosity not by doubt  is not so sure said quashy with a frown and a tone of selfassertion which was rare in him  nicelookin men like hims not allers as nice as dey looks  fie quashy  i thought you were of a more trustful spirit  so i is massaawrful trusful  kin trus you wid amost anyting trus dis yer injin gal wid untol gol  trus soozn wid de whole world an eberyting else besides but is not quite so sure about dis yer pedro  dint he say dars noos to tell an he wants help an ders mischif abrewin  an aint i sure nuff dat hes got suffin to do wid de mischif or he wouldnt be so secret  well quashy youd better not tell pedro your doubts of him said lawrence for if he knocks you down i wont feel bound to stand up for youseeing that i have perfect confidence in him  further conversation on this point was cut abruptly short by a tremendous hissing inside the cottage followed by clouds of steam  it was caused by one of quashys pots having boiled over  the negro sprang to the rescue  soon afterwards the host and the old hunter returning they all entered the place together and sat down to supper  it was but a simple cottage suitable to the simple tastes of a mountaineer in such a region with only two rooms and a kitchen besides a small attic divided into two chambers which could be reached only by a ladder through a trapdoor  little furniture graced it yet what little there was bore evidence of having felt the touch of a tasteful female hand  numerous nails and pegs were stuck in the walls for the purpose of supporting firearms etcetera but the weapons had been secreted in a place of safety for during the owners frequent and long absences from home the cottage was locked up and left pretty much to take care of itself being deemed safe enough owing to its remote and lonely position  the key was always left in charge of old ignacio who was understood to have his eye on the place and privileged to inhabit it whenever he chose  all this and a great deal more pedro told to lawrence as they sat round the table at supper in what used to be the parlour of the establishment  but im going to lock it up and hide the key this time he continued because i have to send ignacio on urgent matters into the eastern parts of bolivia to  to git help an tell de noos about de mischif whats abrewin said the negro abruptly with a pointed stare at the guide and an arrested potato on the end of his fork  youve learnt your lesson well quashy returned pedro with a goodhumoured smile as he helped himself to a fresh supply of meat these are the very wordsto obtain help and spread the news about the mischief thats brewing  pass the salt like a good fellow and help manuela to some more maize  youre forgetting your manners boy  the negro heaved a sigh of discomfiture and did as he was bid  next morning at daybreak they left the cottage and descended the intricate valley which led to it  pedro seemed to have quite subdued his feelingsat least all outward manifestation of themfor he was sterner and more silent than usual as they resumed their journey  for some distance their route and that of ignacio lay in the same direction but towards the afternoon of the same day on which they left mariquita cottage the old hunter bade the party adieu and accompanied by his gaucho lad and his dogs entered a northeasterly defile of the hills and disappeared  we shall soon get to more cultivated lands manuela said pedro in the indian tongue glancing back at lawrence who rode a few paces behind  i doubt not you will be glad to see female faces again  to the surprise of the guide manuela said that she did not care  indeed he rejoined i thought you would be getting tired by this time of such rough travelling and frequent hard lodging and fare as well as of the conversation of us men  no i am not tired  i delight in this wild free life  surely not because it is new to you said pedro with a glance of amusement when you dwell with your kindred your life must be wild enoughunless indeed the great chief your father deems it beneath the dignity of his daughter to join in the sports of her fellows  manuela made no reply but for a moment or two gave vent to that clear short merry laugh in which she sometimes indulged  lawrence armstrong irresistibly charmed by the sound rode up alongside  manuela is merry he said to the guide will you not translate that i may enjoy the joke  it is not easy to translate replied pedro  in fact i doubt if you will see the joke at all  it requires a little knowledge of manuelas past career to make understanding possible  she only said that she delighted in this wild free life  not much jest in that truly returned lawrence being i fear dull of comprehension nevertheless i see an unintentional compliment to us in the remark for it implies that we have not made manuelas journey tedious to her  it may be so said pedro simply  i was just telling her that we shall soon get to more inhabited parts of the land where she will have a little female society now and then and i was about to add that afterwards we shall descend into the lower grounds of bolivia where she will have wild life enough to her hearts contentperchance too much of it  soon afterwards the guides prophecy came true for they passed from the rugged mountains into a wide and richly clothed tableland where there were a few scattered farms at which they were made heartily welcome whenever they chose to stop for the night or for a meal  passing thence into another range of comparatively low hills they reached the town of san ambrosio where they found comfortable quarters in a new and commodious innat least it seemed commodious after the recent experiences of our travellers  here pedro said he would have to spend a day or two as he had business to transact in the town and that he would search out an old acquaintance with whose family he would place manuela till their departure  while pedro was gone in quest of his friend the indian girl probably feeling shy in the midst of such unwonted crowds retired to the room provided for her and lawrence and quashy found themselves left in the unusual condition of having nothing to do  of course in these circumstances they resolved to go out and see the town  while lawrence was questioning the landlord an american as to how he should proceed a very decided tremor passed through his frame  quashy seemed to experience a similar sensation for he said abruptly  eartquak  thats nothing new here sir said the landlord to lawrence as he lighted a cigarette were used to it though some of the natives aint quite easy in their minds for the shocks have been both frequent as well as violent lately  have they done any damage asked lawrence  nothin to speak of  only shook down a house or two that was built to sell i suppose not to stand  youll find the marketplace second turn to your left  somewhat impressed by the landlords freeandeasy manner as well as by his apparent contempt for earthquakes the master and man went out together  with characteristic modesty the negro attempted to walk behind but lawrence would by no means permit this  he insisted on his walking beside him  bery good massa said quashy at last giving in if you will walk longside ob a nigger snot my fault  dont blame me  with this protest solemnly uttered the faithful negro accompanied our hero in his inspection of the town    chapter nine  tells of a tremendous catastrophe  san ambrosio was at the period of which we write a small and thriving placethough what may be styled a mushroom town which owed its prosperity to recently discovered silvermines  all things considered it was a town of unusual magnificence on a small scale  being built with straight streets cutting each other at right angles lawrence and his man had no difficulty in finding the principal square or marketplace which was crowded with people selling and buying vegetables milk eggs fruit etcetera brought in from the surrounding districts  the people presented all the picturesque characteristics of the land in profusionpeons with huge spanish spurs mounted on gaily caparisoned mules gauchos on active horses of the pampas marketwomen in varied costumes more or less becoming and darkeyed senhoras on balconies and verandas sporting the graceful mantilla and the indispensable fan  the carts and donkeys and dogs and fowls and boys had the curious effect of reducing the babel of voices and discordant sounds to something like a grand harmony  besides these there was a sprinkling of men of freeandeasy swagger in long boots with more or less of villainy in their facesadventurers these attracted by the hope of something turning up to their advantage though afflicted most of them with an intense objection to take the trouble of turning up anything for themselves  dangerous fellows too who would not scruple to appropriate the turnings up of other people when safe opportunity offered  a clear fountain played in the centre of the squareits cool refreshing splash sounding very sweet in the ears of lawrence whose recent sojourn in the cold regions of the higher andes had rendered him sensitive to the oppressive heat of the town  besides this a clear rivulet ran along one side of the square near to which was the governors house  a line of trees threw a grateful shade over the footpath here  on the opposite side stood the barracks where a few illclad unsoldierly men lounged about with muskets in their hands  all the houses and church walls and spires not only in the square but in the town bore evidence in the form of cracked walls and twisted windows and doorways of the prevalence of earthquakes and there was a general appearance of dilapidation and dirt around which was anything but agreeable to men who had just come from the free grand sweetscented scenery of the mountains  they seem to have had some severe shakings here said lawrence pointing with his stick to a crack in the side of one of the houses which extended from the roof to the ground  we may remark here that on entering the town our travellers had laid aside their arms as being useless encumbrances though lawrence still carried his oaken cudgel not as a weapon but a walkingstick  yes massa replied quashy got lots ob eart quaks in dem diggins ebery day more or less dey hab a few  jest afore you come down dis mornin i hab some convsashin wid de landlord an he say he don like de look ob tings  indeed quashy  why not  cause its

scienskrific genleman in our inn whats bin aprofisyin as therell be a grand bustup afore long  i hope hell turn out to be a false prophet said lawrence  what is his name  dun know massa  look dar exclaimed quashy with a grin pointing to a fat priest with a broadbrimmed white hat on a sleek mule he do look comfrable  more comfortable than the poor beast behind him returned lawrence with a laugh as he observed three little children cantering along on one horse  there was no lack of entertainment and variety in that town for people generally seemed to a great extent to have cast off the trammels of social etiquette both in habits and costume  many of the horses that passed were made to carry double  here would ride past a man with a woman behind him there a couple of girls or two elderly females elsewhere appeared a priest of tremendous length and thinness with feet much too near the ground and further on a boy so small as to resemble a monkey with behind him a woman so old as to suggest the idea he had taken his greatgrandmother out for a ride orvice versa  for some hours master and man wandered about enjoying themselves thoroughly in spite of the heat commenting freely on all they saw and heard until hunger reminded them of the flight of time  returning to their hotel lawrence to his surprise found a note awaiting him  it was from pedro saying that he had found his friend in a village about three miles from san ambrosio describing the route to the place and asking him to send quashy out immediately as he wanted his assistance that night for a few hours  i wonder what he wants with you said lawrence  to help him wid de mischif replied the negro in a halfsulky tone  well youll have to go but youd better eat something first  no massa wid yous leave ill go off at once  a hunk ob bread in de pocket an lots o fruit by de waydas nuff for dis nigger  off with you then and tell pedro that you left manuela and me quite comfortable  o massa lawriescuse me usin de ole nameit am so nice to hear you speak jolly like dat  minds me ob de ole times  get along with you said lawrence with a laugh as the warmhearted black left the hotel  thus these two parted  little did they imagine what singular experiences they should encounter before meeting again  soon after quashys departure lawrence went to the door of manuelas room and tapping gently said  dinner is ready manuela  i kom queek replied the girl with a hearty laugh  it had by that time become an established little touch of pleasantry between these two that lawrence should teach the indian girl englishat least to the extent of familiar phraseswhile she should do the same for him with spanish  there was one thing that the youth liked much in this and it also surprised him a little namely that it seemed to draw the girl out of her indian reticence and gravity for she laughed with childlike delight at the amazing blunders she made in attempting english  indeed she laughed far more at herself than at him although his attempts at spanish were even more ridiculous  a few minutes later manuela entered the room and with a modest yet gracious smile took a seat opposite her pupilteacher  dignity thought the latternative dignity and grace  being the daughter of a great chief of the incasa princess i supposeshe cannot help it  an ordinary indian female now would have come into the room clumsily looked sheepish and sat down on the edge of her chairperhaps on the floor  but as he gazed at her short black curly hair her splendid black eyebrows her pretty little highbred mouth beautiful white teeth and horribly brown skin he sighed and only said  ay ay  well well  what a pity  what ees dat inquired the girl with a look of grave simplicity  did i speak returned lawrence a little confused  yesyou say ay ay  well well  what a pittie  ohahyesi was only thinking manuela  what will you have  som muttin replied the girl with a pursing of the little mouth that indicated a tendency to laugh  it is not mutton  its beef i think  well beeeef very naicean som gravvie too pleeese  she went off at this point into a rippling laugh which being infectious in its nature also set her companion off but the entrance of the landlord checked them both  he sat down at a small table near to them and being joined by a friend called for a bottle of wine  hotter than ever he remarked to lawrence  yes very sultry indeed  shouldnt wonder if we was to have a sharpish touch or two tonight  to which his friend who was also an american if not an englishman and appeared to be sceptical in his nature replied gammon  this led to a conversation between the two which is not worthy of record as it was chiefly speculative in regard to earthquakes in general and tailed off into guesses as to social convulsions present past or pending  one remark they made however which attracted the attention of our hero and made him wish to hear more  it had reference to some desperate character whose name he failed to catch but who was said to be in the neighbourhood again trying to raise men to join his band of robbers the landlord supposed to which the landlords friend replied with emphasis that he had come to the right place for as far as his experience went san ambrosio was swarming with men that seemed fit for anythingfrom pitchandtoss to manslaughter  not wishing apparently to hear anything more about such disagreeable characters and subjects manuela rose at the conclusion of the meal and retired to her apartment while lawrence continued to sip his coffee in a balcony which overlooked the vineyard behind the hotel  it was evening and although unusually warm the weather was very enjoyable for a profound calm reigned around and the hum of the multitudes in the distant square seemed hushed as the church bells rang the hour for evening prayers  as the twilight deepened and the stars came faintly into sight in the darkblue vault above the thoughts of lawrence became strangely saddened and gradually quitting the scene of peaceful beauty on which he gazed sped over the cordillera of the andes to that home of his boyhood which now lay in ashes  the frame of mind thus induced naturally led him to dwell on past scenes in which his mother had taken a part and he was still meditating more than half asleep on the joys which were never to return when he was roused into sudden and thorough consciousness by somethinghe could not tell what a sort of sensationwhich caused him to leap from his chair  at the same moment there arose from the streets a cry or wail suddenly a rumbling noise was heard  lawrence bounded towards the nearest door  full well he knew what it meant  before he could escape there was a tremendous upheaval of the solid earth and in one instant without further warning the entire town fell with one mighty crash lawrence just saw the walls and roof collapsingthen all was dark and consciousness forsook him    chapter ten  recounts some terrible and some vigorous deeds  how long our hero lay in this state he could not tell but on recovering his faculties he became conscious of the fact that he was in total darkness lying on his back with a tremendous weight pressing on his chest  for a few moments he remained still quite unable to recollect what had occurred or where he was  suddenly memory resumed its officethe earthquake the fall of the hoteland with a gush of horror he realised the terrible truth that he was buried alive  the reader must have been in the position we describe to understand fully the feelings of the poor youth at that moment  his first impulse was to make a violent effort to shake off the intolerable weight that almost suffocated him but his efforts strong though he was proved in vain  it felt as if a mountain held him down  then the thought of manuela rushed in upon him and he uttered a loud cry  the sound of his voice in the confined space was terrible  it seemed to rush in upon his brain with awful din  in his agony a feeling of frantic despair came over him and with the strength of a giant he struggled to be free but still without success  exhausted as much by his horror as by his efforts he lay for some minutes quite still his brain keenly alive and thirsting as it were for some sound that might convey hope  no sound was to be heard save the intense beating of his own pulsations which seemed to throb into his ears and down into his very extremities  as he lay listening it came strangely into his thoughts with something like a feeling of regret that it would be very hard for him to die  so much strong life as he possessed must he thought take long to destroy but again the memory of poor manuela perhaps in a similar condition and certainly not far from him banished the thoughts of self and he listened once more intently  all was still as the grave  the effort at selfcontrol however calmed him a little and in a gentler mood he tried to move his arms  the left arm was fixed as in a vice and gave him so much pain that he feared it had been broken  the right arm was also fast but he felt that he could move his hand  it was a feeble straw for the buried man to clutch at yet it was strong enough to buoy up hope in a stout heart  his courage returned and with calm resolute patience he set to work uttering the fervent prayer help me o god  where there was space for a hand to move freely he knew there must be space to remove rubbish though it might be ever so little  in a few minutes some handful of earth were thrust aside  then by drawing his arm upwards and pushing it downwards he loosened the rubbish around it and by slow degrees set it partially free  if he had been entombed in solid earth this he was well aware could not have been possible but rightly judging that in a mass of mingled bricks mortar and beams there must be spaces more or less open he worked away with patience and in hope  the result was that he was able at last to touch with his right hand the object which lay so crushingly on his chest  it was an enormous beam  the utter impossibility of even moving it filled him for a moment with despair but again he cried to god for help  the cry was answered truly and effectively yet without a miracle for the very act of trust in the almighty calmed his mind and set it free to consider intelligently  he could not hope to lift the beam  it was far too heavy  being so heavy he knew it would have killed him outright if it had not been checked in its descent and partially supported somehow  might he not then scrape away the rubbish on which he lay until he should as it were sink away from the beam  he tried at once and managed to get his right hand slightly under him  he could reach his haunch  it was a terribly slow process but by degrees the busy hand reached the waist drawing the rubbish out by small portions at a time  it seemed to him as if hours were spent in these painful efforts  still no appreciable difference was made in his position and he had by that time pushed his hand as far up under his back towards his neck as it was possible to turn it  finding that he could scrape away no more in that direction he now sought to deepen the hollows already made  in doing so he got hold of a brick which he wrenched out with a desperate effort  the result was instantaneous relief for he seemed to subside not much indeed but sufficiently to permit of his breathing freely  with a fervent exclamation of thankfulness he turned slightly round and drew his left arm out from the rubbish  he felt it anxiously  it was bruised a good deal but not broken  although so greatly relieved that he felt for a few moments almost as if he had been delivered from death the poor youth was still in a terrible case  the space in which he was confined did not admit of his sitting up much less standing  what seemed to be a solid mass of the fallen wall was above him prevented from crushing him by the beam before mentioned while around him were masses of brick and mortar densely packed  again exerting his lungs the youth shouted with all his might and then paused to listen but there was no reply  then he shouted the name of manuela in the hope that she might hear and answer if still alive but no answering voice replied  believing now that nothing could save him but a fixed purpose and a prolonged desperate effort on an intelligent plan he prayed again for help and then proceeded to enlarge his tomb by scraping the rubbish back under the beam from beneath which he had drawn himself and packing it tightly down  this enlarged the space enabling him to get upon his knees  to work upward through the fallen wall would he knew be an impossibility  he therefore worked horizontally for some time throwing the rubbish between his legs behind him as we presume the moles are accustomed to do  then he passed his hand along over his head and found that the solid wall was no longer above himonly disjointed bricks and beams  with renewed hope and redoubled effort he now worked his way upwards although wellnigh suffocated by dust as well as by smoke arising from fires which had broken out in many places all over the ruined town suddenly while thus engaged he heard voices faintly  he shouted with all his might and listened  yes he was not mistaken he heard voices distinctly and they appeared to be speaking in spanish  with something like a bounding of the heart he repeated his shout and renewed his labours  if he had known the character of the persons who had thus encouraged him his hopes would not have been so strong  we have said that the entire town had been levelled by one tremendous convulsion and that in many places fires had broken out among the ruins  these fires sent up dense volumes of smoke which naturally attracted people from all quarters of the surrounding country  among them came bands of desperate and lawless characters who fastened on the ruins as vultures seize on carrion  they resembled the unclean birds in more respects than one for they went about as long as there was anything of value to be seized long after other people had been forced to quit the place owing to the horrible stench of the hundreds of corpses decaying and in many cases burning among the ruins  see note 1  it was the voices of some of these lawless ruffians that lawrence had heard  he soon became aware of their character by the terrible oaths which they used and the fiendish laughter in which they indulged whenever he called for help  knowing that he had nothing to hope from such miscreants he ceased to call out but toiled none the less vigorously to effect his deliverance  at last he managed to scrape through to the upper world and a feeling of inexpressible relief filled his breast as a bright ray of sunshine shot into his prison  that it was daylight did not surprise him for the many hours which he had spent under ground seemed to him like weeks  but he soon found that he was not yet free  the hole which he had scraped was much too small to admit of the passage of even a little boy  in trying to enlarge it he found to his dismay that on one side of it was an enormous beam on the other a mass of solid masonry which could not be moved without aid looking out he saw nothing but confused heaps of smoking ruins save in one direction where in the far distance for the hotel had stood on a mound he could see a group of men engaged as if searching for something  to these he shouted again but did not attract their attention  either they did not hear him or did not care  turning then to the beam he tried with all his might to raise it but failed though it moved slightly  encouraged by hope and afterwards influenced by despair he tried again and again until his strength broke down  at this juncture he heard footsteps and saw a man passing near  senhor senhor he cried in the best spanish he could muster aid me to get out for the love of god  a coarse insult was the only reply as the man passed on  a group of other men who passed soon after behaved as badly for they only laughed at his entreaties  it is difficult to say whether rage or indignation was more powerful in lawrences heart but both passions were equally unavailing in the circumstances  he felt this and soon calmed down so that when half an hour later another man passed that way he addressed him in tones of respect and earnest entreaty  the bandit for such he was seemed to be utterly unaffected for although he must certainly have heard the appeal he like the others passed on without taking the slightest notice  senhor senhor cried lawrence i have a gold watch and chain to which you  the man stopped for the bait took at once  turning and walking towards the place from which the sound came he soon found the hole through which our hero looked  hand out the watch senhor he said  no no answered lawrence aid me first to lift the beam  whether the man understood the bad spanish or not we cannot say but instead of helping to lift the beam he drew a pistol from his belt and said  hand out the watch or i shoot  shoot away then cried lawrence savagely as he drew quickly back into his hole  the report of the pistol followed the words and the ball caused a cloud of dust and rubbish to mingle with the smoke  a wild laugh of defiance from within told that our englishman was not hurt  haha  shoot again he cried fiercely  no senhor no  you are brave  i will help you replied the miscreant  lawrence doubted the honesty of the mans assurance but of course thanked him and expressed readiness to avail himself of his assistance he kept carefully at the extreme end of the hole however while his murderous deliverer removed some of the rubbish from the beam and so made it possible to raise it  remaining quite still lawrence waited till he saw that the beam had been so far moved as to enlarge the space sufficiently for him to get through  then with a sudden spring a la jackinthebox he leaped out and stood before the astonished bandit  lawrence whose sense of honour taught him to hold his promise as sacred to a thief as to an honest man had fully intended to give up his watch and chain to the man if he should remain peaceably disposed but the bandit was not so disposed  recovering from his surprise he drew a second pistol from his belt and levelled it at lawrence  thought is quick quicker even than triggers  his length of limb happily flashed into the youths mind  up went his foot with a sudden kick and away went the pistol into the air where it exploded after the manner of a skyrocket  the bandit did not wait for more  he turned and fled much to the satisfaction of the victor who overcome by prolonged exhaustive toil and excitement sank down on a heap of rubbish and lay there in a semiconscious state  it seemed as if both mind and body had resolved to find rest at all hazards for he lay perfectly motionless for nearly an hournot exactly asleep but without being fully conscious of connected thought  from this state of repose if it may be so called he was partially aroused by the voices of men near him talking in coarse violent language  raising his head languidly he observed a band of about eight or ten villainouslooking fellows busy round a hole out of which they appeared to be drawing some sort of booty  a prize exclaimed one of the men be gentle shes worth taking alive  a loud laugh from the others roused lawrence again but a feeling of unwonted exhaustion oppressed him so that he scarce knew what it was he heard  suddenly there arose a female voice in a cry of pain  lawrence started up on one elbow and beheld manuela struggling in the grasp of one of the band  if electric fire had taken the place of blood in his veins he could not have bounded up more quickly  the shock seemed to renew and double his wonted strength  like the english bulldog with terrible purpose but in absolute silence he rushed over the rubbish towards the man who held the struggling girl  the man seemed to be a leader being the only one of the band who carried a cavalry sabre  the others were armed some with short swords some with carbines and pistols  swift though lawrence was the chief saw him coming  he let go the girl and made a wild cut at him with the sabre  lawrence received the cut on his left arm  at the same moment he struck the villain such a blow with his clenched fist that it seemed to crush in his skull and sent him headlong into the hole out of which they had just dragged the indian girl  fortunately he dropped his sabre as he fell  with a shout of defiance our hero caught it up just in time to arrest the descent of a carbine butt on his head  next moment the man who aimed the blow was cleft to the chin and a united rush of the robbers was for the moment arrested  manuela helpless and horrorstruck had stood motionless on the spot where the chief had released her  lawrence caught her in his left arm swung her into an angle of the broken wall placed himself in front and faced his foes  the villains though taken by surprise were no cravens  apparently they had already discharged their firearms for only one fired at our hero with a pistol and missed his aim  flinging the weapon at his adversary with a yell of disappointment he missed his aim a second time  at the same moment another of the bandone of the tallest and most ferociouslookingsprang upon the youth with terrible fury  he knew well apparently how to use his weapon and lawrence felt that his experience at school now stood him in good stead  as the weapons of these giants flew around with rapid whirl and clash the others stood aside to see the end  doubtless they would have taken unfair advantage of their foe if they could but lawrence turning his back to the wall where manuela crouched prevented that  at last one dastardly wretch seeing that his comrade was getting the worst of it bethought him of his carbine and began hurriedly to load  our hero noted the act and understood its fatal significance  with a bound like that of a tiger he sprang at the man and cut him down with a backhanded blow turning even in the act just in time to guard a sweeping cut dealt at his head with a straight point he thrust his sword through teeth gullet and skull of his tall adversary until it stood six inches out behind his head  then without a moments pause he leaped upon the nearest of the other bandits  awestricken they all gave back and it seemed as if the youth would yet win the day singlehanded against them all when a shout was heard and half a dozen men of the same stamp if not the same band came running to the rescue  lawrence drew hastily back to his protecting wall  pray manuela pray he gasped we are in gods hands  at that moment two shots were heard away on their right and two of the advancing bandits fell  an instant later and quashy bounded upon the scene with a high trumpetshriek like a wild elephant  pedro followed brandishing the rifle which he had just discharged with such fatal effect  lawrence joined them with a genuine british cheer but their adversaries did not await the onset  they turned fled and speedily scattered themselves among the ruins  tank god massa wes in time said quashy wiping with his sleeve the perspiration that streamed from his face as they returned quickly to manuela  we must not wait a moment here said pedro hurriedly  there may be more of the villains about  but you are wounded senhor armstrong  not badly said lawrence  it might have been worse but the fellow was in such a hurry that the edge of his sabre turned and i got only a blow with the side of it  if i had only had my good cudgelby the way it must be in the hole  it was in my hand whenstay ill return in a few seconds  he ran back to his late tomb and quickly returned in triumph with his favourite weapon  come we must get away from this at once said pedro turning to manuela  no time for explanations  are you hurt  no thank god  let us go replied the girl who was pale and haggard as she staggered towards them  take my arm said lawrence presenting his wounded limb  the girl pointed with trembling hand to the blood  it is nothinga mere scratch said lawrence  in his anxiety he forgot to speak in spanish  manuela appeared as if about to sink with fear  he caught her lifted her in his arms as if she had been a little child and following pedros lead left the place which had been the scene of so many terrible events  in the outskirts of the town there was a large low building of mud or sundried bricks which had not been overthrown by the earthquake  to this pedro conducted his companions  they found room in the place though it was nearly full of survivors in all conditions of injury from those who had got mere scratches and bruises to those who had been so crushed and mangled that life was gradually ebbing away  there seemed to be about fifty people in the room and every minute more were being brought in  here lawrence set down his burden who had by that time quite recovered and turned quickly to the guide  come pedro he said i can be of use here but we must have my own wound dressed first  you can do it i doubt not  pedro professed to be not only able but willing  before he did it however he whispered in a low tone yet with much emphasis to manuela  dont forget yourself  remember  as he whispered pretty loud and in spanish lawrence overheard and understood him and puzzled himself not only that day but for many days and nights after as to how it was possible that manuela could forget herself and what it was she had to remember  but the more and the longer he puzzled over it the less did he clear up his mind on the subject  when it became known that lawrence was a doctor there was a visible increase of hope in the expression and bearing of the poor wounded people  and the youth soon justified their trustful feelings for with pedro and quashy as assistantsurgeons and manuela as headnurse he went about setting broken bones bandaging limbs sewing up wounds and otherwise relieving the sufferers around him  while this was going on the poor people were recounting many marvellous tales of terrible risks run escapes made and dangers evaded  during all this time too frequent shocks of earthquake were felt of greater or less violence and these afterwards continued daily for a month so that the few buildings which had partially survived the first awful shock were finally levelled like the rest  when lawrence with his assistants had gone the rounds of the extemporised hospital he was so completely worn out that he could scarcely keep his eyes open  swallowing a cup of hot coffee hastily he flung himself on a heap of straw beside one of his patients and almost instantly fell into a profound lethargic slumber  there was an unoccupied armchair in the room  placing this beside the youths couch the indian girl sat down with a fan purposing in her gratitude to protect her preserver from the mosquitoes which were having an unusual bout of revelry over the sufferers that night  quashy observing this as he lay down in a corner shook his head sadly and whispered to himself  ah you brown gal yous in lub wid massa  but its useless  de ole story ob unrekited affection for you know pretty though you is massa kin nebber marry a squaw  thus thinking quashy went sweetly to sleep  so did most of the others in that crowded place  but manuela stuck to her colours nobly  she kept awake until her pretty black eyes became lustreless until her pretty brown face became expressionless until the effort to continue awake became hopeless  then her little head fell back on the cushion of the chair the little mouth opened and the large eyes closed  the little hand which held the fan dropped by her side the fan itself dropped on the floor and like the others poor manuela at length found rest and solace in slumber    note 1  a similar disaster accompanied by dreadful scenes of lawlessness and horror occurred in 1861 when the city of mendoza was totally destroyed by an earthquake and ninetenths of the inhabitants perished    chapter eleven  outwitted by a bandit  early next morning pedro went round and quietly roused his friends  we must start at once he said in a low voice to lawrence when the wearied youth was sufficiently awake to understand  your wounded arm is better i hope  it is only stiff and painful happily no bones are injured  but why such haste  i dont like to leave my poor patients in this fashion  will any of them die if you dont stay to nurse them asked the guide with a grave almost stern expression  why no not exactly returned lawrence but many of them will want their wounds dressed and all of them will be the better for a little more skilled attendance  will they not survive under ordinary attendance asked pedro with increasing severity of expression  doubtless they will but  would you like interrupted the inflexible guide to have them all roused up at this early hour to hear a little farewell speech from you explaining the absolute necessity for your going away and your extreme regret at leaving them  not if there is such necessity returned lawrence yawning and raising himself on one elbow  there is such necessity senhor  i have been down to the village where my friend lives and have got fresh horses  manuela and quashy are already mounted  i let you sleep to the last moment seeing you were so tired  dont forget your pistols you may need them  without waiting for a reply he rose and left the room  the young doctor hesitated no longer  regret at quitting the poor people around him was overborne by the fear of being left behind for he had by that time begun to entertain a vague suspicion that the stern and peculiar man by whom he was led would not permit any object whatever to stand in the way of what he believed to be his duty  in a few seconds he issued from the hut armed with his pair of doublebarrelled pistols and the faithful cudgel  the cavalry sabre however had been lost not much to his regret  the grey light of dawn was just sufficient to give a ghostly appearance to what may be truly termed the ghastly ruins around them and to reveal in undefined solemnity the neighbouring mountains  smoke still issued from the halfsmothered fires and here and there a spectral figure might be seen flitting silently to and fro  but all was profoundly still and quiet even the occasional tremors of the earth had ceased for a time when they issued from the enclosure of the hut  without speaking lawrence mounted the horse which stood ready for him and they all rode silently away picking their steps with great care through the upheaved and obstructed streets  it was a scene of absolute and utter ruin which lawrence felt could never be effaced from his memory but must remain there burned in deeply in its minutest details to the end of time  when they had passed the suburbs however and reached the country beyond the depressing influences passed away and a certain degree of cheerfulness returning with the sun they began to chat and to explain to each other their various experiences  of course when i felt the earthquake said pedro to lawrence i knew that although little damage was done to the village to which i had gone in search of my friends it must have been very severe on the town with its spires and public buildings so i saddled up at once and set off on my return  i met quashy just as i left the village and we both spurred back as fast as we could  when we came in sight of it we saw at once that the place was destroyed but until we reached it had no idea of the completeness of the destruction  we could not even find the road that led to the inn where we had left you and manuela and it was not till the following morning that we found the inn itself and came up as you know just in time to help you though we had sought diligently all night  das so massa broke in quashy who had listened with glittering eyes to pedros narrative which of course was much more extended and full an yous got no notion how wes banged about our poor shins among dese ruins afore we founded you  smy blief but for de fires wed nebber hab founded you at all  and dem scoundrilsoh dem scoundrils  quashys feelings at this point failed to find vent in words sufficiently expressive so he relieved them to some extent by shaking his fist at scoundreldom in general and grinding his teeth  no words could have expressed his feelings half so well  by way of changing a subject that appeared to be almost too much for him he turned abruptly to the indian girl and said in spanish quite as bad as that of lawrence  but where were you senhorina all the time  ay manuela lets hear how it was that you escaped said pedro quickly in indian  i escaped through the mercy of god replied the girl in a low voice  true manuela true replied the guide you never said a truer word than that but by what means was his mercy displayed  i can scarcely tell returned the girl when the earthquake came i was sitting on my bed  then the wall of the room seemed to fall on me and my senses were gone  how long i lay so i cannot tell  when i recovered my mind i felt as if buried alive but i could breathe and although unable to rise i could move  then i heard cries and i replied but my strength was gone and i think no one heard me  then i prayed and then i think i slept but am not sure  at last i heard a spade striking the earth above me  soon an opening was made and i was dragged rudely out  the rest you know  on this being interpreted to her companions quashy gave it as his decided opinion that a miracle had been performed for her special deliverance but lawrence thought that without miraculous interference god had caused a mass of wall to fall over and protect her in much the same way that he himself had been protected  while they were talking thus and slowly descending one of the numerous richlywooded though rugged paths which traverse the lower slopes of the andes they encountered a party of horsemen from the pampas  they were wellarmed and from their looks might have been another troop of banditti coming like human vultures from afar to swoop down on the carcass of the unfortunate town  to have shown the slightest hesitancy or fearsupposing them to have been what they lookedwould have been to invite attack but as the reader knows our travellers were not the men to betray themselves thus before starting they had carefully examined their weapons and had bestowed them about their persons somewhat ostentatiously  pedro had even caused manuela to stick a brace of small pistols and a large knife in her belt and as indian women are sometimes known to be capable of defending themselves as vigorously as men she was by no means a cipher in the effective strength of the party  with a dignified yet freeandeasy air that would have done credit to a spanish don of the olden time pedro saluted the party as he rode past his aspect and the quiet selfpossessed air of the huge englishman with the singularity of his cudgel coupled with the look of graceful decision about the indian maiden and the blunt bulldoggedness of the square negro were sufficient to ensure a polite response not only from that party but from several other bands of the same stamp that were met with during the day  diverging from the main road in order to avoid these bands they followed a track wellknown to the guide  towards the afternoon from the top of a rising ground they descried a solitary foot traveller wending his way wearily up the hill  he was a man of middle age and powerfullybuilt but walked with such evident difficulty that it seemed as if he were either ill or exhausted pedro eyed him with considerable suspicion as he approached  in passing he begged for assistance  as he spoke in french lawrence whose sympathies like those of quashy were easily roused asked in that tongue what was the matter with him  he had been robbed he said by that villainous bandit conrad of the mountains or some one extremely like him and had been nearly killed by him  he was on his way to san ambrosio where his wife and family dwelt having heard that it had been greatly damaged if not destroyed by an earthquake  it has been utterly destroyed my poor fellow said lawrence in a tone of pity but it may be that your family has escaped  a good number of people have escaped  here are a few dollars for you  you will need them i fear  you can owe them to me and pay them when next we meet  the gift was accompanied with a look of pleasantry for lawrence well knew there was little chance of their ever meeting again  pedro sat regarding them with a grim smile  you are a stout fellow he said in a tone that was not conciliatory after the beggar had accepted the dollars with many expressions of gratitude from all i have heard of conrad of the mountains you are quite a match for him if he were alone  he was not alone senhor replied the beggar with a look that told of a temper easily disturbed  to this pedro replied contemptuously oh indeed and turning abruptly away rode on  you doubt that man said lawrence following him  i do  he looked honest  men are not always to be judged by their looks  das a fact interposed quashy what would peepil judge ob me now if dey hoed by looks  theyd say you were a fine genial hearty goodnatured blockhead said lawrence laughing  true massa yous right  im all dat an wuss but not always dat sometimes im roused an im awrful wen im roused  you should see me wen my backs riz  oh my  the negro opened his eyes and mouth so awfully at the mere idea of such a rising that his companions were fain to seek relief in laughter  even the grave manuela gave way to unrestrained merriment for if she failed to thoroughly understand quashys meaning she quite understood his face  that night they found welcome shelter in a small farm  did you fall in with the notorious bandit conrad of the mountains asked their host after the ceremonious reception of his guests was over  no senhor answered pedro  is that fellow in this neighbourhood just now  so it is said senhor  i have not seen him myself and should not know him if i saw him but from descriptions i should think it must be he  i have a poor fellowa peonlying here just now who has been robbed and nearly murdered by him  come he is in the next room you can speak to him  saying this the host introduced pedro and lawrence into an inner chamber where the wounded man lay groaning horribly  he was very ready indeed eager to give all the information in his power  fear had evidently given the poor fellow an exaggerated idea of the appearance of the man who had waylaid him nevertheless from his description our travellers had no difficulty in recognising the poor bereaved beggar whom they had met and assisted  was he a large man asked pedro  yes yes senhor tremendousseven feet or more and so indicating about three feetacross the shoulders  rough black head huge black beard and moustache hawk nose with such awful eyes and the strength of a tiger  i could never have been so easily overcome by one man if he had not been a giant  you see said pedro in english turning to lawrence with a smile the description tallies exactly making due allowance for this poor fellows alarm  he must be a clever fellow this conrad of the mountains for he has not only frightened a peon out of his wits but roused the pity of an englishman by asserting that he had been robbed by himself  your charity you see was ill bestowed  so it seems we might have made this noted bandit prisoner if we had only known exclaimed lawrence who seemed more distressed at missing the chance of becoming an amateur thiefcatcher than at misdirected charity  but do you really think the fellow was conrad of the mountains  i am certain he was not said pedro  how do you know  i have several grounds for my belief but even if i had not i might easily judge from appearances  conrad is said to be kind to women and children  the scoundrel we met with could not be kind to any one moreover there is no clear proof that conrad is a bandit while this man certainly is one  im sorry you seem so sure because i should like much to be able to say i had seen this notorious fellow about whom every one appears to hear so much and to know so little  although the bandit of whom we have just made mention was not conrad of the mountains it may interest the reader to know that he was in truth a sufficiently notorious villain named fan the captain of a band of twenty assassins most of whom were escaped criminals from the prisons of chili and peru  among other exploits fan once attacked the armed escort of a troop of mules conveying silver in bars from the mines to chili  fan and his men attacked them in a ravine so suddenly and with such a deadly fire of musketry that the few who survived laid down their arms at once on the promise being made that their lives should be spared  banditti do not usually regard promises as binding  it would be surprising if they did  fan made the survivors lie down on their faces and was about to plunder the mules when he changed his mind and shot all the rest of the convoy in cold blood except the last who seeing the fate that awaited him leaped over a precipice rolled down a steep slope many hundred feet deep and strange to say escaped with his life  he then procured a dozen or two wellarmed men and returned to the scene of the robbery but found that the robbers had flown with as much silver as they could carry the remainder being scattered about on the road  these miscreants were afterwards captured but owing to disputes between the peruvian and the chilian governments the former of whom had hold of while the latter claimed the robbers they all escaped their merited punishment and were set at large    chapter twelve  thick woods heat change of scene and savages  we must change the scene now and transport our reader to one of those numerous streams which convey the surplus waters of the andes to the warmer regions of bolivia and thence through many a wild luxuriant wilderness and jungle to the parana river by which they ultimately find their way to the sea  it was approaching the afternoon of a very sultry day when lawrence awoke from his midday siesta under an algarobatree and slowly opened his eyes  the first object they rested upon was the brown little face of manuela reposing on a pillow formed of leopard skin  in those regions it was the practice when convenient to sling a network hammock between two trees and enjoy ones siesta in that  the indian girl lay in her hammock with her eyes shut and her little mouth opennot undignifiedly open but just sufficiently so to permit of one seeing something of the teeth and tongue inside  fascinated apparently by the sight a mite of a bluebird with a golden head sat on the edge of the hammock close to the little mouth and looked in  evidently it was a bird of an inquiring disposition for having gazed for a considerable time with one eye it turned its head and gazed a longer time with the other  quashy lay close to lawrence with his back towards him  the latter observing that the cheek of the former was more lumpy and prominent than usual raised himself on one elbow to look at him and found that the lump was the result of an expansion of the mouth from ear to ear  he was wide awake gloating over the proceedings of that little bluebird but he heard lawrence move and turning his head slightly round whispered  dat am berry funnyint it  the whisper slightly roused manuela  she drew a long breath vented a deep sigh and effectually blew the bluebird away  at the same moment the whole party was roused by a wild and indescribable scream followed by a magnificent flash of what seemed to be coloured fire  in his halfsleeping condition lawrence believing it to be the warwhoop of wild indians leaped up and grasped his cudgel but nothing was to be seen save the grinning face of quashy and the amused looks of manuela and pedro  purrits remarked the negro by way of explanation  what do you mean by purrits demanded lawrence half ashamed of his alarm  i mean what i says massapurrits  he means parrots said pedro with a grave smile as he rose and proceeded to fold up the poncho on which he had lain  weve had many a song from these screamers but i dont remember ever seeing such a big flock come so near us or scream so loud before  they must have been attracted by your pretty face manuela and could not help shouting with surprise at finding you asleep  manuela laughed lightly as she stepped out of her hammock  theyve just roused us in good time continued pedro looking up between the treetops at the sky for the hut of the tigerhunter is a long way off and im anxious to reach it before dark  in a few minutes the hammock and other camp equipage was conveyed to one of the native canoes which lay close to the rivers bank our travellers embarked and ere long were far from the spot where the siesta had been taken  in the afternoon they stopped for a little to refresh themselves with roasted parrot chocolate and biscuit  parrots are found everywhere and in great numbers in those regions between the atlantic and pacific  they live and travel in large flocks and as every one knows they are remarkably fond of using their discordant voices much to the annoyance of sensitive travellers fortunately such travellers do not often go to the wild regions of south americawhen they do they soon become unsensitive  when parrots assemble in a flock on the trees they keep fluttering their wings with a tremulous motion bending down their heads and chattering young and old without regard to each other or to harmony  each seems bent on giving his own opinion in the loudest key and pays no regard whatever to the opinions of others  there is something almost human in this  it is a curious fact that while the plumage of the parrots breasts is always gaudy and brilliant in the extreme that of their backs is usually the colour of the general tone of the region they inhabit  in woods where the bark of trees is chiefly bright yellow and green their backs are of these colours  in the plains they are a mixture of green and brown so that when skimming over a country they are not easily distinguished but if they chance to come unexpectedly on travellers they sheer off with a shriek and expose their gaudy breasts to view  the large flock that had so suddenly come on our friends while taking their siesta had turned off thus with a horrible scream and revealed their gay breasts on which the sun chanced to shine at the moment with great power thus producing as we have said a splendid flash of colour  massa inquired quashy as they sat in the canoe enjoying the cold meal and floating slowly with the stream which you likes bestros purrit or ros monkey  really im not quite sure replied lawrence it depends very much on appetite  if im very hungry i prefer the one that comes first to hand  which do you like best  well is not kite sure needer  i tink sometimes dat monkey is best but i cant easy git ober de face  how so quashy  cause it am so like eatin a bit o my greatgranmoder  indeed  yes  yous no notion how like dey all is to dat ole lady  you see she was uncommon old  she come ob a longlib race  das whar it is my moder was eightytwo an my granmoder was ninetysiven an my greatgranmoder was a hunrd an sixteen an dey was all alive togidder an at fuss you couldn tell which was de oldest  dey run neck an neck for a long time but arter de greatgran one pass de hunr milestoneoh she hoed ahead like a rattlesnake  de wrinkles an de crows foots an dede colourjes like bunt leather  she lef de oders far behind an looked like nuffin so much as dat poor little bleareyed monkey you shot de oder day what senhorina manuela say was so nice to eat  what you unerstan ingliss added the negro looking at the indian girl who had given vent to a halfsuppressed giggle  yesleetil replied manuela without attempting further to restrain her mirth  quite pleased that his remarks should afford amusement quashy was about to launch out extensively on the greatgranmoder theme when an exclamation from the guide checked him  look senhor armstrong he said arresting the progress of the canoe by a slight turn of his paddle  yonder is a mode of fishing which no doubt is new to you  pedro pointed as he spoke to a canoe which a sharp bend of the stream had just revealed to them  its occupants were indians  they were almost naked and so intent on their occupation that the arrival of our travellers had not been observed  one of the indians a splendid specimen of muscular strength stood up in the canoe with a bow and arrow in his hands and one foot on the gunwale quite motionless suddenly he drew the bow the arrow pierced the water without causing a ripple and next moment a transfixed fish was struggling on the surface  the fish was barely secured when the presence of strangers was discovered  an exclamation followed  instantly the dark savage bent his bow with the arrow pointed this time full at the breast of pedro  that worthy did not however seem much alarmed  he at once pushed out into the stream and gave a shout which induced the savage not only to lower his bow but to fling it into his canoe and throw up his arms with exclamations of surprise and joy  he knows you said lawrence looking back at pedro who sat in the stern of their canoe  yes he knows me  i am pretty wellknown to most people in these regions  this is the tigerhunter of whom i have spoken  his dwelling is not faroff  the meeting of the two friends was remarkably cordial and it was evident to both lawrence and quashy that the white man and the brown were not only old friends but more than usually fond of each other  after the first salutations both canoes were run to the bank of the stream and when they had all landed pedro presented his friend to lawrence who shook hands with him in the english fashion  you have not mentioned your friends name said lawrence  his name replied pedro with a laugh well it is almost unpronounceable  perhaps you had better call him by the name he goes by among his friendsspotted tiger or more brieflytiger  tell spotted tiger then said lawrence that i am happy to make his acquaintance  when the guide had translated this and the indian had returned a complimentary rejoinder they continued to converse in the indian tongue with much animation and on the part of spotted tiger with some excitement  of course lawrence understood nothing but he continued to watch the expressive features of the savage with interest and observed when their glances showed they were talking of manuela that tiger first raised his eyebrows in surprise and then smiled peculiarly  strange thought lawrence what can he mean by that  perhaps he knows the chief her father but why look surprised and smile on that account  i wish pedro was not so secretive  however its his business not mine  consoling himself with this philosophic thought lawrence reembarked with his friends and accompanied by tiger proceeded down stream till they came to a beautiful spot where the banks widened out into a small lake or pond  on its shores under the cool shade of many trees stood the hut of the savage  the scenery here was more than usually beautiful being diversified not only in form but in its wealth and variety of trees and twining parasites and graceful ferns with in one place groves of tall trees covered with balls of wild cotton as large as an orange and elsewhere inextricable entanglements of gorgeously flowering creepers such as the most vivid imagination would fail to invent or conceive behind one part of the scene the setting sun shone with intense light turning all into dark forms while in other parts the slanting rays fell upon masses of rich foliage and intensified its colour  in front of the hut a handsome indian woman stood awaiting the arrival of her husband  she held in her arms a naked little ball of whiteybrown fat which represented the youngest tigercub of the family  other cubs less whitey and more brown romped around while up in the trees several remembrancers of quashys greatgreatgrandmother sat grinning with delight if not indignation at the human beings below  after being hospitably entertained by the indian with fish alligator soup roast parrot and young monkey the party assembled round a fire kindled outside the hut more for the purpose of scaring away wild beasts than cooking though the little tigercubs used it for the latter purpose  then pedro said to lawrence  now senhor armstrong i am going to ask you to exercise a little patience at this point in our journey  the business i have in hand requires that i should leave you for two or three days  i fully expect to be back by the end of that time and meanwhile i leave you and quashy and manuela in good company for my friend spotted tiger is true as steel though he is an indian and will perhaps show you a little sport to prevent your wearying  very good pedro  i am quite willing to wait said lawrence  you know i am not pressed for time at present  i shall be very glad to remain and see what is to be seen here and learn spanish from manuela  or teach her angleesh suggested the girl bashfully  certainly  whichever pleases you best manuela returned lawrence  but spose said quashy with a look of awful solemnity at pedrospose you nebber comes back at all  spose you gits drownded or killed by a tiger or shot by a injin  what den  suppose retorted the guide that an earthquake should swallow up south america or that the world should catch firewhat then  why den we no care a buttin for noting arter dat replied the negro promptly but if you don return we nebber reach buenos ayres  never fear quashy  if i dont return spotted tiger will guide you safely there  that night pedro and his friend left the hut in a canoe lighted by a brilliant moon  before morning the latter returned alone  meanwhile lawrence had slung manuelas hammock between two trees with a fire on either side yet screened from the chief campfire by a thick bush so that though close at hand and under his protection she occupied as it were a separate chamber of her own  his own hammock and that of quashyfor they all used hammockswere hung side by side a little nearer to the large fire  mr and mrs tiger with all the little tigers finding their hut rather warm came outside and also made their beds beside their visitors    chapter thirteen  deals with spotted tigers home and a hunting expedition  in spite of howling jaguars and snarling pumas and buzzing mosquitoes and the whole host of nocturnal abominations peculiar to those regions our weary travellers lay peacefully in their hammocks and slept like hummingtops  in regard to quashy we might more appropriately say like a buzzingtop  once or twice during the night quashy rose to replenish the fires for the jaguars kept up a concert that rendered attention to this protection advisable but he did it with halfclosed eyes and a sort of semiwakefulness which changed into profound repose the instant he tumbled back into his hammock  lawrence not being so well accustomed to the situation lay awake a short time at first having his loaded pistols under his pillow but as we have said he soon slumbered and it is probable that all the jaguars pumas peccaries tapirs alligators and wild cats in that district might have walked in procession under his hammock without disturbing him in the least had they been so minded  as for manuela with that quiet indifference to mere prospective danger that usually characterises her race she laid her head on her tigerskin pillow and slept the sleep of innocence having absolute faith no doubt in the vigilance and care of her protectors  it might have been observed however that before lying down the indian maiden knelt beside her hammock and hid her face in her hands  indeed from the first it had been seen by her fellowtravellers that manuela thus communed with her god and on one occasion lawrence remarking on the fact had asked pedro if she were a christian  she is a christian was pedros reply but as he manifested an evident intention not to be communicative on the subject lawrence forbore to put further questions although he felt his interest in the girl as well as his curiosity increasing and he longed to know how and when she had been turned from heathen worship to the knowledge of christ  when daylight began to glimmer in the east the bird beast and insect worlds began to stir  and a wonderful stir do these worlds make at that hour in the grand regions of central south america for although nocturnal birds and beasts retire and at least partially hide their diminished heads at daylight the myriad denizens of the forests bound forth with renewed life and vigour to sing a morning hymn of praise to their makerinvoluntarily or voluntarily who can tell which and what right has man to say dogmatically that it cannot be the latter thousands of cooing doves legions of chattering parrots made the air vocal millions of little birds of every size and hue twittered an accompaniment and myriads of mosquitoes and other insects filled up the orchestra with a high pitched drone while alligators and other aquatic monsters beat time with flipper fin and tail  breakfast consisting of excellent fish eggs maize jaguarsteak roast duck alligatorragout and chocolate was prepared outside the indian hut  the hut itself was unusually clean tiger being a peculiar and eccentric savage who seemed to have been born as the saying is in advance of his generation  he was a noted man among his brethren not only for strength and prowess but for strange ideas and practices especially for his total disregard of public opinion  in respect of cleanliness his hut differed from the huts of all other men of his tribe  it was built of sundried mud  the furniture consisted of two beds or heaps of leaves and skins and several rude vessels of clay  the walls were decorated with bows arrows blowpipes lances gamebags fishinglines and other articles of the chase as well as with miniature weapons and appliances of a similar kind varying its size according to the ages of the little tigers besides these there hung from the raftersif we may so name the sticks that stretched overheadseveral network hammocks and unfinished garments the handiwork of mrs tiger  that lady herself was a fat and by no means uncomely young woman simply clothed in a white tunic fastened at the waist with a beltthe arms and neck being bare  her black hair was cut straight across the forehead an extremely ugly but simple mode of freeing the face from interference which we might say is peculiar to all savage nations had not the highly civilised english of the present day adopted it thus proving the truth of the proverb that extremes meet  the rest of her hair was gathered into one long heavy plait which hung down behind altogether madame tiger was clean and pleasant lookingfor a savage this is more than could be said of her progeny which swarmed about the place in undisguised contempt of cleanliness or propriety  stepping into the hut after kindling the fire outside quashy proceeded to make himself at home by sitting down on a bundle  the bundle spurted out a yell wriggled violently and proved itself to be a boy  jumping up in haste quashy discommoded a tame parrot on the rafters which with a horrible shriek in the indian tongue descended on his head and grasped his hair while a tame monkey made faces at him and a tame turtle waddled out of his way  having thus as it were established his footing in the family the negro removed the parrot to his perch receiving a powerful bite of gratitude in the act and invited the wife of spotted tiger to join the breakfastparty  this he did by the express order of lawrence for he would not himself have originated such a piece of condescension  not knowing the dialect of that region however he failed to convey his meaning by words and resorted to pantomime  rubbing his stomach gently with one hand he opened his mouth wide pointed down his throat with the forefinger of the other hand and made a jerky reference with his thumb to the scene of preparations outside  madame tiger declined however and pointed to a dark corner where a sick child claimed her attention  o poor ting whats de matter wid it asked quashy going forward and taking one of the childs thin hands in his enormous paw  the little girl must have been rather pretty when in health but there was not much of good looks left at that time save the splendid black eyes the lustre of which seemed rather to have improved with sickness the poor thing appeared to know that she had found in the negro a sympathetic soul for she not only suffered her hand to remain in his but gave vent to a little squeak of contentment  stop  you hold on a bit poppity said quashy whose inventive capacity in the way of endearing terms was great ill fetch de doctor  he ran out and presently returned with lawrence who shook his head the moment he set eyes on the child  no hope inquired quashy with solemnity unspeakable on his countenance  well i wont say that  while there is life there is hope but it would have been more hopeful if i had seen the child a week or two sooner  after a careful examination during which the father who had come in and the mother looked on with quiet patience and manuela with some anxiety he found that there was still room for hope but he said turning to quashy she will require the most careful and constant nursing and as neither tiger nor his wife understands what we say and pedro may not be back for some days it will be difficult to explain to them what should be done  can you not speak their dialect even a little he added in spanish to manuela  she shook her head but said quietly  me will nurse  thats very kind of you and it will really be a charity for the child is seriously ill  she is a strangely attractive little thing he continued bending over her couch and stroking her hair gently  i feel quite as if i had known her a long time  now i will give you instructions as well as i can as to what you have to do  shall i give them in spanish or english  quite gravely the indian girl replied angleesh  very well said he and proceeded to tell manuela how to act as sicknurse  when he had finished the girl at once stepped up to tigers wife with a winning smile patted her shoulder kissed her forehead and then pointing to the little invalid with a look of profound intelligence went out of the hut  presently she returned with some of the gravy of the alligatorragout sat down beside the little one and began to administer it in small quantities  evidently the child was pleased both with the food and the angel of mercy who had found her for she nestled in a comfortable way close to manuelas side lawrence observed when the latter looked round for something she wanted that her eyes were full of tears  i knew i was right he muttered to himself as he returned to the fire where quashy had already spread out the breakfast she certainly must be a princess of the incas  they were notoriously celebrated for their gentle and amiable qualities even at the time of pizarros conquest  what more passed in his mind we cannot tell for he ceased to mutter and never revealed his subsequent thoughts to any one  now quashy said lawrence when breakfast was over we are left here in what we may style difficulties  the indians dont understand spanish or english so until pedro returns we shall have to get along as best we can by signs  bery well massa i hope you knows how to talk by signs for its more dan dis nigger do  as he spoke he threw an ear of maize at a monkey which sat on a branch overhead gazing at the party with an expression of the most woebegone resignation  he missed his aim but none the less did that monkey change its look into a glare of intense indignation after which it fled shrieking with hurt feelings into the woods  im not much up in the language of signs said lawrence but we must try our best  saying which he arose and touching tiger on the shoulder beckoned him to follow  with the lithe easy motions of the animal after which he was named the indian rose  lawrence led him a few paces from the fire and then putting himself in the attitude of a man discharging an arrow from a bow suddenly let the imaginary arrow fly looked at the savage touched his own breast and smiled  so did quashy with compound interest  spotted tiger looked puzzled shook his head and also smiled  he tink you wants him to shoot you said quashy  no no thats not it said lawrence with a somewhat abashed look at the indian  i want you to take us out shootinghunting you knowhunting  as tiger did not know the word hunting he continued to shake his head with a puzzled air  every one who has tried it knows what a silly almost imbecile feeling comes over one when one attempts the communication of ideas in dumb show  feelings of this sort affected our hero very keenly  he therefore while continuing the pantomime kept up a running or interjectional accompaniment in the english language  look here tiger he said impressively taking up two sticks which he made to represent a bow and arrow and placing them in position i want to go hunting with youhuntingshooting the jaguar  yes de jaguartiger you know said quashy who in his anxiety to get the savage to understand imitated his masters actions and could not refrain from occasionally supplementing his speech  as a tigerskin chanced to be hanging on a bush near to the fire lawrence completed his pantomime by throwing his mimic arrow against that  a gleam of intelligence suffused the face of the savage  stalking into his hut he returned with a bow considerably longer than himself and an arrow also of great length  retiring to a distance from the jaguarskin above referred to he bent his bow quickly and sent an arrow straight through the middle of it thereafter raising himself with a look of pride  why the fellow thinks i want him to show off his powers of shooting said lawrence  so he dode idjit said quashy  with much anxiety of expression great demonstration of vigorous action and many painful efforts of inventive genius the two men tried to convey their wishes to that son of the soil but all in vain  at last in desperation quashy suddenly seized the jaguarskin threw it over his own shoulders placed a long pole in lawrences hands and said  now massa you look out is agwine to spring at you and you stick me  he uttered a mighty roar as he spoke and bounded towards his master who entering at once into the spirit of the play received him on the point of his spear whereupon the human jaguar instantly fell and revelled for a few seconds in the agonies of death  then he calmly rose  now said he with a look of contempt if he no understan dat its cause he haint got no brains  at first the indian had gazed at this little scene with a look of intense astonishment  when it was finished he burst into a fit of hearty laughter  evidently it was the best piece of acting he had seen since he was born and if he had been other than a savage he must certainly have shouted bravo perhaps encore and clapped his hands  boh hes a born idjit cried quashy turning away in disgust but a new idea seemed to flash into his fertile brain  stop a bit he suddenly exclaimed seizing a piece of flat bark that lay at his feet  on this with the point of a charred stick he drew a triangular form with three dots in it for two eyes and a nose  an oval attached to this represented a body at the other end a long waving line served for a tail four short lines below indicated legs  this creature he covered all over with spots  there he cried sticking it into a bush and glaring at the indian jaguarjaguar  catching up the pole which lawrence had thrown down he rushed at this jaguar and pierced it through the heart  thereafter in hot haste he picked up tigers bow and arrows ran down to the river put them into a small canoe and thrust it into the water  holding on with one hand he waved with the other  ho hi come along you stuppid idjit  the stuppid idjit was enlightened at last  with a dignified smile which would probably have been a frown if he had understood quashys words he went up to his hut and selected a lance and a bow with which and a quiver of arrows he returned to the little hunting canoe  seeing that they were now understood lawrence took his shotgun and pistols the negro also armed himself and in a few minutes more they found themselves paddling gently down the sluggish current of the river  the scenery through which those curiously assorted hunters passed that day in their light canoe was singularly beautiful and when turning up one of the narrow streams that fed the main river they came into a region of sweet mellow twilight caused by the overarching trees where the very aspect of nature suggested though it could not create coolness lawrence felt as if he had been at last transported into those famous regions of fairyland which if they really existed and we were in very deed to get into them would perchance not equal and certainly could not excel our own actual world  gigantic trees towered upwards till their heads were lost in the umbrageous canopy while their stems were clasped by powerful snakelike creepers or adorned with flowering parasites  the bushes grew so thick and tangled that it seemed as if neither man nor beast could penetrate themwhich indeed was the case as regards man in many places yet here and there unexpected openings permitted the charmed eyes to rest upon romantic vistas where creepers convolvuli and other flowers of every shape hue and size hung in festoons and clusters or carpeted the ground  fruit too was there in abundance  everything seemed to bear fruit  the refreshing and not too luscious prickly pear the oukli an enormous cactus not unlike the prickly pear but with larger fruit whose delightful pulp was of a bloodred colour the ancoche with sweettasted pearllike drops and many others  there was plenty of animal life also in and around this stream to interest the hunters who were now obliged to exert themselves a little to make head against the sluggish current  waterhens were innumerable and other wildfowl flew or paddled about enjoying apparently a most luxuriant existence while brown anthills were suggestive of exceedingly busy life below as well as above ground  there are many kinds of ants out there some of them very large others not quite so large which however make up in vicious wickedness what they lack in size  at one bend in the stream they came suddenly on a boaconstrictor which was swimming across at another turn they discovered a sight which caused lawrence to exclaim  theres a breakfast for you quashy  what would you say to that  id like to hab im cooked massa  the reference was to an alligator which was crossing the stream a few yards ahead of them with a live boa in his jaws  the huge serpent was about twelve feet long and wriggled horribly to escape but the monster had it fast by the middle  evidently its doom was fixed  several tapirs and a band of grunting peccaries were also seen but all these were passed without molestation for the ambitions of our hunters that day soared to nothing less than the tiger of the american jungles the sneaking lithe strong and muchdreaded jaguar  spotted tiger seemed to have at last become fully aware of the spirit of his companions for he took no apparent note of the various animals seen as they passed along and evidently was on the outlook for the monarch of the jungle  having been told by pedro that he was a celebrated hunter lawrence felt sure that he would lead them to success  why you no shoot de deer an pepper de alligators massa asked quashy at last after several of the creatures mentioned had been seen and passed  because i dont want them returned lawrence and i have no pleasure in useless destruction of life  besides i am anxious to shoot a jaguar having a strong wish to take home the claws and skull of one the first for my friends the last for a museum  when we want food i will shoot deer or anything else thats eatable  quashy remained silent  he seemed to be revolving his masters reply in a philosophical way when something between a snarl and a growl turned his thoughts sharply into another channel  tiger quietly prepared his bow and arrows and laid his spears so that they should be handy  lawrence and the negro also got ready their weapons and then they advanced with caution dipping their paddles lightly and gazing earnestly into the jungle on the right bank of the stream    chapter fourteen  the hunt continued one of the hunters almost concluded  explorations indulged in and a capture effected  dar massa dar he is exclaimed quashy in a hoarse whisper pointing into the bushes  nonsense man replied lawrence in a low voice its only an anthill  even in that moment of excitement lawrence could scarce refrain from laughter at the face of his humble follower for quashys business in life had not accustomed him to much sport at any time and the prospect of actually assisting at the slaughter of a jaguar or a puma had stirred every nerve and fibre of his black being into intense excitation so that his eyes and nostrils were dilated to the utmost and he panted vehementlywith hope of course not fear  tiger on the contrary was cool and calm though watchful  he paid no attention whatever to his companions being too well acquainted with his work to stand in need of either advice or assistance from them  as guide the savage occupied the bow of the canoe lawrence sat in the middle and quashy in the stern for he understood how to steer  having been admonished to hold his tongue he crouched so as if possible to diminish his size  he also pursed his lipsand what a tight rounding and projecting of superfluous flesh that pursing was no tongue can adequately tell  he also glared and this talking with the eyes was a mute sermon in itself  yet no jaguar could be seen  silently with dip of paddle that made no sound and glide of craft through the water that produced only an oily ripple they slowly ascended the stream  at first lawrence had seized his fowlingpiece which was charged with ball for the occasion but as time passed and the indian showed no intention of landing he laid the gun down and again took up his paddle  after a time through some inadvertence of quashy the canoe was sent rather close in among the reeds and giant leaves of the bank  that was stupid of you quash said lawrence as he stood up to assist tiger in backing out  das true massa said the negro in profoundest humility of selfcondemnation is a black idjit  as the fore part of the canoe had touched on a mudbank lawrence seized one of the indians lances and used the butt end as a pole with which to push off  under this impulse the canoe was gradually sliding into deep water when a rustling of the leaves was heard and next instant a fullsized jaguar sprang upon the indian with catlike agility  whether the brute had slipped on the muddy bank we cannot say but it missed its aim and instead of alighting on the shoulders of the man it merely struck him on the head with one of its paws in passing and went with a tremendous splash into the water  tiger fell forward insensible from the severe scalpwound inflicted next instant the jaguar rose grasped the edge of the canoe and almost overturned it as it strove to climb in and there is no doubt that in another moment it would have succeeded for the attack was so sudden that quashy sat paralysed while lawrence forgot his pistols and his gun lay in the bottom of the canoe  happily however he recovered enough of presence of mind to use the lance in his hands  turning the point of the weapon to the jaguars mouth he thrust it in with such tremendous force that it passed right down its throat and into its very vitals  with a gasping snarl the monster fell back into the stream and was quickly drowned as well as impaled  help me to haul him on board cried lawrence  thus awakened the negro relieving his feelings by giving vent to a roar which partook somewhat of a cheer seized the jaguars tail  his master grasped its ears and in another moment it lay in the bottom of the canoe  now help to lay the poor fellow beside it said lawrence  o massahe not dead eh groaned the negro as he assisted in the work  no nor likely to die yet a while replied lawrence with much satisfaction as he examined and bound up the scalpwound  it is not deep hell soon come round but we must get him home without delay out with your paddle quashy and use it well  ill take the bow  the canoe which during these proceedings had been floating slowly down stream was now turned in the right direction and in a short time was out upon the larger river  here however they had to labour with energy against the stream and it was far on in the afternoon before they came in sight of the indians hut  by that time spotted tiger had partially recovered as lawrence observed during a pause made for rest  on reaching an eddy which carried the canoe in the right direction they rested again  the cessation of paddling appeared to rouse the wounded man for he sat up and with a halfdazed look stared at the head of the dead jaguar on the haunch of which his elbow leaned  then he cast an inquiring look at lawrence who replied to him with a nod and a smile and went on to indicate by means of pantomime what had occurred  he pointed to the animals claws and to tigers head then to the bloody spear which lay at his side and to the jaguars bloodstained throat after which he pointed to his own breast and nodded again  the indian evidently understood him for an expression of gratitude overspread his countenance as he extended his right handenglish fashionfor a shake  our hero was not slow to grasp it and the two exchanged a squeeze which told of lasting friendship and goodwill  a few minutes later and the canoe was run upon the bank in front of the hut where all the children were assembled to receive them  it did not seem as if any of the family were deeply affected by the shaky appearance of the father as he stepped on shore but the younger members evinced feelings of intense delight when the jaguar was lifted out and two of them seizing the tail as a towrope passed it over their shoulders and dragged the carcass up to the hut to show it to their mother  o mothers loving repositories of childhoods joys and woes ye are unquestionably the same in substance and in spirit all the world over  tigers wife was more affected than lawrence expected she would have been by her husbands accident and tended him with anxious care  by taking hold of him and laying him gently down in a corner opposite to that of his sick child lawrence gave him to understand that it was his duty to take rest  to say truth he did not require much persuasion but at once laid his head on his pillow and quietly went to sleep  the hospital is filling rather quickly manuela said lawrence when he had finished tending his new patient and your duties are increasing i fear  no fear  me likes to nuss replied the girl with a look that puzzled the young doctor  it was manuelas fascinating smile that came hardest on our poor hero when she looked grave or sad he could regard her as a mere statue an unusually classicallooking bronze savage but when she smiled there was something so bewitchingly sweet in the lines of her little face that he felt constrained to shut his eyes turn away and groan in spirit to think that she was brown and a savage  was there ever a case he thought so mysteriously miserable so singularly sad as mine  if she were only white i would marry her at once if she would have me for the sake of her gentle spirit alone ay even though she were the child of a costermonger but i cannot i do not love a savage the daughter of a savage chief with a skin the colour of shoe leather  no it is impossible and yet i am in love with her spirit  i know it  i feel it  i never heard of such a strange thing beforea man in love with a portion of a woman and that the immaterial portion  the last word changed the current of his thoughts for it suggested the idea of another portion belonging to some girls with which men are too apt to fall in love  massa de grubs ready said quashy entering the hut at that moment  go to work then quash  dont wait  ill be with you directly  but quashy did wait  he was much too unselfish a son of ebony to think of beginning before his master  when they had seated themselves on the grass outside the hut along with manuela who left her post of duty in order to dine and had made a considerable impression on the alligatorragout and tigersteaks and other delicacies quashy heaved a deep sigh of partial satisfaction and asked if tiger would be well enough to go out hunting next day  i think not said lawrence no doubt he may feel able for it but if he shows any disposition to do so i shall forbid him  how you forbid him when you not can speak hims tongue asked manuela in a mild little voice but with an arch look to which her arched black eyebrows gave intense expression  well replied lawrence laughing i must try signs i suppose as usual  no use massa said quashy nebber make him understan  i gib you a plan  see here  you tie him up hand an foot den we go off huntin by our lone an let him lie till we comes back  lawrence shook his head  i fear he would kill us on our return  no we must just go off early in the morning before he wakes and get manuela to try her hand at signlanguage  she can prevail on him no doubt to remain at home  i vill try said manuela with a laugh  in pursuance of this plan lawrence and quashy rose before broad daylight the following morning launched the little canoe they had used the day before put gun spears etcetera on board and were about to push off when one of the boys of the family ran down and seemed to wish to accompany them  wed better take him said lawrence hes not very big or old but he seems intelligent enough and no doubt knows something of his fathers haunts and sporting customs  yous right massa assented the negro  lawrence made a sign to the lad to embark and quashy backed the invitation with  jump aboord leetle cub  instead of obeying leetle cub ran up into the bush but presently returned with a long stick like a headless lance a bow and arrows and an instrument resembling a large grappling anchor made of wood placing these softly in the canoe the little fellow who seemed to be about ten years of age stepped in and they all pushed off into the rivergetting out of sight of the hut without having roused any one turning into the same stream which they had visited the day before they pushed past the place where the jaguar had been killed and entered on an exploration as lawrence called it  im very fond of an exploration quashy he said dipping his paddle softly and working gently for there was so little current that it seemed more like the narrows of a lake than a stream  yes is bery fond ob sploration too massa replied the negro with a selfsatisfied nod  it am so nice not to know whar yous gwine to or whar yous comin to or whos dar or whos not dar or what fishll turn up or what beastll turn down or what nixtoh it am so jolly what you sniggerin at you dirty leetle cub  the question was put to the indian boy who seemed much amused by something he saw up among the trees  looking up they saw at least a dozen red monkeys grinning at them and one of thesea small onewas hanging on by its fathers tail  oh shoot shoot cried quashy to lawrence opening his great eyes eagerly  deys so good to eat  no quash i wont shoot  we have shot enough of fat ducks to feed us all for one or two days at least  besides i cant bear to kill monkeys  it feels so like committing murder  while he was yet speaking leetle cub had taken up the long lancelike stick before mentioned and pointed it at the monkeys  it was a blowpipe  before lawrence could interfere the short arrow with which it was charged had sped on its mission with deadly aim and the smallest monkey relaxing its hold of the paternal tail fell without even a cry into the watershot through the heart  lawrence said nothing but resolving that if the boy should attempt such another shot he would disturb his aim he dipped his paddle vigorously and pushed up the river  coming at last to an open space where the stream widened into something like a little pond they observed an erection of timber on the bank which aroused their curiosity  it also seemed to arouse the cubs interest for he made somewhat excited signs that he wished to land there  willing to humour him they ran the canoe on the beach  leetle cub jumped out at once and taking up the anchorlike piece of wood before mentioned went with it towards the timber erection  i do believe it is an alligatorhook said lawrence  das a fact said quashy well washum by which he meant well watch him  it was indeed interesting to watch that little fellowwho was evidently in all respects a thorough chip of the old blockas he went about his work quietly yet with an undercurrent of excitement which he was not entirely able to conceal  he took his bow and arrows as well as the blowpipe on shore and laid them at his side so as to be ready at hand in case of emergency while he baited the alligatorhook with the dead monkey  the hook was simple  it consisted of four pieces of tough hard wood about a foot long and the thickness of a mans thumb  these were tied to the end of a stout rope made of raw hide and so arranged that their points were directed backwards and curved somewhat outwardsthus forming as it were four huge barbs  the dead monkey was placed on and around this horrible hookif we may so term it  the delicate morsel was then attached to the end of a pole which stretched over the stream so that the bait when fixed remained suspended just above the water the slack of the rope was then made fast to a tree  thus the arrangement was such as to compel the alligator to raise himself well out of the water to obtain his mouthful  while leetle cub was engaged in erecting this cumbrous machine a young alligator about a foot long crawled out from under some leaves on the bank close to him  the urchin saw it instantly seized his bow and in a moment transfixed it with an arrow  the fury of the little creature infant though it was seemed tremendous  it turned round snapping viciously at the arrow and would probably have escaped with it into the water if another shot from the same unerring hand had not terminated its career  after setting his line the cub carried the little alligator to the canoe and put it carefully therein  das what dey make de soup ob said quashy  the ragout you mean  dun know whats a ragoo massa  we calls it soup  anyhow its bery good  yes quash its not bad  but look there our daring and expert young hunter evidently wants us to land for he is pointing to the bush shall we go  praps its as well massa  ob course no alligators sitch a fool as swaller dat little moutful when wes alookin at it  i spose leetle cub wants us to go away an gib em a chance  having made up their minds to gratify the little fellow they landed and accompanied him into the woods  he seemed quite to expect that they would do so and follow his lead  he set off at a smart pace in advance of them carrying his bow on his shoulder  lawrence was well repaid by this walk because it led him into and through scenery of a more striking and beautiful character than he had yet seen of its kind  in many places the trees formed long aisles and vaulted colonnades and arches so regular that it seemed as though they had been planted by the hand of man  elsewhere the chaos of tree and shrub flower and fern and twining root was so indescribable that it seemed as if chance and haphazard had originated it all but the mind of our hero was cast if we may say so in too logical a mould to accept such an absurd origin for anything  my father made it all he said mentally with a glow of enthusiasm and although like a little child gazing at an intricate machine i see not the order or arrangement certain am i that both must be there  between the treestems they saw anthills fully five or six feet high from the trees hung thousands of orchids of various colours and so attractive was the aspect of things overhead that lawrence was more than once tripped up by the long tangled grasses through which in some parts they had to push their way  of course there were plenty of parrots and monkeys and other creatures to make the forest lively indeed in some parts there seemed a prospect of its becoming still more lively for their little guide pointed out in soft places the footprints of tapirs and jaguars which seemed to be quite fresh  lizards innumerable crossed their path at every point snakes were seen gliding out of their waya fortunate tendency on the part of most snakesand the woods resounded with the singing of the yapu a bird something like a blackbird with yellow tips to its wings and somewhat like the mockingbird in that it imitated every other bird in the forest whether there is jealousy between the yapu and the parrot we have not been able to ascertain but if birds are like men in their sentiments we fear it is more than probable  unlike man however the yapu prefers to sing upsidedown swinging the while from the branch of a tree and ruffling its plumage  hallo massa  look dar said quashy pointing with intense surprise at a neighbouring treestem  did you ebber see a crab climbin up a tree  i certainly never did replied lawrence as he looked in the direction indicated where he saw not a crab indeed but a monstrous hairy spider as large as a goodlysized crab  stepping forward to examine the creature he was surprised to have his hat twitched off his head and found that it was the web of the said spider which had done it afterwards he learned that the spider in question subsists by catching little birds and that its bite is not so venomous as that of a smaller kind which abounds in the woods there  not being desirous of testing the creatures power in that way at the time he contented himself with inspecting it and listening to a learned dissertation on spiders in general from quashy as he afterwards walked on  good fortune seemed to smile on them that day for they had not advanced a hundred yards further when two large jaguars crossed their path  it is probable that they did not see the hunters for they did not look up but gliding catlike into the jungle quickly disappeared  perhaps it was fortunate that lawrence and his man recovered their presence of mind when too late for if they had fired hastily and only wounded the creatures it might have brought to an abrupt end their terrestrial career  as it was  quashy recovered with a gasp drew his two doublebarrelled pistols which in his eagerness he neglected to cock and with one in each hand rushed yelling after the jaguars lawrence cocked his gun and followed at a smart though more sedate pace  leetle cub who probably thought them both fools ran after them with a broad grin on his dingy countenance  we need scarcely say that the pursuit was useless  quashy returned in a few minutes with labouring breath and streaming at every pore lawrence scarcely less blown sat down on a fallen tree and laughed when his lungs permitted  of course he was joined by the sympathetic black echoed by the small boy and imitatednot badlyby a number of parrots which wisely availed themselves of the rare opportunity to learn a lesson from man  as they advanced the path became more encumbered and difficult to traverse so they determined to return  their little guide however seemed to object very strongly and made wonderful gesticulations in his efforts to induce them to go on  lawrence however remained firm seeing at last that his followers had determined to rebel the cub gave up trying to influence them scooped a quantity of wild honey out of a hole in a tree and sitting down in a halfsulky mood sought to console himself by eating the same  come well follow you in that at all events said lawrence seating himself beside the child and regaling himself with the sweet food quashy followed his example with right goodwill  when their modest meal was over they returned to the river  the little boy on nearing it ran anxiously forward in advance and soon they perceived by his frantic gesticulations and shouts that something of interest awaited them there  hes cotched cried quashy and darted off as if shot from a catapult  lawrence followed using his long legs to such advantage that he was not far behind his man for although gifted with greater powers of selfrestraint than quashy our hero was not a whit behind him in strong enthusiasm  they found that an alligatornot indeed of the largest size but nevertheless about six or seven feet longhad swallowed the monkey and was tugging at the rope like a mad thingturning round and round in its rage and smacking the water with its resounding tail  instantly they all laid hold of the rope and began to drag it towards the bank  how shall we manage to kill it said lawrence as the monster came close in  stick im shot im hang im  nebber mind dat  git im fustkill im arter gasped the negro as he strained at the rope ably seconded by his comrades  it was a hard tussle and might have been unsuccessful if lawrence and quashy had not possessed more than average physical strength  as it was they pulled the monstrous animal just near enough to get his head clear of the water and then putting several balls into him killed him outright  plenty ragoo now massa exclaimed the negro with a broad grin after they had stowed the carcass in the canoe  yes quash more than enough  leetle cub seemed to have his mind running in the same direction for he eyed the alligator with longing looks and licked his lips expressively as they reentered the canoe shoved off and directed the bow homeward    chapter fifteen  an unexpected attack and an unlookedfor arrival  thus excitingly and we presume pleasantly passed the time at tigers hut during three days  in that period the indian hunter quite recovered from his wounds and his little girl manca by name began to show decided signs of amendment under manuelas careful nursing  during that period also spotted tiger conducted his visitors to many scenes of beauty where the young doctor not only shot a variety of game large and small feathered and furred but made acquaintance with many quite new species of plants  he collected and preserved a few of the rarest of these but owing to the style of travelling both past and prospective he had to deny himself much in that respect  likewise during those three days he made acquaintance with the numerous pets of tigers householdnot the human pets although he became a great favourite with these also but the loweranimal pets the turtle and the noisy parrot already mentioned a fat little guineapig a most melancholy red monkey a young jaguar a very juvenile tapir a flamingo and other creatures  the tapir was about the size of a six months old pig  instead of the blackish brown hair peculiar to the adult tapir its coat was striped longitudinally with black grey and yellow and was so brilliant in colour that the animal was quite a dazzling pet besides which it was an affectionate little thing and particularly susceptible to the pleasure of being tickled  the tame jaguar however was a very different style of animal  it did indeed like to be caressed but it had gradually grown too large to be a safe plaything and there was an occasional gleam in its eye which rendered lawrence uneasy when he saw the indian children playing with it  it was about the size of a small newfoundland dog but had grown up so gradually with the family that they appeared not to realise the danger attending its great strength  spotted tiger himself had indeed perceived something of it for at the time we write of he had tied the animal to a stake with a stout rope which was long enough to permit of his ranging in a wide circle  little did lawrence dream of the part that peculiar pet was to play before the period of three days closed  it was on the evening of the third day  they were all seated round a fire at supper in front of the hut  lawrence sat beside manuela as usual and was taking much pains to teach her the correct pronunciation of an english word of which she made a wonderful bungle and seemed to derive much amusement from the fact to judge from her occasional peals of silvery laughter  we use the word advisedly in deference to the feelings of our hero who thought and called the laughter silvery  tiger sat on the girls other side and quashy was seated opposite with little cub and several of the lesser cubs beside him  the pet jaguar crouched close to its stake glaring at them  there was nothing unusual either in the attitude or the glare to cause anxiety yet lawrence did not like it and while engaged in imparting the difficult lesson referred to kept his eye on the brute  suddenly without warning or roar the dangerous pet sprang at manuela why it selected her we cannot imagine unless it was that being a brute of good taste it chose her as the tenderest of the party  the strong cord by which it was fastened snapped like a piece of thread but lawrence threw himself in front of the girl caught the animal by the throat and held him with both hands as if in a vice  instantly every claw of the four paws was buried in the flesh of his legs and arms and he would certainly have been fearfully rent by his powerful antagonist if tiger had not with lightning stroke buried his long keen knife in the animals heart  so swiftly and effectually was the deed done that the jaguar next moment hung limp and dead in our heros grasp  dropping it on the ground he turned up his sleeves to examine the wounds  deep enough but not lacerated thank god he said  they wont give me much trouble  come quash into the bush and help me to look at the other scratches and dress them  i must appoint you assistantsurgeon for the occasion  manuela murmured her thanks in a deep tremulous voice that said much for her power of gratitude and timidly taking the youths hand as he passed humbly touched it with her lips  the wounds were soon dressed and thanks to tigers promptitude they did not afterwards give much trouble  that night as they were about to retire to their several hammocks lawrence went up to the indian girl and for the first time held out his hand for a shake in the white mans fashion  im glad manuela he said as she frankly grasped it that it has pleased god to make me the instrument ofofprotecting you  twice replied the girl quickly and then paused with a confused lookhow you say twiceor two times  say which you like replied lawrence with a hearty laugh the words will sound equally well from your lips but twice is the right way  well twice you have save me  i am gratitude  my father will be gratitude  tell me manuela returned lawrence earnestly is your father a chief  yesa great chief  there was a peculiar smile on the girls lips as she said this that disconcerted him  we have said that he was naturally shy  he had intended to follow up his first question by asking if her father was descended from the incas but the peculiar smile checked him  he bade her goodnight and turned abruptly away  while he was sitting by the fire meditating on this matter he heard a step in the bushes  tiger who had already retired to his hammock also heard it and bounded to his feet  next instant pedro glided into the circle of light and saluted them  he appeared to be worn out with exhaustion for flinging himself on the ground beside the fire he rested his head in silence for a few minutes on a poncho  then observing a piece of manioca cake that had been dropped by some one at supper he took it up and ate it almost ravenously  why you seem to be starving pedro said lawrence earnestly  not so bad as that returned pedro with a faint smile  a man can scarcely be said to starve with so many of the fruits of the earth around him  but ive been hard pressed since early morning and  stay interrupted lawrence before you say another word i will go and fetch you some food  no need senhor  my old friend spotted tiger has forestalled you  this was true  the indian having seen at a glance how matters stood had gone up to the hut without speaking  he now returned with a bowl of boiled maize a bunch of bananas and a jar of water  while his friend was busy with these he asked a few questions which pedro answered briefly  from the expression of the indians face lawrence gathered that these replies caused him some anxiety  as the guides appetite became gradually appeased his loquacity increased but he made few remarks to lawrence until the meal was finished  then turning to him with a sigh of contentment he said  ive been slightly wounded senhor but i doubt not that you can soon put me all right  taking off his poncho as he spoke and pushing aside his light cotton shirt he revealed the fact that his left breast was bound with a piece of bloodstained calico  lawrence at once examined the wound  a slight wound indeed he said but vigorously dealt  i can see thatand youve had a narrow escape too  half an inch higher up would have been fatal  yes it was meant to kill was pedros quiet rejoinder but thank god i had a friend near who meant to save and he turned the knife aside in time  sit down now ill tell you how it happened  my business required me to visit a certain tribe of indians at a considerable distance from here where the country is somewhat disturbed and the white inhabitants are threatening to cut each others throats by way of mending political affairs  they took me for a spy it is not the first time that i have been taken for a spy and i suppose it wont be the last continued pedro with a grave smile  of course i protested my innocence explained my object and showed that my visit was one of peace  they would have let me go if an enemy had not been in the camp  you see senhor armstrong i have many enemies as well as friends everywhere  that is always the case with men who hold decided principles and try to act up to them with vigour returned lawrence  so i have found it rejoined pedro looking earnestly at his young friend  you have had a more varied experience of life than i  has that been your experience too  it has  but i suspect that my experience of life has not been so much varied as yours pedro for it has been chiefly among civilised communities until now  still i have observed that it is only those who swim with the current of public opinion and jostle nobody who manage to keep friends with everybody  when a man ventures to think for himselfas he ought to doand take action he is sure to have enemies as well as friendssupposing of course that he is a man of any power or influence  well i suppose it is because i try to have influence rejoined pedro that i manage to have plenty of friends and foesthe last being sometimes unreasonably bitter  that proves your influence to be powerful said lawrence  hm it may be so  i know not  time will show  at all events this enemy of mine stirred up a number of men like himself in the camp to such an extent that they seized me and carried me to the banks of their river with the purpose of throwing me to the alligators  some of those who were in my favour ran along with them and among them i observed one man who i knew would be willing to risk his life for me  this gave me hope but my enemy did not approve of the mode of my execution he thoughtrightlythat a chance of escape was involved in it so to make sure i suppose he came close up and when they were on the point of throwing me into the river he drew his knife and made a plunge at my heart  my friend must have suspected something of the sort for he had also pushed close to me and i saw him give the wouldbe murderer the jostle that turned his knife aside  next moment i was in the river  i knew that it swarmed with alligators and felt an uncomfortable thrill as i went in head foremost but i knew also that i was a strong and swift swimmer so i struck out for my life to the opposite bank which was not more than forty yards off  i splashed as much as i could for you know senhor that splashing tends to keep alligators off though it is not always successful  before i had made half a dozen strokes however i felt my flesh creep  do you know what it feels like to have your flesh creep  no not exactly replied lawrence but i have a pretty good guess as to what you mean  well resumed the guide i felt my flesh creep for i heard a most awful puffing and splashing close behind me  at the same time i heard a wild cheer on the bank as if my foes were rejoicing at the prospect of my being eaten up  i looked back quickly expecting to see the terrible jaws and the long rows of teeth but to my great surprise i saw only my friend pursuing me with his knife in his teeth as if he wanted to finish me  i understood the thing at once  the good fellow knew that two could make a better splashing than one and he also hoped no doubt that his comrades would give him credit for extreme bravery in thus jumping into such danger for the sakeas they would supposeof killing an enemy  the cheer they gave him showed what they thought on that point  we both gained the opposite banki a few yards in advance  you may be sure i was not slow in bounding up the bank  i could hear the howl of rage with which the villains saw the failure of their plan  what is more i could both hear and see the arrows that were sent after me but through gods blessing none of them touched me and i was soon in the shelter of the woods  i could also hear my friend panting at my heels  im a pretty fair runner continued pedro but my friend is a better he passed me like a deer  come on he cried youve no time to lose  from which i knew he meant that the blackguards would cross the river in canoes and pursue me  he led me across a spit of jungleland where the river took a sudden bend and came out on the bank at the head of a long rapid  on reaching the bank he pulled out a small canoe which had been concealed there and told me to jump in  youll have to run the rapid  its not much of a chance but its your only one  i squeezed his hand thanked him hastily and was soon paddling quickly with the current  in a few moments i heard my friend shouting with rage and brandishing his knife  he was acting i knew  looking back i saw that a number of men had joined him and again the arrows began to drop around me but i was soon beyond their reach and battling with the rapid  well was it for me that i have been much used to canoeing for the words of my friend its not much of a chance were literally true for some minutes i was whirled about by eddies and shoots in such a way that it seems to me now a miracle that i escaped being dashed to pieces several times  i forgot all about my pursuers so great was the danger but when at last i ran out of the lowest shoot into the water below the rapids i saw on looking back that they were still following me along the banks  i was going faster however than they were so i felt easier in my mind till i saw them jump into several canoes and push off in chase  by that time i had more than a mile of start and the sun was setting  now pedro said i to myself its a fair race for your life so bend your back to it my boy  i went on till it grew so dark that i could hardly see twenty yards ahead of me  then i put ashore hauled the canoe up among the reeds climbed into a tree and went to sleep for well i knew that it would be death both to them and me if we continued descending a stream like that in the dark  well i slept like a top for i was dead beat but two or three times i awoke with a tremendous start under the impression that i was falling ive always found it so when obliged to spend the night in the branches of a tree  did you ever sleep so senhor armstrong  lawrence confessed that he had never yet indulged in such birdlike repose  well its not so difficult as you might think continued pedro with a meditative gaze at the fire especially if youre very tired hard pressed for time and in some danger  under these circumstances its wonderful what a fellow can do to make the best of his opportunities you find out somehow the securest way to twine your legs and arms in among the branches and twist your feet and fingers into the forks and twigsdont you know  yes lawrence knew well at least if he did not know exactly he had a powerful imagination  well then long before daylight i was up and off feeling my way as best i could in the first grey glimpses of dawn so that i got a good startat least i thought so but soon i found my pursuers had also started early and were overhauling me and no wonder seeing that their canoes were large and well manned  i now felt that i had no chance of escaping by water but i had by that time got into a part of the country with which i was well acquainted and knew that if i could only reach a certain point before being caught i might take to the bush and cross overland to my friends hut here  that was early this morning  the only trouble i had was that my wound was beginning to give me considerable pain and i felt losing strength for want of food  i had scarce time to cat much less to search for food they pressed me so hard  however a man makes a hard struggle for life so i tightened my belt and set to work with such good will that i was soon a long way ahead of them and got out of sight at a place where the river takes a number of bends and is full of small islands  at last about noon i reached the desired point paddled carefully in among the reeds so as to prevent the savages seeing where i had landed jumped ashore hid the canoe stepped out as hard as i could andhere i am  but exclaimed lawrence with some excitement if you left the indians so recently wont they be close on your heels  no fear  i came here in a straight line overland  by the windings of the river they cannot be here even at the soonest before the afternoon of tomorrow  but they will probably give up the chase long before getting this length  besides if they did arrive they would find a warm reception from four wellarmed men instead of catching one poor unarmed fugitive  but we wont give them the chance  we will be up and away by daybreak  tiger here has agreed to join us in our trip to buenos ayres  he will take his wife and family down stream to his fatherinlaws tribe where they will be safe till his return  are you all well and ready for a start  yes all welland shall be ready as soon as you please  thats right  wheres quashy  close alongside  dont you hear him  lawrence referred to a sound like the drone of a giant mosquito which proceeded from the negros nose for that worthy was a heavy sleeper when not in dangerand had not been disturbed by the arrival of the guide  giving vent to a prolonged yawn pedro rose and stretched himself  then he went up to the sleeping quashy and took him by the nose at the same time putting his hand on his mouth to smother the inevitable yell in its birth  when sufficiently awake to be released with safety the amiable negro was permitted to raise himself and when aware of who had grasped him he beamed with goodwill and gleamed with surprise  get up quashy and help them to pack said pedro curtly we start at daybreak  quashy was on his feet in a moment  dont rouse me till its time to start added pedro who thereupon rolled into the vacant hammock and was asleepperchance in the land of dreamsalmost as soon as his wearied head reposed on the negros pillow    chapter sixteen  tells of absurd as well as evil doings and winds up with a horrid surprise  whether pedros pursuers continued the chase as far as the indian hunters hut we cannot tell for long before noon of the following day our travellers were far from the huntinggrounds of the gallant savage  soon after the usual midday siesta the canoe which contained the whole of the hunters worldly wealth was run on the beach near to the spot where dwelt his fatherinlaw with many members of his tribe  that worthy old man in a light evening costume consisting of a cotton shirt and straw hat came down to receive his children who landed amid much noise with their boys and girls and household gods including the red monkey the parrot the flamingo the fat guineapig the turtle and the infant tapir  the old chief was quite willing to take care of the family during the absence of his soninlaw and was very pressing in his offers of hospitality to the white travellers but pedro refused to delay more than an hour at the village  the old man also evinced a considerable amount of curiosity in regard to manuela and made one or two attempts to engage her in conversation but on being informed by pedro that she belonged to a tribe living halfway between his huntinggrounds and the regions of patagonia and that she did not understand his dialect at all he forbore to question her and satisfied himself with simply gazing  after a farewell which was wonderfully affectionate for savages spotted tiger embarked in pedros canoe and pushing off into the river bade the indians adieu  the canoe in which the party now travelled belonged to tiger and was larger as well as more commodious than that in which they had hitherto journeyed having a gondolalike cabin constructed of grasses and palmleaves underneath which manuela found shelter from the sun  in the evenings pedro could lie at full length on the top of it and smoke his cigarette  they were floating with the current you see and did not require to labour much at the paddles at that time  it would weary the reader were we to continue our description of the daily proceedings of our adventurers in journalistic form  to get on with our tale requires that we should advance by bounds and even flightsnot exactly of fancy but over stretches of space and time though now and then we may find it desirable to creep or even to stand still  we request the reader to creep with us at present and quietly listen while pedro and tiger talk  pedro lies extended on his back on the roof of the gondolalike cabin his hands under his head his knees elevated and a cigarette in his mouth  lawrence and quashy are leaning in more or less lazy attitudes on the gunwale of the canoe indulging now and then in a few remarks which do not merit attention  manuela also in a reclining attitude rests under the shade of the erection on which pedro lies listening to their discourse  tiger is the only one on duty but his labour is light it consists merely of holding the steering oar and guiding the light craft along the smooth current of the river  pedro lies with his head to the stern so that his talk with the indian is conducted so to speak upsidedown  but that does not seem to incommode them for the ideas probably turn right end foremost in passing to and fro  of course their language is in the indian tongue  we translate  tiger said pedro sending a long whiff of smoke straight up towards the bright blue sky where the sun was beginning to descend towards his western couch we shant make much i fear of the men of this part of the country  i did not expect that you would replied the indian giving a gentle turn to his oar in order to clear a mudbank on which a number of alligators were basking comfortably  why so tiger  surely peace and good government are as desirable to them as to others  no doubt but many of them do not love peace  they are young  their blood is hot and they have nothing to do  when that is so war is pleasant to them  it is natural  man must work or play or fight  he cannot lie still  those who are killed cannot return to tell their comrades what fools they have been so those that remain are greater fools than ever  i agree with you tiger but you see it is not the young men who have the making of war though they generally get all the doing of it and the poor women and children take the consequences it is the governors whom one would expect to show some sort of wisdom and recognise the fact that union is strength and that respect for law is the only hope of the land  governors returned tiger in a deep voice are not only fools but villainstyrants  the indian spoke with such evidence of suppressed indignation that pedro tried to look at him  the aspect of his frowning countenance upsidedown was not conducive to gravity  come tiger said pedro with a tendency to laugh they are not all tyrants i know one or two who are not bad fellows  i know one who is a fool and a robber  indeed  what has he done to make you so bitter asked pedro  made us wear spectacles replied the indian sternly  what do you mean  have you not heard about it  no you know i have been away in chili for some time and am ignorant of much that has been going on in these parts  there is in spain a white man i know not who said tiger with an expression of ineffable contempt but he must be the chief of the fools among the white men who seem to me to be all fools together  thank you for the compliment said pedro with a laugh  this white fool continued tiger paying no regard to his friends interruption thought that he would send out here for sale some spectaclesglass things you know that old white men look through when they cannot see  we indians as you know never need such things  we can see well as long as we live  it is supposed that a mistake was made by some one for something like a canoeload of spectacles was sent outso many that in a hundred years the white men could not have used them up  the trader knew not what to do  there was no sale for them he applied to the governorthat robber of whom i have spoken  he said to the trader with a wink of his eyethat sort of wink which the white fool gives when he means to pass from folly to knaverywait he said and you shall see  then he issued an order that no indian should dare to appear in his district or in church during festivaldays without spectacles  the consequence was that the spectacles were all sold  i know not the price of these foolish things but some white men told me they were sold at an enormous profit  although pedro sympathised heartily with his brown friend in his indignation he could not quite repress a smile at the ridiculous ideas called up  fortunately the indian failed to interpret an upsidedown smile particularly with the moustache as it were below instead of above the mouth and a cigarette in the lips  it was too complicated  and were you obliged to buy and wear a pair of these spectacles tiger asked pedro after a few silent puffs  yeslook here they are he replied with inconceivable bitterness drawing forth the implements of vision from his pouch and fixing them on his nose with intense disgust  then suddenly plucking them off he hurled them into the river and said savagelyi was a christian once but i am not a christian now  how what do you mean asked pedro raising himself on his elbow at this so as to look straightly as well as gravely at his friend  i mean that the religion of such men must be false growled the indian somewhat defiantly  now tiger returned his friend in a remonstrative tone that is not spoken with your usual wisdom  the religion which a man professes may be true though his profession of it may be false  however i am not unwilling to admit that the view of our religion which is presented in this land is falsevery false  nevertheless christianity is true  i will have some talk with you at another time on this subject my friend meanwhile let us return to the point from which we broke offthe disturbed state of this unhappy country  let us pause here reader to assure you that this incident of the spectacles is no fiction  well would it be for the south american republics at this day as well as for the good name of spain if the poor aborigines of south america had nothing more serious to complain of than the arbitrary act of the dishonest governor referred to but it is a melancholy fact that ever since the conquest of peru by pizarro the spaniards have treated the indians with brutal severity and it is no wonder that revenge of the fiercest nature still lingers in the breasts of the descendants of those unfortunate savages  probably our reader knows that the peruvian region of the andes is rich in gold and silvermines  these the spanish conquerors worked by means of indian slave labour  not long after the conquest a compulsory system of personal toil was established whereby a certain proportion of the natives of each district were appointed by lot to work in the mines every individual who obtained a grant of a mine became entitled to a certain number of indians to work it and every mine which remained unwrought for a year and a day became the property of any one who chose to claim and work it  as there were many hundreds of mines registered in peru alone it may be imagined what a host of indians were consequently condemned to a degraded state of slavery  the labour of the mines was so dreadful that each unfortunate on whom the lot fell considered it equivalent to his deathwarrant  and that there was ground for this belief is proved by the fact that not more than one in six of the indians condemned to the mines survived the treatment there inflicted  each mitayo or conscript received nominally two shillings a day  but he never actually received it  on his fate being fixed by lot the poor fellow carried his wife and children to the mines with him and made arrangements for never again returning home  his food and lodging being supplied by his employers owners were furnished at such an extravagant rate that he always found himself in debt at the end of his first yearif he outlived it in that case he was not allowed to leave until his debt was paid which of course it never was  usually however the bad air and heavy labour of the mines coupled with grief told so much on men accustomed to the fresh air and free life of the wilderness that death closed the scene before the first year of servitude was out  it is said that above eight millions of natives have perished thus in the mines of peru  we have shown briefly one of the many phases of tyrannical cruelty practised by the conquerors of the land  here is another specimen  at first there were few merchants in peru therefore privilege was granted to the spanish corregidors or governors of districts to import goods suitable for indians and barter them at a fair price  of course this permission was abused and trade became a compulsory and disgraceful traffic  useless and worthless articles and damaged goodsrazors for instance silk stockings velvets etceterawere forced on indians who preferred naked feet and had no beards  the deeds of the soldiers miners and governors were but too readily copied by the priests many of whom were rapacious villains who had chosen the crucifix as their weapon instead of the sword  one priest for instance besides his regular dues and fees received during the year as presents which he exacted at certain festivals 200 sheep 6000 head of poultry 4000 guineapigs and 50000 eggs and he would not say mass on those festivaldays until a due proportion of the presents was delivered  and this case of extortion is not told of one of the priests of old  it occurred in the second quarter of the present century  another priest summoned a widow to make declaration of the property left her by her husband so that he might fix the scale of his burial fees  he made a high demand  she implored his mercy reminding him of her large family  he was inexorable but offered to give up his claim if she would give him her eldest sona boy of eightto be sold as a slave or given away as a present  it seems that the senhoras of those lands want such boys to carry their kneeling carpets  the civil authorities could not be appealed to in this case  there was no redress so the widow had to agree to give up her son  doubtless both in camp and in church there may have been good men but if so they form an almost invisible minority on the page of peruvian history  in short tyranny in every form was and for centuries has been practised by the white men on the savages and it is not a matter of wonder that the memory of these things rankles in the indians bosom even at the present time and that in recent books of travel we read of deeds of diabolical cruelty and revenge which we in peaceful england are too apt to think of as belonging exclusively to the days of old  but let us return to our friends in the little canoe  to tell you the truth said pedro to the indian i am deeply disappointed with the result of my mission  it is not so much that men do not see the advantages and necessity for union as that they are heartless and indifferentcaring nothing apparently for the welfare of the land so long as the wants and pleasures of the present hour are supplied  has it ever been otherwise asked tiger with grave severity of expression  well i confess that my reading of history does not warrant me to say that it has but my reading of the good creators word entitles me to hope for and strive after better times  i know not returned the indian with a faroff pensive look what your histories say  i cannot read  there are no books in my tongue but my memory is strong  the stories true stories of my fathers reach very far backto the time before the white man came to curse the landand i remember no time in which men did not desire each others property and slay each other for revenge  it is mans nature as it is the rivers nature to flow down hill  it is mans fallen not his first nature said pedro  things were as bad in england once  they are not quite so bad now  gods law has made the difference  however we must take things here as we find them and im sorry to think that up to this point my mission has been a failure  indeed the last effort as you know nearly cost me my life  and what will you now do asked tiger  i will visit a few more places in the hope that some of the people may support us  after that ill mount and away over the pampas to buenos ayres see the colonel and deliver manuela to her father  the whitehaired chief asked tiger  even so replied pedro  during the foregoing conversation quashy had thrust his fat nose down on a plank and gone to sleep while lawrence and manuela having nothing better to do taught each other spanish and english respectively  and strange though it may appear it is a fact that manuela with all her quickwitted intelligence was wonderfully slow at learning english  to lawrences intense astonishment and it must be confessed to his no small disappointment the indian maiden not only made the same blunders over and over again and seemed to be incapable of making progress but even laughed at her own stupidity  this somewhat cooled his admiration of her character which coolness afforded him satisfaction rather than the reverse as going far to prove that he was not really as how could he be in love with the brownskinned uneducated halfsavage girl but only much impressed with her amiable qualities  poor fellow he was much comforted by these thoughts because had it been otherwise how terrible would have been his fateeither on the one hand to marry her and go and dwell with her savage relationsperhaps be compelled to paint his visage scarlet with arabesque devices in charcoal and go on the warpath against the white man or on the other hand to introduce his indian bride into the salons of civilisation with the certainty of beholding the sneer of contempt on the face of outraged society with the probability of innumerable violations of the rules of etiquette and the possibility of manuela exhibiting the squaws preference for the floor to a chair fingers to knives and forks andpooh the thing was absurd utterly out of the question  towards sunset they came to a part of the river where there were a good many sandbanks as well as extensive reaches of sand along shore  on one of these lowlying spits they drew up the canoe and encamped for that night in the bushes close enough to the edge to be able to see the river where a widespreading tree canopied them from the dews of night  solemn and inexpressibly sad were the views of life taken by lawrence that night as he stood by the rivers brink in the moonlight while his companions were preparing the evening meal and gave himself up to the contemplation of things past present and to comewhich is very much like saying that he thought about nothing in particular  what he felt quite sure of was that he was horribly depresseddissatisfied with himself his companions and his surroundings and ashamed in no small degree of his dissatisfaction  as well he might be for were not his companions particularly agreeable and were not his surroundings exquisitely beautiful and intensely romantic  the moon in a cloudless sky glittered in the broad stream and threw its rippling silver treasures at his very feet  a gentle balmy air fanned his cheek on which mantled the hue of redundant health and the tremendous puffs and longdrawn sighs of the alligators with the growl of jaguars croak and whistle of frogs and the voice of the howling monkey combined to fill his ear with the music of thrilling romance if not of sweetness  what more could i wish he murmured selfreproachfully  a tremendous slap on the facedealt by his own hand as a giant mosquito found and probed some tenderer spot than usualreminded him that some few things which he did not wish for were left to mingle in his cup of too great felicity and reduce it like water in overproof whisky to the level of human capacity  still dissatisfied despite his reflections he returned to the fire under the spreading tree and sat down to enjoy a splendid basin of turtle soupsoup prepared by tiger the day before from the flesh of a turtle slain by his own hand and warmed up for the supper of that evening  a large tin dish or tureen full of the same was placed at his elbow to tempt his appetite which to say truth required no tempting  manuela having already supped sat with her little hands clasped in her lap and her lustrous eyes gazing pensively into the fire  perhaps she was attempting to read her fortune in the blazing embers  perchance engaged in thinking of that very common subjectnothing  if pedro had smoked the same thing it would have been better for his health and pocket but pedro thinking otherwise fumigated his fine moustache and disconcerted the mosquitoes in the region of his nose  quashy having just replenished the fire until the logs rose two feet or more from the ground turned his back on the same warmed his hands behind him and gazed up through the overarching boughs at the starry sky with that wistfully philosophical expression which negroes are apt to assume when their thoughts are too deep or too complex for utterance  spotted tiger continued to dally with the turtle soup and seemed loath to give in as he slowly with many a pause between raised the huge iron spoon to his lips  no one seemed inclined to break the silence into which they had sunk for all were more or less fatigued and it seemed as if the very brutes around sympathised with them for there was a perceptible lull in the whistling of the frogs the howling monkeys appeared to have gone to rest and the sighing alligators to have subsided and sunk so that the breaking of a twig or the falling of a leaf was perceptible to the listening ear  things were in this state of profound and peaceful calm when a slight rustling was heard among the branches of the tree above them  the instant glare of quashys eyes the gaze of manuelas the cock of pedros ear and the sudden pause of our heros spoon on its way to his lips were sights to behold  the indian alone seemed comparatively indifferent to the sound though he looked up inquiringly  at that moment there burst forth an earsplitting marrowshrivelling bloodcurdling yell that seemed to rouse the entire universe into a state of wild insanity  there could be no mistaking itthe peculiar horrid shrieking only too familiar warwhoop of the painted savage  quashy staggered back  he could not recover himself for a log had caught his heel  to sit down on the fire he knew would be death therefore he bounded over it backwards and fell into lawrences lap crushing that youths plate almost into the region where the soup had already gone and dashing his feet into the tureen  lawrence roared manuela shrieked pedro sprang up and seized his weapons  so did lawrence and his man regardless of the soup  tiger alone sat still conveying the iron spoon slowly to his lips but with a peculiar motion of his broad shoulders which suggested that the usually grave savage was convulsed with internal laughter  ghosts and crokidileswhats dat gasped quashy staring up into the tree and ready to fire at the first visible object  tiger also looked up made a peculiar sound with his mouth and held out his hand  immediately a huge bird responding to the call descended from the tree and settled on his wrist  quashys brief commentary explained it all  purrit  it was indeed the indians faithful petparrot which he had taught thus to raise the warcry of his tribe and which having bestowed its entire affections on its master was in the habit of taking occasional flights after him when he went away from home    chapter seventeen  in which ingenuity comicality ferocity eccentricity fecundity and some other ities in man and beast are mentioned  plain sailing fair weather perpetual calm and sunshine are not the lot of any man or woman here  the weather that fertile source of human intercourse is occasionally boisterous as well as serene in the regions of peru and bolivia  a day or two after the events recounted in the last chapter our travellers experienced a sudden change  we have said that they had come to a part of the river where there were occasional stretches of sand and here they had evidence of the improvident nature of indians in the number of turtleshells found lying on the sands with parts of the animals still adhering to them  on one particular spot they found a space of about seventy yards in diameter completely covered with the upper and under shells of turtles these had evidently been cut asunder violently with hatchets and reddishbrown furrows in the sands told where streams of blood had flowed during the massacre  what wanton slaughter exclaimed lawrence as he and his friends stood looking at the scene  and it is not long since it was done said pedro for the fleshat least whats left of itis still fresh  ugh you brutes exclaimed quashy referring to a number of urubu vultures which stood on the shells all more or less gorged some still tearing sleepily at the meat others standing in apoplectic apathy quite unable to fly  they counted upwards of three hundred dead turtles and this carnage it was afterwards ascertained had been the work of only a dozen or so of indiansnot for food but for the sake of the fine yellow fat covering the intestines which formed an article of commerce at the time between the red men and the white  that night after supper time the party busied themselves in making mosquitocurtains out of a small quantity of green muslin obtained from spotted tigers fatherinlaw who had received it from the missionaries  the supply being quite insufficient to make curtains for them all quashy had set his fertile brain to work and devised a species of net which having never been seen in that country before deserves special notice  it may serve as a hint to other mortals similarly situated and tormented  you mus know remarked quashy to his friends who watched him while he fabricated the first of these curtains dat my granfadder was a injineer an some ob his geenus comed down to me  dats why is so clebber wid my hands  has you got dem hoops tied massa  all right quashy im just finishing the last one  thereare these the right sizes  das right massa  biggest two one futt six in dameter oder two leetle ones one futt  now you looks here ladies an genlemen  see is made a bag ob dis muzzlin bout two futt six long an bout two futt wide  well one end ob de bag is close upas you see  tother end am openas you bhold  vwalla

can git inside an dere you are  no skeeters git at me now  but quash said lawrence who had watched the making of this ingenious device as well as lent assistance there are mosquitoes inside it even now and with such swarms as are about us how will you keep them out while putting the thing on  don call it a ting massa said quashy with a dignified look call it a veil  deres nuflin easier  see here  he rose took off the veil and flattened the hoops down on each other so as to drive out all that might be inside  then he stepped to leeward of the fire held his breath for a few seconds while in the smoke quickly adjusted his novel headpiece and stood up fully armed against the skeeters  but still objected lawrence how can you lay your head on your pillow with such a thingbeg pardon such a veil on  nuffin easier massa  he illustrated his point by rolling over into one of the nearest hammockswhich had already been hungand laying his head down when of course the machine bulged away from his black face and the discomfited millions kept thrusting their proboscesand doubtless making faces at himineffectually  but how if you should want to roll about in your sleep asked pedro  dont want to roll about in your sleep replied the negro curtly  it is right to say that in spite of the advice thus firmly given quashy did roll in his sleep that night with the result that his nose at last got close to the veil and pressed against it  no malignant foe ever took advantage of an enemys weak point more promptly than did the skeeters of quashys nocturnal trumpet  they settled on its point with a species of triumphant hum  they warred with each other in their bloodthirsty desire to seize on the delicate but limited morsel  it was cut and come againat least it was cut away and let others come onas long as the chance lasted  and the consequence was that quashy rose next morning with two noses  his natural nose being a mere lump of fat and the lump raised on it being much the same in form and size with the original we feel justified in saying that he had two nosesnearly  notwithstanding it is but fair to add that the veils were afterwards pronounced a great success  but to return  that night after the veils in question had been made and put on by all except tiger who was skeetoproof and the happy wearers were steeped in blissful repose a tremendous hurricane burst upon them with thunder lightning and rain  the wind came in furious gusts which tore away some of the veils overturned the hammocks scattered the bedding extinguished the fire drenched them to the skin and otherwise rendered them supremely miserable  retiring to a thicker part of the jungle they cut down branches and made a temporary erection which they covered with ponchos and blankets but as everything had to be done in the dark it was a wretched affair and at the best only a partial protection  into the furthest extremity of this hut poor manuela crept  the others followed and there they all sat or reclined shivering till morning  about daybreak lawrence heard pedro and the indian girl conversing in the indian language and in unusually earnest tones which were interrupted once or twice by slight laughter  he wondered much what they found to laugh at but having become by that time accustomed to the guides little touches of mystery and being very sleepy he did not trouble himself about it long  the storm happily was shortlived and when the sun appeared enabling them to dry their garments and a good breakfast had been eaten the discomforts of the past night were forgotten and quashy even ceased to growl at the skeeters and lament his double nose  hitherto they had met with few indians and these few were friendly being acquainted either personally or by report with spotted tiger for the mans reputation as a jaguar and puma slayer had extended far beyond his own tribe  that day however several native canoes were passed and in the evening they found that the place on which tiger had made up his mind to encamp was in possession of indians  friendly asked pedro as they approached the shore  yes friendly replied tiger  would it not be better to go a little further and encamp away from them asked lawrence who retained unpleasant memories of the dirtiness of indian encampments  tiger wishes to speak to them said pedro as the canoe was run on shore  it was found that the party consisted of several families of indians who were out on a turtlehunting expedition for the season had arrived when turtles lay their eggs  this laying season of the turtle sets the whole population of those regions civilised and savage in motion searching in the sands for eggs and capturing or killing the animals  the indians now met with were on the latter business  upon the weather depends the commencement of this season of unwonted activity among the turtles and wild excitement among the riverside indians for the snows must cease to fall on the summits of the andes and the rivers must decrease in volume so as to lay bare vast spaces of sand before the eggs can be laid  no alderman in london city ever equalledmuch less excelleda south american savage of that region in his love of turtle or in his capacity for devouring it  but the savage goes immeasurably further than the alderman  he occupies altogether a higher and more noble position in regard to the turtle for he not only studies with prolonged care and deep interest its habits and manners but follows it watches it catches it kills it and finally cooks it with his own hands before arriving at the aldermans comparatively simple and undignified act of eating it  so exact are these indians in their observations and knowledge of the turtle question that they can tell almost to a day when and where their unsuspecting victims will land and lay  there was an extensive stretch of flat sand close to the spot where our voyageurs put ashore on which the indians had observed numerous clawmarked furrows which had been traced by the turtles  here therefore they had called a halt built a number of ajoupas or leafy sheds about two hundred yards from the edge of the river under the shelter of which to sit at night and watch for their prey  the turtles it was found were expected to land that night  meanwhile the savages were regaling themselves with a splendid dish or rather jar containing hundreds of turtles eggs mixed with bananas  these they hospitably shared with their visitors  the mess was very palatable though heavy and our travellers did justice to it especially the negro whose gastronomic powers were equal to all emergencies  how do they know asked lawrence as he and pedro busied themselves in tying up the hammocks in a suitable part of the jungle when to expect the turtles  who can tell said pedro  instinct i suppose  but dey not stink at all objected quashy anyhow not till arter deys dead sot cant be dat  its not that kind of stink i mean quashy quite another sort said pedro who felt unequal to the task of explanation  but look sharp we must lend the indians a helping hand tonight  but i dont know nuffin about it said quashy an a man what dont know what to do is ony in de way ob oder peepil  you take a just view of things boy returned pedro but you wont find it difficult to learn  five minutes looking at what the indians do will suffice for they only turn the turtles  how you mean  turn im upsidedown or outside inwich  youd find it hard to do the last quashy  no youve only to turn them over on their backs and let them lie thats all  while the negro was thus gathering useful knowledge the indians amused themselves in various ways until darkness should call them forth to the business of the hour  some with that amazing tendency to improve their personal appearance which is common alike to civilised and savage plucked out the little beard with which nature had endowed them by means of tweezers deeming it no doubt wiser on the whole to pluck up the beard by the roots than to cut it off close thereto as indeed it was seeing that the former process did not need regular repetition  others were still busy with the turtleegg ragout unable apparently to decide whether or not appetite was satisfied  two somewhat elderly but deeply interested savages whiled away the time with a game of cupandball turn and turn about with imperturbable gravity  this game was different from that of europe to the extent of being played on precisely opposite principles  it was not he who caught the ball on the point of the sharp stick that won but he who failed to catch it for failure was more difficult to achieve than success  the explanation is simple  the handle was a piece of pointed wood about the thickness of a ramrod and a yard or so in length  to this by a piece of string made from fibres of the palm was attached the ball which was formed of the skull of a turtle carefully scraped  there was no cup in the game  it was all point and the great point was to touch the ball a certain number of times without catching it a somewhat difficult feat to accomplish owing to the dozen or more natural cavities with which the skullball was pierced and into one of which the point was almost always pretty sure to enter  at last the shades of night descended on the scene and the indians laying aside ragout tweezers cupandball etcetera went down to the sandflats and crouched kneeled or squatted under the leafy ajoupas of course their visitors accompanied them  it was a profoundly dark night for during the first part of it there was no moon and the stars although they lent beauty and lustre to the heavens did not shed much light upon the sands  there is a weird solemnity about such a scene which induces contemplative thought even in the most frivolous while it moves the religious mind to think more definitely somehow of the near presence of the creator  for some time lawrence who crouched in profound silence beside pedro almost forgot the object for which he was waiting there  the guide seemed to be in a similarly absent mood for he remarked at last in a low voice  how striking would be the contrasts presented to us constantly by nature if we were not so thoroughly accustomed to them  storm and noise and war of elements last nighttonight silence calm and peace  at present darkness profoundin half an hour or so the moon will rise and the sands will be like a sheet of silver  this moment quiet reposea few moments hence it may be all will be turmoil and wildest actionthat is if the turtles come  true assented lawrence and we may add yet another illustration at one moment subjects of contemplation most sublimenext moment objects the most ridiculous  he pointed as he spoke to quashy whose grinning teeth and glaring eyes alone were distinctly visible in the background of ebony  he was creeping on his hands and knees by way of rendering himself if possible less obtrusive  massa he said in a hoarse yet apologetic whisper is come to ax if you tink de turtles am comin at all dis night  how can i tell quash you stupid fellow  get away to your own ajoupa and keep quiet  i wonder the indians havent let fly a poisoned arrow at you  goand have patience  poor quashy shut his mouth and his eyesit was as if three little lights had gone outwhile his dusky frame melted into its native gloom  no sound was to be heard on the sandflats after that until about midnight when the moon appeared on the horizon  just then a sound was heard on the river  here they come whispered pedro  the sound increased  it was like a swirling hissing noise  soon they could see by the increasing light that the water of the river seemed actually to boil  immediately afterwards thousands of turtles came tumbling clumsily out of the water and spread themselves over the flats  evidently egglaying was no joke with them  the wellknown sluggishness of the creatures was laid aside for this great occasion and wonderful activity marked their every movement from first to last  you see they had to manage the business in a wholesale sort of fashion each turtle having from thirty to forty eggs or more to deposit in the sandon which sand in conjunction with the sun devolved the duty of subsequent maternal care  that the creatures acted on prearranged principles was evident from the fact that they worked in separate detachments each workingparty devoting its energies to the digging of a trench two feet deep four feet broad and sometimes 200 yards long  their zeal was amazing as well it might be for they allowed themselves less than an hour in which to do it all  each animal dug like a hero with its forefeet and sent the sand flying about it to such an extent that the whole flat appeared to be enveloped in a thick fog  when satisfied that their trench was deep enough they stopped work deposited their softshelled eggs and with their hind feet soon filled up the trench  so great was their eagerness and hurry that during the operation more than one turtle tumbling over her companions rolled into the trench and was buried alive  no sooner was the stupendous work accomplished than they made a disorderly rush for the river as if aware of the fate which threatened them  and now at last came the opportunity of the savage  the iron dukes up guards and at em could not have been more promptly or gladly obeyed than was the signal of the redskinned chief  like statues they had awaited it  like catapults they responded to it with yells of mingled madness and joy  but there was method in their madness  to have run between the shelly host and the river so as to cut off its retreat would have been sheer lunacy at which luna herselfby that time shining superblywould have paled with horror for the men would have certainly been overthrown and trampled under foot by the charging squadrons  what the indians did was to rush upon the flanks of the host seize the animals tail and hurl them over on their backs in which position they lay flapping helplessly  before the retreating miserables reached the river hundreds of captives were thus obtained  you may be sure that lawrence and pedro and spotted tiger acted their part well that night and that quashy was not long in learning his lesson  the first tail the negro grasped slipped through his hands so mighty was his effort and as a consequence he sat down with that sudden involuntary flop which one associates irresistibly with nurseries jumping up and rendered wise he took a better grip next time turned the turtle over and fell on the top of it receiving a tremendous whack on the cheek from its right flipper as a reward for his clumsiness  but practice makes perfect  even in the brief space of time at his disposal quashy managed to turn ten turtles with his own hands besides turning himself over six times if not more  rendered wild by success and desperate with anxiety as the fugitives neared the river the negro fixed his glittering eyes on a particularly huge turtle which was scuttling along in almost drunken haste  with an impromptu warhowl quashy charged down on it and caught it by the tail  with a heave worthy of hercules he lifted his foe some inches off the sand but failed to turn it  making a second effort he grasped the edge of the creatures shell with his left hand and the tail more firmly with the right  huyp he shouted and made a herculean heave  a second time he would have failed if it had not been that he was on the edge of a part of the trench which the turtles had not had time to fill up  the weight of the creature caused a foreleg to break off part of the edge and over it went slowly on its sidealmost balancing thus and flapping as it went  to expedite the process quashy seized it by the neck and gave another heave and howl  unfortunately the edge of the trench again gave way under one of his own feet and he fell into it with a cry of distress for the turtle fell on the top of him crushing him down into the soft watery sand  well was it for quashy that night that lawrence armstrong had good ears and was prompt to respond to the cry of distress else had he come to an untimely and inglorious end  hearing the cry lawrence looked quickly round guessed the cause shouted to pedro who was not faroff and was soon on the spotyet not a moment too soon for poor quashy was almost squashy by that time  they dragged the turtle off dug the negro out and found that he had become insensible  raising him gently in their arms they bore him up to the camp where they found manuela ready to minister to him  dead exclaimed the horrified girl when she saw the negro laid down and beheld the awful dirtygreen colour of his countenance  i hope not replied lawrence earnestly  is shsqueeshsure not exclaimed quashy himself with a sneeze as he opened his eyes  and quashy we need scarcely add was right  he was not dead  he did not die for many years afterwards  for aught that we know indeed he may be living still for he came of a very longlived race  his accident however had the useful effect of preventing his giving way to too exuberant felicity and rendered him a little more careful as to the quantity of turtleegg ragout which he consumed that night for supper  it would be pleasant to end our chapter here but a regard for facts compels us to refer to the slaughter of the unfortunate turtles next morning  there is in the interior of the turtle a quantity of yellow fat which is said to be superior in delicacy to the fat of the goose and from which is obtained a fine oil highly prized as an article of commerce to secure this fat the animals which had been turned were killed at daylight the following morning  the axes of the indians caused the shells to fly in splinters the intestines were then torn out and handed to the indian women whose duty it was to remove from them the precious fat after which the carcasses were left to the vultures and fishereagles which flocked from afar to the scene of carnage with that unerring instinct which has so often been commented on by travellers but which no one can understand    chapter eighteen  pedro becomes communicative manuela vocal lawrence preposterous quashy and tiger violentthe whole ending in a grand catastrophe  senhor armstrong said pedro the evening after that on which the capture of turtles took place i have received some bad newsat least unsatisfactory newswhich will necessitate a change in our style of travelling and a more rapid progress towards our journeys end  im sorry for that lawrence answered for to my mind our style of travelling is very agreeable and the rate quite fast enough especially for one who has no definite purpose in view  that may be so senhor returned pedro with a grim smile but as i have something of a definite purpose in view the case is different  true pedrotrue  i do not object to any change in your plans i merely comment on the very pleasant time we are having and shall be ready to act as you desire so you see i am as i promised to bean obedient follower  but where got you this news from  i have seen no one arrive in the camp since we came  what may the nature of the news be if i may venture to ask of one who is soso very reticent  the guide pondered some time before replying to these questions  then with the air of one who has made up his mind on an uncertain point said  i had no intention of rousing your curiosity by needless secrecy  i have not very many or very profound secrets  only in a disturbed country it behoves a man to hold his tongue in regard to his affairs but i feel that you are a friend senhor armstrong who may be trusted not that i have much to trust to youand yet my doings are so mixed up with the affairs of other people that to some extent i am tonguetied  i may tell you however that i am a secret agent of the government to which i have volunteered my services solely because i love peace and hate war and am desirous of doing all i can to promote the first and abate the last  the idea may appear to you quixotic but  pardon me senhor pedro interrupted lawrence promptly  i think you the reverse of quixotic  i honour you for your sentiments and sympathise with you most heartily  do i not remember that it is written blessed are the peacemakers and also scatter thou the people that delight in war  yes i have gathered from your conversation that such are your sentiments but do not misunderstand me  i am not of those who would have peace at any price  i believe in the right of selfdefence  i recognise the right of oppressed nations to rise up and draw the sword in order to free themselves from tyrants in short i believe that there are some things that are worse even than war but while i concede so much i hold that most of the wars recorded in history have been undertaken without just cause many of them without any real or obvious cause at all too many of them with a distinctly bad cause  even in the present day and among christian nations there is far too little tendency to appeal to arbitration which is the only legitimate way for reasonable men to settle any dispute or quarrel  does your sympathy go with me thus far  lawrence with a glow of enthusiasm on his face extended his hand and grasping that of his companion shook it warmly  i go with you in every word pedro  you are a man after my own heart and i say god prosper you in your good work wherever you go  manuela who was standing near at the time looked up at the enthusiastic youth quickly  her knowledge of english must have been improving despite the badness of her pronunciation for she seemed to understand the conversation and to regard lawrence with profound interest  the youth was so carried away with his feelings however that he did not observe the girls look or expression  that is well pedro said with a pleased look as he returned his friends grasp but i fear you wont find many of our way of thinking in this unhappy country  you are aware no doubt that it is frequentlyi might almost say every three or four yearsdisturbed by factious quarrels which too often end in riot and bloodshed though these are not often on so large a scale as to be styled civil war well there is a party of peacelovers even here who do their best to bring about a better state of things and a more settled and powerful government  some of the men of influence at buenos ayres and some even of the military men are of this party  i am as i have said their secret agentsecret because if i were to attempt the thing openly or as a government agent i should be treated with ridicule by some or be murdered perhaps by others in either of which cases my influence would be gone  of course as you have seen i run considerable risk in travelling through the land on my mission for i have been several times taken for a spy but i dont object to run risk the cause being a good one  as to the news which i have received by mere chance from a passing indian it is another outbreak in the san juan district which makes a change in the disposition of troops necessary and as i have particular business with one of the officers i must change my route and make for buenos ayres as straight as possible  that is all the mystery about it so you see as i said it is not very profound  it is very interesting however returned lawrence and you may depend on my falling in with your plans whatever they are  well then returned the guide the first part of my plan is simple enoughmerely to start off tomorrow by the first peep of day  will you go therefore and tell quashy to get ready while i have a talk with manuela  we do not intend to inflict on the reader the whole of the conversation that took place in the indian tongue between the little brown maiden and the guide  a small portion of it will suffice  i repeat manuela said the latter in a remonstrative tone that you are not wise  my kind protector forgets replied the girl with a modest look that i have never set up any claim to wisdom  but what will your father say  i really cannot guess what he will say she answered with one of her prettiest little smiles  but you may be quite sure that the thing is impossible  consider the immense difference between you and forgive me manuela but i think it is not fair  now my protector forgets himself returned the maiden drawing herself up and bestowing a look on the guide which was quite worthy of an inca princesssupposing lawrence to have been right in his conjecture on that point  well well please yourself manuela returned pedro with a laugh in which exasperation slightly mingled but do me the justice to tell your father when you meet that i fairly remonstrated with and warned you after all nothing would please me betterif it should ever come about  he turned on his heel and went off with a mingling of expressions on his handsome face to look after the canoe and make preparations for an early start in the morning  canoe travelling appears to be rather slow work while it is going on even when descending the current of a river  each point of land seems to be reached and passed so gradually every vista of the river seems so extensive and the trees on shore drop so leisurely astern that when you think of the hundreds of miles which lie in advance you are apt to feel as if the journey or voyage would never come to an end  but when you forget the present and reflect on the past when you think how many hundreds of miles now lie behind although it seems but yesterday that you set out on the journey then you realise the fact that the power of littles of steady daily unremitting perseverance has had too little weight with you in your estimates and that just as fast as your startingpoint recedes from you exactly so fast does your goal approach although those misleading factors your feelings may have induced you to think otherwise  five days after the occurrence of the events on what we may style turtlebeach lawrence found himself wondering at what appeared to be the faroffness of the spot considering the slowness of the hourly progress yet at the same time wondering if they should ever traverse the nine hundred or a thousand miles that yet intervened between him and buenos ayres  to do lawrence armstrong justice however he was by no means impatient he was quite satisfied that things should go as slowly as they pleased for was he not travelling through the most interesting of countries in which the flora and the fauna and the geological features furnished abundantay superabundantfood for the satisfaction of his scientific appetite while his companions were of the pleasantest character pedro since the opening up of his heart to him had laid aside much though not allof his reserve and shown himself to be a man of extensive information and profound thought  spotted tiger was a splendid specimen physically and mentally of the sons of the soil in the contemplation of whom he could expend whatever smattering he possessed of ethnological science  then quashywas not that negro the very soul and embodiment of courage fidelity and goodhumour the changes of whose april face alone might have furnished rich material for the study of a physiognomist or a rembrandt  and as for manuelawe cannot analyse his thoughts about her  it is probable that he could not have expounded them himself  take the following sample of them as overheard by us one day when he had strayed into the wild woods alone and was seated on the roots of a mighty tree pencil in hand attempting unsuccessfully to make a sketch  i do believe he murmured with a gesture of impatiencefor he had drawn a small convolvulus hanging from a tree with such disregard for the rules of linear perspective that it was the proportionate size of an omnibusi do believe that that girl has come between me and my wits of course it is not love  that is quite out of the question  a white man could not fall in love with a black woman  yes he did the poor girl the injustice in his perplexed indignation with himself to call her black although it must have been obvious to the most careless observer that she was only reddishbrown or to speak more correctly brownishred  i cant understand it he continued to murmur in that low slow absent faraway tone and manner characteristic of artists when at work no doubt her nose is grecian and her mouth small as well as exquisitely formed her chin full and rounded her teeth faultless her eyes gorgeous and her whole contour perfect butbutshes blackat least correcting himself with a touch of compunction shes brown no i see what it isitswell thats more like a balloon than a waterlilyyes it must be that i am in love with her spirit thats it  ive said so before andandi say it again  he drew back his head at this point and looked criticallyeven sternlyat the sketch  there was room both for criticism and indignation for the display in so small a compass of bad drawing vile composition ridiculous chiarooscuro and impossible perspective could only have been justified by the supposition that his intellect had been warped through the heart in consequence of an unheard of perplexity connected therewith  yes he continued resuming his work with the air of an invincible man there is something distinctly and exasperatingly wrong here  i am in love with her spirit and not with her person  is it possible that the human race descending from adam and eve should have reached the nineteenth century without such a case ever having been heard of before and that ii should be the first wretched exampleoror victim  it is like loving the jewel without caring for the casno thats a bad simile for one could throw away a casket and keep the jewel which could not conveniently be done in this case  i wonder what it is that makes the rules of perspective so difficult and the practice so im  his meditations were checked at this point by a sound so sweet that his heart almost stood still his pencil remained suspended over the sketch and the halfformed word remained in the halfopened mouth  it was as if an angel had come to earth and were warbling the airs of paradise  peeping through the bushes lawrence saw that it was manuela  she was sauntering along pensively humming as she went  he sat still amazed and silent  from what cause we know not but the indian girl had not until that day opened her mouth in song  the youths surprise was increased when she came near enough to let him hear that the words were spanish but suddenly remembering that english girls sometimes learned italian songs by rote like parrots his surprise partly abatedwhy should not an indian girl learn spanish songs by rote  manuela passed close to the tree behind which our hero sat  on observing him she stopped and blushed intensely red  evidently she had thought herself quite alone and experienced the usual dislike of humanity to being caught in the act of singing to itself  in a burst of great enthusiasm lawrence sprang up overturned his drawing materials seized the girls hand and dropped it again as if it had burnt him as he exclaimed  i wishoh  i wish manuela that i were your brother  the lightning flash is said to be quick and we suppose relatively speaking it is so but we are quite sure that lightning cannot hold a candle to thought in this respect  lawrence as the reader has doubtless observed was not a man of much more than average intelligence or action of mind yet between the first wish and the word brother he had perceived and condemned the impropriety of exhibiting strong feeling in thus grasping manuelas hand the unmanliness of doing or saying anything to her that had the remotest approach to lovemaking while in circumstances where the poor girl could not get out of his way however much she might wish to do so and the meanness not to say absurdity of showing anything like a lovers affection for a spirit which could only make itself known through the medium of a brown visage  hence lawrence who was the soul of honour and gallantry got out of the dilemma by suddenly conceiving and expressing the above intense wish to be manuelas brother  it did not occur to him that the gratification of his wish might have involved warpaint and feathers a seminude body a wild unlettered life and a predilection for raw meat and murder  no rapid though thought is it did not convey these ideas to his mind  his one desire after the first unguarded exclamation and impulsive grasp of the hand was to escape from his false position without committing himself and without giving pain or annoyance to the unprotected girl  and his success was in proportion to his boldness for manuela burst into a hearty laugh and said  why you wants be my brudder  brother manuela not brudder replied lawrence joining in the laugh and much relieved in mind  the word is spelt with th not with two ds  the reason is that i should then have the right to order you to sit at my feet and sing me these pretty songs whenever i liked  and i fear i should be a very tyrannical brother to you for i would make you sing all day  whatistrannical asked the girl whose tendency to laugh was evidently not yet quite subdued  hallo hi  quashy came the guides strong voice at that moment ringing through the arches of the forest and preventing the explanation that might have been of trannical  but quashy replied not  it was the end of the noontide siesta  while lawrence as we have seen had taken to sketching and manuela to singing the negro had gone off on his own account and pedro was now anxious to have his assistance in getting ready to start  as lawrence hurriedly collected his pencils the indian girl stood admiring his workpoor ignorant thing  just then there arose in the forest a sound which filled them both with mingled surprise and alarm  it was a peculiar dull sound almost indescribable but something like what one might expect to hear from a hundred spades or pickaxes working together in the depths of the forest  after a minute or two it ceased and profound silence reigned  dead silence in critical circumstances is even more alarming than definite noise for then the imagination is allowed full play and only those who have got the imagination powerfully developed know of what wild and terrifying vagaries it is capable  lawrence and manuela looked at each other  the former had often before admired the gorgeous black orbs of the latter but he had not till then thought them to be so very large  suddenly the earth trembled under their feet it seemed as if a volcano were heaving underground  the memory of san ambrosio rushed upon them and they too trembledat least the girl did  at the same time a shout arose which seemed to them not unfamiliar  the noise increased to something like the galloping of a distant squadron of cavalry  let me lift you into this tree said lawrence quickly  manuela did not object  he lifted her by the waist with his two large hands as if she had been a little child and placed her on a branch that happened to be just within his reach  scarcely had he done so when a host a very army of american wildhogs or peccaries burst from the bushes like a tornado and bore down on them  they were so near that there was no time for lawrence to climb up beside manuela  he could only seize the branch with both hands and draw up his long legs  the living torrent passed under him in a few seconds and thusthanks to his gymnastic training at schoolhe escaped being ripped up in all directions by the creatures tusks  it was these same tusks digging round trees for the purpose of grubbing up roots that had produced the strange sounds and it was the shouts of quashy and tiger in pursuit that had awakened the echoes of the forest  on the heels of the large animals came galloping and squealing a herd of little ones and close upon these followed the two hunters just named panting warwhooping and cheering  several of the little pigs were speared some were even caught by the tail and a goodly supply of meat was obtained for at least that day and the next  but before noon of that next day an event of a very different and much more serious nature occurred  it was early morning at the time  they were traversing a wide sheet of water both banks of which were high richlywooded and all aglow with convolvuli and other flowers and innumerable ropelike creepers the graceful festoons and hanging tendrils of which gave inexpressible softness to the scene  in the middle of the lakelike expanse were numerous mudflats partly covered with tropical reeds and rushes of gigantic size  the course our voyagers had to pursue made it necessary to keep close under the right bank which was unusually steep and high  they were all silent for the hour and the slumbering elements induced quiescence  a severe thunderstorm accompanied by heavy rains had broken over that district two days before and lawrence observed that deep watercourses had been ploughed among the trees and bushes in several places but every other trace of the elemental war had vanished and the quiet of early morning seemed to him sweet beyond expression inducing his earnest spirit to wish that the mystery of sin had never been permitted and that it were still possible for man to walk humbly with his god in a world of peacefulness as real as that of inanimate nature around him  when the sun arose a legion of living creatures came out from wood and swamp and reedy isle to welcome him  flamingoes otters herons white and grey and even jaguars then began to set about their daily work of fishing for breakfast  rugged alligators like animated trunks of fallen trees crawled in slimy beds or ploughed up the sands of the shore in deep furrows while birds of gorgeous plumage and graceful sometimes clumsyform audibly if not always visibly united to chant their morning hymn  such were the sights on which our travellers eyes rested with a sort of quiet delight when pedro broke the silence in a low voice  youd better keep a little farther out into the stream he said to tiger  the indian silently obeyed  it was well that he did so promptly for in less than a minute and without the slightest premonition the immense bank above them slid with a terrific rumbling noise into the river  the enormous mass of sand and vegetable detritus thus detached could not have been much if at all less than half a mile in extent  it came surging and hurling down trees and roots and rocks and mud intermingling in a chaos of grand confusion the great cablelike creepers twining like snakes in agony and snapping as if they were mere strands of packthread timber crashing rock grinding sometimes bursting like cannon shots and the whole plunging into the water and raising a great wave that swept the alligators from the mudflats and swallowed up the reeds and rushes sending herons kingfishers and flamingoes screaming into the air and dashing high into the jungle on the opposite shore  as we have said the canoe got out of reach of the terrible avalanche just in time but it could not escape the wave  the indian however was prepared for that  it was not the first time he had seen such a catastrophe  turning the bow of the canoe instantly towards the falling bank he thus met the wave as it were in the teeth and rode safely over it  if he had been less alive to the danger or less prompt to meet it or if he had underestimated it and allowed the wave to catch them on the side of the canoe the adventures of our five friends had that day come to an abrupt close and what is probably of greater consequence to the reader this faithful record would never have been written    chapter nineteen  in which among other things lawrence refuses an invitation and bids a final farewell to manuela  a jump of several hundreds of miles at one mighty bound may seem difficult perhaps impossible but if the reader will kindly put on the grasshopper legs of imagination which we now provide such a jump will be found not only possible but perchance agreeable  we pass at one fell spring then from the thick forests of bolivia to the wide rolling pampas or plains of south america  you are still within sight of the andes good reader  you may travel from north to south if you willfrom the equatorial regions of the mexican gulf to the cold and stormy cape at tierra del fuegowithout losing sight of that magnificent backbone of the grand continent  we have reached a frontier town which lies among the undulating hills at the base of the mountains yet within sight of the outskirts of the grassy pampas  a small town it is with little white houses and a church glittering in the sunshine  a busy town too with a mixed population fluttering in the streets in the variegated trappings and plumage of merchants and priests and muleteers and adventurers and darkeyed senhoras enveloped in all the mysterious witchery that seems inseparable from spanish mantillas and fans  it was evening when our travellers arrived at the town  they were on horseback now having a considerable time previously forsaken the rivers for the roadsif we may call by such a name those unmade highways which are merely marked out through the wilderness by the passage of men  bells were ringing in the steeple as they entered the town for some fete or holiday was in process of celebration and the presence of a considerable number of men in uniform gave to the place the appearance of a garrison town  there were so many oddlooking and striking characters in the streets that the arrival of our party made no particular impression on the people save that manuelas elegant little figure and pretty brown face drew some attentionadmiration on the part of the men scorn on that of a fewa very fewof the senhoras  you see in all parts of the world some people are found who seem to hold though they would find it difficult to say why that gods creatures with brown and black skins ought to be looked down upon and held in contempt by his creatures who chance to have white skins  you will generally find that the people who think thus also hold the almost miraculous opinion that those who wear superfine clothing and possess much money have a sort of indefinable but unquestionable right to look down upon and lord it over those who own little money and wear coarse garments  you will carefully observe unprejudiced reader that we use the word some in speaking of those people  we are very far from pitting the poor against the rich  we are bound to recognise the fact that amongst both classes there are gems of brightest lustre irradiated by rays from the celestial sun while in both there are also found qualities worthy of condemnation  but when we record the fact that some of the white senhoras looked with jealousy and scorn upon our sweet little indian heroine we ought to recognise the undeniable truth that they themselves so long as actuated by such a spirit were beneath contemptfit subjects only for pity  as they passed along much interested and somewhat excited by the comparatively novel sights around them pedro rode up to a mounted soldier and accosted him in spanish  he returned to his party with a gleam of stronger excitement in his eyes than lawrence had observed since they became acquainted  riding alongside of manuela who was in advance he entered into earnest and animated conversation with her  then reining back until he was abreast of lawrence he said  part of the object of my journey has been accomplished sooner than i had expected senhor armstrong  indeed  i hope it has been satisfactorily accomplished  well yes as far as it goes  the fact is i find that there has been a raid of the indians into this part of the country and a body of troops has been sent to quell them under colonel marchbanks  now this colonel as his name will suggest is an englishman in the service of the argentine army under whose orders i have been serving and to communicate with whom was one of my chief reasons for undertaking this journey  will that then render your journey to buenos ayres unnecessary asked lawrence a slight feeling of anxiety creeping over him  no it wont do that but it will greatly modify my plans  among other things it will oblige me to leave manuela behind and push on alone as fast as possible  i suppose you will have no objection to a tearing gallop of several hundred miles over the pampas said pedro while a smile of peculiar meaning played for an instant on his handsome face  objections exclaimed our hero with great energy of course not  a tearing gallop over the pampas isamost  he stopped for a strange unaccountable feeling of dissatisfaction which he could not understand began to overwhelm him  was it that he was really in love after all with this indian girl and that the thought of final separation from herimpossible  no he could not credit such an idea for a moment  but he loved her spirither soul as it were and he could not be blamed for being so sorry so very sorry to part with that thus suddenlythus unexpectedly  yes he was not in love  it was a fraternal or paternala platonic feeling of a strong type  he would just see her once more alone before starting say goodbye and give her a little as it were paternal or fraternal or platonic advice  senhor armstrong is in a meditative mood said pedro breaking the thread of his meditations  yes i was thinkingwas wonderingthat isby the way with whom will you leave manuela  with a friend who lives in a villa in the suburbs  you seem to have friends wherever you go said lawrence  ay and enemies too returned pedro with a slight frown  however with gods blessing i shall circumvent the latter  when do you start asked lawrence with an air of assumed indifference  tomorrow or next day perhaps but i cannot tell until i meet colonel marchbanks  i am not indeed under his commandbeing what you may call a sort of freelancebut i work with him chiefly that is under his directions for he and i hold much the same ideas in regard to most things and have a common desire to see something like solid peace in the land  look do you see that villa with the rustic porch on the cliff just beyond the town  yesit is so conspicuous and so beautifully situated that one cannot help seeing and admiring it  that is where the friend lives with whom i shall leave manuela  indeed said lawrence whose interest in the villa with the rustic porch was suddenly intensified and shall we find her there on our return  i was not aware that senhor armstrong intended to return said pedro with a look of surprise  lawrence felt somewhat confused and taken aback but his countenance was not prone to betray him  of course i mean will you find her there when you return  though as to my returning the thing is not impossible when one considers that the wreck of part of my fathers property lies on the western side of the andes  ah true  i forgot that for a moment  well i suppose she will remain here till my return said pedro unless the indians make a successful raid and carry her off in the meantime he added with a quick glance at his companion  and are we to stay tonight at the same villa  no we shall stay at the inn to which we are now drawing near  i am told that the colonel has his headquarters there  the conversation closed abruptly at this point for they had reached the inn referred to  at the door stood a tall goodlooking young man whose shaven chin cut of whisker and tweed shooting costume betokened him an englishman of the sporting class  addressing himself to this gentleman with a polite bow pedro asked whether colonel marchbanks was staying there  wellawim not quite sure but there isawi believe a military man ofawsome sort staying in the place  without meaning to be idiotic this sporting character was one of those rich plucky languid drawlywauly men who regard the world as their special huntingfield affect freeandeasy nonchalance and interlard their ideas with aw to an extent that is absolutely awful  the same question put to a waiter who immediately appeared elicited the fact that the colonel did reside there but was absent at the moment  well then said pedro turning quickly to lawrence you had better look after rooms and order supper while i take manuela to the villa  for the first time since they met lawrence felt inclined to disobey his friend  a gush of indignation seemed to surge through his bosom for a moment but before he could reply pedro who did not expect a reply had turned away  he remounted his steed and rode off meekly followed by the indian girl  quashy took the bridles of his own and his masters horse and stood awaiting orders while spotted tiger who was not altogether inexperienced in the ways of towns led his animal and the baggagemules round to the stables  so thought lawrence bitterly i am ordered to look after things here and manuela goes quietly away without offering to say goodbye without even a friendly nod although she probably knows i may have to start by daybreak tomorrow and shall never see her again  bah what else could i expect from a squawa black girl  but no matter  its all over  it was only her spirit i admired and i dont care even for that now  it will be observed that our poor hero did not speak like himself here so grievous was the effect of his disappointment  fortunately he did not speak at all but only muttered and looked savage to the amusement of the sportsman who stood leaning against the doorpost of the inn regarding him with much interest  will you sup senhor asked a waiter coming up just then  eh nothat isyes replied lawrence savagely  how many senhor  how many eh  how should i know  as many as you like  come here  he thundered off along a passage clanking his heels and spurs like a whole regiment of dragoons and without an idea as to whither the passage led or what he meant to do  awquite a wemarkable cweature  a sort ofawlonglegged curiosity of the andes  mad i suppose or drunk  these remarks were partly a soliloquy partly addressed to a friend who had joined the sportsman but they were overheard by quashy who with the fire of a free negro and the enthusiasm of a faithful servant said  no more mad or drunk dan youselfyou whitefaced racoon  being unable conveniently to commit an assault at the moment our free negro contented himself with making a stupendous face at the englishman and glaring defiance as he led the cattle away  as the reader knows that must have been a powerful glare but its only effect on the sportsman was to produce a beaming smile of anglosaxon goodwill  that night lawrence armstrong slept little  next morning he found that pedro had to delay a day in order to have some further intercourse with colonel marchbanks  having nothing particular to do and being still very unhappythough his temper had quite recoveredhe resolved to take a stroll alone  just as he left the inn a tall powerfullybuilt soldierly man entered and bestowed on him a quick stern glance in passing  he seemed to be between fifty and sixty straight as a poplar and without any sign of abated strength though his moustache and whiskers were nearly white  lawrence would have at once recognised a countryman in this old officer even if the waiter had not addressed him by name as he presented him with a note  at any other time the sociable instincts of our hero would have led him to seek the acquaintance both of the colonel and the awful sportsman but he felt misanthropical just then and passed on in silence  before he had been gone five minutes quashy came running after him  you no want me massa  no quash i dont  praps suggested the faithful man with an excess of modesty and some hesitationpraps youd like me to go wid you forfor company  youre very kind quash and i should like to have you very much indeed but at present im very much out of sorts and  o massa interrupted the negro assuming the sympathetic gaze instantly and speaking with intense feeling its not in de stummik am it  he placed his hand gently on the region referred to  no quash lawrence replied with a laugh it is not the body at all that affects me it is the mind  oh is dat all said the negro quite relieved  den you not need to boder youself  nobody ebber troubled long wid dat complaint  do you know massa dat de bery best ting for dat is a little cheerful siety i tink youll be de better ob me  he said this with such selfsatisfied gravity and withal seemed to have made up his mind so thoroughly to accompany his young master that lawrence gave in and they had not gone far when he began really to feel the benefit of quashys light talk  we do not mean to inflict it all on the reader but a few sentences may perhaps be advantageous to the development of our tale  splendid place dis massa observed the negro after they had walked and chatted some distance beyond the town  yes quashvery beautiful  lots ob nice shady trees an bushes and flowers an fruits an sweet smells ob oranges an  he waved his arms around as if to indicate a profusion of delights which his tongue could not adequately describe  quite true quash replied lawrence who was content to play second violin in the duet  is you gwine inquired quashy after a brief pause to de gubners ball tonight  no  i did not know there was a governor or that he intended to give a ball  the negro opened his eyes in astonishment  you not know ob it he exclaimed why eberybody knows ob it an amost eberybodys agwineall de spectable peepil i mean an some ob dem whats not zactly as spectable as dey should be  but deys all agwine  hes a liberal gubner you see an hes gwine to gib de ball in de inn at de lanlords expense  indeed thats a curiously liberal arrangement  yes an a bery clebber rangement for de lanlord  hes a cute man de lanlord  i spose yous agwine  no i am not going  i have received no invitation besides i have no evening dress  bless you massa you dont need no invitation nor evenin dress needer  you just go as you are an its all right  but i have no wish to go  i would rather prepare for an early start tomorrow  das a prutty house wes acomin to massa said quashy not hearing or ignoring the last remark  lawrence looked up with a start  unwittingly quite unwittingly he had rambled in the direction of the villa with the rustic porch  an deres de missis ob de villa i suppose said quashy  no shes ony a redskin  why massa he continued opening his eyes to their widest its manuelaor her ghost  it was indeed our little indian heroine walking alone in the shrubbery she had not observed her late companions who were partly concealed by bushes  quashy said lawrence impressively laying his hand on the negros shoulder get out of the way  i want to speak to her aloneto say goodbye you know for we start early tomorrow  the negro promptly threw himself on the ground and nodded his head  you go ahead massa  all right  when you comes dis way agin youll find dis nigger am vanisht like a wreaf ob smoke  a few seconds more and lawrence suddenly appeared before manuela  she met him without surprise but with an embarrassed look  instantly a dark chilling cloud seemed to settle down on the poor youths spirit mingled with a host of other indescribable feelings there was one very strong of indignation but with a violent effort he controlled his features so as to indicate no feeling at all  this is an unexpected meeting manuela  i had hardly hoped for it as we set off very early tomorrow but im glad we have met for i should never have got over the feeling that i had been unkind in going off without saying goodbye  do you make out what i mean  i think you understand english better than my bad spanish  yesi understan  i very sorry we part  very very sorry goodbye  she put out her hand and lawrence mechanically took it  there was something so ridiculous in this prompt and cool way of parting after having been so long together that the youth could scarcely believe he was awake  had this pretty little inca princess then no feeling whateverno touch of common tenderness like other girls  did the wellknown stoicism of her race require that she should part for the last time from the man who had twice saved her life with a simple im very sorry  goodbye  he felt cured now completely  such a spirit he thought could not command esteem much less affection  as neither body nor spirit was now left to him he began to feel quite easy in his mindalmost desperately easyand that paternal fraternal platonic interest in the child which we have before mentioned began to revive  well manuela he said at last with a stupendous sigh as though he were heaving the entire andes off his rugged old shoulders yet with a brotherly smile as he patted the little brown hand you and i have had pleasant times together  i could have wishedoh how iwell hem but no matter  you will soon no doubt be among your own people again  all i would ask of you is sometimes when faraway to think of me to think of me as perhaps the presumptuous young fellow who did his best to make a long and rather trying journey agreeable to you  think of me manuela as a father and i will think of you as my little indian girl  i will fink she said dropping her grave eyes on the ground and the stoicism of all the incas seemed to be concentrated in her look and bearing at that moment tink of you as a fadder  goodbye he said again  goodbye she replied  he had intended to print a fatherly kiss on the little brown hand but this parting was too much  he dropped her hand and turning abruptly away with a final farewellgod bless you quickly left the spot in a sort of bewildered amazement that a heartless indian girl should ever have been able to obtain even for a time so powerful an influence over him    chapter twenty  is cumulatively astonishing  there are we suppose in the lives of all men critical periods testingpoints as it werewhen their faith in everything true is shaken almost if not quite to the foundation and when they are tempted to ask with more or less of bitterness who will show us any good  well is it for such when in the hour of trial they can look up to the fountain of all good and in the face of doubt darkness difficulty ay and seeming contradiction simply believe and trust  when lawrence armstrong slowly sauntered back to the inn after his final interview with manuela it surprised even himself to find how strong had been his feelings how profound his faith in the girls goodness of heart and how intensely bitter was his disappointment  but its all over now he muttered thrusting his hands deep into the pockets of his coat and frowning ferociously at some imaginary wrong though he would have been puzzled if required to state exactly what the wrong was  all over he repeated and then continued with an affected air of indifference and what of that  what matters it to me that i have been mistaken  i never was in love with the girl  how could i be with a blackwell a brown squaw  impossible  it was only admirationstrong admiration i admitof what i had fancied were rarely fine qualities especially in a savan indian and ive been mistaken thats all  thats all  but after a pause have i been mistaken  does this unaccountably callous indifference at saying goodbye to one who is nothing to herwho never can be anything to herargue that all the good qualities i have admired so much are nonexistent or bad qualities  surely not  let me consider  let me look this perplexing matter straight in the face and see what is to be made of it  what are the good qualities that i seem to have been so mistaken about  frowning still more ferociously as if with a view to constrain himself to the performance of a deed of impartial justice our hero continued to mutter  earnest simplicitythats the firstno thats two qualities  be just lawrence whatever you are be just  earnestness then thats the first point  whatever else i may have been wrong about there can be no mistake about that  she is intensely earnest  how often have i noticed her rapt attention and the eager flash of her dark eyes when pedro or i chanced to tell any anecdote in which injustice or cruelty was laid bare  she is so earnest that i think sometimes she has difficulty in perceiving when one is in jest  she does not understand a practical jokewell to be sure there was that upsetting of the coffee on quashys leg  but after all i must have been mistaken in that  so much then for her earnestness  next simplicity  no child could be more simple  utterly ignorant of the ways of the worldthe nauseous conventionalities of civilised life  brought up in a wigwam no doubt among the simple aborigines of the pampas or the mountainsyes it must have been the mountains for the incas of peru dwelt in the andes  he paused here for a few minutes and sauntered on in silence while a tinge of perplexity mingled with the frown  no doubt he was thinking of the tendency exhibited now and then by the aborigines of the pampas and mountains to raid on the white man now and then and appropriate his herds as well as scalp himself  however she had nothing to do with that he muttered apologetically and cannot help the peculiarities of her kindred gentleness that is the next quality  a man may mistake motives but he cannot mistake facts  her gentleness and sweetness are patent facts and her modesty is also obvious  then she is a christian  pedro told me so  she never omits to pray night and morning  of course that does not constitute a christian butwell then the sabbathday she has all along respected and i am almost sure that our regular halts on that day although ordered by pedro were suggested by manuela  of course praying and sabbathkeeping may be done by hypocrites and for a bad end but who save a consummately blind idiot would charge that girl with hypocrisy  besides what could she gain by it all  pshaw the idea is ridiculous  of course there are many more good qualities which i might enumerate but these are the most important and clearly pronouncedvery clearly  he said this very decidedly for somehow a counteracting suggestion came from somewhere reminding him that he had twice saved the indian girls life that he had tried with earnest devotion to help and amuse her in all their journeyings together and that to be totally indifferent about final separation in these circumstances argued the absence of even ordinary gratitude which is clearly one of the christian virtues  but after all he muttered indignantly would not any young fellow have done the same for any woman in the circumstances  and why should she care about parting from me  i wouldnt care much about parting from myself just now if i could  there now thats an end o the matter  shell go back to the wigwam of her father and ill go and have a jolly good splitting gallop across the pampas with pedro and quashy  dats just de bery best ting what you can do massa  lawrence turned round abruptly and found that his faithful servant was hurrying after him and grinning tremendously  why youre always laughing quash said the youth a little sharply  o massa exclaimed the negro turning his mouth the other way  is nebber laugh no more if you don like it  like it my good fellow exclaimed lawrence himself giving way to a short laugh to conceal his feelings of course i like it only you came on me unexpectedly and to say truth i am  still out ob sorts massa  yes thats itexactly  well for a man out ob sorts you walk most awrful irriglarone time slow noder time so quick  i was bleeged to run to obertake you  further converse was checked by their arrival in the town  on reaching the hotel they found the place in considerable confusion and bustle owing to preparations for the governors ball about to take place that evening  they met pedro at the door  youll go i suppose he said to lawrence referring to the ball  indeed i will not  ive had no invitation and have no evening dress  why senhor armstrong forgets he is not now in england said pedro we require neither invitation nor evening dress in an outotheway place like this  youll find all sorts of people there  indeed a few are likely to be of the class who prefer to dance with their coats off  no matter ill not go  nothing will induce me to go returned lawrence firmlyalmost testily  dont say that rejoined pedro regarding his companion with a peculiar smile  you may perhaps meet friends there  you know that i have no friends here returned our hero who thereupon went off to his own room to meditate over his uncomfortable feelings  but when he had reached his room and shut his door pedros reference to meeting with friends coupled with his peculiar look recurred to him what could the fellow mean  what friends had he in the country except pedro himself and quashy and spotted tiger andandmanuela but of course he could not refer to the last for who ever heard of a governor inviting an unknown indian girl to a ball  no pedro must have been jesting  he would not go  but the longer he thought over the matter the more were his perplexity and curiosity increased until at last he wavered in his firm determination not to go and when the ball was about to begin of which the sounds of hurrying steps and musical instruments apprised him he changed his mind  combing his hair slightly he tried to brush his rough garments with his hands arranged his necktie and flannel collar a little dusted his long boots with a towel washed his hands laid aside his weapons and went off to the hall with the intention of at least looking in at the door to see what was going on  he met pedro in the corridor  ha  senhor armstrong has changed his mind  yes i have  lawrence said this in the slightly defiant tone of a man who gives in with a bad grace  he was altogether out of sorts and unlike himself but pedro like a true friend took no notice of that  im glad you have given in senhor said pedro for it saves me the trouble of dragging you there by force in order that i may have the pleasure of seeing how you will look under the influence of a surprise  a surprise pedro  yes  but come the ball is about to begin  at the end of the corridor they encountered the english sportsman who at the same moment chanced to meet his friend to whom he said  i say just come andawhave a look at the company  all free and easy no tickets required no dress noawthere goes the governor  the remainder was lost in distance as the two sporting characters sauntered to the ballroom where they stood near the door looking on with condescending benignity as men might for whose amusement the whole affair had been arranged  and truly there was much to be amused at as lawrence and his companion standing just within the doorway soon found  owing to the situation of the little town near the base of the mountains there were men there of many nations and tongues on their way to various mines or on business of some sort in or on the other side of the mountainsgermans french italians english spanish and portuguese  all strangers were welcomed by the hospitable governor and landlordthe latter of whom felt no doubt that his loss on food was more than counterbalanced by his gain on drink  among the guests there were gauchos of the pampas and the head men of a band of peons who had just arrived with a herd of cattle as these danced variously in campdresses topboots silver spurs ponchos and shirt sleeves and as the ladies of the town appeared in picturesque and varied costumes with mantillas and fans lawrence felt as if he were witnessing a fancy dress gathering and soon became so absorbed as to forget himself and his companion entirely  he was aroused from his reverie by the drawling exclamation  aw indeed  yes replied the landlord to the sportsman the colonels coming hes a jolly old man and likes to see other people enjoyin a bit o fun  an whats more hes goin to bring his daughter with him and another girla niece i suppose  they say theyre both splendid creatures  aw indeed languidly replied the sportsman twisting his moustache  it was evident that the landlord had failed to arouse his interest  at that moment the first dance came to an end and there was a stir at the upper end of the room where was another door of entrance  its the colonel exclaimed the landlord hurrying forward  colonel marchbanks entered with a lady on either arm  he was a splendid old manso tall that lawrence could distinguish his fine bald head with its fringe of white hair rising high above the intervening guests  people became silent and fell away from him as if to have a better look at him  come said pedro suddenly i will introduce you  there was a strange gleam in pedros eyes and unwonted excitement in his manner as he pushed his way through the crowd  lawrence followed in some surprise  suddenly he heard a sharp strange indescribable shout  it was the voice of pedro who was only a few yards in advance of him  our hero sprang forward and beheld a sight which filled him with surprise  one of the girls who leaned on the colonels arm was a beautiful blonde of about fifteen with flowing golden hair and rich brown eyes  she stood as if petrified with the brown eyes gazing intensely at pedro who also stood transfixed returning the gaze with compound interest  mariquita he murmured holding out both hands  yes said the delighted colonel i felt quite sure she was your child but said nothing about  father burst from the girl as with a cry of joy she bounded into pedros arms  just so continued the colonel i didnt like to mention my suspicions for fear of raising false hopes and thought the surest way would be to bring them face to face  wasnt it so manuela  lawrence turned as if he had received an electric shock  he had been so absorbed in the scene we have just described that he had not looked at the girl who leaned on the colonels other arm  he now turned and beheldnot the indian girl of his travels but a fairskinned darkeyed senhorina  yet as he gazed the blood seemed to rush to his brain for these were the eyes of manuela and the slightly open little mouth was hersthe straight grecian nose and the graceful figure  it seemed as if his wildest dream were realised and that manuela had become white  he clasped his hands and gazed as pedro had just done with such intensity that the sportsman observing the rudeness said to his friend  awdont you think it would be as well toawkick the fellow out of the room  hallo whats this exclaimed the old colonel turning sharply on lawrence with a magnificent frown  it was quite evident that he as well as pedro and our hero had also received a most unexpected surprise for not only did the youth continue to stand gazing with clasped hands but the young lady did not seem in the least offended  on the contrary she looked up at the colonel with an incomprehensible expression and a bewitching smile as she said in excellent english  he is not rude father only astonished  let me introduce my friend and preserver mr lawrence armstrong  but lawrence heard not and cared nothing for the introduction  it is manuela he exclaimed with a hesitating step forward and a look of unbelief still lingering in his eyes  she held out her little white hand  he grasped it  the same hand certainly  there could be no doubt about that  pon my honourawthe most interesting tableau vivant i everaw saw  come come cried the colonel whose pleased smile had given place to unimaginable astonishment  youyou should have prepared me for this manuela  iim obliged to you senhor of course forfor saving my daughter butcome follow me  he turned and left the room with rapid strides and would have dragged manuela after him if that young lady had not been endued with a pace neat active and what is sometimes called trippingwhich kept her easily alongside of the ancient man of war  lawrence followed mechanically  pedro with an arm round mariquitas waist brought up the rear  as they vanished through the doorway the people gave them a hearty cheer and resumed dancing  the sportsman found himself so much overcome that he could only ejaculate aw  but presently he recovered so far as to say lets go an have a ciga and he also melted from the scene    chapter twenty one  hopes fears perplexities joys and explanations  two conversations took place shortly after the scene in the ballroom and to these we now draw attention  the first was in the hotelin the private apartment of colonel marchbanks  having got rid of the ladies the fiery man of war led his victimif we may so style himinto the apartment referred to and shut the door without asking lawrence to be seated he stalked into the middle of the room  now senhor he said wheeling round suddenly and confronting lawrence with a tremendous frown what do you mean by this  the look and the tone were such as the youth would in ordinary circumstances have resented but he was far removed from ordinary circumstances just then  he was a victim  as such he looked at his questioner with perplexity in his countenance and said  i beg pardon  what do you mean by your conduct i say repeated the colonel fiercely for he mistook and was rendered more irritable by the youths apparent stupidity  you have insulted my daughter in the ballroom  your daughter said lawrence with the air of a man whose eyes are dazzled by some sudden burst of strong light which he does not quite understand  yes sir  you know quite well what i mean cried the colonel waxing angrier  it may be true for all i know or care that you have saved her life more than once as pedro tells me but  i saved the life of an indian girl interrupted lawrence gently and gazing wistfully in the colonels angry face as if he saw a distant landscape of marvellous beauty through it the daughter of a great chief and a descendant of the incas  a descendant of the hottentots sir exclaimed the colonel becoming furious for he now thought the young man was attempting to jest the fact that my daughtermy daughter sir was persuaded to assume that useless and ridiculous disguise and the fact that you rendered her assistance when so disguised gives you no right toto insult her in public andandi have heard sir from manuela herself that  manuela interrupted the victim in a soft unbelieving voice and with an eager wistful look at the exquisite landscape againis it possible  sir youre a fool shouted the old soldier unable to contain himself  pedro told me much about you but he did not say you were a fool  impossible  i knew it must be a dream murmured lawrence as if to himself i was never called a fool before  no gentleman would have done itleast of all an english gentleman  this shot although not aimed hit the mark fairly  forgive me senhor said the colonel modifying his tone though evidently still much annoyed but your manners and language are so strange that really  he stopped as a new light broke upon him  surely he said you cannot have been in ignorance all this time that manuela is my daughter  tell me cried lawrence suddenly shaking off the dream of unbelief advancing a step and gazing so intensely into the colonels eyes that the man of war made a quick involuntary motion with his right hand towards his swordtell me colonel marchbanksis manuela who i thought was an inca princess really your daughter  i know nothing about the inca princesses senhor replied the old man sternly but with a perplexed air all i know is that the disguised girl with whom you have been unfortunately travelling of late is my daughter and although your ignorance of the fact accounts in some degree  he got no further for lawrence gave a full free shout of joy such as he had not vented since he was a schoolboy raised himself to his full height and threw up his arms clearing off a very constellation of crystal gimcracks from a chandelier in the mighty stretch and exclaimed  ill have her ill have her  yes in spite of all  the door opened at that moment and he stood transfixed for there was spotted tigerglaring horribly and obviously charged with important tidings  come in cried the colonel in spanish  come out cried the savage in some other language which lawrence did not understand but which the colonel evidently did for he clapped on his hat and without a word of explanation hurried with tiger out of the room leaving lawrence to solitary meditation  the other conversation that we have referred to was held in the garden of the hotel under a thick overhanging tree between pedro and the lovely lady who had been the cause of lawrences little affair with the colonel  what have you done with her pedro asked the lovely lady  taken her to the villa where she will be well cared for  but why so quickly  why not wait for me  the voice was in very truth that of manuela though the countenance was that of a spanish senhorina  because time is precious  we have received news which calls for speedy action and i must be in close attendance on your father manuela  as i am likely to have quarter of an hour to spare while he holds a palaver with tiger i have sought you out to ask an explanation for im eager to know how and where my darling was found  i can wait as well as most men but  yes yes i know said manuela drawing her mantilla a little more closely over her now fair face  you shall hear  listen  you know that my father loves you  pedro smiled assent and nodded  his is a loving and loveable nature resumed our heroine  so is his daughters thought pedro but he did not say so  and he never forgets a friend continued manuela  he has often often spoken to me about you and your dear ones and many a time in his military wanderings has he made inquiries about the dear child who was stolen so long agoten years now is it not  ay not far short of eleven  she was just turned five when last i beheld her angel faceno not last thank god  well pedro you may easily believe that we had many raisings of our hopes like yourself and many many disappointments but these last arose from our looking chiefly in wrong directions  it somehow never occurred to us that her lot might have fallen among people of rank and wealth  yet so it was  one day when out on the pampas not far from buenos ayres visiting a friend and never thinking of dear mariquita we saw a young girl coming towards us down the garden walk  as she came near my father stopped short and laid his hand on my shoulder with such a grasp that i nearly cried out  i looked up in surprise and never before saw such an expression of eager inquiry on his face  manuela he said in a low tremulous voice if mariquita is alive i see her now  i see our friend pedro in every line of her pretty face  i looked but could not see the likeness  you know how differently people seem to be affected by the same face  i failed to see in the sweet countenance framed in curling fair hair and in the slight girlish figure of surpassing grace my swarthy friend pedro  she seemed startled at first by my fathers abrupt manner  he questioned her what was her namemariquita she said  i was sure of it rejoined my father  your surname my girl  arnold senhor she replied with surprise  my dear father is very impulsive  his hopes sank as fast as they had risen  of course he said afterwards mariquita is a common name and should not have raised my expectations so quickly but the likeness you see staggered me  dear father continued manuela casting down her eyes and speaking in a pensive tone i do love him so because of his little imperfections  they set off his good points to so much greater advantage  i should not like to have a perfect father  would you pedro  she raised her eyes to the guides face with an arch lookand those eyes had become wonderfully lustrous since the skin had lost its brown hue  really manuela returned the impatient guide i have not yet considered what degree of perfection i should like in my fatherbut how about  forgive me yesmariquita  well finding that we were going to the house where she dwelt mariquita walked with us and told us that she had lived with our english friends mr and mrs daulton since she was a little child  did she remember her parents we asked  yes she remembered them perfectly and tried to describe them but we could make nothing of that for evidently she thought them handsomer grander and more beautiful than any other people in the world  she did not remember where they dweltexcept that it was in the woods and among mountains  that corresponds exactly cried my father becoming excited forgive me child i am an eccentric old fellow butdid you quit your home amid fire and smoke and yells  my father was stopped at this point by our arrival at the house and the appearance of our friends  but he was too much roused by that time to let the matter drop so he carried mrs daulton off to the library and learned from her that the child had been lent to her by a priest  lent my dear madam said my father  yes lent  the priest laughed when he presented her but said the child was the orphan daughter of a distant relation of his who had left her to his care  he did not want her or know what to do with her and offered to give her to us  my husband said he could not accept such a gift but he would gladly accept her as a loan  we both disbelieved the priest for he was a bad man but as we were much in want of a companion for our own little girl at the time we accepted her and brought her here  the priest died suddenly and as there was no one else to claim her we have kept her ever since and right glad we are to have her  you wont have her long said my sweet father in his usual blunt and pleasant way  i am convinced that i know her father  of course arnold is a name you gave her  no when she came to us she said her name was mariquita but she knew of no other name  it was the priest who told us her surname was arnold  well pedro to bring my story to an end my father told the daultons all about you and got them to lend mariquita to us  that was two years ago  since then she has dwelt with us as my very dear sister  my father knew you were in peru at the time and his purpose was to wait till you should return and present mariquita unexpectedly to you to see if you would recognise each other  therefore he did not mention her when he wrote asking you so urgently to return here  neither did he mention his suspicions to mariquita herself  we just led her to understand that we found her company so pleasant that we wished her to remain with us for a long visit  then came news of the illness of a dear relation of mine in chili  i was sent by my father to see and nurse her  at parting he told me if i should by any chance meet with you i was on no account to speak or even hint at this matter  little did either of us think at the time that i was destined to make so long a journey under your care  and you know senhor pedro that i am not bad at keeping secrets  i not only obeyed my father in this matter but i faithfully obeyed yourself when you imposed on me the necessity of keeping my disguise secret from senhor armstrong  you did manuela faithfully  and it was very hard to do let me assure you as well as needless returned manuela in a slightly hurt tone  over and over again i have been on the point of betraying myself  why did you require me to maintain such secrecy and afflict myself with such constant care and watchfulness  because i knew full well replied pedro with a twinkle in his eye that if poor senhor armstrong knew your true character he would infallibly fall in love with you in spite of your brown skin  and pray senhor why should you object to senhor armstrong or any one else falling in love with me in spite of my brown skin  you know very well manuela that your father being my friend it is my duty in all circumstances to be faithful to him  you are also aware that your father entertains a strong objection to very young men who have no money or prospects presuming to think of marriage with his daughter and that he would never consent to your being engaged to senhor armstrong in present circumstances  it was my simple duty therefore when i saw the danger to warn and protect you  indeed i saw almost the first day after we met the youth that i had made a great mistake in asking him to join us but it was too late then to change so i imposed secrecy on you and admit that you have acted your part well but my wellmeant efforts have been utterly in vain  how so  why because the poor wretch has fallen hopelessly in love with you in spite of your disguiseay and in spite of his own efforts to the contrary for i have watched him carefully and regard him as an uncommonly fine specimen of an amiable selfdenying and honourable man  and now as i had feared your father is furious at his presuming even to think of you though i have done my best to show him that he has acted nobly all through our journey that after all he may not really care for you at all and that at all events you have given him no encouragement whatever and do not care a straw for him  manuela flushed deeply at the last words and there was the slightest possible contraction of her fine eyebrows as she replied somewhat loftily  senhor pedro you are a kind friend and a faithful guide but you pretend to a greater knowledge of these matters than you possess  you do not understand my beloved father as well as i do and you are totally ignorant of the state of my feelings  however i believe you have done all for the best and my earnest request now is that having discharged what you conceive to be your duty on this point you will say and do nothing more  your will would be law in this matter even if i were not under such a deep debt of gratitude to you returned pedro and it is all the more easy to obey you now that i have handed you over to your father and am no longer responsible  are you aware that we start immediately in pursuit of the indians who have attacked and murdered the poor people of rollands ranch  yes my father has told me all about it  has he told you that you and mariquita are to accompany the force so far on the road and that when we get beyond the disturbed district i am to carry you on with a small party to buenos ayres while the main body pursues the savages  yes he told me that too replied manuela but she added with a little hesitation he did not say who was to go with our small detachment  the slightest possible twinkle in pedros eye indicated suppressed feeling as he replied that he also was ignorant on that pointthe only things which he was quite sure of being that senhor armstrong and quashy were to go with the main body  indeed exclaimed the maiden in surprise  i had thought senhor armstrong objected to fighting  pedro laughed  so he does senhorina but when the rescue of captive women and children is in the case he holds fighting to be a duty as you are aware  but i must go now continued pedro becoming grave and earnest as he took the girls hand  words can never express my feelings towards you and your father dear manuela  indeed i have never been in the habit of saying muchleast of all when i have felt much mariquita and i will bless you both to the latest hour of our lives adieu  we meet in the morning at the house in which you are staying lawrence has named it the house with the rustic porchand we start from there  you are all ready i suppose  yes  you know i have little luggage to look after said manuela with a laugh and i shall continue to travel as an indian girlas an inca princess  indeed  why so  that senhor pedro is a matter with which you have nothing whatever to do    chapter twenty two  colonel marchbanks proves to be not so good a general as he gets credit for and lawrence stands selfconvicted  it has been stated that our hero had agreed to join colonel marchbanks in the pursuit of the indians not because the troops sought to avenge the murders which had been committed but because several women and children had been carried off and the rescue of these formed the main object of the expedition  there can be no doubt however that the desire of lawrence to join in such a praiseworthy adventure was not a little stimulated by the fact that manuela was to accompany her father at least a part of the way and he naturally hoped to have some opportunities of speaking to her perhaps of riding beside her as he had so often done when he imagined her to be a daughter of the incas  but alas the course of his love being true and deepremarkably deep was doomed to run in its proverbially rugged course  colonel marchbanks when leading his men to gloryor otherwiselike a true soldier as he was invariably moved with an advance and rearguard  like a cautious father he placed lawrence in the rearguard and arranged that there should be a considerable distance between it and the main body  we may remark in passing that when the first burst of the old gentlemans anger with lawrence was over he had generously resolved in consideration of what the young man had done for his daughter to make no further allusion to the ballroom scene but merely to hold the presumptuous youth politely at armslength and take especial care that the two young people should not again have an opportunity of meeting alone  he laid no command on either of them but simply trusted to his own wisdom and watchfulness  being as it were a freelance lawrence he knew would naturally ride in the force very much where he pleased  he had therefore cleverly provided against the evil consequences that might flow from such freedom by making a little arrangement at a brief and final interview the evening before they set out  now young senhor he said in his usual abrupt way although a volunteer in this expedition and not versed in military matters you must of course put yourself under my orders and consider yourself one of my troopers  oh of course of course lawrence had not the slightest objection to do so  he was quite ready to do whatever was required of him if only he might assist in the rescue of hapless captives and although he knew nothing of military matters still in the event of an engagement he might prove himself useful as a surgeon  humph  we dont deal much in surgeons in this country  it is usually do or die with us replied the colonel with a grim smile  however we shall see  meanwhile i have appointed you to the charge of some of the baggagemules  your late experience must have made you somewhat expert in such matters and your duty will be with the rearguard  one of my officers will show you your position in the morning  goodnight  lawrence left with a quiet goodnight colonel and with a very unquiet feeling that somehow things might not turn out precisely as he had hoped  later that night manuela appeared before her stern father dressed in the old familiar costume of an indian girl and with her fair skin stained dark brown  usually the old soldier met his child with a beaming smile that lit up his rugged visage with tenderness as a gleam of sunshine sometimes illumines the rugged peaks of the andes but on this occasion he received her with a frown compounded of love and annoyance  how now child  this is an unseasonable time for such foolery  i want to travel in my old dress father she replied with a winning smile that almost tore the old mans heart in twainand there are such smiles reader let us assure you though you may not have had the good fortune to see them yet  you certainly shall do nothing of the sort my dear returned the stern old man as if he were laying down one of the medopersic laws for he was very tough you know and had great power of control over his feelings especially the softer ones  oh im so sorry you dont like it said the inca princess with a little look of humble disappointment which was infinitely more heartrending than the smile but do you know father i have ridden so long in this costume and in the gentleman fashion that i feel quite sureat least i thinki should be utterly knocked up the first day if i were to begin a long hard journey in the ladies position  then you know i could not dare to ride so in ordinary female dress and with a white face the thing would look ridiculouswouldnt it  and of course everybody knows that pedro arrived here with an indian girl in his band so the thing will seem quite natural and nobody will notice me especially if i keep near to pedro and the soldiers will just thinkif they think at allthat you have left your daughter behind  ah well that alters the case manuela said the colonel with most unmedopersic hesitancy and still frowning a little at his inkbottlenot at his daughter  of course if it had been merely one of your whims nothing would have induced me to let you go in such guise but there is truth in what you say andyesa good thought you shall travel near pedro  goodnight  go to bed love  you will need all the rest you can obtain between now and morning  goodnight darling father  i would kiss you if i had not just put on the stain  she retired and soon after laid her pretty brown cheek on her pillow in placid contentment while her grim father arranged his war plans so that pedro should travel with the advanceguard  there was a soft fresh exhilarating breeze blowing from the pampas as the troop issued from the little town at a gallop when the first streak of dawn became visible  there was order doubtless in all the arrangements but all seemed utter confusion to lawrence as he assisted the young officer under whose special command he was placed to look after the mules  some faint evidence of order however began to reveal itself to his uneducated mind when he observed that the confusion abated on the main body moving off and leaving him with a small band behind  his perception of order might have been still further though unpleasantly increased had he known that the advanceguard with manuela in its train had started a considerable time previously  but he had not much time to think for the command was almost immediately given to mount and ride  quashy was beside him for being his servant colonel marchbanks had said he might do with him as he pleased  but quashy was silent for his spirit was chafed  his master observed the fact after the first halfhours gallop  what ails you quash  i cant abide peepil growled the negro what says aw  what do you mean  i mean that aws agwine wid us  whatthe sportsmaneh  yes massa  ony i dont blieve he ever sported nuffin but a swagger andandaw  wen i git up dis mornin i heerd im say to his friend i say jack wouldnt itawbe dooced good fun to go and awhab a slap at de injins  if de injins send a spear troo his libberawhell not tink it sitch fun  thats true quash but the same may be said of ourselves  not so massa cause we nebber said it would be dooced good fun  theres something in that quash but you shouldnt let feelings of illwill to any one get the mastery of you  men of his stamp are often very good fellows at bottom though they do aw in a most ridiculous and unaccountable manner  besides he has done you no harm  done me no harm repeated the negro indignantly didnt he say you was mad or drunk  well well said lawrence laughing that was a very innocent remark it did no harm to either of us  yous wrong massa returned quashy in a magnificently hurt tone  it dood no harm to you but it hurt my feelins an dats wuss dan hurtin my body  at this point in the conversation the troop passed over the brow of an eminence and beheld the wide rolling sea of the illimitable south american pampas or plains stretching away on all sides to the horizon during the whole morning they had been galloping through the region of the monte or bush that borderland which connects the treeless plains with the tropical forests of the north where thorny shrubs covered the ground in more or less dense patches where groves of the algarobaa noble tree of the mimosa speciesand trees laden with a peachlike but poisonous fruit as well as other trees and shrubs diversified the landscape and where the ground was carpeted with beautiful flowering plants among which were the variegated blossoms of verbena polyanthus and others  but now all was changed  it seemed as if the party had reached the shores of a great level grassy sea with only here and there a seeming islet where a thicket grew to break the skyline of the horizon  for a few minutes the rearguard drew up to collect the straggling baggagemules and then away they went with a wild shout as if they were moved by the same glad feeling of freedom that affects the petrel when it swoops over the billows of the mighty ocean  the scene and the sensations were absolutely new to lawrence and quashy both were mounted on very good horses which seemed to sympathise with their riders for they required no spur to urge them over the grassy plain  the sun was bright and lawrence had been too long accustomed to the leaden skies of old england to quarrel with the sunshine however hot it might be besides he rather enjoyed heat and as for quashy heat was his native element  a pleasant air was blowing too  in short everything looked beautiful especially to our hero who knewat least supposedthat a certain princess of the incas was in the band immediately in front of him  he was not aware you see that she was with the advanceguard  das am mugnifercent exclaimed quashy as his horse put his foot into a biscachohole and only escaped a fall by making a splendid bound where by its haunch striking the negros back sent him plunging on to its neck  oh  i does like to be shook like dat massa  if you get shook much worse than that cried lawrence ill have to stop to pick you up  no fear massa  howebber much i wobbles i nebber comes off  an islet of bushes at this point necessitated a slight detour  on the other side of it they found that the main body of the troop had halted for rest and food  right glad was lawrence to find that colonel marchbankss humour was entirely changed that the asperity of the previous night had passed away and that the natural urbanity of his nature had returned  a pleasant gallop was it not senhor armstrong he said as our hero joined the group of officers around him  delightful and quite new to me said lawrence  i have often read of but never seen the pampas till now  he looked furtively about as he spoke  the colonel marked the look and with a somewhat grim smile observed that they should see more than enough of the pampas for some days to come  the sea of long yellowbrown grass and thistles he added gets to be rather monotonous at last but i never weary of the feeling of immensity and freedom which it inspires  come dine with us senhor  lawrence gladly accepted the invitation  we make but a brief halt said the colonel for time presses and distances are great  our next shall be at the estancia algaroba where we shall spend the night  your friend pedro will make arrangements for us  he is with the advanceguard  oh indeed said lawrence then feeling that he ought to say something more i suppose his newlyfound daughter is with him  yes replied the colonel curtly as he shot a suspicious glance at the youth from under his shaggy brows  after dining lawrence returned to the baggagemules with an unaccountable depression of spirits upon him and deeply absorbed with the question whether rearguards ever overtook advanceguards and what if they did usually became of intervening main bodies  with such puzzling military questions on his mind the remainder of that days journey was not equal to the first part and even quashy the sympathetic failed to interest him  the estancia previously referred to by the colonel stood on a slight eminence surrounded by the grove of algarobatrees from which it derived its name  the fruit of this tree forms excellent food for cattle and lawrence found himself busily engaged during the first hour after arrival in procuring it for his mules and otherwise looking after his charge  when this duty was done feeling no disposition to join his comrades at supper he sauntered into a garden in rear of the estancia where he found a rustic seat under an algarobatree and sat down to meditate  it was a calm peaceful moonlight night with an air so he felt of sadness about it which harmonised with his melancholy thoughts  he now believed he saw through colonel marchbankss plan and had given up all hope of seeing manuela again  in these circumstances being a man of submissive spirit yet powerful will he set himself resolutely to think of the important object in which he was engaged  somewhat thus his meditations ran  i am no soldier but i am a man and i should be less than a man unworthy to liveif i were not ready to help in the rescue of women and children  some of the girls poor things may be like manuthat is now although i hate war and do not approve of settling disputes by the sword i feel that selfdefence or the defence of the helpless justifies waray to the knife  of course it does  was i not thoroughly justified in fighting the robbers when manu  well then let me think it out  a thing is not properly thought at all until it is thought out and found out  talking of that how fortunate that pedros little daughter was found out  it is most interesting  i delight to think of her  and shes so pretty tooquite beautiful though of course not so beautiful as man  bother manuela he exclaimed aloud starting up  as he spoke manuela herselfthe princess of the incasstood before him  in order to account for this sudden miscarriage of the colonels plans we must turn aside to state that the princess being of an active disposition and not easily tired had said to pedro that evening when his detachment was encamping under a group of trees not far from the estancia that she would ride back to the main body to see her father  but my strict orders are said pedro that i am to keep you with the advanceguard and you know that your father is not a man to be disobeyed  quite true returned the princess looking with a solemn expression down at pedrofor she was still on horseback while he and his men were dismounted preparing the camp  you must on no account disobey my father pedro  well then you see returned the guide with an amused look i cannot give you permission to leave us  of course not  that would be insubordination pedro would it not which in time of war is punishable i think with death  i would never think of asking permission or tempting you to disobey  i will be sure to tell my father that you positively refused to let me go  adieu senhor pedro  a good appetite and sweet repose  she touched her splendid horse with a switch and next moment was flying over the pampas at a pace that rendered pursuit useless  dismounting and fastening her steed to a tree she passed through the garden towards the house and naturally as we have seen came upon lawrence  manuela he exclaimed  si senhor she replied  he advanced a step with outstretched arms and then checking himself clasped his hands  is itcan it bea dream  what doos you dream senhor asked the girl in the old familiar broken english  manuela dear girl do not trifle with me  it seems like magic  did i not see youin the ballroomwhitethe daughter of colonel marchbanks  well senhor armstrong said manuela earnestly and in good english i admit that i am the daughter of colonel marchbanks but i did not indeed i did not wish to deceive  deceive interrupted lawrence quickly as well might you tell me that one of the unfallen angels did not mean to deceive  o dear one forgive me  i know not how to tell itbutbutcan you believe that a great stupid fellow like myself loves you so thatthatiwellits of no use  ill never act wisely if i try toto  he seized her hand  she did not withdraw it  he drew her to him  she did not resist and there followed a sounda very slight sound yet it was not so slight but that it sent a shock of alarm and anger to the soul of colonel marchbanks who came up at that awkward moment  sir sirrah senhorrascal spluttered the old man as manuela ran away from the scene whatwhywhat do you mean  drawing himself up lawrence said with a look of dignity  colonel marchbanks i can look you honestly in the face and say that neither in word nor deed have i done you or your daughter wrong  nohave you not shouted the colonel  sir rascalthere is a lookingglass over the mantelpiece in the estancia  go there look yourself in the face and say if you dare that you have done me no wrong  he wheeled about violently and strode away fuming  lawrence went to his chamber wondering at such a display of wrath in one so genial  he glanced at the lookingglass in passing through the chief room of the estancia  the glance revealed to him the fact that there was a large rich brown patch in the region of his mouth and nose    chapter twenty three  treats of savages captives chases accidents incidents and perplexities  not unfrequently in human affairs evil consequences are happily averted by unforeseen circumstances  it was so on the present occasion  what colonel marchbankss wrath might have led to no one can tell for a little before dawn on the following morning there came a messenger in hot haste from pedro stating that one of the scouts had come in with the news that the indians were encamped with their captives and booty not half a days ride in advance of them  the result was an immediate order to advance and to close up  it is interesting to consider how small a matter will cheer the spirits of some men  the order to mount and ride naturally produced some excitement in the breast of lawrence armstrong being unaccustomed to the dash and whirl of troops eager to meet the foe but the succeeding order to close up did more it filled his heart with joy for did it not imply that the advance and rearguards must come nearer to each other  at least to his unmilitary mind it seemed so  in a brief space of time and with marvellously little noise the troops were in motion and at dawn sure enough he saw the figures of the ladies galloping with the advance party with pedro leading the wayfor he had been appointed to the responsible duty of guide  venturing to push a little ahead of his special charge lawrence soon found himself with the main body and heard the colonel order one of his officers to ride forward and tell the ladies to fall to the rear of the force  hearing this lawrence almost imperceptibly to himself tightened his reins but before he had dropped many strides behind the colonel turned his head slightly and summoned him by name  with something like a guilty feeling lawrence rode forward  we have heard of the whereabouts of the savages senhor armstrong  you are a civilian and as surgeon to the force it is your duty of course to keep as much out of danger as possible but as brave men usually prefer the front i absolve you from this duty  you are at liberty to go there if you choose  the blood rushed to our heros face  he knew well what the old soldier meant  with a simple thank you colonel he put spurs to his steed and was in a few seconds galloping alongside of pedro  you ride furiously senhor said the guide with a twinkle in his eye which was characteristic of him when amused  lawrence made no reply  just then they overtopped a slight ridge or rising ground and beheld a few mounted men on the horizon  these were evidently the scouts of the indian band for on seeing the soldiers they drew hastily together and stood in a group as if to consult for a few seconds  then turning they galloped over the next rising ground and disappeared  the soldiers of course increased their speed  on gaining the top of the ridge they beheld a large band of indians mounting and galloping off in hot haste  evidently they did not intend to give battleat least at that time  with a mighty shout the soldiers bore down on them at their utmost speedlawrence pedro the colonel and quashy leading for they were the best mounted of the party  it was soon perceived that captives were with the indians for women in civilised dress were seen on horseback and some of the savages had children in front of them  at this sight every thought of self fled from the warm heart of lawrence armstrong and he was impressed with but one idearescue the helpless  urging his steed to its utmost he was soon far ahead of the troop closely followed by quashy whose eyes and teeth seemed to blaze with excitement  there was a savage straight ahead of them who carried something in his arms  it seemed to be a child  fixing his eye on this man lawrence spurred on and grasped his sword with deadly intent  quashy ever observant did the same  the man perceiving their intentions diverged a little to the right of his comrades probably thinking that his pursuers would be unwilling to quit the main band and might thus be thrown off  he was mistaken for lawrence possessed with immense power of will a strong spice of recklessness  the more therefore that the savage diverged the more did his pursuers diverge in their determination to have him  finding himself hard pressed he dropped his load  it proved to be only a sack which bursting revealed not a child but a quantity of miscellaneous property  enraged as well as disappointed by the discovery our hero being fallible permitted evil feelings to enter his bosom and spurred on with a tighter grasp of the sword under the influence of revenge but the savage being now lightened held on with still greater speed diverging more and more until in a short time he raced almost at right angles from his companions towards a part of the plain which was somewhat elevated above the surrounding level  it was a wise move on his part for the place he knew was riddled with biscachoholes  among these he steered his course with consummate skill  of course lawrences steed ere long put its foot into a hole and rolled over sending its rider headlong to the ground where he lay on his back insensible alike to pity for captives and impulses of revenge  after lying thus for a considerable time he slowly opened his eyes and looking up met the solemn gaze of quashy  his head rested on the knee of his sable follower  whats wrong quash was his first inquiry  nuffins wrong massa now you talk  i was begin to tink your mout was shut up for ebber  have they caught the rascals asked lawrence suddenly recollecting what had passed and raising himself on one elbow  i not know massa  nobody here to tell  howwhatwhere are the troops  dun know massa gone arter de injins i spose an de injins gone arter deir own business an bof gone off de face ob de art altogidderso far as i can see  lawrence started up in great anxiety and although still giddy from the effects of his fall could see plainly enough that neither troops nor indians were to be seenonly a mighty sea of waving grass with a clear horizon all round and nothing to break the monotony of the vast solitude save their two horses browsing quietly a few yards off  quashy it strikes me that we shall be lost said lawrence with anxious look  smy opinion massa dat wes lost aready  come returned lawrence rising with some difficulty lets mount and be off after them  which way did they gothat is at what point of the compass did they disappear  quashys face assumed the countless wrinkles of perplexity  he turned north south east and west with inquiring glances at the blank horizon and of course gave a blank reply  you see massa he said apologetically you hoed arollin ober an ober in sitch a way dat it rader confused me an i forgits to look whar we was an den i was so awrful cut up for fear yous gone dead dat i tink ob nuffin elsean now its too late  too late indeed rejoined lawrence with a feeling of bitterness nevertheless we must ride somewhere  catch our horses quashy and i will wait for you and think  having applied himself to that most difficult processthinking out a plan with insufficient material for thoughtour hero resolved to ride in what he supposedjudging by the position of the sunwas an easterly direction hoping to strike the trail of the pursuers and fugitives before night  you see quashy he remarked as they galloped swiftly over the flowering plains we are almost sure to find the trail in a short time for although neither you nor i have had much experience in following trails in the wilderness we have got some sort of ideaat least i have from booksof how the thing should be done and even the most stupid white man could scarcely ride across the track of several hundred horsemen without observing it  das true massa  eben the stoopidist black man am equal to dat  but what if yous mistook de drection an wes ridin west instead ob east  why then quashy wed discover our mistake sooner or later by arriving at the andes returned lawrence with a bland smile  hi  i don mean west returned the negro with a reciprocal grin you couldnt be so mistook as datbut spose youse go souf by mistake  why then the straits of magellan would bring us up  ahwell massa i dun know whar de straits ob majillum is but it would be a comfort to be brought up anywhar for den you couldnt go no farder  an if wes on de right track were sure to come to de atlantic at last eben if we miss de injins an de sodjers altogidder das pleasant to tink onint it  apparently lawrence did not think it remarkably pleasant for he paid no further attention to the remarks of his companion but proceeded along with a profound almost stern gravity and with his eyes glancing keenly right and left after the most approved manner of the indian brave or the backwoods scout  no track or trail however of any kind was to be seen  for more than an hour they sped along down in the flowering hollows over the grassy waves steering carefully past the riddled townships of the biscachos now and then diverging a little to avoid some larger shrubs or tangled masses of herbage sometimes uttering a word of comment on passing objects and occasionally craning their necks on observing some buzzard or other bird on the horizon but never drawing rein until they came to a rising ground from the highest point of which they could have a commanding view of the region all round  here they pulled up  quashy said lawrence in a deep solemn tone we are indeed lost  it pears to me yous right massa  and yet we must be on the right track continued lawrence as if communing with himself unless indeed the indians may have changed their direction and turned off to the south  or de nort suggested quashy in the same selfcommuning tone  come theres nothing for it but to push on cried lawrence galloping away  das so  nuffin else said quashy following  and so they continued on for another hour or more in grim silence after which they rode as it were in grim despairat least lawrence did so for he felt bitterly that he was now separated perhaps for ever from manuela and that he could render no further aid in rescuing the captives from the savages  as for the negro despair was not compatible with his free and easy not to say reckless happygolucky temperament he felt deeply indeed for his young master and sympathised profoundly but for himself he cared little and thought of nothing beyond the interests of the passing hour  possibly if both horses had broken their legs and lawrence had broken his neck quashy might have given way to despair but it is probable that nothing less severe could have overcome his buoyant spirit  at last the sun began to descend behind the andes which were by that time turned into a misty range of tender blue in the far far distance the steeds also showed signs of declining power for in his anxiety to overtake the troops lawrence had pressed them rather harder than he would otherwise have done  opportunely at that time they came in sight of a small clump of bushes like a low islet in the sea of grass  we will camp here said lawrence brusquely as he pulled up and dismounted  the game is up  we are fairly lost thats quite clear and it is equally clear that we and our horses must rest  he spoke in a tone of cynical joviality as if defying his misfortunes the simpleminded quashy accepting it as genuine said all right massa in a tone of cheerful satisfaction as he slid off his steed and set about preparing the encampment  if our heros mind had been more at ease it is probable that he would have enjoyed his surroundings greatly for although lost on the wide pampas they had not begun yet to suffer physically from that misfortune  their wallets were still supplied with food sufficient for at least three full meals the weather was serene and the situation viewed in one aspect was exceedingly romantic  from the top of the rising ground where the fire was burning and the steaks of mares flesh roasting the complete circle of the horizon could be seen and the yellowbrown grass of the pampas at that time about a foot high rolled with a motion that strangely resembled the waves of the liquid ocean itself  but poor lawrence was incapable of enjoying the beauties of nature just then  after one long anxious look round to see if any object should present itself which might raise the faintest echo of hope he returned to the camp and sat down on a mound with a profound sigh  chee up massa said quashy raising his face which glittered with his efforts to blow the fire into a glow  yous git her in de long run  get who demanded lawrence in surprise not unmingled with a touch of severity for this was the first time that his humble follower had dared to touch on the theme that was uppermost in his mind  with a strange compound of what is well named cheek and humility quashy replied her you know de inca princessmanuela  its all right  and pray quashy how do you know that its all right or that i want anything to be all right  in short what business have you to presume toto  oh its all right massa replied the negro with a winkand what a wink that wasi knows all about it bein zactly in de same state wid soozn  lawrence sought refuge from conflicting feelings in a loud laugh and asked what hope quashy could by any possibility entertain of ever seeing susan againshe having as it were vanished from off the earth  oh nebber fear was quashys comfortable reply  is sure to find soozn for she no can git along widout me no more nor i can git along widout her  wes sure to find one anoder in de long run  envying his mans unwavering faith lawrence sat for some time silently contemplating the gorgeous sunset when an exclamation drew his attention to the opposite side of the landscape  look massa  suffin movin dar  there was indeed a moving speckor rather two speckson the horizon as they drew nearer it was soon seen to be a gaucho of the pampas in full chase of an ostrich  they did not come straight towards our wanderers but passed within half a mile of them  the picturesque hunter bending over his steeds neck with his scarlet poncho streaming behind him and the bolas whirling round his head was so eager in the pursuit that he either did not observe or did not mind the thin smoke of the campfire  the giant bird stretching its long legs to the utmost and using its wings as additional propellers seemed quite able to hold its own and test the powers of the horse  gradually pursuer and pursued passed out of the range of vision and were seen no more  just as well remarked lawrence as he afterwards sat eating his maresteak by the starandfire light that fellow might be one of the many robbers who are said to infest the plains and although we could no doubt have protected ourselves from him he might have brought a swarm of his comrades about our ears  yes massa was quashys brief reply for he was engaged at that moment with a large and tough mouthful  a long ride and a hearty though frugal supper disposed both master and man for rest that night  when the last gleam of sunset had faded from the western sky and the last scraps of mares flesh had vanished from their respective bones when the stars were twinkling with nocturnal splendour and all nature was sinking to repose lawrence and quashy lay down on the grass spread their ponchos above them pillowed their weary heads upon their saddles and slept profoundly    chapter twenty four  lawrence and his man fall in with strangers hear good news and experience rough usage  lost on the pampas thought lawrence on awaking next morning  it was romantic no doubt butwell he did not follow up the but with very definite conceptions  as he lifted his eyes towards the horizon where the rays of the rising sun were suffusing the sky with a tinge of rosy light his first feelings partook of gratitude for a night of unbroken rest which had restored a bounding sensation of physical life and strength and energy awaking in such a condition of mind and body leads one contradictory though it may seem to spend the first few minutes of reviving consciousness in restful contemplation and enjoyment of ones surroundings  raising himself on one elbow our hero let his eyes wander dreamily over the vast plain  there was much monotony about it no doubt but the majesty of illimitable space neutralised that impression  on the horizon the intensifying tone of the rapidly increasing light harmonised with the varying greens and yellows of the herbage  here and there one or two uplands in the far distance caught the sheen of day and relieved the prospect with streaks of varied hue still nearer a few clumps of low shrubbery increased this diversity a little  in the middledistance the varied colours and forms of the grasses became distinct enough to invest the scene with character while in the immediate foreground additional force and interest were given to the landscape by the person of quashy lying flat on his back with his great eyes closed and his huge mouth open  the state of dreamy contemplation did not last long  the stern realities of the situation seemed to rush in upon his mind with sudden power  lost lost  the captives perhaps still unrescued from the savages  manuela in danger  it was a dreadful state of things  come quashy cried lawrence leaping up and giving the negro a rough shake that brought him instantly to a sitting and blinking condition get up  we must be off  saddle the horsesthe horwhy where are the horses  he finished the sentence in tones of anxiety for no horses were visible  bounding into the patch of bushes on the edge of which they had passed the night lawrence ran through it hastily followed by his man who had shaken off lethargy in a moment  the patch was small  moreover the shrubs were barely tall enough to conceal a horse  in five minutes it became quite certain that the horses were not there  from the highest point of the rising ground they had a clear view of the plains all round but after the keenest scrutiny not a speck resembling a horse was to be seen  the searchers looked at each other in dismay  lost and our horses gone said lawrence in a voice which excess of alarm had reduced to a sort of low hoarse whisper  most awrful murmured quashy  lawrence cleared his throat and paused while his sympathetic servant gazed  now quashy he said it seems to me quite impossible that our animals could have strayed in a few hours quite out of such an enormous circle of vision  they must be somewhere about though we cant see them  yes massa dey must be somewhar as you say  well then it follows that they must be concealed in one of the few clumps of bushes that lie around us  so we must search these instantly for our only hope lies in finding the horses  das so massa  even our negros elastic spirit seemed to be subdued to some extent by the prospect before them for apart from the fact that the bushy islets in the grassy sea were scarcely high enough to entirely conceal so large an object as a horse they were scattered about at such immense distances from each other that a complete search of them implied toilsome labour for at least the whole of that day  lawrence felt however that it had to be done and arranged that his man should search towards the east while he should take the west  to prevent the risk of their losing the mound on which they stood one of their ponchos was thrown over the top of the highest bush and fixed there as a signal  so eager were they to begin that both started off without a thought of breakfast  it is not necessary to follow the steps of each  in regard to lawrence it may suffice to say that he wandered during the whole of that sultry day over the boundless plain wearily but persistently examining the few bushislets that lay to the west of their bivouac without finding a trace of the lost steeds  as the sun began to decline towards the east he gave up in despair and with weary limbs and something like wolfish hunger returned towards the rendezvous  very different had been the experience of his sable servant  starting off as we have said at the same time with his master quashy found the two horses after a two hours search quietly grazing in a grassy hollow  a low shrubcovered mound lying close to this hollow intervened between it and the spot where our adventurers had spent the night thus effectually concealing the lost steeds from view  the instant quashy made the discovery he ran to the nearest elevation on the plain with the intention of shouting the news to his master but by that time lawrence was two or three miles away on the other side of the bivouac quite beyond the range of sight and hearing  quashy therefore ran back to the hollow with the intention of catching the horses mounting his own and driving the other before him to the camp  and now began that interesting but somewhat exhausting and heartbreaking process which may be styled coquetting with a free horse  full of glad enthusiasm the negro ran towards his own steed holding out his right hand and exclaiming come along ole scrubby  he had named the horse ole scrubby owing to some sort of facetious perversity of his own temperament for the horse instead of being ole was quite young and far from being scrubby it was a remarkably fine animal  come now ole scrubby repeated the man wes got no time to waste dee hear  evidently it heard for after allowing its master to advance within three feet of it and even putting out its nose to smell his black hand it gave a snort turned round tossed up its heels and trotted away stopping short suddenly it turned again and looked at its master with a high head as if to say there what think you of that  you ole scoundril growled the negro with an injured look dint i say wes got no time to waste eh  come now  das enuff o your fun  he had again approached to within three feet or so and again the playful steed had protruded its nose and even touched his hand but before that hand could grasp the halter tail and heels were in the air and away it went a second time  indignation intensified to the uttermost sat on quashys countenance scrubs he said solemnlymodifying the name a little as he became more seriousyou nebber dood dat before  come sar you bey orders an stan still  but the horse refused to obey orders and declined to stand still  his master began to lose temperif we may so speak of one who only became a little less amiable than usual  under the influence of the condition however whatever it was he became unjust and began to call his horse names  what you not bey orders you ole screwyou unnatral villinyou obsnit lump o hossflesh  stan still i say  need we say that the horse refused to stand still  again and again and over again the negro tried to lay hands on the animal and as often did he fail  quashy however was not to be easily beaten  his was a resolute and persevering nature but the misfortune on that occasion was that he had to do with a creature possessed of greater resolution and perseverance than himself  he spent hours over the effort  he coaxed the horse  he wheedled it  he remonstrated with and reproved it  he tried the effect of the most endearing entreaties and assurances of personal esteem  losingno becoming less amiable he flew round to the other extreme and accused it of ingratitude indefensible even in an ass  then he sought to bribe it with offers of free forgiveness  after that he tried to frighten it with threats of the most painful and every way horrible consequences but whatever effect all these varied influences might have had upon the horses mind the one unvarying effect on its body was to send its tail and heels towards the sky while it neighed joyously and trotted around  poor quashy went up to it smilinglyafter that frowningly he cringed towards it he advanced straightforwardly he sidled slily he ran at it he rushed at it he bounced at it he yelled at it he groaned at it he perspired after it he went nearly mad over it and finally he sat down before it and glared in deadly silence in its innocent face  then the unfortunate man having spent a very considerable part of the day thus bethought him of trying to catch the other horse but with it he was also unsuccessfulindeed the failure was even more emphatic for lawrences steed refused to let him come within even hopeful distance of it  at last in the profoundest state of despair to which he was ever known to have sunk he returned to camp  lawrence had got there before him saw him coming and advanced to meet him  well quashy i have failed he said with a sigh  sos i returned quashy with a growl  this losing of our horses remarked lawrence is the worst that could have befallen us  no massa said the negro with more of sulkinessor less of amiabilitythan he had exhibited since they first met on the western side of the andes breakin our legs would be wusssmashin our necks would be wusser still  but de hosses is not lost  deys ony spunkerblued  how  what dyou mean  deys down dar returned the negro pointing with his finger down in dat hollerspunkerblued  not killed i hope asked lawrence anxiously  oh no massa ony spunkerbluedstuffed to de muzzle wid deir own selfwill  lawrence received this explanation with a light laugh  come he said quickly lead the way quash and ill show you how to get them out of the spunkerblues  comforted and reassured by his masters hearty tone and manner the negro led the way to the spot where he had spent such a busy day  now we do not know whether we have made it obvious to the reader that lawrence armstrongs kindliness of nature embraced not only the human race but the whole animal kingdom  at all events it is true that wherever he came in contact with the lower animals he managed by some species of fascination to gain their affections  the mode of fascination began no doubt with their stomachs but this does not alter the fact  among other creatures lawrence had gained the affections of quashys steed and also of manuelas and pedros horses as well as his own by means of sugar  with this simple appliance he went into the hollow and held out his hand  come ole scrubby he cried using quashys words  with a cheerful neigh the rebellious one trotted up received the sugar and suffered himself to be led once more into servitude  even among the brutes quash he remarked as he patted the nose of his own steed we are meant to overcome evil with good  come we must spend another night here for it is too late to start off now besides i am tired out and starving  massa returned quashy as they mounted is done up to dat extent an so hungry i could sleep on prickly pears an heat my wittles raw  in this condition of body and mind they galloped back to camp and took particular care that the horses should not again stray  next morning after breakfasting on the remains of their food they mounted and taking the sun as their guide headed away eastward at full gallop  silently and steadily for two hours or more they swept along over the pampas waves turning aside only a little once or twice to avoid ground that had been riddled and rendered unsafe by the biscachos  as noon approached quashy gave a shout and pointed to the horizon ahead of them where living objects of some kind were seen moving along  ostriches said lawrence  deys a noo kind ob ostriches wid four legs returned the negro an wid peepil on deir backs  i believe you are right  a party of mounted men apparently  come this is well  whoever they are we shall at least be able to gather some information from them and at the worst we can follow them to some inhabited spot  true massa an if deys rubbers we kin fight dem  on drawing near they found that the riders belonged to a family of gauchos  there were six of themall finelooking fellows clad in the graceful though ragged costume of the pampas  one of their number was a little boy of about five years of age who rode his horse with all the elegance and ease of a spanish grandee though only about the size of a large monkey  they turned out to be honest and friendly men who said that they were returning home after assisting in a successful chase after indians  had they been assisted by troops in the chase lawrence asked eagerly  yes they hadtroops under a tall whitehaired colonel and the captives had been rescued the savages scattered and the soldiers had gone off in the direction of buenos ayres  so quashy theyve managed the job without our assistance said lawrence on hearing this  now we must spur after the troops as hard as our steeds can go  on this being stated to the leading gaucho he shook his head and advised the senhor to go to their hut for the night  it was only a little way out of the line of march there the travellers could feed and rest well and start refreshed in the morning  besides a storm was coming on which would prevent all travelling for some hours  as he spoke he pointed to a part of the sky which had become dark with clouds and without further remark galloped away followed by his companions  lawrence deemed it wise in the circumstances to accept the invitation  the day had been very sultry and if our travellers had not been ignorant of the signs of the pampas they might have known that the day was heavy with the presage of storm  before the gaucho home to which they were hastening appeared on the horizon the whole sky had become overclouded and vivid forked lightning began to play  from the way in which the gauchos spurred and the horses trembled it was clear that they feared being caught in the storm and little wonder for both men and beasts are filled with alarm when overtaken on the unsheltered pampas by one of these terrific tempests the blast sweeping unchecked over hundreds of miles of wilderness often acquires a force that drives all before it  sometimes great herds of cattle have been driven bellowing before the gale tumbling over each other in wild confusion till some swollen river has checked their flight and ended their career  race and spur and shout as they might however the storm was too quick for them on this occasion  the wind seemed to rush down upon them with evil intent and fury changing the temperature from sultry heat to sudden and bitter cold  dust too was stirred up and swept along so thickly that the day became as dark as night  then the rain burst upon them like a waterspout and mingling with the flying dust overhead came down in the form of mud mixed with flying sticks and stones and grass and prickly thistleheads  so fierce was the hurlyburly that it seemed as if man and horse must perish under it  thunder also cracked and roared in terrific peals while ever and anon the lightning flashed like gleaming steel through the darkness  in the midst of this elemental war the party reached the gaucho huts what they were like lawrence could not tell  he had galloped like the rest wildly along with his face buried in his poncho and saw nothing save once or twice when raising his head slightly and opening one eye he saw or fancied he saw the gauchos like dark phantoms flying before him and quashy at his side bending flat on his horses neck the stout negro seemed to care nothing for his body so long as his face was safe for he had let his poncho go and as it was fastened only at the neck it flapped wildly above his head  presently they passed through an opening in what seemed a mud wall then they stopped so suddenly that lawrence almost went over his steeds head while his man effectually did so and throwing a complete somersault alighted by good fortune on his feet  they all tumbled promiscuously into a mud hut and then clearing their eyes found that the gaucholeader and a woman apparently his wife were smiling welcome beside them that the shortlived storm was already passing away after having done its worst and that they were drenched to the skin as well as covered with mud and thistleheads from top to toe    chapter twenty five  begins with gaucho homes and domestic concerns continues with two fights and ends with a friend and a puzzler  that a hard ride and a thorough soaking do not interfere much with the comfort of the young and healthy was proved that night in the gaucho camp by the intense devotion paid by lawrence and quashy to the ample supper set before them and by the profundity of their slumbers thereafter  true the supper was not luxurious  it consisted of only one dish roasted mares fleshand one beveragewater but happily the tastes of our adventurers were simple  the gaucho hut in which they had found shelter was a very humble dwelling built of mud  it contained only one room in which the whole family resided  like other gaucho hutswhich are nearly all alikeit was covered with long yellow grass and bore so strong a resemblance to the surrounding country that at a little distance it might easily have been mistaken for a hillock  the kitchen of the establishment was a detached shed a few yards off  after sunset the hut was lighted by a feeble lamp made of bullocks tallow which brought into strong relief the bridles spurs bolas and lassos which hung from bone pegs on the walls  other objects of interest were revealed by the primitive lamp in one corner a large dog lay sleeping  a naked negro childa sort of ebony cupidlay asleep beside it with its little head pillowed on the dogs haunch  in another corner a hen was sitting on eggs while its companions guarded by a noble cock roosted on one of the rafters and several children of ages ranging from four to sixteen were seated or standing about awaiting supper  last but not least in importance a gaucho infant hung suspended from the rafters in a primitive cradle of bullocks skin the corners of which were drawn together by four strips of hide  the place would have been insufferably close but for the fortunate circumstance that a number of holes in the dilapidated roof allowed free ventilation  they also allowed free entrance of rain in bad weather butgauchos are not particular  although indifferent as to appearances those gauchos of the pampas many of whom are descendants of the best old families in spainretain much of the manners of their forefathers being hospitable and polite not only to strangers but to each other  when supper was ready the great iron spit on which the beef had been roasted was brought in and the point of it stuck into the dried mud floor  the master of the hut then stepped forward with the air of a hidalgo and offered lawrence the skeleton of a horses head to sit upon quashy having been provided with a similar seat the whole household drew in their horseheads circled round the spit and drawing their long knives began supper  they meant business  hunger was the sauce water washed the viands down  there was little conversation for large mouthfuls were the order of the evening  lawrence and his man acquitted themselves creditably and supper did not terminate till the roast was gone  then they all spread their beds on the floor and retired for the night  each covered his or her head with a poncho or other garment nothing of the sleepers being left visible save their bare feetafter which silence reigned around  in summer abodes of this kind are so animated with insect life that the inhabitants usually prefer to sleep on the ground in front of their dwellings but in the present case the recent storm had rendered this luxury for the time impossible  little cared lawrence and his man for that  where they lay down to repose there they remained without motion till daylight  then the magnificent cock overhead raised his voice and proclaimed the advent of a new day  quashy sat up split his face across displayed his internal throat and rubbed his eyes  immediately the cock descended on his woolly head flapped its wings and crowed again  the people began to stir and lawrence went out with quashy to saddle their horses being anxious to follow in the trail of the troops without delay  a prolonged search convinced them that their horses had either strayed or been stolen for they were nowhere to be found  returning to the hut they observed that the gauchos were exceedingly busy round their corral or enclosure for cattle  what can they be about said lawrence as they drew near  killin pigs i tink  i think not there seems too much excitement for that  there certainly was a considerable noise of piggish voices and the gauchos were galloping about in an unaccountable manner but as is usually the case a little investigation explained the seemingly unaccountable  the men were engaged in driving some cattle into the enclosure and as these were more than half wild and selfwilled the process entailed much energy of limb and noise  as to the porcine yells the whole of the almost superhuman skirling arose from one little pig which the ebony cupid before mentioned had lassoed by the hind leg  gaucho childrenafter being delivered from the cradle before described and after passing through the crawling period of infancy and attaining to the dignity of the staggerbegin to copy their seniors  with lassos and bolas made of twine they practise on little birds or on the dogs and fowls of home  our ebony cupid though not indeed a gaucho but a negro infant partook of the gaucho spirit and although little more than four years of age had succeeded in catching his first pig violence seemed to have reached a white heat in the heart of that little pig  besides giving vent to intensified shrieking it dragged its captor along in a state of blazing triumph until it overturned him snapped the twine and got away  but cupid was not to be balked of his prey  with a staggering rush to where several horses were standing ready bridled he caught hold of the tail of a meeklooking animal and scrambled by means of that appendage on to its back  seizing the bridle he uttered a wild though tiny shout and dashed away after the fugitive  whether he recaptured it or not lawrence never found out for at that moment a subject of greater interest claimed his attention  besides the hut in which they had spent the night there were several other huts near the corral and lawrence now perceived that the place was a sort of hamlet surrounded by a small ditch by way of defence while our hero was glancing round him he observed that quashy stopped suddenly and gazed at something in front of him as if transfixed with a surprise which threw quite into the shade all his previous expressions of astonishment and convinced his master that he had not yet fathomed half the depth of meaning that could be thrown into that sable countenance  quashy bent slightly forward extended his arms spread out his ten fingers opened his mouth and tried to speak  sssoo he began and gasped  ssoosoozn he shouted  yes there she stood in the doorway of a hut as black as life and with a glare of joyful surprise that was only surpassed by that of her admirer  a moment later they recovered  they rushed into each others arms and their lips met  pistols and carbines what a smack it was  in his joy quashy lifted susan fairly off her feet and danced with her until he was exhausted then he set her down and danced round her  susan had recovered her composure by that time  whether quashys mode of treatment is characteristic of negroes of the pampas we do not pretend to say but the girl stood there with a modestly pleased expression of face while quashy continued to dance round her  susans modesty and blackness were alike set off by her costume which consisted of a short white frock while her simple adornments were a pair of gold earrings and a necklace of red coral  alas for the fleeting nature of human joys  while quashy was thus evincing his delight at the unexpected recovery of his betrothed a wild shouting was heard and several horsemen were seen flying over the plains towards the huts at a speed and with an action that betokened them the bearers of important news  they proved to be men of the village who had encountered a large band of indians on their way to attack the place  instantly all the men of the hamlet amounting perhaps to about fifty prepared for defence placing the women and children in the huts for safety  of course lawrence and his man would have volunteered their services even if selfdefence had not required that line of conduct  we have said that the hamlet was surrounded by a shallow ditch  this was backed by a hedge of prickly pears  behind the hedge the men dispersed themselves armed with several rusty flintlock guns some old swords a few indian spears and other less warlike weapons  lawrence and quashy took up a position at the entrance to the little fortress the opening of which was blocked by cactusbushes  their host of the previous night stood beside them  light though such defences seemed they were more effective than might have been supposed for indian horses as a rule will not leap even a shallow ditch and cannot be made to burst through prickly pears though doubtless there may be some exceptions  the defenders had not long to wait  their preparations were barely completed when horsemen were descried on the horizon and in a very brief space of time a band of above a hundred naked savages came thundering down on them uttering terrific screams or yells and brandishing long spears  they rode straight towards the opening in the defences  the chief gaucho was evidently a man of courage for although he knew well that capture meant deathperhaps with torturehe stood firm without blanching his eyes fixed sternly on the approaching foe and his strong hands grasping the stock of a rusty old musket the very look of which might have caused anxiety to its handler  now quash whispered lawrence dont fire till i doand keep cool  yes massa  is cool as a lump o hice  the savage who led the assailants was a tall powerful fellow on a splendid horse  when within about sixty yards of the defences he levelled his spear and made a tremendous rush as if resolved to bear down all obstacles  the gaucho chiefif we may so style himpresented his musket and pulled the trigger  it missed fire  ill try him with shot first remarked lawrence to quashy presenting his doublebarrelled gun  at the distance of fifty yards or so the shot when it entered the savage leader was well scattered so that horse and man were peppered all over  the latter dropped his lance and almost fell off while the former getting on its hindlegs executed a pirouette which brought its tail to the rear and sent it charging wildly back upon its friends  the second in command receiving the other barrel at even shorter range went through the same performance with greater impetuosity  at the same moment the old musket was prevailed on to go off and quashy delivered four pistolshots in quick succession with the result that several men and horses were wounded and the entire body of indians turned and fled in a state of frenzied surprise  they soon pulled up however and held a momentary consultation out of range  then being bold fellows they charged again but this time in two bands one of which attacked the place in rear  as before the band which attacked the front was vigorously repelled but in rear the defenders were less successful  how it was managed lawrence never found out but he had barely succeeded in driving off the foe in front and was congratulating quashy on his coolness when he found himself suddenly surrounded by yelling savages  the gaucho chief made a desperate fight towards his own hut which he gained and entered in safety  lawrence and quashy tried to follow but were too much pressed by numbers  back to back they fought and quashy used his sword with such agility and vigour that in a few seconds he sent several indians bleeding to the rear  lawrence despising the weapons of civilised warfare held his now empty gun in his left hand using it as a sort of shield and brandished his favourite cudgel with such effect that he quickly strewed the ground around him with crowncracked men  unfortunately a stone struck him on the temple and he fell  thus left unsupported quashy after slicing the nose half off a too ardent savage was struck from behind and also fell  when our hero recovered consciousness he found himself lying on the ground afflicted with a strange inability to move hand or foot and conscious chiefly of a splitting headache  presently a voice beside him whispered  is you bery bad massa  lawrence turned his head with great difficulty and beheld his faithful follower lying like himself on the ground firmly bound to a stout spar or pole  his own inability to move was at once explained for he soon perceived that he was in the same bound condition  dyou know what has happened quashy  ho yes massa  de reptiles has took de place an tied you an me to sticks  what for i don know but i spose dey means to skin us alive or roast us praps to muse deir women an childn  more likely that they hope to have us ransomed returned lawrence with a shudder  whats ramsumd massa  try to get our friends to give them money for us  have they killed many of the menor got hold of the women and children asked lawrence anxiously  yes deys kill a few ob de men but not many for some hab got into de huts an some into de corral an deyll fight to de last  de savages am holdin a palaver jist nowsee deys agwine to begin again  screw your head roun to de right an you see  lawrence obeyed and saw the savages assembled on a knoll  after driving the defenders into the huts they had held a brief consultation and seemed on the eve of renewing the attack  filled with deep anxiety for the fate of the poor women and children our hero made a desperate struggle to snap his bonds  no use massa remarked quashy  is tried dat till i nearly busted better lie still  praps dey forgit us  lawrence groaned  he felt so helpless and consequently hopeless that he almost gave way to despair  the spot where they had been flung down after their capture was so covered with rank grass that they could not see far in any direction what they did see however aroused curiosity if it did not inspire hope for the savages seemed suddenly to have changed their plans  they were talking excitedly together on the knoll and pointing eagerly towards the horizon  das funny massa remarked the negro  it is indeed  perhaps they see some of their friends coming  or inimies suggested quashy  the latter was right  in a few minutes the indians were seen to run down to the defences of the place  our unfortunates lost sight of them in a few seconds but they could hear the sound of horsemen approaching at full gallop  in a few minutes they heard shouting then the yells fearful cries and imprecations of men in mortal combat  soon after that a savage passed the place where they lay at full speed  then another and another  it became quickly evident that the defenders of the place were getting the worst of it  at last there was a general flight and as the savages passed by the new assailants appeared  it was easy to see that they were composed of all classes a band of runaway soldiers and escaped convicts  banditti exclaimed lawrence bitterly  deyve got prisners  look massa  our poor hero looked and his hearts nearly stood still with horror for he saw a horseman pass whose figure was strangely like to that of colonel marchbanks  his arms were bound and a villainouslooking man led his horse  immediately after another banditlike fellow rode past with a female form seated in front of him  of course it could be no other than manuela and in the agony of the moment lawrence was about to renew his frantic effort to burst his bonds when a man on foot ran close past him  recognising him at once lawrence shouted  ignacio  the old hunter for it was he stopped abruptly and listened  another shout brought him to the side of our hero  good luck exclaimed ignacio heartily  we have been bound by the scoundrels you are chasing cried lawrence quickly cut us free good ignacio  the hunter drew his long knife and knelt with the apparent intention of releasing them but suddenly paused  nobetter as you are he muttered hurriedly your friends are in danger  i know it interrupted lawrence almost wild with anxiety and surprise why not then release us  there is no time to explain said ignacio quickly almost fiercely listen  i and others are secret enemies in this band of outlaws  when you are free be silent be wise  you will need all your manhood  you must not know mebe silentwise but  the old hunter leaped up hastily sheathed his knife and ran on for at the moment he saw a group of the bandits running towards him  diverging a little and hailing them he drew them away from the spot where lawrence and his man still lay bound  das a puzzler massa gasped quashy who had been rendered almost speechless by surprise if de bustinpower whats in my heart just now would ony go into my muscles id snap dem ropes like samson  as the burstingpower referred to declined to go into the muscles of either master or man they were fain to lie still with as much patience as they could assume and await the course of events    chapter twenty six  in which old friends and enemies turn up in quite a surprising manner and quashys joy overflows  they had not to wait long  a few minutes later and old ignacio returned with several men one of whom from his manner and bearing appeared to be a chief among the outlaws  who are you and who bound you asked this chief with a stern look  answering in his best spanish lawrence explained how he fell into the hands of the savages  the chief did not speak for a few seconds but looked inquiringly at ignacio  it wont do to make more prisoners you know said the old hunter replying to the look we have too many on our hands as it is  the troops are already on our track and you may be sure they wont lose time  besides these men are unknown and wont fetch a ransom  what would you advise then  cut their throats suggested ignacio coolly  you old fool returned the outlaw what good would that do  isnt it clear that these men are the enemies of the savages and we want such to join us  ay returned ignacio but they may be friends of the troops and you dont want such to join us  theres truth in that old man  well well just let them lie theyre safe enough as they are not to do either good or evil  as you say it is of no use burdening ourselves with prisoners who wont fetch a ransom  the colonel and his women will fetch a good price but thesenothing  i suppose that is why cruz has ordered conrad to be shot before we leave the place  why i thought said ignacio with a look of surprise that conrad of the mountains was an outlaw like yourselves  not he  hes a spy and hell meet a spys doom if he has not met it already  comeill go and see this conrad said ignacio i should like to see a spy get his deserts  he turned quickly and hurried away followed by the outlaw  most awrful groaned quashy when they were gone  awful indeed to think that manuela and her father are in the hands of such villains returned lawrence  an soozn said quashy with a deeper groan  but massa whats come ober de ole hunter  he not in arnest ob course  of course not replied lawrence that is our one ray of hope now  he is only acting a part  he will assuredly help us and means us to help him but he takes a strange way to do it  he ceased to speak for at that moment a man was seen approaching  he moved about like one who was searching for something  at last he caught sight of the bound men and ran towards them drawing his knife as he did so  for one instant a feeling of horror shot through the hearts of lawrence and quashy but next moment they were relieved for they recognised in the approaching man the features of their old acquaintance of the andes the robber antonio  i come to pay my debt he said going down on one knee and severing the cords which bound lawrence who heartily showered on him all the spanish terms for thanks and gratitude that he could recall  of course quashy was also set free and was equally profuse in his grateful expressions but antonio cut them both short  come we must be quick he said and hurried away  as they crossed the spot where the recent fight with the indians had taken place quashy picked up one of the spears which lay on the ground and lawrence to his great satisfaction discovered his favourite cudgel lying where he had been knocked down  he picked it up almost affectionately and hurried on  antonio was in evident haste  leading them through the hamlet he went towards the corral where it could be seen a party of the bandits were standing as if in wait  suddenly they heard a noise behind them and observed a party of men with muskets on their shoulders surrounding a prisoner  antonio drew his companions into the shelter of a bush till they should pass  it is conrad of the mountains he whispered while a fierce expression lighted up his eyes  they go to shoot him  he must not die  as what seemed to be the firingparty advanced followed by a straggling group of ruffians lawrence looked with profound interest and pity towards one of whom he had heard so much  the prisoners head hung down as he approached the bush but on passing it he looked up  the sight of his face sent a shock of surprise and consternation to the hearts of lawrence and quashy for the doomed man was no other than their friend pedro  lawrence turned quickly to antonio  conrad he asked pointing to pedro  si senhor replied the outlaw  when the procession had passed lawrence stepped from behind the bush and quietly joined it without being recognised by pedro  he had not at that moment the most remote idea of what he intended to do but one feeling was powerfully dominant in his breastnamely that pedro must be saved at all hazards  of course quashy and antonio followed him  the sudden appearance of the two strangers did not cause much surprise among the band who followed the prisoner for besides their being in the company of one whom they knew the men who had been gathered together by cruz on this occasion were not all known to each other what they knew for certain was that the country was up in arms because of some political convulsion and that cruz was a great leader who knew how to make the most of such circumstances for the benefit of himself and his followers  in a state of feverish anxiety but with a calm outward appearance lawrence marched on quite incapable of forming any plan of rescue but not incapable of prayer or of forming a resolve to do something though he should die in the attempt  on reaching the corral he saw cruz and recognised him at once  the bandit chief was obviously in haste for he at once ordered conrador as we still prefer to call him pedroto be placed with his back against the corral and the firingparty to draw up in front of him at about twenty yards distance  pedro offered no resistance while being led towards the mud wall of the corral  there was neither bravado nor fear in his bearing  evidently he had made up his mind to die like a christian and had given up all hope of deliverance from the foes by whom he was surrounded  but friends were near whom he little dreamed of  having up to that point kept his eyes on the ground he had not observed lawrence and the first intimation he had of his presence was on hearing his voice as he stepped forward placed his tall and stalwart frame in front of him and said sternly to the firingparty  villains you will have to send your bullets through my breast before they harm conrad  yes an troo dis buzzum too cried quashy planting himself in front of lawrence and glaring defiance in his own peculiar and powerful manner  what two more enemies exclaimed cruz with a look of pleased surprise and triumph seize them men but nostay we can as easily kill the three birds at one shot  ready  the firingparty cocked and raised their guns but were suddenly arrested by seeing the wall of the enclosure behind pedro lined as if by magic with human heads all of which carefully levelled an equal number of muskets  at the same moment antonio ignacio spotted tiger colonel marchbanks and the sporting englishman sprang to the front and the old hunter cutting pedros bonds put a musket into his hands  traitor exclaimed cruz grinding his teeth with passion as he scowled at antonio  fool do you not know retorted antonio contemptuously that traitors are the offspring of tyrants  i acknowledge you as father in this respect  but i am not here to bandy words  colonel marchbanks will speak  yes cruz said the old colonel stepping a pace to the front i will speak and that to the purpose  you see those men  pointing to the heads looking over the corral wallten of the best shots among them have their weapons pointed at your heart  if a single musket is fired by your blackguards you know what the result will be  bold as cruz undoubtedly was this speech of the colonel had an obviously quieting effect on him as well as on his followers who however being numerous and not wanting in courage stood ready to obey orders  now i will tell you in few words what i have got to say continued the colonel addressing cruz  when you locked the villagers here in their own huts you forgot or did not know that being a tyrant as well as a scoundrel you had enemies among your own followers  these have not only set us your prisoners free but have done the same good turn to the villagers who have been persuaded to join us against you and now as our numbers are pretty equal we give you the option of going away quietly wherever you please or if you prefer it having a fair fight  i may add that if i were backed by my troops instead of these villagers i would not give you this option but as i have no official right to command these men i now make you the proposal either to retire quietly or fight  awjust so said the sporting englishman  and let me add as a sort ofawfreelance that i and my friend here hope sincerely that you will choose to fight  yous a brick exclaimed quashy with emphasis regarding the sportsman for the first time with favour  cruz hesitated  he was swayed by a burning thirst for vengeance and a prudent regard for his personal safety  by way of hastening his decision colonel marchbanks added  it may be well to remind you that when you unfortunately succeeded in decoying me and my friends into your snares and captured us you did not leave my troops without officers  the gentleman now in command will not lose time in following us up and he is aided by gauchos who could trace you out though you were to hide your rascally head in the darkest retreats of the andes  so youd better be off at once or come on  awyes  if i might advisecome on suggested the sportsman  das so  come on urged quashy  but cruz refused their wellmeant advice  regarding discretion as the better part of valour and resolving no doubt to fight another day he elected to be off  collecting his men in sulky silence he speedily rode away  sorry hes so chickenhearted said the sportsman forgetting even to aw in his disappointment  you ought rather to be glad of it remarked lawrence you forget that there are women and children behind us and that our defeat would have ensured their destruction  oh no replied the englishman who had recovered his quiet nonchalance i did not forget the women and childrendear creatures but i confess that the idea of our defeat had not occurred to me  colonel marchbanks did not give his opinion at the time but his air and expression suggested that fireeater though he was he by no means regretted the turn events had taken  holding out his hand to lawrence in a condescending manner he thanked him for the service he had just rendered  you have quite a talent for turning up unexpectedly in the nick of time he added with a peculiar smile as he turned and walked off towards the huts around which the men who had sided with antonio were by that time assembling  among them lawrence to his ineffable joy found manuela and mariquita  he was too wise however in the presence of the colonel to take any demonstrative notice of her  he merely shook hands with both ladies and congratulated them on their escape from the banditti  you have rendered us good service senhor said mariquita with a brilliant smilea smile that was indeed more brilliant than there seemed any occasion for  ii have been very fortunate stammered lawrence glancing at manuela  but that princess of the incas with an aspect of imperturbable gravity kept her pretty eyes on the ground though the brown of her little cheeks seemed to deepen a trifle in colour  now antonio cried the colonel coming forward at the moment what do you intend to do  if my men were here you know i should be under the necessity of making you and your fellows prisoners notwithstanding your good services today  as it is those of us who stick together must be off without delay eastward  i suppose you will rather take to the mountains  indeed no colonel marchbanks  i am willing to give myself up and to take service under you if that may be allowed  and if you will take my advice comrades added antonio turning to his companions youll do the same for depend on it no good can come of our late style of life  antonios comrades did not feel disposed to take his advice  indeed they had only rebelled against their late captain because of his tyrannical nature but were by no means desirous of changing their mode of life  seeing this the colonel accepted antonios offer and gave his comrades a few words of serious warning and advice mingled with thanks for the service they had rendered him after which the two parties separated and went on their respective ways leaving the gauchos to fortify their village more carefully and get into a better state of readiness to resist the attacks alike of outlaws and indians  before leaving however quashy had a noteworthy interview with susan it occurred at the time that antonio and his men were holding the above conversation with the colonel  the negro lovers were affectionately seated on a horseskull in one of the huts regardless of all the world but themselves  soozn my lub said quashy is agwine to carry you off wid me  quashy my blubbed i expecs you is replied susan simply passing her black fingers through her lovers very curly locks  o soozn how i lubs you  i knowd id find you  i always said it i always tought it an now is dood it  das so returned susan with a bashfully pleased look  i always knowd it

whats dat got to do wid it inquired the lover tying a knot of perplexity on his eyebrows  why you an mes too heaby for one hoss you know an you said you hab ony one  das true returned quashy entangling the knot with another  well nebber mind said susan with a little nod of assurance  is put it all right  ill stole one  soozn exclaimed her lover with inexpressible solemnity youll do nuffin ob de sort  i blongs to a good man now so i knows better dan dat  you mus nebber steal no morenebber  but ill get massa to buy you a hoss  das what ill do  quashy had scarcely given utterance to his intentions when a shout from lawrence summoned him  the party under colonel marchbanks was about to start on their journey eastward  the negro soon informed his master of his difficulty  as he had anticipated it was removed at once  horseflesh is cheap on the pampas  a ladys wardrobeespecially a black ladysdoes not take long to pack in those regions  in less than half an hour a passable steed was purchased from the gauchos and susan mounted thereon  her little all in a bundle was strapped to her truelovers saddle and she fell into the cavalcade which soon afterwards left the village and rode out upon the illimitable plains  it was not a large band but it was composed of rare and strong materials  our friend pedroalias conrad of the mountainsalias the rover of the andesof course took the lead  colonel marchbanks manuela and the fair mariquita followed  antonio spotted tiger the sportsman and his friend came next and lawrence with quashy and soozn brought up the rear  in this order they set off at full gallop over the roadless plains diverging a little here and there as the nature of the ground required but otherwise steering a straight line in the direction of the rising sun    chapter twenty seven  describes several interesting and somewhat violent proceedings  over the flowering plains  oh there is something soulstirring in a free furious prolonged gallop where obstructions are few where the land is almost level and nature reigns unfettered by the influence of man  no fences no ditches no ploughed lands no enclosed estates nothing to check even for a moment the grand onward sweep through illimitable space save the capacity of endurance in steed and rider  of course it has its drawbacks but we will not pause to meditate on these  life has its drawbacks everywhere and if we were to attempt an enumeration of them our tale would become unreasonably long and also somewhat unprofitable  perhaps it adds to the zest of life the fact that many of its incidents are of such a nature that we find it difficult to say whether they are drawbacks or advantages  for instance the jovial garrulity of quashy was a drawback at times  at other times it was a decided advantage and his friends and companions held such interchangeable opinions on the point that they could not readily have expressed them if called on to do so at a moments notice  a runaway tendency in a horse is considered by most people a disadvantage  yet there are some people whose nerves and spirits are so constituted that they have a sneaking fondness for a horse of this disposition  strange though it may seem manuela belonged to this class  it is said that men whose characters form a contrast are more likely to draw towards each other than those whose characters are similar  may the same principle not operate between man and the lower animals  was it not the gentleness tenderness womanliness softness of manuela which caused her to dote upon and delight in her steed though it was a huge high stepping archnecked rearing plunging animalsomething between an irish hunter and a mexican warhorse  the steed in question had been purchased for her by her father from the gauchos who assured him that the animal was a remarkably good one to go  they told the simple truth but not the whole truth for sometimes it would go with its hindlegs doing double service in the way of kicking and at other times it balanced that feat by giving its forelegs a prodigious flourish while in the act of rearing  to do the creature justice however it could and did go ahead of its companions on the journey and retained that position without fatigue as was evinced by the flashing eye distended nostril pawing and snorting with which it received every proposal to halt  being a splendid rider manuela managed this spanking charger with infinite grace and ease all the more that it happened to have a tender mouth and only succeeded in getting beyond her control when it chanced to get the bit between its teeth  at first her father and the others were alarmed and offered to change her steed for another but she refused to change and when they saw how fearlessly she rode they became reconciledall except lawrence  it is the fearlessness of innocence combined with ignorance he muttered to himself one afternoon as manuelas horse without apparent provocation presented first its tail and then its nose to the sky  the inca princess patted the playful creature approvingly and induced it to adopt a bounding indiarubberlike pace  in a few minutes this was reduced to a springy walk  lawrence could not resist the temptation to ride forward and offer his own horse although colonel marchbanks rode alongside of his daughter like an inflexible guardian  you will find my horse much easier to manage miss marchbanks he said and quite as strong and fleet as your own  the colonel frowned and his daughter said no tank you senhor with a little bow and a brilliant smile  it was one of manuelas little fancies to revert sometimes to the broken english peculiar to her colour and costume  this was not at all relished by lawrence  it seemed to argue a want of earnestness which was not at all in harmony with the tremendous depth of his love for her he drew rein immediately and fell behind but at that moment manuelas horse put its foot in a biscachohole and stumbled  evidently it had received a violent surprise for after having a second time presented its tail and nose alternately to the skies it gave vent to an indignant snort performed what seemed to be a pirouette on one leg took the bit in its teeth and bolted  of course the colonel put spurs to his steed and gave chase  instantly lawrence did the same  as a consequence quashy followed and not wishing to be left behind the whole cavalcade went after them at full speed  the thunder of numerous hoofs acted as a sharp spur to the wild runaway  at once it became a fair race in which each gradually took his place according to ability  the course was clearfrom the andes to the atlantic almost and horses and riders were fresh  in a remarkably short time the party straggled and the line extended soon it became evident that the colonel lawrence pedro and quashy were the best mounted of the troop for these four drew far ahead of all the others yet the runaway kept its advantage despite the utmost efforts of manuelas fair little arms to check it  gradually pedro and the colonel were left behind  despite the utmost application of voice and spur quashy also dropped to the rear and the race lay at last between our hero and the inca princess  mile after mile was passed as they flew like the wind over the rolling plains scarcely impeded at all by the pampas grass which was not long at that season but at last they came to a ridge on which there was a line of low bushes  by that time by dint of hard spurring lawrence had managed to get up almost alongside of the girl whose look of gleeful excitement was now changed to one of wild anxiety  try to pull just a little harder cried lawrence your horse wont be able to jump it  manuela tried but she had already put forth all her strength and if that had been twice what it was the effect on the powerful creature would probably have been just the same  as the danger drew nearer lawrence made desperate efforts to increase his speed  he was so far successful that when they finally came to the line of bushes the horses were almost abreast of each other  horses of the pampas are not usually jumpers but manuelas horse must have had a touch of the hunter in him for he rose to the leap and went up like a rocket  lawrence on the other hand went crashing through the obstruction like the shot of an eightyton gun  the leap evidently took more time than the crash which was fortunate for it enabled lawrence to get well alongside at the moment the forefeet of manuelas horse touched the ground and just as the poor girl herself unused to leaping fairly lost her balance as well as her presence of mind and fell backward half fainting  she would have fallen to the ground if lawrence had not caught her round the waist and dragged her to the pommel of his own saddle  it was one of those cases of rescue which men are aptperhaps justifiably soto style providential for no planning or judgment or energy on the part of lawrence could have arranged that manuela should have been at the apex of her leap when her powers failed so that she should fall from that height as it were almost into his arms  a few bounds more and they were safe  as if it had understood this and felt that further effort was needless the runaway steed stopped abruptly and after looking round in unreasonable surprise began quietly to crop the herbage at its feet  one by one the rest of the party came up full of congratulations  you dood dat well massa said quashy who was the first to arrive grinning all over and dat was a buster he added surveying the gap in the bush through which lawrence had crashed  please set me down before the others come up whispered manuela who having as we have said half fainted had allowed her head to fall on her rescuers shoulder  lawrence wished that circumstances might have admitted of his continuing the journey as they were then situated but propriety required him to say  here quashlend a hand  the negro vaulted to the ground and received manuela into his arms just as pedro and the colonel galloped up  thank you senhor armstrong thank you heartily said the latter as he dismounted and sitting down on a mound drew his child to his side  im not hurt not a bit sighed manuela with a slight attempt at a smile  thank god for that but you are shaken a little returned the old soldier with an anxious look  here pedro quashy fetch me the flask from my saddle  by the time a cup of the flasks contents was administered to manuela mariquita and susan were kneeling beside her and the rest were standing round  a splendid leapawcouldnt have been much better done ifawit had been an english hunter remarked the sportsman in an undertone to his friend  but i say dont it strike you that the colonel is uncommonlyawsweet on that little indian girl  shes no more an indian girl than you are replied his friend with a laugh  awyou dont say so returned the sportsman with a slight elevation of his eyebrows  let us go said manuela rising i am much better only a little shaken by such a leap  butbut i should like another  yes to be sure another horse interrupted the colonel who will exchangea quiet one of course  here you is kurnel said quashy with a beaming countenance as he led forward his horse  quiet as a lamb cept when you aggrawates him nebber goes no faster dan you wants him tosometimes not so fast an wouldnt run away even if you was to ax him on your knees  after such recommendation said the colonel turning to manuela i suppose you will accept of this steed  the inca princess accepted it with a beam of gratitude to quashy who thereupon mounted the runaway horse and in a few minutes the whole cavalcade was sweeping over the plain as swiftly as ever  afternoon brought them to a solitary gaucho hut  they came first upon the corral rather suddenly for it was concealed in a hollow  it was an enclosure of strong rough posts stuck into the ground on many of which were perched a number of gorged vultures and hawks  the ground around it was covered with bones bullocks horns wool carcasses of horses and other refuse which induced the travellers to keep carefully to windward of it  on a slight rising ground close at hand stood the mud hut of the family to which it belonged  although living in a state little short of savagery this family being descended from one of the best old families of spainat least so they believedmaintained much of the dignity good manners and ceremony that characterised the old spaniards  it comprised several generations of whom a greatgreatgrandfather blind deaf and benignant formed the head and a baby fat wide awake and uproarious formed the tail between these there was a band of men women girls and boys whom we will not even attempt to describe further than to say that they were all blackeyed sunburnt and more or less pretty and handsome  the travellers rode up to the door of the mud mansion and according to pampas etiquette awaited permission to dismount  this was quickly given with much urbanity by a handsome middleaged man who was the active head of the household  the intention of colonel marchbanks was to take a hasty meal here and push on as far as possible before night  finding that the gauchos were engaged at that time in breaking in some young horses he ordered his party to offsaddle and went with pedro lawrence and some others towards the corral while food was being prepared  quashyever mindful of the welfare of others and ever thoughtful in regard to what he esteemed the most important things of lifehung behind to advise a daughter of the house to prepare a specially tender fowl for susan manuela and mariquita  he even remained a few minutes to receive from the damsel a lesson in cookery  this daughter of the pampas whispered something to a very small brother beside her who was remarkable chiefly for the size of his gorgeous eyes and the scantiness of his costume  with ready obedience the urchin unhooked a miniature lasso from the wall and lassoed a large hen  how the brother and sister executed that hen was not obvious  it was however quickly and effectively done between them  then the sister took the bird to a pot of water which chanced to be boiling at the time and put it therein feathers and all  to civilised people this might have seemed rather a savage process but it was not so  the object was merely to simplify the plucking  after scalding the feathers came off with wonderful facility and also stuck to the girls wet hands with equally wonderful tenacity  washing her hands she next cut off the wings and legs of the fowl and then separated the breast from the back  these portions she put into a small pot with some suet and water and threw the rest away  das bery good remarked quashy nodding his head in approval after which he advised the girl to treat another fowl or two in a similar manner and then followed his master to the corral  here a very animated scene was being enacted  half a dozen young horses were about to be mounted for the first time and broken in  what modern horsetrainers of the tender school would have said to the process we cannot tell  having had no experience in such matters one way or another we hazard no opinion  we merely state the facts of the case  the father of the family mounted on a strong and steady horse commenced the business by riding into the corral and throwing his lasso over the head of a young horse which he dragged forcibly to the gate every step of the process was forcible  there was nothing equivalent to solicitation or inducement from beginning to end  opposition dogged and dire was assumed as a matter of course and was met by compulsion more dogged and more dire  at the gate of the corral the end of the lasso was received by the eldest son of the family a tall strapping and exceedingly handsome youth of about twentythree who had been named pizarrono doubt after the conqueror of peru  he certainly resembled his namesake in courage vigour and perseverance if in nothing else  the young horse displayed great unwillingness at first to quit its companionsshaking its magnificent mane and flourishing its voluminous tail in wild disdain as it was dragged out  but the moment it found itself outside the corral its first idea was to gallop away  a jerk of the lasso checked him effectually  another member of the household then deftly threw his lasso in such a manner that the prancing steed put its feet in it and was caught just above the fetlocks  with a powerful twitch of this second lasso its legs were pulled from under it and it fell with tremendous violence on its side before it could rise the young gaucho forced its head to the ground and held it there then drew his long knife and therewith in a few seconds cut off its mane  another gaucho performed the same operation on the hair of its tailboth acts being done as they explained to indicate that the horse had been once mounted  meanwhile pizarro quickly put a strong hide halter on the animals head and a piece of hide in his mouth to serve as a bit  he also girthed a saddle on him and when all was ready ordered the men who held him to let go  at the same moment he sprang into the saddle and held on  holding on was the point on which pizarro had to concentrate all his attention and power during the next few minutes for the way in which that outraged and intensely fierce creature strove to unseat him is alike beyond the power of description and conception  jumping plunging kicking rearing bounding and pirouetting are all sufficiently expressive terms in their way but they are mild words with which to describe the proceedings of that creature of the pampas while under the influence of temporary insanity  with ears flat on its neck nostrils distended and eyes emitting something almost like flames the young horse absolutely screamed in its fury but all was in vain  as well might it have tried to shake off its own tail as pizarro  suddenly it changed its plan and stretched out its sinewy length to its longest stride  pizarro fell in with the idea encouraged it with his long sharp spurs and heavy lash and away they went over the mighty plain like a streak of personified lightning  it is useful sometimes to let wilful people not only have their way but compel them to continue it  john gilpins spirit when he said    twas for your pleasure you came here   you shall go back for mine  is not unknown on the pampas and the prairie  after sailing away over the plain like a ship going out to sea until it was a mere speck on the horizon pizarros horse thought it time to reduce its pace but here pizarro did not agree with it  he applied whip and spur until his steed was quite exhausted  then he turned homewards and galloped back to the corral into which he turned the animal in a very broken and humble state of mind  there it found several young friends who had just been subdued in a similar manner and it is not altogether improbable that they spent the remainder of that evening in comparing notes  a roughish method butaweffective remarked the sportsman to his friend  this was true  perhaps quashys remark to lawrence was equally true  dat dood it pritty slick massa but ive seed it as well dood praps better by kindness  there is this at all events to be said in regard to the rough system that no man but an athlete could endure the fatigue of the process while any manor even womanhas physical strength sufficient to conquer by love if only he or she possess the requisite patience and milk of human kindness    chapter twenty eight  treats of a gaucho youth  from these gauchos colonel marchbanks learned that his troops had been seen searching for him by the eldest son pizarro and that handsome youth professed himself willing to guide the party to the place where the soldiers were likely to be found  without delay therefore they resumed their journey after supper and that night encamped on the open plain  while the party was busy making arrangements for the night pedro sauntered to the top of a neighbouring knoll to have what he styled a look round  it was a clear moonlight night and lawrence recognising the figure of the guide followed him  pedro he said on overtaking him how is it possible that pizarro can guide us to where the troops are seeing that it is some time since he saw them and he did not know in what direction they meant to travel besides they may have changed their intentions and their route several times  you forget senhor that troops leave a broad trail and you do not yet i see fully appreciate the wonderful powers of some gauchos in tracking out men  this pizarro although so young is already celebrated in that way  you know him then  why you seem to know everybody  i know every one of note replied the guide for my travels have been extensive and my memory is pretty strong  let me give you one or two instances of pizarros powers  i was in this part of the country two years ago  having occasion to pass this way i fell in with pizarro and we travelled together a short time  one forenoon we were riding over the plains when he stopped suddenly pointed to a footprint and said that is the little grey horse that was stolen from my father three years ago  are you sure said i almost laughing at him sure said he of course i am moreover im certain that the horse passed here not more than half an hour ago  lets follow it up then said i more in jest than earnest  but we did follow it up and recovered the little grey horse that same evening  a wonderful power of observation indeed as well as memory said lawrence looking with increased interest at the young gaucho who could be seen by the light of the neighbouring campfire moving about in a graceful free and easy manner assisting in the preparation of supper  it was pretty well in its way returned pedro but he did a sharper thing than that last year  a gold escort was attacked somewhere in the west and the robbers after killing most of the men escaped with the bags of gold  the authorities being very anxious to trace out and punish the robbers offered a high reward for any useful information as to their whereabouts  now it chanced that pizarro was moving about the country at that time and hearing of the adventure and the reward kept his eyes open and his wits about him a little more sharply than usual though he does that pretty well at all times by nature  one day he saw a little child leading a mule laden with raw hides along a narrow path this is a common enough sight in no way calculated to attract particular attention nevertheless it did attract the attention of pizarro  i dont pretend to understand the workings of a gauchos mind perhaps it was the extreme smallness of the child that struck him causing him to think that as no father or mother would risk such a little thing with the charge of a loaded mule without a special reason it would be as well to find out what that special reason might be perhaps it was something else  anyhow suspicion being awakened he followed the mule for a short distance and soon observed that it stepped as if it carried a much heavier weight than a mere pack of hides  at once the stolen gold flashed into pizarros mind  he stopped the mule cut the bandages off the hides and there concealed among them found the stolen bags  after that said lawrence i have no doubt whatever that he will soon find the troops  neither have i returned pedro but pizarro and men like him can do much more than i have told you  by a flight of birds they can tell of an approaching band of men before they are in sight and by the cloud of dust they make when they appear they can form a close estimate of their numbers  when the indian hordes are about to make a raid gauchos are warned of it by the ostriches and llamas and other timid beasts of the pampas all travelling in one direction and in many other ways that seem little short of miraculous they act the part of wildernessdetectives  while continuing their journey next day lawrence resolved to have a chat with the gaucho youth  riding up alongside he saluted him and received a reply and a graceful bow that would have done credit to a spanish grandee  he discovered ere long that the young mans mind like his body had been cast in a noble mould and that although ignorant of almost everything beyond his own wild plains he was deeply imbued with reverence for truth and justice in all the relations of life  indeed his sense of these attributes of god was so strong that the constant violation of them by those around him roused in him occasional bursts of hot indignation as lawrence very soon found when he touched on a recent revolution which had taken place in the province of san juan  are the troops we search for sent out to aid the government of mendoza demanded pizarro turning an earnest and frowning glance on his companion  i believe not answered lawrence at least i have not heard the colonel talk of such an object but i am not in his confidence and know nothing of his plans  pizarro made no rejoinder and lawrence seeing by the continued frown that the youths spirit was somewhat stirred sought for further information by asking about mendoza  do you not know said the gaucho with increased vehemence and a good deal of fine action that the people of san juan have deposed their governor because he is a bad man  i had not heard of it said lawrence but what has that to do with mendoza  you shall hear senhor  the governor of san juan is dishonest  he is bad in every way and in league with the priests to rob the people  his insolence became so great lately that as i have said the people arose asserted their rights and deposed him  then the government of mendoza sent troops to reinstate the governor of san juan but they have not yet succeeded  what right continued the youth with grand indignationwhat right has the government of mendoza to interfere is not the province of san juan as free to elect its own governor as the province of mendoza  have its men not brains enough to work out their own affairsay and they have arms strong enough to defend their rights as the troops shall find when they try to force on the people a governor of whom they do not approve  lawrence felt at once that he was in the presence of one of those strong untameable spirits of which the world has all too few whose love of truth and fairplay becomes as it were a masterpassion and around whom cluster not only many of the worlds good men but unfortunately for the success of the good causealso multitudes of the lower dregs of the worlds wickedness not because these dregs sympathise with truth and justice but simply because truthlovers are sometimes unavoidably arrayed against the powers that be  i dont know the merits of the case to which you refer said lawrence but i have the strongest sympathy with those who fight or suffer in the cause of fairplayfor those who wish to do to others as they would have others do to them  do the people of san luis sympathise with those of san juan  i know not senhor i have never been to san luis  as the town referred to lay at a comparatively short distance from the other lawrence was much surprised by this reply but his surprise was still further increased when he found that the handsome gaucho had never seen any of the towns in regard to which his sense of justice had been so strongly stirred  where were you born pizarro he asked  in the hut where you found me senhor  and you have never been to mendoza or san juan  no senhor i have never seen a town or a villagenever gone beyond the plains where we now ride  how old are you pizarro  i do not know senhor  as the youth said this with a slightly confused look lawrence forbore to put any more personal questions and confined his conversation to general topics but he could not help wondering at this specimen of grand and apparently noble manhood who could neither read nor write who knew next to nothing of the great world beyond his own pampas and who had not even seen a collection of huts sufficiently large to merit the name of village  he could however admirably discern the signs of the wilderness around him as he showed by suddenly pointing to the sky and exclaiming  see there is a lion  lions have not wings pizarro said lawrence with a smile as he looked upward but i see very high in the air a flock of vultures  just so senhor and you observe that they do not move but are hovering over one spot  yes i see that what then  a lion is there senhor devouring the carcass from which he has driven the vultures away  in a short time the correctness of the youths observation was proved by the party coming upon and driving away a puma which had previously disturbed the vultures at their banquet on the carcass of an unfortunate ox  the next morning pizarros capacity for tracking the wilderness was proved by the party coming on the broad trail of the troops  soon afterwards they discovered the men themselves taking their midday siesta  not long after that the united party came within scent of the atlantic and on the afternoon of the same day galloped into the town of buenos ayres    chapter twenty nine  describes several mysterious meetings and conversations  descriptions however graphic or faithful are for the most part misleading and ineffective  who ever went to a town or a region and found it to resemble the picture of it which had been previously painted on his imagination by description  for an account of buenos ayres we refer the inquiring reader to other books  our business at present is with quashy and soozn  that sable and now united couple stand under the shade of a marble colonnade watching with openmouthed interest the bustle of the street in which men and women of many nationsfrench italian spanish english and otherare passing to and fro on business or pleasure  this huge populous town was not only a new sight but an almost new idea to the negroes and they were lost alike in amusement and amazement  hi exclaimed quashy in his falsetto look look dar soozndas funny  he pointed to a little boy who squatted like a toad on a horses back was galloping to market with several skins of milk slung on either side of the saddle so that there was no room for his legs  o quash exclaimed the bride dars pumpkins for you  look  they were indeed notable pumpkinsso large that five of them completely filled a

the placeto the immense delight of several little gaucho boys who clothed in nothing but ponchos and pugnacity stood gazing at the couple  quashy jumped up with such violence that the boys in ponchos fled as he hurried along the street with his bride earnestly explaining to her as he went his newborn plans  at the same moment that this conversation was taking place lawrence armstrong and pedroalias conrad of the mountainswere holding equally interesting and perhaps more earnest converse over two pots of coffee in a restaurant  i have already told you senhor said pedro that old ignacio followed us thus hotly and overtook us as it happened so opportunely for the purpose of telling me of a piece of good fortune that has just been sent to me  true returned lawrence and in the bustle of the moment when you told me i forgot to congratulate you whatever the good fortune may be what was it  good old ignacio little knew continued pedro sipping his coffee with an air of supreme contentment what glad news i had in store for himself about my little mariquitathe light of my eyes the very echo of her mother  the good fortune he had to tell me of was but as a candle to the sun compared with what i had to reveal to him for what is wealth compared with love  however the other piece of good news is not to be sneezed at  but what is this good news pedro asked lawrence with a touch of impatience for his curiosity was aroused and pedros mode of communicating glad tidings was not rapid  before he could reply their attention was attracted by the noisy and selfassertive entrance of two jovial british sailors who although not quite drunk were in that condition which is styled by some people elevatedby others debased  whatever view may be taken of their condition there could be only one opinion as to their effusive goodhumour and universal goodwilla goodwill which would probably have expanded at once into pugnacity if any one had ventured to suggest that the couple had had more than enough of strong drink  now then bill cried one smiting the other with facetious violence on the back whatll you have  then without waiting for a reply he added to the waiter lets have some braryanwarer  the brandy and water having been supplied bill nodded his head cried heres luck jim and drained his first glass  jim responded with the briefer toast luck and followed the others draining example  now ill tell you wot it is jim said bill setting down his glass and gazing at the brandy bottle with a solemnly virtuous look i wouldnt go for to see another bullfight like that one we saw just before we left monte video no not if you was to give me a thousan pound down  no more would i responded jim regarding the waterjug with a virtuously indignant air  such disgusting cruelty continued bill  to see two strong men stand up o their own accord an hammer their two noses into somethin like plum duff an their two daylights into one aint more nor a ornary seaman can stand but to see a plucky little bull set to gore an rip up a lot o poor blinded horses with a lot o cowardly beggars eggin it on an stickin darts all over it an the place reekin wi blood an the people cheerin like madwhyitit made me amost seasick which i never was in my life yet  bah  pass the bottle jim  youre right bill assented jim passing the bottle an it made poor young ansty sick altogether  leastwise i saw his goodlookin face turn amost green as he got up in a hurry like an left the place for you know big an well made as he is an able to hold his own wi the best dick ansty has the heart of a woman for tenderness  his only fault is that hes a teetotaller  ay a ggreat fault that said bill pouring out and spilling most of another glass  i wouldnt give much for him  you couldnt help likin him though if youd sailed with him as ive done returned jim  hes a reglar brick though he dont smoke neither  dont smoke exclaimed bill aghast  then he aint fit for this world  why what does he think baccy was made for  i dun know as to that bill but i do know that hes goin to leave us you see hes only a sort of halfhandworked his passage out you know an well he did it too though he is only a landlubber bein a cornishman whos bin lookin arter mines o some sort ever since he was a boy  he says hes in great luck havin fallen in wi a party as is just agoin to start for the west under a feller they call conrad o the mountains  lawrence and pedro who had been trying to ignore the presence of the sailors and to converse in spite of their noise became suddenly interested at this point and the former glanced inquiringly at the latter  listen said pedro in a low voice and with a nod of intelligence  its a queer story continued jim  i heard all about it this very mornin from himself  hed bin givin some on us a lot o good advice you see hes a sort of edicated chap an got a tremendjous gift o the gab but none of us could take offence at im for hes such a quiet modest felleralthough he is big  well you must know thatthat what was i sayin  ppash th bottle said bill  no thats not what i wasoh yes i was goin to say hed bin givin us good advice because you must know shipmates says he that ive bin in good luck on shore havin fallen in with a most interestin man whose right name i dont know yet because everybody speaks of him as conrad of the mountains though some calls him pedro and others the rover of the andes and a good lot say hes a robber  but i dont care twopence what they say for ive seen him and believe him to be a firstrate feller  anyhow hes a rich one and has bin hirin a few men to help him to work his silvermine and as i know somethin about mining he has engaged me to superintend the underground work  you may be sure we was surprised as well as pleased to hear all this an we pumped him in course a good deal an he told us that the mine was in the andes somewheres at a place called murrykeety valley or some such name  this conrad had discovered the mine a good while ago and had got an old trapper an a boy to work it but never made much of it till a few months back when the old man an the boy came suddenly on some rich ground where the silver was shovelled up in buckets  in course i dont rightly know what like silver is when first got hold on it aint in readymade dollars i dare say but anyhow they say this conradll be as rich as a nabob an hes got a pretty darter too as has bin lost the most of her life and just turned up at the same time wi the silver  i dont rightly know if they dug her up in the mine but there she is an shes goin up to the mountains too so young ansty will be in good company  jim said bill at this point looking with unsteady solemnity at his comrade and speaking slowly i ddon bblieve a single word ont here give us a light ananpash th borle  rising at this point lawrence and pedro left those jovial british tars to their elevating occupations  well senhor said the latter as they walked away you have heard it all though not just in the way i had intended  but tell me pedro is this all true  substantially it is as you have heard it described only i have had more people than old ignacio and his boy to work my silvermine  i have had several men at it for a long time and hitherto it has paid sufficiently well to induce me to continue the works but when ignacio visited it a few weeks ago in passing on his way here to meet me he found that a very rich lode had been foundso rich indeed and extensive that there is every reason to expect what men call a fortune out of it  there is a grave as you know which dims for me the lustre of any fortune but now that it has pleased the almighty to give me back my child i will gladly for her sake try to extract a little more than the mere necessaries of life out of my silvermine now my friend added pedro suddenly stopping and confronting our hero with a decided air and an earnest look will you join me in this venture  i would not give up my lifes work here for all the mines in peru  in order to raise the people and improve the condition of this land i must continue to be a rover of the andes to the end of my days so as i cannot superintend extensive mining operations at the same time i must have a manager and i know of no one whom i should like to have associated with me half so well as senhor lawrence armstrong  will you go with me to the mariquita valley  lawrence paused a minute with his eyes on the ground before answering  i am flattered by your good opinion pedro he said at length and will give you an answer tomorrow if that will do  i never take any important step in haste  this afternoon i have an appointment with quashy and as the hour is near and i promised to be very punctual you will excuse my leaving you now  certainlytomorrow will do said pedro i hope to take quashy also with me  he is a queer fellow  he is particularly queer just now returned lawrence  i think his marriage with susan has turned his brain  so goodbye pedrotill tomorrow  they shook hands heartily and parted  that same afternoon quashy paid a formal visit to manuela at her fathers residence in the suburbs of buenos ayres and told her with a visage elongated to the uttermost and eyes in which solemnity sat enthroned that a very sick man in the country wanted to see her immediately before he died  dear me quashy said manuela an expression of sympathy appearing at once on her fine eyebrows who is it what is his name and why does he send for me  i cant tell you his name miss  is not allowed  but its a bad case an it will be awrful if he should die widout seein you  youd better be quick miss an ill promise to guide you safe an take great care ob you  that i know you will quashy  i can trust you  ill order my horse im  de hoss am at de door aready miss  i order im afore i come here  manuela could not restrain a little laugh at the cool presumption of her sable friend as she ran out of the room to get ready  a few minutes more and the pair were cantering through the streets in the direction of the western suburbs of the town    chapter thirty  the last  we regret to have to record the fact that quashys deeplaid schemes in behalf of manuela and the sick man miscarried  that same night by the light of the full moon he revealed to susan his account of the affair with a visage in which the solemnity of the wondering eyes seemed to absorb the expression of all the other features  soozn he said de white folk is past my comprenshin altogidder an i hant got words to tell you how tankful i am dat you an me was born black  das true

fool was de time i falled in lub wid you soozn  as the negros account of this inflecting and parting was substantially correct we feel indisposed to add more to it except to say that our hero stuck manfully to his resolve and finally went off to the distant valley in the andes without again meeting the inca princess  he was accompanied by pedro and his daughter quashy and susan ignacio the old hunter and his boy as well as spotted tiger  in addition to these there was a pretty large followingsome engaged in the service of pedro others taking advantage of the escort  among them were dick ansty the cornish youth antonio the exbandit and the english sportsman withawhis friend  it is not our purpose to drag the patient reader a second time over the rolling pampas or to introduce him to the mysteries of silvermining in the andes  our end shall be sufficiently explained by stating the fact that as lawrence was faithful to his promise to colonel marchbanks he was not less faithful to his promise to the daughter  a year had barely elapsed when he found himself once again in buenos ayres with the faithful quashy at his side and presented himself before the old colonel not now as a beggar but as part owner of one of the richest silvermines in peru  colonel marchbanks although a prudent man was by no means avaricious  the chief bar which prevented my listening to your proposal he said to lawrence at their first interview is now removed but i have yet to learn from my daughters own lips that she will have you  i have carefully avoided the subject from the very first because i have no faith whatever in forcing or even leading the affections of a young girl  and let me tell you flatly young senhor that your being the richest man in peru and the greatest man as well would not influence me so much as the weight of a feather if manuela does not care for you so you will prepare yourself to abide as well as you can by her final decision  i am prepared to abide by manuelas decision replied lawrence with what may be termed a modest smile  pon my word young man you seem to be unwarrantably sure of your position said the colonel somewhat sternly  however you have heard all i mean to say on the subject just now  leave me and return here in the evening  when lawrence was gone the old soldier found his daughter in a tastefully arranged closet which she called her boudoir the miniature glassdoor of which opened on a luxuriant garden where wood water sunshine and herbage wild and tame seemed to revel for the mastery  that young fellow armstrong has come back said the old man abruptly  i know it was manuelas brief reply  she did not look up being too busily engaged at the moment in the hideously commonplace act of darning the smallest possible hole in one of her dear little stockings  you know it child  yes father  do you also know that he has just been here and formally asked your hand in marriage  yes father i know it  why child how could you know that  you surely have not been tempted toto condescend to eavesdropping  no father i have not condescended to that but i have heard it on the best authority  have you not yourself just told me  ohahwell exclaimed the stern man relaxing into a smile in spite of himself as he observed the calm quiet earnest way in which that princess of the incas applied herself to the reparation of that little hole  now manuela my darling continued the colonel changing his tone and manner suddenly as he sat down beside her and put a hand lovingly on her shoulder you know that i would not for all the world permit or induce you to do anything that would risk your happiness  i now come to ask you seriously if youif you are inin short if you admire this young fellow  instead of answering manuela while searching carefully for any other little hole that might have been made or that was on the eve of being made by any other little toe asked the astounding question  is he rich father  a mixture of surprise and annoyance marked the old mans tone and look as he replied  why what has that got to do with it  have you not over and over again warned me father to beware of those gay young fellows who havent got two sixpences to rub against each other but have presumption enough to trifle with the affections of all the silly girls in the world  and are you sorry that i should have laid your lessons to heart  tut child dont talk nonsense  whether he is rich or poor is a mere matter of moonshine  the question i have to settle just now isare you fond of him  well no father i cant exactly say that i  i knew it  i was sure of it  the presumptuous puppy shouted the old man of war jumping up overturning a worktable with its innumerable contents and striding towards the door  stay father said manuela in a tone that military discipline forbade him to disobey and holding out both her hands with an air and grace that love forbade him to resist  i dont admire him and im not fond of him continued the inca princess vehemently as she grasped her parents hands these terms are ridiculously inadequate  i love him fatheri adore himi  she stopped abruptly for a noise at the glassdoor caused her to turn her eyes in that direction  it was quashy who stood there staring at them with all his eyes and grinning at them with more than all his mouthto say nothing of his ears  you black baboon shouted the colonel when able to speak  oh nebber mind me kurnel said quashy with a deprecatory air skuse me  is ony habin a stroll in de gardin an come here kite by haxidint  go on wid your leetle game an nebber mind me  is ony a nigger  colonel marchbanks could not decide whether to laugh or storm  manuela decided the question for him by inviting the negro to enter which he did with humble urbanity  shake hands with him father  hes only a nigger as he says but hes one of the very best and bravest and most faithful niggers that i ever had to do with  yous bery good missamost as good as soozn  oh well have it all your own way cried the colonel becoming reckless and shaking the negros hand heartily i surrender  lawrence will dine with us this evening manuela so youd better see to having covers laid for threeor perhaps for four  it may be that senhor quashy will honour us with  tankee kurnel yous bery kind but is got a prebious engagement  a previous engagement eh repeated the colonel much tickled with the excuse  yes kurnel got to tend upon massa lawrence but if youll allow me to stan behind his chair an wait ill be much pleased to listen to all you says an put in a word now an den if you chooses  and so good reader all things came about as the little princess of the incas had arranged long before in her own selfwilled little mind shall we trouble you with the details  certainly not  that would be almost an insult to your understanding  but we will trouble you to mount one of the fleetest steeds of the pampas and fly with us over the mighty plains into the wildest regions of the andes  though wild we need not tell you that it is a lovely region for you have been there already  it is the mariquita valley  no longer a silent wilderness however as when we saw it last for not very long after the events which we have just described lawrence armstrong and his blooming bride accompanied by the whitehaired colonel and the irrepressible quashy and another band of miners and selected emigrants entered that valley in a sort of triumphal procession and were met and escorted to the head of it by another triumphal procession which was under the command of conrad of the mountains whose pretty daughter was the first to welcome manuela to her new home  but now dismount  put on these wings and soar with us to the brow of yonder cliff from which we can have a grand birdseye view of the vale almost from its entrance to the point where it is lost and absorbed in the majestic recesses of the higher andes  see you yon cottagelike edifice close to pedros old home with the rustic porch in front and the wellstocked garden around  that is the residence of the overseer of the silvermine lawrence armstrong esquire  the residence as well as the garden is wellstocked for we have ventured to gallop with you over time as well as spaceone result being that there are at least three descendants of the incas by the mothers side romping in the garden  on that mound a little way on the other side of pedros cottage stands another building  it resembles the home of lawrence but with enough of difference to afford the charm of variety  it is the home of the fine young cornish youth who worked his way across the sea as a sailor and accompanied pedro to the mountains  that trip effectually settled his business and resulted in the conversion of mariquita into mrs ansty the change may not strike ordinary readers as being very romantic but it was attended with much felicity  in the small clump of wood just behind pedros cottagewhere you see the lakelet or tarn glittering in the sunlight and sending its infant waters to brawl over the neighbouring precipices and scamper down the valleystands a group of huts  these form the homes of ignacio the old hunter and spotted tiger with his family  ignacio you seestill tough and straight as though he had made up his mind to live and hunt for everhas a strange power of attracting men to him and has induced his indian friend to forsake his old home in the low grounds and dwell with him in the mountains  of course spotted tiger has brought his wife with him and leetle cub no longer little and all the other cubs including poor manca the sick girl whothanks to dr armstrongs skill and change of scene and gods blessing on allis no longer sick but on the contrary robust and grateful  strange to say our english sportsman is living with ignacio just now with several sporting friends  he has been back to england and out again since we last saw him and goes awing all over the settlement with as much nonchalance and latent vigour as everwhen not better engaged with ignacio and spotted tiger and leetle cub in the mountains  in lawrences garden among the romping descendants of the incas by the mothers side may be seen four whiteybrown creatures  these are the children of quashy and susan  two of them are little quashys and two are little soozns  they are not of course all named so but quashy says if he had fifty little bustin gurls hed regard em all as little soozns and susan retorts that if she had five hundred little bad boys shed call em all quashys  they dwell in a small hut in rear of the cottage of massa lawrence for quashy is his gardener and soozn his washerwoman and the little quashys and soozns are playmates of the little incas by the mothers side  antonio the exbandit is assistant gardener to the armstrongs and it is said that that once ferocious man has become so changed under the influence of christian treatment that he not only serves his master faithfully but has even made more than one attempt to rescue an old enemy named cruz from his evil ways  he has not yet been successful but he is strong in faith and hope  colonel marchbanks who has finally retired from the army dwells with the armstrongs and has organised the miners and settlers into a local force of which he is the chief  for the place has grown much of late in importance as well as in numbers and in such a wild region there is need for defensive arrangements  it has other arrangements also of a much more important kind in which the word of god plays the chief part and conrad of the mountains lends a helping hand  that earnest rover has built a church and a schoolhouse and when at home does what in him lies to advance the cause of true religion and education  but he has not ceased to wander in the mountains  true to his instincts as a reformer and lover of mankind he visits with ceaseless activity the great and widely separated centres of population in south america never losing sight of the great object he has set before him in the amelioration of the condition of the people  most people think him a mysterious madman  some who know him well think him an oversanguine enthusiast but all agree in regarding him as a calm gentle amiable man with a determination of purpose that nothing can turn aside and with an intense desire for the welfare and advancement of the country which mariquita the elder called her native land  indeed it is thought by some that pedro must have made to his wife some pledge or promise with reference to that subject but no one can ascertain the truth of that now  there is ground for this belief however for as we sit on our perch overlooking the valley we see this pedro this conrad of the mountains seated in the bower on the mound behind his dwelling resting contemplatively at the wellloved spot after one of his periodical returns  mariquita the younger is beside him  they are both looking earnestly at the grave and conversing about the time when they shall once again meet the lost one by the side of jesus in the better land  till that day came pedro continued unflinchingly to prosecute his selfimposed task whatever it might be  whether or what success attended his efforts we cannot tell yet have we reason to hope that his labour was not in vain  but of this much we are certainly sure that to the end of his days on earth he continued to be known as the rover of the andes and when deathat lastovertook him and arrested his benignant course it found him advancing with trembling steps towards the old place and closed with him finally as he pillowed his head on mariquitas grave  the end
