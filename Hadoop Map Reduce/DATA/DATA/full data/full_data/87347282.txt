87347282	battles with the sea by rm ballantyne    chapter one  heroes of the lifeboat and rocket  skirmishes with the subject generally  it ought to be known to all english boys that there is a terrible and costly war in which the british nation is at all times engaged  no intervals of peace mark the course of this war  cessations of hostilities there are for brief periods but no treaties of peace  war to the knife is its character  quarter is neither given nor sought our foe is unfeeling unrelenting  he wastes no time in diplomatic preliminaries he scorns the courtesies of national life  no ambassadors are recalled no declarations of war made  like the red savage he steals upon us unawares and with a roar of wrathful fury settles down to his deadly work  how does this war progress  it is needful to put and reiterate this question from time to time because new generations of boys are always growing up who so far from being familiar with the stirring episodes of this war and the daring deeds of valour performed scarcely realise the fact that such a war is being carried on at all much less that it costs hundreds of lives and millions of money every year  it may be styled a naval war being waged chiefly in boats upon the sea it is a war which will never cease because our foe is invincible and we will never give in a war which unlike much ordinary warfare is never unjust or unnecessary which cannot be avoided which is conducted on the most barbarous principles of deathless enmity but which nevertheless brings true glory and honour to those heroes who are ever ready night and day to take their lives in their hands and rush into the thick of the furious fray  although this great war beganat least in a systematic manneronly little more than fifty years ago it will not end until the hearts of brave and generous britons cease to beat and the wild winds cease to blow for the undying and unconquerable enemy of whom we write isthe storm  death or victory the old familiar warwhoop is not the final warcry here  death is indeed always facedsometimes metand victory is often gained but final conquests being impossible and the piping times of peace being out of the question the signal for the onset has been altered and the worlds old battlecry has been exchanged for the soulstirring shout of rescue the perishing  though our foe cannot be slain he can like the genii of eastern story be baffled  in the days of old the storm had it nearly all his own way  hearts indeed were not less brave but munitions of war were wanting  in this matter as in everything else the world is better off now than it was then  our weapons are more perfect our engines more formidable  we can now dash at our enemy in the very heart of his own terrible strongholds fight him where even the boldest of the ancient vikings did not dare to venture and rescue the prey from the very jaws of death amid the scenes of its wildest revelry  the heroes who recruit the battalions of our invincible army are the bronzed and stalwart men of our seacoast towns villages and hamlets men who have had much and long experience of the foe with whom they have to deal  their panoply is familiar to most of us  the helmet a souwester the breastplate a lifebelt of cork the sword a strong short oar their wargalley a splendid lifeboat and their shield the hand of god  in this and succeeding chapters i purpose to exhibit and explain in detail our lifeboats and the great the glorious work which they annually accomplish also the operations of the lifesaving rocket which has for many years rescued innumerable lives where from the nature of circumstances lifeboats could not have gone into action  i hold that weespecially those of us who dwell in the interior of our landare not sufficiently alive to the deeds of daring the thrilling incidents the terrible tragedies and the magnificent rescues which are perpetually going on around our shores  we are not sufficiently impressed perhaps with the nationality of the work done by the royal national lifeboat institution which manages our fleet of 270 lifeboats we do not fully appreciate it may be the personal interest which we ourselves have in the great war and the dutyto say nothing of privilegewhich lies upon us to lend a helping hand in the good cause  before going into the marrow of the subject let us put on the wings of imagination and soar to such a height that we shall be able to take in at one eagle glance all the coasts of the united kingdoma sweep of about 5000 miles all round  it is a tremendous sight for a storm is raging  black clouds are driving across the murky sky peals of thunder rend the heavens lightning gleams at intervals revealing more clearly the crested billows that here roar over the sands or there churn and seethe among the rocks  the shrieking gale sweeps clouds of spray high over our windward cliffs and carries flecks of foam far inland to tell of the dread warfare that is raging on the maddened sea  near the shore itself numerous black specks are seen everywhere like inkspots on the foam  these are wrecks and the shrieks and the despairing cries of the perishing rise above even the roaring of the gale  death is busy gathering a rich harvest for this is a notable night in the great war  the stormfiend is roused  the enemy is abroad in force and has made one of his most violent assaults so that from shetland to cornwall ships and boats are being battered to pieces on the rocks and sands and many lives are being swallowed up or dashed out while if you turn your gaze further out to sea you will descry other ships and boats and victims hurrying onward to their doom  here a stately barque with disordered topsails almost bursting from the yards as she hurries her hapless crewall ignorant perchance of its proximitytowards the dread leeshore  elsewhere looming through the murk a ponderous merchantman her mainmast and mizzen gone and just enough of the foremast left to support the bellying foresail that bears her to destruction  think you reader that this sketch is exaggerated  if so let us descend from our lofty outlook and take a nearer view of facts in detail  i quote the substance of the following from a newspaper article published some years ago  the violence of the storm on wednesday and thursday night was terrific the damage to shipping has been fearful  on sea the tremendous gale proved disastrous beyond precedent  falmouth harbour was the scene of several collisions and one barque and a tug steamer sank at their anchors  a wreck is reported at lelant to which the penzance lifeboat with a stouthearted crew had started when our despatch left to rescue thirteen men who could be descried hanging in the shrouds  a fine new ship is on hayle bar and another vessel is believed to be wrecked there also  doubtless we have not yet heard of all the wrecks on the cornish coast but it is in the magnificent bay which includes torquay paignton and brixham that the most terrible havoc has occurred  on wednesday about sixty sail were anchored in torbay  eleven have gone ashore at broadsands five of which are total wrecks  the names of those we could ascertain were the fortitude of exeter the stately of newcastle the dorset of falmouth and a french brigantine  at five oclock on thursday evening some of the crews were being drawn ashore by lines and baskets  at churston cove one schooner is ashore and a total wreck there is also another the blue jacket which may yet be saved at brixham there are two fine ships ashore inside the breakwater  at the back of the pier ten vessels have been pounded to matchwood and all that remains are a shattered barque her masts still standing two brigs and a schooner all inextricably mingled together  twelve trawlers have been sunk and destroyed  out of the sixty ships at anchor on wednesday night there were not more than ten left on thursday afternoon  many of these are disabled some dismasted  a fishingboat belonging to brixham was upset in the outer harbour about eight oclock and two married fishermen of the town and a boy were drowned  at elbury a new brig the zouave of plymouth has gone to pieces and six out of her crew of ten are drowned  eleven other vessels are on shore at elbury many of the men belonging to which cannot be accounted for  one noble woman named wheaton wife of a master mariner saved two lives by throwing a rope from the window of her house which is built on the rocks overhanging the bay at furzeham hill  scores of poor shipwrecked men are wandering distractedly about brixham and churston the greater part of them having lost all they possessed  the total loss of life arising from these disasters is variously estimated at from seventy to a hundred  is not this a tremendous account of the doings of one gale  and let it be observed that we have lifted only one corner of the curtain and revealed the battlefield of only one small portion of our farreaching coasts  what is to be said of the other parts of our shores during that same wild storm  it would take volumes instead of chapters to give the thrilling incidents of disaster and heroism in full detail  to convey the truth in all its force is impossible but a glimmering of it may be obtained by a glance at the wreck chart which is published by the board of trade every year  every black spot on that chart represents a wreck more or less disastrous which occurred in the twelve months  it is an appalling fact that about two thousand ships upwards of seven hundred lives and nearly two millions sterling are lost every year on the shores of the united kingdom  some years the loss is heavier sometimes lighter but in round numbers this is our annual loss in the great war  that it would be far greater if we had no lifeboats and no lifesaving rockets it will be our duty byandby to show  the black spots on the wreck chart to which we have referred show at a single glance that the distribution of wrecks is very unequalnaturally so  near the great seaports we find them thickly strewn at other places where vessels pass in great numbers on their way to these ports the spots are also very numerous while on unfrequented parts they are found only here and there in little groups of two three or four  away on the norwest shores of scotland for instance where the seal and the seamew have the ocean and rugged cliffs pretty much to themselves the plaguespots are few and far between but on the east coast we find a fair sprinkling of them especially in the mouths of the forth and tay whither a goodly portion of the worlds shipping crowds and to which the hardy norseman now sends many a load of timberboth log and batteninstead of coming as he did of old to batten on the land  it is much the same with ireland its more important seaports being on the east  but there is a great and sudden increase of the spots when we come to england  they commence at the border on the west where vessels from and to the busy clyde enter or quit the irish sea  darkening the fringes of the land on both sides and clustering round the isle of man they multiply until the ports have no room to hold them and as at liverpool they are crowded out into the sea  from the deadly shores of anglesea where the royal charter went down in the great and memorable storm of november 1859 the signs of wreck and disaster thicken as we go south until we reach the bristol channel which appears to be choked with them and the dangerous cliffs of cornwall which receive the illfated vessels of the fleets that are perpetually leaving or entering the two great channels  but it is on the east coast of england that the greatest damage is done  from berwick to the thames the black spots cluster like bees  on the coasts of norfolk and suffolk off great yarmouth where lie the dangerous haisborough sands the spots are no longer in scattered groups but range themselves in dense battalions and further south off the coast of kent round which the worlds commerce flows unceasingly into the giant metropolis where the famous goodwin sands play their deadly part in the great war the dismal spots are seen to cluster densely like gnats in a summer sky  now just where the black spots are thickest on this wreck chart lifeboats and rocket apparatus have been stationed in greatest numbers as in ordinary warfare so in battles with the sea our storm warriors see an admirable book with this title written by the reverend john gilmore of ramsgate  macmillan and company are thrown forward in force where the enemys assaults are most frequent and dangerous  hence we find the eastern shores of england crowded at every point with lifesaving apparatus while most of the other dangerous parts of the coast are pretty well guarded  where and how do our coast heroes fight  i answersometimes on the cliffs sometimes on the sands sometimes on the sea and sometimes even on the pierheads  their operations are varied by circumstances  let us draw nearer and look at them while in action and observe how the enemy assails them  i shall confine myself at present to a skirmish  when the stormfiend is abroad when dark clouds lower when blinding rain or sleet drives before the angry gale and muttering thunder comes rolling over the sea men with hard hands and weatherbeaten faces clad in oilskin coats and souwesters saunter down to our quays and headlands all round the kingdom  these are the lifeboat crews and rocket brigades  they are on the lookout  the enemy is moving and the sentinels are being posted for the nightor rather they are posting themselves for nearly all the fighting men in this war are volunteers  they require no drilling to prepare them for the field no bugle or drum to sound the charge  their drum is the rattling thunder their trumpet the roaring storm  they began to train for this warfare when they were not so tall as their fathers boots and there are no awkward squads among them now  their organisation is roughandready like themselves and simple too  the heavens call them to action the coxswain grasps the helm the oars are manned the word is given and the rest is straightforward fightingover everything through everything in the teeth of everything until the victory is gained and rescued men women and children are landed in safety on the shore  of course they do not always succeed but they seldom or never fail to do the very uttermost that it is in the power of strong and daring men to accomplish  frequently they can tell of defeat and victory on the same battlefield  so it was on one fearful winter night at the mouth of the tyne in the year 1867  the gale that night was furious  it suddenly chopped round to the south south east and as if the change had recruited its energies it blew a perfect hurricane between midnight and two in the morning accompanied by blinding showers of sleet and hail which seemed to cut like a knife  the sea was rising mountains high  about midnight when the storm was gathering force and the sentinels were scarcely able to keep a lookout a preventive officer saw a vessel driving ashore to the south of the south pier  instantly he burnt a blue light at which signal three guns were fired from the spanish battery to call out the life brigade  the men were on the alert  about twenty members of the brigade assembled almost immediately on the pier where they found that the preventive officer and pierpoliceman had already got out the lifesaving apparatus but the gale was so fierce that they had been forced to crawl on their hands and knees to do so  a few minutes more and the number of brigade men increased to between fifty and sixty  soon they saw through the hurtling storm that several vessels were driving on shore  before long four ships with their sails blown to ribbons were grinding themselves to powder and crashing against each other and the piersides in a most fearful manner they were the mary mac the cora and the maghee belonging to whitstable and the lucern of blyth  several lifeboats were stationed at that point  they were all launched manned and promptly pulled into the narrows but the force of the hurricane and seas were such that they could not make headway against them  the powers of man are limited  when there is a will there is not always a way  for two hours did these brave men strain at the tough oars in vain then they unwillingly put about and returned utterly exhausted leaving it to the men with the lifelines on shore to do the fighting  thus frequently when one arm of the service is prevented from acting the other arm comes into play  the work of the men engaged on the pier was perilous and difficult for the lines had to be fired against a head wind  the piers were covered with ice and the gale was so strong that the men could hardly stand while the crews of the wrecks were so benumbed that they could make little effort to help themselves  the men of the mary mac however made a vigorous effort to get their longboat out  a boy jumped in to steady it  before the men could follow the boat was stove in the rope that held it broke and it drove away with the poor lad in it  he was quickly washed out but held on to the gunwale until it drifted into broken water when he was swallowed by the raging sea and the boat was dashed to pieces  meanwhile the crew of the cora managed to swing themselves ashore their vessel being close to the pier  the crew of the lucern acting on the advice of the brigade men succeeded in scrambling on board the cora and were hauled ashore on the lifelines  they had not been ten minutes out of their vessel when she turned over with her decks towards the terrible sea which literally tore her asunder and pitched her up stem on end as if she had been a toy  the crew of the maghee were in like manner hauled on to the pier with the exception of one lad from canterbury it was the poor boys first voyage  little did he think probably while dreaming of the adventures of a sailors career what a terrible fate awaited him  he was apparently paralysed with fear and could not spring after his comrades to the pier but took to the rigging  he had scarcely done so when the vessel heeled over and he was swung two or three times backwards and forwards with the motion of the masts  it is impossible to imagine the feelings of the brave men on the pier who would so gladly have risked their lives to save himhe was so near and yet so hopelessly beyond the reach of human aid  in a very brief space of time the waves did their workship and boy were swallowed up together  while these events were enacting on the pier the mary mac had drifted over the sand about half a mile from where she had struck  one of her crew threw a leadline towards a seaman on the shore  the hero plunged into the surf and caught it  the rest of the work was easy  by means of the line the men of the life brigade sent off their hawser and breechesbuoy or cradle which apparatus i shall hereafter explain and drew the crew in safety to the land  that same morning a whitby brig struck on the sands  the lifeboat pomfret belonging to the royal national lifeboat institution put out and rescued her crew  in the morning the shores were strewn with wreckage and amongst it was found the body of the boy belonging to the mary mac  all these disasters were caused by the masters of the vessels mistaking the south for the north pier in consequence of having lost sight of tynemouth light in the blinding showers  of course many lifeboats were out doing good service on the night to which i have referred but i pass all that by at present  the next chapter will carry you good reader into the midst of a pitched battle    chapter two  describes a tremendous battle and a glorious victory  before following our brilliant lifeboatthis gaudy butterflylike thing of red white and blueto the field of battle let me observe that the boats of the royal national lifeboat institution have several characteristic qualities to which reference shall be made hereafter and that they are of various sizes  a full and graphic account of the royal national lifeboat institutionits boats its work and its achievementsmay be found in an interesting volume by its late secretary richard lewis esquire entitled history of the lifeboat and its workpublished by macmillan and company  one of the largest size is that of ramsgate  this may be styled a privileged boat for it has a steamtug to wait upon it named the aid day and night the aid has her fires banked up to keep her boilers simmering so that when the emergency arises a vigorous thrust of her giant poker brings them quickly to the boiling point and she is ready to take her lifeboat in tow and tug her out to the famed and fatal goodwin sands which lie about four miles off the coastopposite to ramsgate  i draw attention to this boat first because she is exceptionally situated with regard to frequency of call the means of going promptly into action and success in her work  her sisterlifeboats of broadstairs and margate may indeed be as often called to act but they lack the attendant steamer and sometimes despite the skill and courage of their crews find it impossible to get out in the teeth of a tempest with only sail and oar to aid them  early in december 1863 an emigrant ship set sail for the antipodes she was the fusilier of london  it was her last voyage and fated to be very short  the shores of old england were still in sight the eyes of those who sought to better their circumstances in australia were yet wet and their hearts still full with the grief of parting from loved ones at home when one of the most furious storms of the season caught them and cast their gallant ship upon the dangerous sands off the mouth of the thames  this happened on the night of the 3rd which was intensely dark as well as bitterly cold  who can describe or conceive the scene that ensued the horror the shrieking of women and children and the yelling of the blast through the riggingfor it was an absolute hurricanewhile tons of water fell over the decks continually sweeping them from stem to stern  the fusilier had struck on that part of the sands named the girdler  in the midst of the turmoil there was but one course open to the crew namely to send forth signals of distress  guns were fired rockets sent up and tarbarrels set ablaze  then during many hours of agony they had to wait and pray  on that same night another good ship struck upon the same sands at a different pointthe demerara of greenocknot an emigrant ship but freighted with a crew of nineteen souls including a trinity pilot tossed like a plaything on the sandsat that part named the shingles off margate the demerara soon began to break up and the helpless crew did as those of the fusilier had done and were still doingthey signalled for aid  but it seemed a forlorn resource  through the thick driving murky atmosphere nothing but utter blackness could be seen though the blazing of their own tarbarrels revealed with awful power the seething breakers around which as if maddened by the obstruction of the sands leaped and hissed wildly over them and finally crushed their vessel over on its beamends  swept from the deck which was no longer a platform but as it were a sloping wall the crew took refuge in the rigging of one of the masts which still held fast  the mast overhung the caldron of foam which seemed to boil and leap at the crew as if in disappointed fury  by degrees the hull of the demerara began to break up  her timbers writhed and snapped under the force of the everthundering waves as if tormented  the deck was blown out by the confined and compressed air the copper began to peel off the planks to loosen and soon it became evident that the mast to which the crew were lashed could not long hold up  thus for ten apparently endless hours the perishing seamen hung suspended over what seemed to be their grave  they hung thus in the midst of pitchy darkness after their blazing tarbarrels had been extinguished  and what of the lifeboatmen during all this time  were they asleep nay verily  everywhere they stood at pierheads almost torn from their holdfasts by the furious gale or they cowered under the lee of boats and boathouses on the beach trying to gaze seaward through the blinding storm but nothing whatever could they see of the disasters on these outlying sands  there are however several sentinels which mount guard night and day close to the goodwin and other sands  these are the floating lights which mark the position of our extensive and dangerous shoals  two of these sentinels the tongue lightship and the princes lightship in the vicinity of the girdler sands saw the signals of distress  instantly their guns and rockets gleamed and thundered intelligence to the shore such signals had been watched for keenly that night by the brave men of the margate lifeboat who instantly went off to the rescue  but there are conditions against which human courage and power and will are equally unavailing  in the teeth of such a gale from the westnorwest with the sea driving in thunder straight on the beach it was impossible for the margate boat to put out  a telegram was therefore despatched to ramsgate  here too as at broadstairs and everywhere else the heroes of the coast were on the lookout knowing well the duties that might be required of them at any moment  the stout little aid was lying at the pier with her steam up  the ramsgate lifeboat was floating quietly in the harbour and her sturdy lionlike coxswain isaac jarman was at the pierhead with some of his men watching  the ramsgate men had already been out on service at the sands that day and their appetite for saving life had been whetted they were ready for more work  at a quarter past eight pm the telegram was received by the harbourmaster  the signal was given  the lifeboatmen rushed to their boats  first come first served is the rule there  she was overmanned and some of the brave fellows had to leave her  the tight little tug took the boat in tow and in less than half an hour rushed out with her into the intense darkness right in the teeth of tempest and billows  the engines of the aid are powerful like her whole frame  though fiercely opposed she battled out into the raging sea now tossed on the tops of the mighty waves now swallowed in the troughs between battered by the breaking crests whelmed at times by green seas staggering like a drunken thing and buffeted by the fierce gale but never giving way an inch onward steadily if slowly until she rounded the north foreland  then the rescuers saw the signals going up steadily regularly from the two lightships  no cessation of these signals until they should be answered by signals from the shore  all this time the lifeboat had been rushing surging and bounding in the wake of her steamer  the seas not only roared around her but absolutely overwhelmed her  she was dragged violently over them and sometimes right through them  her crew crouched almost flat on the thwarts and held on to prevent being washed overboard  the stout cable had to be let out to its full extent to prevent snapping so that the mist and rain sometimes prevented her crew from seeing the steamer while cross seas met and hurled her from side to side causing her to plunge and kick like a wild horse  about midnight the tongue lightship was reached and hailed  the answer given was brief and to the point a vessel in distress to the norwest supposed to be on the high part of the shingles sand  away went the tug and boat to the norwest but no vessel could be found though anxious hearts and sharp and practised eyes were strained to the uttermost  the captain of the aid who knew every foot of the sands and who had medals and letters from kings and emperors in acknowledgment of his valuable services was not to be balked easily he crept along as close to the dangerous sands as was consistent with the safety of his vessel  how intently they gazed and listened both from lifeboat and steamer but no cry was to be heard no signal of distress nothing but the roaring of the waves and shrieking of the blast and yet they were not far from the perishing  the crew of the demerara were clinging to their quivering mast close by but what could their weak voices avail in such a storm  their signal fires had long before been drowned out and those who would have saved them could not see more than a few yards around  presently the booming of distant cannon was heard and then a faint line of fire was seen in the far distance against the black sky  the princes and the girdler lightships were both firing guns and rockets to tell that shipwreck was taking place near to them  what was to be done were the shingles to be forsaken when possibly human beings were perishing there  there was no help for it  the steamer and lifeboat made for the vessels that were signalling and as the exhausted crew on the quivering mast of the demerara saw their lights depart the last hope died out of their breasts  hope thou in god for thou shalt yet praise him perchance occurred to some of them who knows  meanwhile the rescuers made for the princes lightship and were told that a vessel in distress was signalling on the higher part of the girdler sands  away they went again and this time were successful  they made for the girdler lightship and on the girdler sands they found the fusilier  the steamer towed the lifeboat to windward of the wreck into such a position that when cast adrift she could bear down on her  then the cable was slipped and the boat went in for her own special and hazardous work  up went her little foresail closereefed and she rushed into a sea of tumultuous broken water that would have swamped any other kind of boat in the world  what a burst of thrilling joy and hope there was among the emigrants in the fusilier when the little craft was at last descried  it was about one oclock in the morning by that time and the sky had cleared a very little so that a faint gleam of moonlight enabled them to see the boat of mercy plunging towards them through a very chaos of surging seas and whirling foam  to the rescuers the wreck was rendered clearly visible by the lurid light of her burning tarbarrels as she lay on the sands writhing and trembling like a living thing in agony  the waves burst over her continually and mingling in spray with the black smoke of her fires swept furiously away to leeward  at first each wave had lifted the ship and let her crash down on the sands but as the tide fell this action decreased and had ceased entirely when the lifeboat arrived  and now the point of greatest danger was reached  how to bring a lifeboat alongside of a wreck so as to get the people into her without being dashed to pieces is a difficult problem to solve  it was no new problem however to these hardy and fearless men they had solved it many a time before that night  when more than a hundred yards to windward of the wreck the boats foresail was lowered and her anchor let go  then they seized the oars and the cable was payed out but the distance had been miscalculated  they were twenty yards or so short of the wreck when the cable had run completely out so the men had to pull slowly and laboriously back to their anchor again while the emigrants sent up a cry of despair supposing they had failed and were going to forsake them  at length the anchor was got up  in a few minutes it was let go in a better position and the boat was carefully veered down under the lee of the vessel from both bow and stern of which a hawser was thrown to it and made fast  by means of these ropes and the cable the boat was kept somewhat in position without striking the wreck  it was no easy matter to make the voice heard in such a gale and turmoil of seas but the captain of the fusilier managed to give his ships name and intended destination  then he shouted how many can you carry  we have more than a hundred souls on board more than sixty of them women and children  this might well fill the breasts of the rescuers with anxiety  their boat when packed full could only carry about thirty  however a cheering reply was returned and seizing a favourable opportunity two of the boatmen sprang on the wreck clambered over the side and leaped among the excited emigrants  some seized them by the hands and hailed them as deliverers others half dead with terror clung to them as if afraid they might forsake them  there was no time however to humour feelings  shaking them all offkindly but forciblythe men went to work with a will briefly explained that there was a steamer not far off and began to get the women first into the boat  terrorstricken half fainting trembling in every limb deadly pale and exhausted by prolonged anxiety and exposure the poor creatures were carried rather than led to the ships side  it needed courage even to submit to be saved on such a night and in such circumstances  two sailors stood outside the ships bulwarks fastened there by ropes ready to lower the women  at one moment the raging sea rose with a roar almost to the feet of these men bearing the kicking lifeboat on its crest  next moment the billow had passed and the men looked down into a yawning abyss of foam with the boat surging away far out of their reach plunging and tugging at the ropes which held it as a wild horse of the plains might struggle with the lasso  no wonder that the women gazed appalled at the prospect of such a leap or that some shrieked and wildly resisted the kind violence of their rescuers  but the leap was for life it had to be takenand quickly too for the storm was very fierce and there were many to save  one of the women is held firmly by the two men  with wildlystaring eyes she sees the boat sweep towards her on the breast of a rushing sea it comes closer  some of the men below stand up with outstretched arms  the woman makes a half spring but hesitates  the momentary action proves almost fatal  in an instant the boat sinks into a gulf sweeps away as far as the ropes will let her and is buried in foam while the woman is slipping from the grasp of the men who hold her  dont let her go dont let her go is roared by the lifeboatmen but she has struggled out of their grasp  another instant and she is gone but god in his mercy sends the boat in again at that instant the men catch her as she falls and drag her inboard  thus one by one were the women got into the lifeboat  some of these women were old and infirm some were invalids  who can conceive the horror of the situation to such as these save those who went through it  the children were wrapped up in blankets and thus handed down  some of the husbands or fathers on board rolled up shawls and blankets and tossed them down to the partially clothed and trembling women  it chanced that one small infant was bundled up in a blanket by a frantic passenger and handed over the side  the man who received it mistaking it for merely a blanket cried here bill catch and tossed it into the boat  bill with difficulty caught it as it was flying overboard at the same moment a woman cried my child my child sprang forward snatched the bundle from the horrified bill and hugged it to her bosom  at last the boat being sufficiently filled was hauled up to her anchor  sail was hoisted and away they flew into the surging darkness leaving the rest of the emigrants still filled with terrible anxiety but not now with hopeless despair  the lifeboat and her tender work admirably together  knowing exactly what must be going on and what would be required of him though he could see nothing the captain of the aid after the boat had slipped from him had run down along the sands to leeward of the wreck and there waited  presently he saw the boat coming like a phantom out of the gloom  it was quickly alongside and the rescued people twentyfive women and childrenwere transferred to the steamer taken down to her cabin and tenderly cared for  making this transfer in such a sea was itself difficult in the extreme and accompanied with great danger but difficulty and danger were the rule that night not the exception  all went well  the aid with the warriorboat in tow steamed back to windward of the wreck then the lifeboat slipped the cable as before and returned to the conflict leaping over the seething billows to the field of battle like a warhorse refreshed  the stirring scene was repeated with success  forty women and children were rescued on the second trip and put on board the steamer  leaden daylight now began to dawn  many hours had the storm warriors been engaged in the wild exhausting fight nevertheless a third and a fourth time did they charge the foe and each time with the same result  all the passengers were finally rescued and put on board the steamer  but now arose a difficulty  the tide had been falling and leaving the wreck so that the captain and crew determined to stick to her in the hope of getting her off if the gale should abate before the tide rose again  it was therefore agreed that the lifeboat should remain by her in case of accidents so the exhausted men had to prepare for a weary wait in their wildly plunging boat while the aid went off with her rescued people to ramsgate  but the adventures of that night were not yet over  the tug had not been gone above an hour and a half when to the surprise of those in the lifeboat she was seen returning with her flag flying half mast high a signal of recall to her boat  the lifeboat slipped from the side of the wreck and ran to meet her  the reason was soon explained on his way back to ramsgate the captain had discovered another large vessel on her beamends a complete wreck on that part of the sands named the shingles  it was the demerara and her crew were still seen clinging to the quivering mast on which they had spent the livelong night  more work for the wellnigh worn out heroes  away they went to the rescue as though they had been a fresh crew  dashing through the surf they drew near the doomed ship which creaked and groaned when struck by the tremendous seas and threatened to go to pieces every moment  the sixteen men on the mast were drenched by every sea  several times that awful night they had as it were been mocked by false hopes of deliverance  they had seen the flashing of the rockets and faintly heard the thunder of the alarmguns fired by the lightships  they had seen the lights of the steamer while she searched in vain for them on first reaching the sands had observed the smaller light of the boat in tow whose crew would have been so glad to save them and had shouted in vain to them as they passed by on their errand of mercy to other parts of the sands leaving them a prey to darkness and despair  but a merciful and loving god had seen and heard them all the time and now sent them aid at the eleventh hour  when the lifeboat at last made in towards them the ebb tide was running strongly and from the position of the wreck it was impossible to anchor to windward and drop down to leeward in the usual fashion  they had therefore to adopt the dangerous plan of running with the wind right in upon the forerigging and risk being smashed by the mast which was beating about with its living load like an eccentric batteringram  but these ramsgate men would stick at nothing  they rushed in and received many severe blows besides dashing into the iron windlass of the wreck  slowly and one by one the enfeebled men dropped from the mast into the boat  sixteenall saved  there was great shaking of hands despite the tossings of the hungry surf and many fervid expressions of thankfulness as the sail was hoisted and the men of the demerara were carried away to join the other rescued ones who by that time thronged the little aid almost to overflowing  at ramsgate that morningthe morning of the 4thit was soon known to the loungers on the pier that the lifeboat was out had been out all night and might be expected back soon  bright and clear though cold was the morn which succeeded that terrible night and many hundreds of anxious beating hopeful hearts were on the lookout  at last the steamer and her warriorboat appeared and a feeling of great gladness seemed to spread through the crowd when it was observed that a flag was flying at the masthead a wellknown sign of victory  on they came right gallantly over the still turbulent waves  as they passed the pierheads and the crowd of pale faces were seen gazing upwards in smiling acknowledgment of the hearty welcome there burst forth a deeptoned thrilling cheer which increased in enthusiasm as the extent of the victory was realised and culminated when it became known that at one grand swoop the lifeboat after a fight of sixteen hours had rescued a hundred and twenty souls from the grasp of the raging sea  reader there was many a heartstirring incident enacted that night which i have not told you and much more might be related of that great battle and glorious victory  but enough surely has been told to give you some idea of what our coast heroes dare and do in their efforts to rescue the perishing    chapter three  light and shade in lifeboat work  but victory does not always crown the efforts of our lifeboats sometimes we have to tell of partial failure or defeat and it is due to the lifeboat cause to show that our coast heroes are to the full as daring selfsacrificing and noble in the time of disaster as they are in the day of victory  a splendid instance of persevering effort in the face of absolutely insurmountable difficulty was afforded by the action of the constance lifeboat belonging to tynemouth on the night of the 24th november 1864  on that night the coast of northumberland was visited by one of the severest gales that had been experienced for many years and a tremendous sea was dashing and roaring among the rocks at the mouth of the tyne  many ships had sought refuge in the harbour during the day but as the shades of evening began to descend the risk of attempting an entrance became very great  at last as the night was closing in the schooner friendship ran on the rocks named the black middens  shortly afterwards a large steamer the stanley of aberdeen with thirty passengers most of whom were women thirty of a crew a cargo of merchandise and a deckload of cattle attempted to take the river on approaching she sent up rockets for a pilot but none dared venture out to her  the danger of putting out again to sea was too great  the captain therefore resolved to attempt the passage himself  he did so three heavy seas struck the steamer so severely as to divert her from her course and she ran on the rocks close to the friendship so close that the cries of her crew could be heard above the whistling winds and thundering waves  as soon as she struck the indescribable circumstances of a dread disaster began  the huge billows that had hitherto passed onward heaving her upwards now burst over her with inconceivable violence and crushed her down sweeping the decks continuouslythey rocked her fiercely to and fro they ground her sides upon the cruel rocks they lifted her on their powerful crests let her fall bodily on the rocks stove in her bottom and rushing into the hold extinguished the engine fires  the sound of her rending planks and timbers was mingled with the piercing cries of the female passengers and the gruff shouting of the men as they staggered to and fro vainly attempting to do something they knew not what to avert their doom  it was pitch dark by this time yet not so dark but that the sharp eyes of earnest daring men on shore had noted the catastrophe  the men of the coastguard under mr lawrence byrne their chief officer got out the rocket apparatus and succeeded in sending a line over the wreck unfortunately however owing to mismanagement of those on board the steamer it proved ineffective  they had fastened the hawser of the apparatus to the forecastle instead of high up on the mast so that the ropes became hopelessly entangled on the rocks  before this entanglement occurred however two men had been hauled ashore to show the possibility of escape and to give the ladies courage  then a lady ventured into the slinglifebuoy or cradle with a sailor but they stuck fast during the transit and while being hauled back to the wreck fell out and were drowned  a fireman then made the attempt  again the cradle stuck but the man was strong and went hand over hand along the hawser to the shore where mr byrne rushed into the surf and caught hold of him  the rescuer nearly lost his life in the attempt  he was overtaken by a huge wave and was on the point of being washed away when he caught hold of a gentleman who ran into the surf to save him  the rocket apparatus having thus failed owing to the simple mistake of those in the wreck having fastened the hawser too low on their vessel the crew attempted to lower a boat with four seamen and four ladies in it  one of the davits gave way the other swung round and the boat was swamped  three of the men were hauled back into the steamer but the others perished  the men would not now launch the other boats  indeed it would have been useless for no ordinary boat could have lived in such a sea  soon afterwards all the boats were washed away and destroyed and the destruction of the steamer itself seemed about to take place every moment  while this terrible fight for dear life was going on the lifeboatmen were not idle  they ran out their good boat the constance and launched her  and what a fearful launching that was  this boat belonged to the institution and her crew were justly proud of her  according to the account given by her gallant coxswain james gilbert they could see nothing whatever at the time of starting but the white flash of the seas as they passed over boat and crew without intermission twelve or thirteen times  yet as quickly as the boat was filled she emptied herself through her dischargingtubes  of these tubes i shall treat hereafter  gilbert could not even see his own men except the second coxswain who i presume was close to him  sometimes the boat was driven to an angle of forty or fortyfive degrees in clearing the rocks  when they were in a position to make for the steamer the order was given to back all oars and keep her endon to the sea  the men obeyed they seemed to be inspired with fresh vigour as they neared the wreck  let gilbert himself tell the rest of the story as follows  when abreast of the port bow two men told us they had a rope ready on the starboard bow  we said we would be there in a moment  i then ordered the bowman to be ready to receive the rope  as soon as we were ready we made two dashing strokes and were under the bowsprit expecting to receive the rope when we heard a dreadful noise and the next instant the sea fell over the bows of the stanley and buried the lifeboat  every oar was broken at the gunwale of the boat and the outer ends were swept away  the men made a grasp for the spare oars three were gone two only remained  we were then left with the rudder and two oars  the next sea struck the boat almost over end on board the friendship the boat at the time being nearly perpendicular  we then had the misfortune to lose four of our crew  as the boat made a most fearful crash and fell alongside the vessel james grant was i believe killed on the spot betwixt the ship and the boat edmund robson and james blackburn were thrown out joseph bell jumped as the boat fell  my own impression is that the men all jumped from the boat on to the vessel  we saw them no more  there were four men standing in a group before the mainmast of the schooner  we implored them to come into the boat but no one answered  little wonder at that james gilbert  the massive wreck must have seemedat least to men who did not know the qualities of a lifeboata surer foothold than the tossed cockleshell with only two oars and a rudder out of which four of her own gallant crew had just been lost even landsmen can perceive that it must have required much faith to trust a lifeboat in the circumstances  the next sea that struck the lifeboat continues the coxswain landed her within six feet of the foundationstone of tynemouth dock with a quickness seldom witnessed  the crew plied the remaining two oars to leeward against the rudder and boathook  we never saw anything till coming near the three shields lifeboats  we asked them for oars to proceed back to the friendship but they had none to spare  thus the brave constance was baffled and had to retire severely wounded from the fight  she drove in her disabled and unmanageable condition into the harbour  of the four men thrown out of her grant and robson who had found temporary refuge in the wrecked schooner perished  the other two bell and blackburn were buoyed up by their cork lifebelts washed ashore and saved  the schooner itself was afterwards destroyed and her crew of four men and a boy were lost  meanwhile the screams of those on board of her and the stanley were borne on the gale to the vast crowds who despite darkness and tempest lined the neighbouring cliffs and the shields lifeboats just referred to made gallant attempts to approach the wrecks but failed  indeed it seemed to have been a rash attempt on the part of the noble fellows of the constance to have made the venture at all  the second cabin of the stanley was on deck and formed the bridge or outlook  on this a number of the passengers and crew had taken refuge but a tremendous sea carried it and all its occupants bodily away after this the fury of the sea increased and about an hour before midnight the steamer with a hideous crash broke in two amidships  the after part remained fast the fore part swung round  all the people who remained on the after part were swept away and drowned  the new position into which the fore part of the wreck had been forced was so far an advantage to those who still clung to it that the bows broke the first violence of the waves and thus partially protected the exhausted people thirtyfive of whom still remained alive out of the sixty souls originally on board  ten of these were passengerstwo being ladies  meanwhile fresh preparations were being made by the rocketmen messengers had been sent in hot haste to cullercoats for more rockets those at tynemouth having been exhausted  they arrived at five oclock in the morning  by that time the tide had fallen considerably admitting of a nearer approach to the wreck and once more a gleam of hope cheered the hearts of the perishing as they beheld the fiery messenger of mercy rush fiercely towards them from the shore  but hope was still delayed  four of the rockets missed  the fifth passed right over them dropping the lifeline on the wreck and drawing from the poor sufferers a feeble cheer which was replied to lustily from the shore this time fortunately no mistakes were made by those on board  the blocks and tackle were drawn out the hawser on which the slinglifebuoy traversed was fastened high up on the foremast to prevent the ropes fouling the rocks as they had done on the first attempt then the lifebuoy was run out and eventually every soul was drawn in safety to the shore  thus did that battle end with much of disaster and death to regret indeed but with upwards of thirtyfive rescued lives to rejoice over  i have now shown the action and bearing of our coast heroes both in circumstances of triumphant victory and of partial success  before proceeding to other matters it is well to add that when intelligence of this disaster was telegraphed to the lifeboat institution a new lifeboat was immediately forwarded to tynemouth temporarily to replace the damaged constance  instructions were given for the relief of the widows and children of the two lifeboatmen who had perished and 26 pounds was sent to the crew of the boat  at their next meeting the committee of the institution besides recording their deep regret for the melancholy loss of life voted 100 pounds in aid of a fund raised locally for the widows and seven children of the two men  they likewise bestowed their silver medal and a vote of thanks inscribed on vellum to mr lawrence byrne of the coastguard in testimony of his gallant services on the occasion  contributions were also raised by a local committee for the relief of the sufferers by these disasters and a volunteer corps was formed to assist in working the rocket apparatus on future occasions of shipwreck  let me at this point earnestly request the reader who dwells in an inland home and who never hears the roaring of the terrible sea carefully to note that in this case it was men of the coast who did the work and people of the coast town who gave subscriptions who sympathised with sufferers and raised a volunteer corps  ponder this well good reader and ask yourself the question is all as it should be here  have i and my fellowinlanders nothing to do but read admire and say well done  a hint is sufficient at this point  i will return to the subject hereafter  sometimes our gallant lifeboatmen when called into action go through a very different and not very comfortable experience  they neither gain a glorious victory nor achieve a partial success but after all their efforts risks and exposure find that their services are not required and that they must return meekly home with nothing to reward them but an approving conscience  one such incident i once had the opportunity of observing  i was living at the timefor purposes of investigation and by special permission on board of the gull lightship which lies directly off ramsgate harbour close to the goodwin sands  it was in the month of march during the greater part of my two weeks sojourn in that lightship the weather was reasonably fine but one evening it came on to blow hard and became what jack styles dirty  i went to rest that night in a condition which may be described as semiseasick  for some time i lay in my bunk moralising on the madness of those who choose the sea for a profession  suddenly i was rousedand the seasickness instantly curedby the watch on deck shouting down the hatchway to the mate south sand head light is firing sir and sending up rockets  the mate sprang from his bunkjust opposite to mineand was on the cabin floor before the sentence was well finished  thrusting the poker with violence into the cabin fire he rushed on deck  i jumped up and pulled on coat nether garments and shoes as if my life depended on my speed wondering the while at the poker incident  there was unusual need for clothing for the night was bitterly cold  on gaining the deck i found the two men on duty actively at work one loading the lee gun the other fitting a rocket to its stick  a few hurried questions by the mate elicited all that it was needful to know the flash of a gun from the south sand head lightship about six miles distant had been seen followed by a rocket indicating that a vessel had got upon the fatal sands in her vicinity  while the men were speaking i saw the flash of another gun but heard no report owing to the gale carrying the sound to leeward  a rocket followed and at the same moment we observed the distress signal of the vessel in danger flaring on the southern tail of the sands but very faintly it was so far away and the night so thick  by this time our gun was charged and the rocket in position  look alive jack fetch the poker cried the mate as he primed the gun  i was enlightened as to the poker  jack dived down the hatchway and next moment returned with that instrument redhot  he applied it in quick succession to gun and rocket  a grand flash and crash from the first was followed by a blinding blaze and a whiz as the second sprang with a magnificent curve far away into surrounding darkness  this was our answer to the south sand head lightship  it was at the same time our signalcall to the lookout on the pier of ramsgate harbour  thats a beauty said our mate referring to the rocket  get up another jack  sponge her well out jacobs well give em another shot in a few minutes  loud and clear were both our signals but four and a half miles of distance and a fresh gale neutralised their influence on that dark and dismal night  the lookout did not see them  in a few minutes the gun and rocket were fired again  still no answering signal came from ramsgate  load the weather gun said the mate  jacobs obeyed and i sought shelter under the lee of the weather bulwarks for the wind seemed to be made of penknives and needles  the sturdy gull straining and plunging wildly at her huge cables trembled as our third gun thundered forth its summons but the rocket struck the rigging and made a low wavering flight  another was therefore sent up but it had scarcely cut its bright line across the sky when we observed the answering signala rocket from ramsgate pier  thats all right now sir our work is done said the mate to me as he went below and quietly turned in while the watch having sponged out and recovered the gun resumed their active perambulations of the deck  i confess that i felt somewhat disappointed at the sudden termination of the noise and excitement  i was told that the ramsgate lifeboat could not well be out in less than an hour  there was nothing for it therefore but patience so i turned in all standing as sailors have it with a request that i should be called when the lights of the tug should come in sight  scarcely had i lain down however when the voice of the watch was heard shouting hastily lifeboat close alongside sir didnt see it till this moment  she carries no lights  out i bounced minus hat coat and shoes and scrambled on deck just in time to see a boat close under our stern rendered spectrally visible by the light of our lantern  it was not the ramsgate but the broadstairs lifeboat the men of which had observed our first rocket had launched their boat at once and had run down with the favouring gale  what are you firing for shouted the coxswain of the boat  ship on the sands bearing south replied jack at the full pitch of his stentorian voice  the boat which was under sail did not pause and nothing more was said with a magnificent rush it passed us and shot away into the darkness our reply had been heard and the lifeboat steering by compass went straight as an arrow to the rescue  it was a thrilling experience to me  spectral as a vision though it seemed and brief almost as the lightning flash its visit was the real thing at last  many a time had i heard and read of our lifeboats and had seen them reposing in their boathouses as well as out for exercise but now i had seen a lifeboat tearing before the gale through the tormented sea sternly bent on the real work of saving human life  once again all became silent and unexciting on board the gull and i went shivering below with exalted notions of the courage endurance and businesslike vigour of our coast heroes  i now lay wakeful and expectant  presently the shout came again  tugs in sight sir  and once more i went on deck with the mate  the steamer was quickly alongside heaving wildly in the sea with the ramsgate lifeboat bradford in tow far astern  she merely slowed a little to admit of the same brief question and reply the latter being repeated as the boat passed for the benefit of the coxswain  as she swept by us i looked down and observed that the ten men who formed her crew crouched flat on the thwarts  only the steersman sat up  no wonder  it must be hard to sit up in a stiff gale with freezing spray and sometimes heavy seas sweeping over one  i knew that the men were wide awake and listening but as far as vision went that boat was manned only by ten oilskin coats and souwesters  a few seconds carried them out of sight and thus as regards the gull lightship the drama ended  there was no possibility of the dwellers in the floating lights hearing anything of the details of that nights work until the fortnightly visit of their tender should fall due but next morning at low tide far away in the distance we could see the wreck bottom up high on the goodwin sands  afterwards i learned that the ships crew had escaped in one of their own boats and taken refuge in the south sand head lightship whence they were conveyed next day to land so that the gallant men of ramsgate and broadstairs had all their toil and trouble for nothing  thus you see there are not only high lights and deep shadows but also neutral tints in the various incidents which go to make up the grand picture of lifeboat work  there is a fund connected with the broadstairs lifeboat which deserves passing notice here  it was raised by the late sir charles reed in 1867 the proceeds to be distributed annually among the seamen who save life on that coast  the following particulars of this fund were supplied by sir charles reed himself  eight boatmen of broadstairs were interested in a luggerthe dreadnoughtwhich had for years done good service on the goodwins  one night they went off in a tremendous sea to save a french barque but though they secured the crew a steamtug claimed the prize and towed her into ramsgate harbour  the broadstairs men instituted proceedings to secure the salvage but they were beaten in a london law court where they were overpowered by the advocacy of a powerful company  in the meantime they lost their lugger off the coast of normandy and in this emergency the lawyers they had employed demanded their costs  the poor men had no means and not being able to pay they were taken from their homes and lodged in maidstone gaol  he sir charles was then staying in broadstairs and an appeal being made to him he wrote to the times and in one week received nearly twice the amount required  the bill was paid the men were liberated and brought home to their families and the balance of the amount a considerable sum was invested the interest to be applied to the rewarding of boatmen who by personal bravery had distinguished themselves by saving life on the coast    chapter four  construction and qualities of the lifeboat  in previous chapters enough has been told i think to prove that our lifeboats deserve earnest and thoughtful attention not only as regards their work but in reference to their details of construction  it has been said that the lifeboat possesses special qualities which distinguish it from all other boats  chief among these are the selfrighting and selfemptying principles  stability resulting from breadth of beam etcetera will do much to render a boat safe in rough seas and tempestuous weather but when a boat has to face mighty rollers which turn it up until it stands straight on end like a rearing horse and even tumble it right over or when it has to plunge into horrible maelstroms which seethe leap and fume in the mad contention of cross seas no device that man has yet fallen upon will save it from turning keel up and throwing its contents into the water  instead therefore of attempting to build a boat which cannot upset men have deemed it wiser to attempt the construction of one which will not remain in that position but which will of necessity right itself the end aimed at has been achieved and the boat now in use by the lifeboat institution is absolutely perfect in this respect  what more could be desired in any boat than that after being upset it should right itself in a few seconds and empty itself of water in less than one minute  a boat which does not right itself when overturned is only a lifeboat so long as it maintains its proper position on the water  let its selfemptying and buoyant qualities be ever so good you have only to upset it to render it no better than any other boatindeed in a sense it is worse than other boats because it leads men to face danger which they would not dare to encounter in an ordinary boat  doubtless lifeboats on the nonselfrighting principle possess great stability and are seldom overturned nevertheless they occasionally are and with fatal results  here is one example  in the month of january 1865 the liverpool lifeboat when out on service was upset and seven men of her crew were drowned  this was not a selfrighting boat and it did not belong to the lifeboat institution most of whose boats are now built on the selfrighting principle  moreover the unfortunate men had not put on lifebelts  it may be added that the men who work the boats of the institution are not allowed to go off without their cork lifebelts on  take another case  on the 4th january 1857 the point of ayr lifeboat when under sail in a gale upset at a distance from the land  the accident was seen from the shore but no aid could be rendered and the whole boats crewthirteen in numberwere drowned  this boat was considered a good lifeboat and doubtless it was so in many respects but it was not a selfrighting one  two or three of the poor fellows were seen clinging to the keel for twenty minutes by which time they became exhausted were washed off and having no lifebelts on perished  again in february 1858 the southwold lifeboata large sailing boat esteemed one of the finest in the kingdom but not on the selfrighting principlewent out for exercise and was running before a heavy surf with all sail set when she suddenly ran on the top of a sea turned broadside to the waves and was upset  the crew in this case were fortunately near the shore had on their lifebelts and although some of them could not swim were all savedno thanks however to their boat which remained keel upbut three unfortunate gentlemen who had been permitted to go off in the boat without lifebelts and one of whom was a good swimmer lost their lives  let it be noted here that the above three instances of disaster occurred in the day time and the contrast of the following case will appear all the stronger  one very dark and stormy night in october 1858 the small lifeboat of dungeness put off through a heavy sea to a wreck threequarters of a mile from the shore  eight stout men of the coastguard composed her crew  she was a selfrighting selfemptying boat belonging to the lifeboat institution  the wreck was reached soon after midnight and found to have been abandoned  the boat therefore returned towards the shore  now there is a greater danger in rowing before a gale than in rowing against it  for the first half mile all went well though the sea was heavy and broken but on crossing a deep channel between two shoals the little lifeboat was caught up and struck by three heavy seas in succession  the coxswain lost command of the rudder and she was carried away before a sea broached to and upset throwing her crew out of her  immediately she righted herself cleared herself of water and was brought up by her anchor which had fallen out when she was overturned  the crew meanwhile having on lifebelts floated and swam to the boat caught hold of the lifelines festooned round her sides clambered into her cut the cable and returned to the shore in safety what more need be said in favour of the selfrighting boats  the selfemptying principle is quite equal to the selfrighting in importance  in every case of putting off to a wreck in a gale a lifeboat ships a great deal of water  in most cases she fills more than once frequently she is overwhelmed by tons of water by every sea  a boat full of water cannot advance therefore baling becomes necessary but baling besides being very exhausting work is so slow that it would be useless labour in most cases  besides when men have to bale they cannot give that undivided attention to the oars which is needful  to overcome this difficulty the selfemptying plan was devised  as i doubt not the reader is now sufficiently interested to ask the questions how are selfrighting and selfemptying accomplished  i will try to throw some light on these subjects  first as to selfrighting  you are aware no doubt that the buoyancy of our lifeboat is due chiefly to large aircases at the ends and all round the sides from stem to stern  the accompanying drawing and diagrams will aid us in the description  on the opposite page you have a portrait of let us say a thirtythree feet tenoared lifeboat of the royal national lifeboat institution on its transporting carriage ready for launching and on page 95 two diagrams representing respectively a section and a deck view of the same figures 1 2 and 3  the breadth of this boat is eight feet its stowageroom sufficient for thirty passengers besides its crew of twelve menfortytwo in all  it is doublebanked that is each of its five banks benches or thwarts accommodates two rowers sitting side by side  the lines festooned round the side dip into the water so that anyone swimming alongside may easily grasp them and in the middle part of the boatjust where the large wheels come in the engravingtwo of the lines are longer than the others so that a man might use them as stirrups and thus be enabled to clamber into the boat even without assistance  the rudder descends considerably below the keelto give it more powerand has to be raised when the boat is being launched  the shaded parts of the diagrams show the position and form of the aircases which prevent a lifeboat from sinking  the white oblong space in figure 2 is the free space available for crew and passengers  in figure 3 is seen the depth to which the airchambers descend and the height to which the bow and sternchambers rise  it is to these large airchambers in bow and stern coupled with great sheeror rise fore and aftof gunwale and a very heavy keel that the boat owes its selfrighting power  the two airchambers are rounded on the top  now it is obvious that if you were to take a model of such a boat turn it upside down on a table and try to make it rest on its two rounded airchambers you would encounter as much difficulty as did the friends of columbus when they sought to make an egg stand on its end  the boat would infallibly fall to one side or the other  in the water the tendency is precisely the same and that tendency is increased by the heavy iron keel which drags the boat violently round to its right position  the selfrighting principle was discoveredat all events for the first time exhibitedat the end of last century by the reverend james bremner of orkney  he first suggested in the year 1792 that an ordinary boat might be made selfrighting by placing two watertight casks in the head and sternsheets of it and fastening three hundredweight of iron to the keel  afterwards he tried the experiment at leith and with such success that in 1810 the society of arts voted him a silver medal and twenty guineas  but nothing further was done until half a century later when twenty out of twentyfour pilots lost their lives by the upsetting of the nonselfrighting shields lifeboat  then 1850 the late duke of northumberland offered a prize of 100 guineas for the best lifeboat that could be produced  no fewer than 280 models and drawings were sent in and the plans specifications and descriptions of these formed five folio manuscript volumes  the various models were in the shape of pontoons catamarans or rafts northcountry cobles and ordinary boats slightly modified  the committee appointed to decide on their respective merits had a difficult task to perform after six months careful patient investigation and experiment they awarded the prize to mr james beeching of great yarmouth  beechings boat although the best was not however deemed perfect  the committee therefore set mr james peake one of their number and assistant mastershipwright at woolwich dockyard to incorporate as many as possible of the good qualities of all the other models with beechings boat  from time to time various important improvements have been made and the result is the present magnificent boat of the institution by means of which hundreds of lives are saved every year  the selfdischarge of water from a lifeboat is not so easy to explain it will be the more readily comprehended if the reader understands and will bear in remembrance the physical fact that water will and must find its level  that isno portion of water small or great in tub pond or sea can for a moment remain above its flat and level surface except when forced into motion or commotion  left to itself it infallibly flattens out becomes calm lies still in the lowest attainable positionin other words finds its level  bearing this in mind let us look again at figure 3  the dotted double line about the middle of the boat extending from stem to stern represents the floor of the boat on which the mens feet rest when standing or sitting in it  it also represents or very nearly so the waterline outside that is the depth to which the boat will sink when afloat manned and loaded  therefore the boats floor and the ocean surface are on the same level  observe that  the space between the floor and the keel is filled up with cork or other ballast now there are six large holes in the boats flooreach hole six inches in diameterinto which are fitted six metal tubes which pass down by the side of the cork ballast and right through the bottom of the boat itself thus making six large openings into the sea  but hallo you exclaim wont the water from below rush up through these holes and fill the boat  it will indeed rush up into these holes but it will not fill the boat because it will have found its levelthe level of oceanon reaching the floor  well besides having reached its level the water in the tubes has reached six valves which will open downwards to let water out but which wont open upwards to let it in  now suppose a huge billow topples into the boat and fills it quite full is it not obvious that all the water in the boat stands above the oceans levelbeing above the boats floor  like a wise element it immediately seeks its own level by the only mode of egressthe discharging tubes and when it has found its level it has also found the floor of the boat  in other words it is all gone moreover it rushes out so violently that a lifeboat filled to overflowing frees itself as i have already said in less than one minute  the buoyancy therefore of a lifeboat is not affected for more than a few seconds by the tons of water which occasionally and frequently break into her  to prove this let me refer you again to the account of the constance given by its gallant coxswain as recorded in the third chapter  he speaks of the lifeboat being buried sunk by the wave that burst over the bow of the stanley and immediately he adds the men made a grasp for the spare oars  there is no such remark as when we recovered ourselves etcetera  the sinking and leaping to the surface were evidently the work of a few seconds and this is indeed the case for when the force that sinks a lifeboat is removed she rises that instant to the surface like a cork and when she tumbles over she recovers herself with the agility of an acrobat  the transportingcarriage is a most essential part of a lifeboat establishment because wrecks frequently take place at some distance from a station and prompt assistance is of the utmost importance in all cases of rescue  it is drawn by horses and with its exceedingly broad and strong wheels can be dragged over any kind of road or across soft sand  it is always backed into the surf so deep that the boat may be launched from it with her crew seated and the oars out ready to pull with might and main the instant the plunge is made  these first strokes of a lifeboats crew are of immense importance  want of union or energy on the part of steersman or crew at this critical point may be fatal the boat must be made to cut the breakers endon so as to prevent her turning broadside on and being rolled back on the beach  even after these initial strokes have been made successfully there still remains the possibility of an unusually monstrous wave hurling the boat back end over end  the boat resting on its carriage on the sands figure 1 shows the relative position of the two  it will be seen from that position that a very slight tip will suffice to cause the bow of the boat to drop towards the sea  as its keel rests on rollers comparatively little force is required to launch it  such force is applied by means of ropes attached to the stern passing through pulleys at the outer end of the carriage so that people on shore haul the ropes inland in order to force the boat off its carriage seaward  once the boat has got fairly over the surf and out upon the wild sea her progress is comparatively safe simple tugging against wind and sea being all that has to be done until the wreck is reached where dangers of another kind await her  i have now shown that the great qualities of our lifeboat arebuoyancy or a tendency not to sink selfrighting power or inability to remain upside down selfemptying power or a capacity to discharge any water that may get into it and stability or a tendency not to upset  the last quality i shall refer to though by no means the least is strength  from what has been already written about lifeboats being hurled against wrecks and rocks it must be evident that the strength of ordinary boats would not suffice  in order to give them the requisite strength of frame for their tremendous warfare they are built of the best honduras mahogany on what is known as the diagonal planthat is the boat has two distinct skins of planking one set of planks being laid on in a diagonal position to the others  moreover these planks run from one gunwale round under the boat to the other gunwale and have a complete layer of prepared canvas between them  thus great strength and elasticity are combined so that the boat can stand an inconceivable amount of battering on wreckage rocks or sand without being destroyed  that this is really so i will endeavour to prove by referring in the next chapter to a particular instance in which the great strength of one of our lifeboats was powerfully illustrated  it may be added in conclusion that the oars of a lifeboat are short and so made as to combine the greatest possible strength with lightness they are fastened to the gunwale by short pieces of rope and work in a moveable iron crutch on an iron tholepin  each boat is provided with a set of spare oars  her equipment of compass cables grapnels anchors etcetera is as may be supposed very complete and she rides upon the storm in a rather gay dress of red white and blue in order that she may be readily distinguished from other boatsher lower parts being white her upper sides blue and her line of fender all round being scarlet    chapter five  more tales of heroism  if any one should doubt the fact that a lifeboat is all but indestructible let that sceptical one read the following tale of wreck and rescue  on a terrible night in the year 1857 a portuguese brig struck on the goodwin sands not far from the lightship that marks the northern extremity of those fatal shoals  a shot was fired and a rocket sent up by the lightship  no second signal was needed  the ramsgate men were as usual keeping a bright lookout  instantly they jumped into the lifeboat which lay calmly floating in the harbour alongside the pier so eager were the men to engage in the deadly struggle that the boat was overmanned and the last two who jumped in were obliged to go ashore again  the tug aid was all readyaccording to customwith steam up  she took the boat in tow and made for the mouth of the harbour  staggering out in the teeth of tide and tempest they ploughed their way through a heavy cross sea that swept again and again over them until they reached the edge of the goodwins  here the steamer cast off the boat and waited for her while she dashed into the surf and bore the brunt of the battle alone  it was a familiar proceeding to all concerned  many a time before had the ramsgate boat and steamer rescued men and women and little ones from the jaws of death on the goodwins but they were about to experience a few novelties that night  it was very dark so that the boat had much difficulty in finding the brig  on coming within about eighty yards of her they cast anchor and veered down under her lee  at first they were in hopes of getting the vessel off and some hours were spent in vain attempts to do this but the gale increased in fury the brig began to break up  she rolled from side to side and the yards swung wildly in the air  a blow from one of these yards would have stove the boat in so the portuguese crewtwelve men and a boywere taken from the wreck and the lifeboatmen endeavoured to push off  all this time the boat had been floating in a basin worked in the sand by the motion of the wreck but the tide had been falling and when they tried to pull up to their anchor the boat struck heavily on the edge of this basin  they worked to get off the shoals with the energy of men who believe that their lives depend on their efforts  for a moment they succeeded in getting afloat but again struck and remained fast  meanwhile the brig was lifted by each wave that came rushing over the shoals like a mountain chain of snow and let fall with a thundering crash  her timbers began to snap like pipestems and as she worked nearer and nearer to the boat the wildlyswaying yards threatened immediate destruction  the heavy seas flew continually over the lifeboat so that passengers and crew could do nothing but hold on to the thwarts for their lives  at last the brig came so near that there was a stir among the men they were preparing for the last struggle some of them intending to leap into the rigging of the wreck and take their chance  but the coxswain shouted stick to the boat boys stick to the boat and the men obeyed  at that moment the boat lifted a little on the surf and grounded again new hope was inspired by this  they pulled at the cable and shoved might and main with the oars  they succeeded in getting out of immediate danger but still could not pull up to their anchor in the teeth of wind and tide  the coxswain then saw plainly that there was but one resource leftto cut the cable and drive away to leeward right across the goodwin sands which at that place were two miles wide  but there was not yet sufficient water on the sands even for the attempting of that forlorn hope  as far as could be seen in that direction ay and far beyond the power of vision there was nothing but a chaos of wild tumultuous whirling foam without sufficient depth to float them over so they held on intending to wait till the tide which had turned should rise  very soon however the anchor began to drag this compelled them to hoist sail cut the cable sooner than they had intended and attempt to beat to windwardoff the sands  it was in vain  a moment more and they struck with tremendous force  a breaker came rolling towards them filled the boat caught her up like a plaything on its crest and hurling her a few yards onwards let her fall with a shock that wellnigh tore every man out of her  each successive breaker treated her in this way  those who dwell by the seashore know well those familiar ripples that mark the sands when the tide is out  on the goodwins those ripples are gigantic banks to be measured by feet not by inches  i can speak from personal experience having once visited the goodwins and walked among the sandbanks at low water  from one to another of these banks this splendid boat was thrown  each roaring surf caught it by the bow or stern and whirling it right round sent it crashing on the next ledge the portuguese sailors gave up all hope and clung to the thwarts in silent despair but the crew did not lose heart altogether  they knew the boat well had often gone out to battle in her and hoped that they might yet be saved if they could only escape striking on the pieces of old wreck with which the sands were strewn  thus literally yard by yard with a succession of shocks that would have knocked any ordinary boat to pieces did that lifeboat drive during two hours over two miles of the goodwin sands  a thrilling and graphic account of this wreck and rescue is given in the reverend john gilmores book storm warriors in which he tells us that while this exciting work was going on the aid lay head to wind steaming half power and holding her own against the storm waiting for her lifeboat but no lifeboat returned to her and her gallant captain became more and more anxious as time flew by  could it be possible that her sturdy little comrade with whom she had gone out to battle in hundreds of gales was overcome at last and destroyed  they signalled again and again but got no reply  then as their fears increased they began to cruise about as near to the dangerous shoals as they dared almost playing with deathas they eagerly sought for their consort  at last the conviction was forced upon them that the boat must have been stove by the wreck and swamped  in the midst of their gathering despair they caught sight of the lightships bright beam shining like a star of hope through the surrounding darkness  with a faint hope they made for the vessel and hailed her  have you seen anything of the lifeboat was the eager question  nothing nothing was the sad reply  back they went again to the place they had left determined to cruise on hoping against hope till the night should pass away  hour after hour they steamed hither and thither with anxiously straining eyes  at last grey dawn appeared and the wreck became dimly visible  they made for it and their worst fears were realisedthe remnant of the brigs hull was there with ropes and wreckage tossing wildly round itbut no lifeboat  sadly they turned away and continued to search for some time in the faint hope that some of her crew might be floating about buoyed up by their lifebelts but none were found and at last they reluctantly made for the harbour  and when the harbour was gained what saw they there  the lifeboat safe and sound floating as calmly beside the pier as if nothing had happened  as the captain of the aid himself said he felt inclined at once to shout and cry for wonder and we may be sure that his wonder was not decreased when he heard the lifeboats story from the brave coxswains lipshow that after driving right across the sands as i have described they suddenly found themselves in deep water  that then knowing the extremity of danger to be past they had set the sails and soon after had through gods mercy landed the rescued portuguese crew in ramsgate harbour  it must not be imagined however that such work as this can be done without great cost to those who undertake it  some of the men never recovered from the effects of that nights exposure  the gratitude of the portuguese seamen was very great as well as their amazement at such a rescue  it is recorded of them that before arriving in the harbour they were observed to be in consultation together and that one who understood a little english spoke to one of the crew in an undertone  coxswain said the lifeboat man they want to give us all their money  yes yes cried the portuguese interpreter in broken english you have saved our lives  thank you thank you but all we have is yours it is not much but you may take it between you  the amount was seventeen pounds  as might have been expected neither the coxswain nor his men would accept a penny of it  this coxswain was isaac jarman who for many years led the famous ramsgate lifeboat into action and helped to save hundreds of human lives  while staying at ramsgate i had the pleasure of shaking the strong hard hand of jarman and heard some of his adventures from his own lips  now from all that has been said it will i think be seen and admitted that the lifeboats of the institution are almost indestructible  the lifebelt to which reference has been so often made deserves special notice at this point  the figure on the titlepage shows its appearance and the manner in which it is worn  it was designed in 1854 by admiral jr ward the institutions chief inspector of lifeboats its chief quality is its great buoyancy which is not only sufficient to support a man with head and shoulders above water when heavily clothed but enables the wearer easily to support another personthe extra buoyancy being 25 pounds  besides possessing several great advantages over other lifebelts that of admiral ward is divided in the middle by a space where the waistbelt is fastened  this permits of great freedom of action and the whole machine is remarkably flexible  it is also very strong forming a species of armour which protects the wearer from severe blows and moreover helps to keep him warm  it behoves me now to say a few words about the inventor of lifeboats as has been told our present splendid boat is a combination of all the good points and improvements made in such boats down to the present time  but the man who first thought of a lifeboat and invented one who fought against apathy and opposition who completed and launched his ark of mercy on the sea at bamborough in the shape of a little coble in the year 1785 and who actually saved many lives therewith was a london coachbuilder lionel lukin by name  assuredly this man deserved the deepest gratitude of the nation for his was the first lifeboat ever brought into action and he inserted the small end of that wedge which we have been hammering home ever since and which has resulted in the formation of one of the grandest most thoroughly national and unsectarian of our charitable institutions  henry greatheada boatbuilder of south shieldserroneously got the credit of this invention  greathead was a noted improver and builder of lifeboats and was well and deservedly rewarded for his work but he was not the inventor  lionel lukin alone can claim that honour  in regard to the men who man them enough has been written to prove that they well deserve to be regarded as the heroes of the coast  and let me observe in passing that there are also heroines of the coast as the following extract from the journal of the institution will show  it appeared in the january number of 1865  voted the silver medal of the institution and a copy of its vote of thanks on parchment to miss alice r le geyt in admiration of her prompt and courageous conduct in rowing a small boat into the surf at the risk of her life and rescuing two little boys who had fallen into the sea from the outer pier at lyme regis dorset on the 4th august  again in october 1879 the committee of the national lifeboat institution voted the silver medal of the institution and a copy of the vote inscribed on vellum to miss ellen francis prideaux brune miss gertrude rose prideaux brune miss mary katherine prideaux brune miss beatrice may prideaux brune and miss nora oshaughnessy in acknowledgment of their intrepid and prompt services in proceeding through a heavy surf in their rowingboat and saving at considerable risk of life a sailor from a boat which had been capsized by a squall of wind off bray hill padstow harbour cornwall on the 9th august when the accident occurred the ladies boat was being towed astern of a fishingboat and miss ellen prideaux brune with great gallantry and determination asked to be cast off and with her companions she proceeded with all possible despatch to the rescue of the drowning sailor  all the ladies showed great courage presence of mind and marked ability in the management of their small boat  they ran great risk in getting the man into it on account of the strong tide and sea on at the time  so it would appear that the spirit of the farfamed grace darling has not yet departed from the land  if heroism consists in boldly facing and successfully overcoming dangers of the most appalling nature then i hold that thousands of our men of the coastfrom shetland to the lands endstand as high as do those among our soldiers and sailors who wear the victoria cross  let us consider an example  on that night in which the royal charter went down there was a maltese sailor on board named joseph rodgers who volunteered to swim ashore with a rope  those who have seen the effect of a raging sea even on a smooth beach know that the power of the falling waves is terrible and their retreating force so great that the most powerful swimmers occasionally perish in them  but the coast to which rodgers volunteered to swim was an almost perpendicular cliff  i write as an eyewitness reader for i saw the cliff myself a few days after the wreck took place when i went down to that dreary coast of anglesea to identify the bodies of lost kindred  ay and at that time i also saw something of the awful aspect of loss by shipwreck  i went into the little church at llanalgo where upwards of thirty bodies lay upon the floorstill in their wet garments just as they had been laid down by those who had brought them from the shore  as i entered that church one body lay directly in my path  it was that of a young sailor  strange to say his cheeks were still ruddy as though he had been alive and his lips were tightly compressedi could not help fancyingwith the force of the last strong effort he had made to keep out the deadly sea  just beyond him lay a woman and beside her a little child in their ordinary walkingdresses as if they had lain down there and fallen asleep side by side  i had to step across these silent forms as they lay some in the full light of the windows others in darkened corners of the little church and to gaze earnestly into their dead faces for the lineaments of those whom i had gone to find but i did not find them there  their bodies were washed ashore some days afterwards  a few of those who lay on that floor were covered to hide the mutilation they had received when being driven on the cruel rocks  altogether it was an awful sightwell fitted to draw forth the prayer god help and bless those daring men who are willing to risk their lives at any moment all the year round to save men and women and little ones from such a fate as this  but to return to joseph rodgers  the cliff to which he volunteered to swim was thundered on by seas raised by one of the fiercest gales that ever visited our shores  it was dark too and broken spars and pieces of wreck tossing about increased the danger while the water was cold enough to chill the lifeblood in the stoutest frame  no one knew better than rodgers the extreme danger of the attempt yet he plunged into the sea with a rope round his waist  had his motive been selfpreservation he could have gained the shore more easily without a rope but his motive was not selfishit was truly generous  he reached the land hauled a cable ashore made it fast to a rock and began to rescue the crew and i have no doubt that every soul in that vessel would have been saved if she had not suddenly split across and sunk four hundred and fiftyfive lives were lost but before the catastrophe took place thirtynine lives were saved by the heroism of that maltese sailor  the lifeboat institution awarded its gold medal with its vote of thanks inscribed on vellum and 5 pounds to rodgers in acknowledgment of his noble conduct  all round the kingdom the men are as a rule eager to man our lifeboats  usually there is a rush to the work and as the men get only ten shillings per man in the daytime and twenty shillings at night on each occasion of going off it can scarcely be supposed that they do it only for the sake of the pay  true those payments are increased on occasions of unusual risk or exposure nevertheless i believe that a worthier motive animates our men of the coast  i do not say or think that religious feeling is the cause of their heroism with some doubtless it is with others it probably is not but i sincerely believe that the word of godpermeating as it does our whole community and influencing these men either directly or indirectlyis the cause of their selfsacrificing courage as it is unquestionably the cause of our national prosperity    chapter six  supplies a few points for consideration  i have now somewhat to say about the royal national lifeboat institution which has the entire management and control of our fleet of 273 lifeboats  that institution has had a glorious history  it was founded by sir william hillary baroneta man who deserves a monument in westminster abbey i think for besides originating the lifeboat institution he saved and assisted in saving 305 lives with his own hands  born in 1824 the institution has been the means of saving no fewer than 29608 lives up to the end of 1882  at its birth the archbishop of canterbury presided the great wilberforce lord john russell and other magnates were present the dukes of kent sussex and other members of the royal family became vicepatrons the earl of liverpool its president and george the fourth its patron  in 1850 good prince albert became its vicepatron and her majesty the queen became and still continues a warm supporter and annual contributor  this is a splendid array of names and titles but let me urge the reader never to forget that this noble institution depends on the public for the adequate discharge of its grand work for it is supported almost entirely by voluntary contributions  the sole object of the institution is to provide and maintain boats that shall save the lives of shipwrecked persons and to reward those who save lives whether by means of its own or other boats  the grandeur of its aim and singleness of its purpose are among its great recommendations  when however life does not require to be saved and when opportunity offers it allows its boats to save property  it savesand rewards those who assist in savingmany hundreds of lives every year  last year 1882 the number saved by lifeboats was 741 besides 143 lives saved by shoreboats and other means for which rewards were given by the institution making a grand total of 884 lives saved in that one year  the number each year is often larger seldom less  one year 1869 the rescued lives amounted to the grand number of 1231 and in the greater number of cases the rescues were effected in circumstances in which ordinary boats would have been utterly useless worse than useless for they would have drowned their crews  in respect of this matter the value of the lifeboat to the nation cannot be estimatedat least not until we invent some sort of spiritual arithmetic whereby we may calculate the price of widows and orphans tears and of broken hearts  but in regard to more material things it is possible to speak definitely  it frequently happens in stormy weather that vessels show signals of distress either because they are so badly strained as to be in a sinking condition or so damaged that they are unmanageable or the crews have become so exhausted as to be no longer capable of working for their own preservation  in all such cases the lifeboat puts off with the intention in the first instance of saving life  it reaches the vessel in distress some of the boats crew spring on board and find perhaps that there is some hope of saving the ship  knowing the locality well they steer her clear of rocks and shoals  being comparatively fresh and vigorous they work the pumps with a will manage to keep her afloat and finally steer her into port thus saving ship and cargo as well as crew  now let me impress on you that incidents of this sort are not of rare occurrence  there is no play of fancy in my statements they happen every year  last year 1882 twentythree vessels were thus saved by lifeboat crews  another year thirtythree another year fiftythree ships were thus saved  as surely and regularly as the year comes round so surely and regularly are ships and property saved by lifeboatssaved to the nation  it cannot be too forcibly pointed out that a wrecked ship is not only an individual but a national loss  insurance protects the individual but insurance cannot in the nature of things protect the nation  if you drop a thousand sovereigns in the street that is a loss to you but not to the nation some lucky individual will find the money and circulate it  but if you drop it into the sea it is lost not only to you but to the nation indeed to the world itself for ever of course taking for granted that our amphibious divers dont fish it up again  well let us gauge the value of our lifeboats in this light  if a lifeboat saves a ship worth ten or twenty thousand sovereigns from destruction it presents that sum literally as a free gift to owners and nation  a free gift i repeat because lifeboats are provided solely to save lifenot property  saving the latter is therefore extraneous service  of course it would be too much to expect our gallant boatmen to volunteer to work the lifeboats in the worst of weather at the imminent risk of their lives unless they were also allowed an occasional chance of earning salvage  accordingly when they save a ship worth say 20000 pounds they are entitled to put in a claim on the owners for 200 pounds salvage  this sum would be divided after deducting all expenses such as payments to helpers hire of horses etcetera between the men and the boat  thusdeduct say 20 pounds expenses leaves 180 pounds to divide into fifteen shares the crew numbering thirteen men   13 shares to men at 12 pounds each156 pounds  2 shares to boat                  24 pounds   total                             180 pounds   let us now consider the value of loaded ships  not very long ago a large spanish ship was saved by one of our lifeboats  she had grounded on a bank off the south coast of ireland the captain and crew forsook her and escaped to land in their boats one man however was inadvertently left on board  soon after the wind shifted the ship slipped off the bank into deep water and drifted to the northward  her doom appeared to be fixed but the crew of the cahore lifeboat observed her launched their boat and after a long pull against wind and sea boarded the ship and found her with seven feet of water in the hold  the duty of the boats crew was to save the spanish sailor but they did more they worked the pumps and trimmed the sails and saved the ship as well and handed her over to an agent for the owners  this vessel and cargo was valued at 20000 pounds  now observe in passing that this cahore lifeboat not only did much good but received considerable and wellmerited benefit each man receiving 34 pounds from the grateful owners who also presented 68 pounds to the institution in consideration of the risk of damage incurred to their boat  no doubt it may be objected that this being a foreign ship was not saved to our nation but as the proverb says it is not lost what a friend gets and i think it is very satisfactory to reflect that we presented the handsome sum of 20000 pounds to spain as a free gift on that occasion  this was a saved ship  let us look now at a lost one  some years ago a ship named the golden age was lost  it was well named though illfated for the value of that ship and cargo was 200000 pounds  the cost of a lifeboat with equipment and transporting carriage complete is about 650 pounds and there are 273 lifeboats at present on the shores of the united kingdom  here is material for a calculation  if that single ship had been among the twentyseven saved last year and it might have been the sum thus rescued from the sea would have been sufficient to pay for all the lifeboats in the kingdom and leave 22550 pounds in hand  but it was not among the saved  it was losta dead loss to great britain  so was the ontario of liverpool wrecked in october 1864 and valued at 100000 pounds  also the assage wrecked on the irish coast and valued at 200000 pounds  here are five hundred thousand poundshalf a million of moneylost by the wreck of these three ships alone  of course these three are selected as specimens of the most valuable vessels lost among the two thousand wrecks that take place each year on our coasts they vary from a firstrate mail steamer to a coal coffin but set them down at any figure you please and it will still remain true that it would be worth our while to keep up our lifeboat fleet for the mere chance of saving such valuable property  but after all is said that can be said on this point the subject sinks into insignificance when contrasted with the lifeboats true workthe saving of human lives  there is yet another and still higher sense in which the lifeboat is of immense value to the nation  i refer to the moral influence it exercises among us  if many hundreds of lives are annually saved by our lifeboat fleet does it not follow as a necessary consequence that happiness and gratitude must affect thousands of hearts in a way that cannot fail to redound to the glory of god as well as the good of man let facts answer this question  we cannot of course intrude on the privacy of human hearts and tell what goes on there but there are a few outward symptoms that are generally accepted as pretty fair tests of spiritual condition  one of these is parting with money  looking at the matter in this light the records of the institution show that thousands of men women and children are beneficially influenced by the lifeboat cause  the highest contributor to its funds in the land is our queen the lowliest a sailors orphan child  here are a few of the gifts to the institution culled almost at random from the reports  one gentleman leaves it a legacy of 10000 pounds  some time ago a sum of 5000 pounds was sent anonymously by a friend  a hundred pounds comes in as a second donation from a sailors daughter  fifty pounds come from a british admiral and five shillings from the savings of a child oneandsixpence is sent by another child in postagestamps and 1 pound 5 shillings as the collection of a sunday school in manchester 15 pounds from three fellowservants 10 pounds from a shipwrecked pilot and 10 shillings 6 pence from an old salt  i myself had once the pleasure of receiving twopence for the lifeboat cause from an exceedingly poor but enthusiastic old woman  but my most interesting experience in this way was the receipt of a note written by a blind boywell and legibly written tootelling me that he had raised the sum of 100 pounds for the lifeboat institution  and this beneficial influence of our lifeboat service travels far beyond our own shores  here is evidence of that  finland sends 50 pounds to our institution to testify its appreciation of the good done by us to its sailors  president lincoln of the united states when involved in all the anxieties of the great war between north and south found time to send 100 pounds to the institution in acknowledgment of services rendered to american ships in distress  russia and holland send naval men to inspectnot our armaments and materiel of hateful war but our lifeboat management  france in generous emulation starts a lifeboat institution of its own and sends over to ask our society to supply it with boatsand last but not least it has been said that foreigners driven far out of their course and stranded soon come to know that they have been wrecked on the british coast by the persevering efforts that are made to save their lives  and now good reader let me urge this subject on your earnest consideration  surely every one should be ready to lend a hand to rescue the perishing  one would think it almost superfluous to say more  so it would be if there were none who required the line of duty and privilege to be pointed out to them  but i fear that many especially dwellers in the interior of our land are not sufficiently alive to the claims that the lifeboat has upon them  let me illustrate this by a case or twoimaginary cases i admit but none the less illustrative on that account  mother says a little boy with flashing eyes and curly flaxen hair i want to go to sea  he has been reading cooks voyages and robinson crusoe and looks wistfully out upon the small pond in front of his home which is the biggest bit of water his eyes have ever seen for he dwells among the cornfields and pastures of the interior of the land  dont think of it darling willie  you might get wreckedperhaps drowned  but darling willie does think of it and asserts that being wrecked is the very thing he wants and that hes willing to take his chance of being drowned  and willie goes on thinking of it year after year until he gains his point and becomes the familys sailor boy and mayhap for the first time in her life willies mother casts more than a passing glance at newspaper records of lifeboat work  but she does no more  she has not yet been awakened  the people of the coast naturally look after the things of the coast has been her sentiment on the subjectif she has had any definite sentiments about it at all  on returning from his first voyage willies ship is wrecked  on a horrible night in the howling tempest with his flaxen curls tossed about his hands convulsively clutching the shrouds of the topmast and the hissing billows leaping up as if they wished to lick him off his refuge on the crosstrees willie awakens to the dread reality about which he had dreamed when reading cook and crusoe  next morning a lady with livid face and eyes glaring at a newspaper gasps willies shipiswrecked five lostthirteen saved by the lifeboat  one faint gleam of hope  willie may be among the thirteen  minutes that seem hours of agony ensue then a telegram arrives saved mother thank godby the lifeboat  ay thank god echoes willies mother with the profoundest emotion and sincerity she ever felt but think you reader that she did no more  did she pass languidly over the records of lifeboat work after that day  did she leave the management and support of lifeboats to the people of the coast  i trow not  but what difference had the saving of willie made in the lifeboat cause  was hers the only willie in the wide world  are we to act on so selfish a principle as that we shall decline to take an interest in an admittedly grand and good and national cause until our eyes are forcibly opened by our willie being in danger  of course i address myself to people who have really kind and sympathetic hearts but who from one cause or another have not yet had this subject earnestly submitted to their consideration  to those who have no heart to consider the woes and necessities of suffering humanity i have nothing whatever to sayexceptgod help them  let me enforce this pleathat inland cities and towns and villages should support the lifeboat institutionwith another imaginary case  a tremendous gale is blowing from the southeast sleet driving like needlesenough almost to put your eyes out  a good ship under closereefed topsails is bearing up for port after a prosperous voyage but the air is so thick with drift that they cannot make out the guiding lights  she strikes and sticks fast on outlying sands where the sea is roaring and leaping like a thousand fiends in the wintry blast  there are passengers on board from the antipodes with boxes and bags of golddust the result of years of toil at the diggings  they do not realise the full significance of the catastrophe  no wonderthey are landsmen  the tide chances to be low at the time as it rises they awake to the dread reality  billows burst over them like miniature niagaras  the good ship which has for many weeks breasted the waves so gallantly and seemed so solid and so strong is treated like a cork and becomes apparently an eggshell  night comesdarkness increasing the awful aspect of the situation tenfold  what are boxes and bags of golddust nownow that wild despair has seized them all excepting those who through gods grace have learned to fear no evil  suddenly through darkness spray and hurlyburly thick a ghostly boat is seen  the lifeboat  well do the seamen know its form  a cheer arouses sinking hearts and hope once more revives  the work of rescuing is vigorously violently almost fiercely begun  the merest child might see that the motto of the lifeboatmen is victory or death  but it cannot be done as quickly as they desire the rolling of the wreck the mad plunging and sheering of the boat prevent that  a sturdy middleaged man named browna common name frequently associated with common senseis having a rope fastened round his waist by one of the lifeboat crew named jonesalso a common name not seldom associated with uncommon courage  but brown must wait a few minutes while his wife is being lowered into the boat  oh be careful  do it gently theres a good fellow roars brown in terrible anxiety as he sees her swung off  never fear sir shes all right says jones with a quiet reassuring smile for jones is a tough old hand accustomed to such scenes  mrs brown misses the boat and dips into the raging sea  gone gasps brown struggling to free himself from jones and leap after her but the grasp of jones is too much for him  hold on sir shes all right sir bless you theyll have her on board in a minute  ive got bags boxes bucketfuls of gold in the hold roars brown only save her and its all yours  the shrieking blast will not allow even his strong voice to reach the men in the lifeboat but they need no such inducement to work  the gold wont be yours long remarks jones with another smile neptunell have it all tonight  see theyve got her into the boat all right sir  now dont struggle so youll get down to her in a minute theres another lady to go before your turn comes  during these few moments of forced inaction the selfpossessed jones remarks to brown in order to quiet him that theyll be all saved in half an hour and asks if he lives near that part of the coast  live near it gasps brown  no  i live nowhere  bin five years at the diggings  made a fortune  going to live with the old folk nowat blunderton far away from the sea high up among the mountains  hm grunts jones  do they help to float the lifeboats at blunderton  the lifeboats  no of course not never think of lifeboats up there  some of you think of em down here though remarks jones  do you help the cause in any way sir  me  no  never gave a shilling to it  well never mind  its your turn now sir  come along  well save you  jump cries jones  and they do save him and all on board of that illfated ship with as much heartfelt satisfaction as if the rescued ones had each been a contributor of a thousand a year to the lifeboat cause  dont forget us sir when you gits home whispers jones to brown at parting  and does brown forget him  nay verily  he goes home to blunderton stirs up the people hires the townhall gets the chief magistrate to take the chair and forms a branch of the royal national lifeboat institutionthe blunderton branch which ever afterwards honourably bears its annual share in the expense and in the privilege of rescuing men women and little ones from the raging seas  moreover brown becomes the enthusiastic secretary of the branch  and here let me remark that no society of this nature can hope to succeed unless its secretary be an enthusiast  now reader if you think i have made out a good case let me entreat you to go with brown in your eye and do likewise  and dont fancy that i am advising you to attempt the impossible  the supposed blunderton case is founded on fact  during a lecturing tour one mansomewhat enthusiastic in the lifeboat causepreached the propriety of inland towns starting branches of the lifeboat institution upwards of half a dozen such towns responded to the exhortation and from that date have continued to be annual contributors and sympathisers    chapter seven  the lifesaving rocket  we shall now turn from the lifeboat to our other great engine of war with which we do battle with the sea from year to year namely the rocket apparatus  this engine however is in the hands of government and is managed by the coastguard  and it may be remarked here in reference to coastguard men that they render constant and effective aid in the saving of shipwrecked crews  at least onethird of the medals awarded by the lifeboat institution go to the men of the coastguard  every one has heard of captain manbys mortar  its object is to effect communication between a stranded ship and the shore by means of a rope attached to a shot which is fired over the former  the same end is now more easily attained by a rocket with a light rope or line attached to it  now the rocket apparatus is a little complicated and ignorance in regard to the manner of using it has been the cause of some loss of life  many people think that if a rope can only be conveyed from a stranded ship to the shore the saving of the crew is comparatively a sure and easy matter  this is a mistake  if a ropea stout cable were fixed between a wreck and the shore say at a distance of three or four hundred yards it is obvious that only a few of the strongest men could clamber along it  even these if benumbed and exhaustedas is frequently the case in shipwreckcould not accomplish the feat  but let us suppose still further that the vessel rolls from side to side dipping the rope in the sea and jerking it out again at each roll what man could make the attempt with much hope of success and what in such circumstances would become of women and children  more than one rope must be fixed between ship and shore if the work of saving life is to be done efficiently  accordingly in the rocket apparatus there are four distinct portions of tackle  first the rocketline second the whip third the hawser and fourth the lifebuoysometimes called the slinglifebuoy and sometimes the breechesbuoy  the rocketline is that which is first thrown over the wreck by the rocket  it is small and light and of considerable lengththe extreme distance to which a rocket may carry it in the teeth of a gale being between three and four hundred yards  the whip is a thicker line rove through a block or pulley and having its two ends spliced together without a knot in such a manner that the join does not check the running of the rope through the pulley  thus the whip becomes a double linea sort of continuous rope or as it is called an endless fall by means of which the lifebuoy is passed to and fro between the wreck and shore  the hawser is a thick rope or cable to which the lifebuoy is suspended when in action  the lifebuoy is one of those circular lifebuoyswith which most of us are familiarwhich hang at the sides of steamers and other vessels to be ready in case of any one falling overboard  it has however the addition of a pair of huge canvas breeches attached to it to prevent those who are being rescued from slipping through  let us suppose now that a wreck is on the shore at a part where the coast is rugged and steep the beach very narrow and the water so deep that it has been driven on the rocks not more than a couple of hundred yards from the cliffs  the beach is so rocky that no lifeboat would dare to approach or if she did venture she would be speedily dashed to piecesfor a lifeboat is not absolutely invulnerable  the coastguardsmen are on the alert  they had followed the vessel with anxious looks for hours that day as she struggled right gallantly to weather the headland and make the harbour  when they saw her miss stays on the last tack and drift shoreward they knew her doom was fixed hurried off for the rocketcart ran it down to the narrow strip of pebbly beach below the cliffs and now they are fixing up the shore part of the apparatus  the chief part of this consists of the rocketstand and the box in which the line is coiled in a peculiar and scarcely describable manner that permits of its flying out with great freedom  while thus engaged they hear the crashing of the vessels timbers as the great waves hurl or grind her against the hungry rocks  they also hear the cries of agonised men and women rising even above the howling storm and hasten their operations  at last all is ready  the rocket a large one made of iron is placed in its stand a stick and the line are attached to it a careful aim is taken and fire applied  amid a blaze and burst of smoke the rocket leaps from its position and rushes out to sea with a furious persistency that even the stormfiend himself is powerless to arrest but he can baffle it to some extentsufficient allowance has not been made for the force and direction of the wind  the rocket flies indeed beyond the wreck but drops into the sea a little to the left of her  anotherlook alive is the sharp order  again the fiery messenger of mercy leaps forth and this time with success  the line drops over the wreck and catches in the rigging  and at this point comes into play sometimes that ignorance to which i have referredculpable ignorance for surely every captain who sails upon the sea ought to have intimate acquaintance with the details of the lifesaving apparatus of every nation  yet so it is that some crews after receiving the rocketline have not known what to do with it and have even perished with the means of deliverance in their grasp  in one case several men of a crew tied themselves together with the end of the line and leaped into the sea  they were indeed hauled ashore but i believe that most if not all of them were drowned  those whom we are now rescuing however are gifted let us suppose with a small share of common sense  having got hold of the line one of the crew separated from the rest signals the fact to the shore by waving a hat handkerchief or flag if it be day  at night a light is shown over the ships side for a short time and then concealed  this being done those on shore make the end of the line fast to the whip with its tailedblock and signal to haul off the line  when the whip is got on board a tally or piece of wood is seen with white letters on a black ground painted on it  on one side the words are englishon the other french  one of the crew reads eagerly  make the tail of the block fast to the lower mast well up  if masts are gone then to the best place you can find  cast off the rocketline see that the rope in the block runs free and show signal to the shore  most important cautions these for if the tailblock be fastened too low on the wreck the ropes will dip in the water and perhaps foul the rocks  if the whip does not run free in the block it will jamb and the work will be stopped and if the signals are not attended to the coastguardsmen may begin to act too soon or on the other hand waste precious time  but the signals are rightly given the other points attended to and the remainder of the work is done chiefly from the shore  the men there attach the hawser to the whip and by hauling one side thereof in they run the other side and the hawser out  on receiving the hawser the crew discover another tally attached to it and read  make this hawser fast about two feet above the tailblock  see all clear and that the rope in the block runs free and show signal to the shore  the wrecked crew are quick as well as intelligent  life depends on it they fasten the end of the hawser as directed about two feet above the place where the tailblock is fixed to the stump of the mast  there is much shouting and gratuitous advice no doubt from the forward and the excited but the captain and mate are cool  they attend to duty and pay no regard to any one  signal is again made to the shore and the men of the coastguard at once set up a triangle with a pendent block through which the shoreend of the hawser is rove and attached to a doubleblock tackle  previously however a block called a traveller has been run on to the hawser this block travels on and above the hawser and from it is suspended the lifebuoy  to the traveller block the whip is attached then the order is given to the men to haul and away goes the lifebuoy to the wreck run out by the men on shore  when it arrives at the wreck the order is women first  but the women are too terrified it may be to venture  can you wonder  if you saw the boiling surf the heaving water the roaring and rushing waves with black and jagged rocks showing here and there over which and partly through which they are to be dragged you would respect their fears they shrink back they even resist  so the captain orders a prentice boy to jump in and set them the example  he is a fine handsome boy with curly brown hair and bright black eyes  he too hesitates for a moment but from a far different motive  if left to himself he would emulate the captain in being that proverbial last man to quit the wreck but a peremptory order is given and with a blush he jumps into the bag or breeches of the buoy through which his legs project in a somewhat ridiculous manner  a signal is then made to the shore the coastguardsmen haul on the whip and off goes our prentice boy like a seagull  his flight is pretty rapid considering all things  when about halfway to land he is seen dimly in the mist of spray that bursts wildly around and over him  those on the wreck strain their eyes and watch with palpitating hearts  the ship has been rolling a little just then it gives a heavy lurch shoreward the rope slackens and down goes our prentice boy into the raging sea which seems to roar louder as if in triumph  it is but for a moment however  the doubleblock tackle already mentioned as being attached to the shoreend of the hawser is manned by strong active fellows whose duty it is to ease off the rope when the wreck rolls seaward and haul it in when she rolls shoreward thus keeping it always pretty taut without the risk of snapping it  a moment more and the prentice is seen to emerge from the surf like a true son of neptune he is seen also like a true son of britain to wave one hand above his head and faintly through driving surf and howling gale comes a cheer  it is still more faintly replied to by those on the wreck for in his progress the boy is hidden for a few seconds by the leaping spray but in a few seconds more he is seen struggling among the breakers on the beach  several strong men are seen to join hands and advance to meet him  another moment and he is safe on shore and a fervent thank god bursts from the wrecked crew who seem to forget themselves for a moment as they observe the waving handkerchiefs and hats which tell that a hearty cheer has greeted the rescued sailor boy  there is little tendency now to hesitation on the part of the women and what remains is put to flight by certain ominous groans and creakings that tell of the approaching dissolution of the ship  one after another they are lifted tenderly into the lifebuoy and drawn to land in safety amid the congratulations and thanksgivings of many of those who have assembled to witness their deliverance  it is truly terrible work this dragging of tender women through surf and thundering waves but it is a matter of life or death and even the most delicate of human beings become regardless of small matters in such circumstances  but the crew have yet to be saved and there are still two women on boardone of them with a baby  the mothera thin delicate woman positively refuses to go without her babe  the captain knows full well that if he lets her take it the child will be torn from her grasp to a certainty he therefore adopts a seemingly harsh but really merciful course  he assists her into the buoy takes a quick turn of a rope round her to keep her in snatches the child from her arms and gives the signal to haul away  with a terrible cry the mother holds out her arms as she is dragged from the bulwarks then struggles to leap out but in vain  another wild shriek with the arms tossed upwards and she falls back as if in a fit  poor thing mutters the captain as he gazes pitifully at the retreating figure but youll soon be happy again  come dick get ready to go wi the child next trip  dick shales is a huge hairy seaman with the frame of an elephant the skin of a walrus and the tender heart of a woman  he glances uneasily round  theres another lady yet sir  you obey orders says the captain sternly  i never disobeyed orders yet sir and i wont do it now says dick taking the baby into his strong arms and buttoning it up tenderly in his capacious bosom  as he speaks the lifebuoy arrives again with a jovial sort of swing as if it had been actually warmed into life by its glorious work and had come out of its own accord  now then lads hold on steady says dick getting in for fear you hurt the babby  this is the first time that dick shales has appeared on any stage wotsomediver in the character of a woman  dick smiles in a deprecating manner at his little joke as they haul him off the wreck  but dick is wrong and his mates feel this as they cheer him for many a time before that had he appeared in womans character when womans work had to be done  the captain was right when he muttered that the mother would be soon happy again  when dick placed the babywet indeed but wellin its mothers arms she knew a kind of joy to which she had been a stranger beforeakin to that joy which must have swelled the grateful heart of the widow of nain when she received her son back from the dead  the rest of the work is soon completed  after the last woman is drawn ashore the crew are quickly rescuedthe captain of course like every true captain last of all  thus the battle is waged and won and nothing is left but a shattered wreck for wind and waves to do their worst upon  the rescued ones are hurried off to the nearest inn where sympathetic christian hearts and hands minister to their necessities  these are directed by the local agent for that admirable institution the shipwrecked fishermens and mariners societya society which cannot be too highly commended and which it is well to add is supported by voluntary subscriptions  meanwhile the gallant men of the coastguard rejoicing in the feeling that they have done their duty so well and so successfully though wet and weary from long exposure and exertion pack the rocket apparatus into its cart run it back to its place of shelter to be there made ready for the next call to action and then saunter home perchance to tell their wives and little ones the story of the wreck and rescue before lying down to take muchneeded and wellearned repose  let me say in conclusion that hundreds of lives are saved in this manner every year  it is well that the reader should bear in remembrance what i stated at the outset that the great war is unceasing  year by year it is waged  there is no prolonged period of rest  there is no time when we should forget this great work but there are times when we should call it specially to remembrance and bear it upon our hearts before him whom the wind and sea obey  when the wild storms of winter and spring are howling when the frost is keen and the gales are laden with snowdrift when the nights are dark and long and the days are short and greythen it is that our prayers should ascend and our hands be opened for then it is that hundreds of human beings are in deadly peril on our shores and then it is that our gallant lifeboat and rocketmen are risking life and limb while fighting their furious battles with the sea  the end
