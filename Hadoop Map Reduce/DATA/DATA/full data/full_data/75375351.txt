 book i     the napoleon of notting hill     chapter iintroductory remarks on the art of prophecy   the human race to which so many of my readers belong has been playing at childrens games from the beginning and will probably do it till the end which is a nuisance for the few people who grow up and one of the games to which it is most attached is called keep tomorrow dark and which is also named by the rustics in shropshire i have no doubt cheat the prophet the players listen very carefully and respectfully to all that the clever men have to say about what is to happen in the next generation the players then wait until all the clever men are dead and bury them nicely they then go and do something else that is all for a race of simple tastes however it is great fun  for human beings being children have the childish wilfulness and the childish secrecy and they never have from the beginning of the world done what the wise men have seen to be inevitable they stoned the false prophets it is said but they could have stoned true prophets with a greater and juster enjoyment individually men may present a more or less rational appearance eating sleeping and scheming but humanity as a whole is changeful mystical fickle delightful men are men but man is a woman  but in the beginning of the twentieth century the game of cheat the prophet was made far more difficult than it had ever been before the reason was that there were so many prophets and so many prophecies that it was difficult to elude all their ingenuities when a man did something free and frantic and entirely his own a horrible thought struck him afterwards it might have been predicted whenever a duke climbed a lamppost when a dean got drunk he could not be really happy he could not be certain that he was not fulfilling some prophecy in the beginning of the twentieth century you could not see the ground for clever men they were so common that a stupid man was quite exceptional and when they found him they followed him in crowds down the street and treasured him up and gave him some high post in the state and all these clever men were at work giving accounts of what would happen in the next age all quite clear all quite keensighted and ruthless and all quite different and it seemed that the good old game of hoodwinking your ancestors could not really be managed this time because the ancestors neglected meat and sleep and practical politics so that they might meditate day and night on what their descendants would be likely to do  but the way the prophets of the twentieth century went to work was this they took something or other that was certainly going on in their time and then said that it would go on more and more until something extraordinary happened and very often they added that in some odd place that extraordinary thing had happened and that it showed the signs of the times  thus for instance there were mr h g wells and others who thought that science would take charge of the future and just as the motorcar was quicker than the coach so some lovely thing would be quicker than the motorcar and so on for ever and there arose from their ashes dr quilp who said that a man could be sent on his machine so fast round the world that he could keep up a long chatty conversation in some oldworld village by saying a word of a sentence each time he came round and it was said that the experiment had been tried on an apoplectic old major who was sent round the world so fast that there seemed to be to the inhabitants of some other star a continuous band round the earth of white whiskers red complexion and tweedsa thing like the ring of saturn  then there was the opposite school there was mr edward carpenter who thought we should in a very short time return to nature and live simply and slowly as the animals do and edward carpenter was followed by james pickie dd of pocohontas college who said that men were immensely improved by grazing or taking their food slowly and continuously after the manner of cows and he said that he had with the most encouraging results turned city men out on all fours in a field covered with veal cutlets then tolstoy and the humanitarians said that the world was growing more merciful and therefore no one would ever desire to kill and mr mick not only became a vegetarian but at length declared vegetarianism doomed shedding as he called it finely the green blood of the silent animals and predicted that men in a better age would live on nothing but salt and then came the pamphlet from oregon where the thing was tried the pamphlet called why should salt suffer and there was more trouble  illustration city men out on all fours in a field covered with veal cutlets  and on the other hand some people were predicting that the lines of kinship would become narrower and sterner there was mr cecil rhodes who thought that the one thing of the future was the british empire and that there would be a gulf between those who were of the empire and those who were not between the chinaman in hong kong and the chinaman outside between the spaniard on the rock of gibraltar and the spaniard off it similar to the gulf between man and the lower animals and in the same way his impetuous friend dr zoppi the paul of anglosaxonism carried it yet further and held that as a result of this view cannibalism should be held to mean eating a member of the empire not eating one of the subject peoples who should he said be killed without needless pain his horror at the idea of eating a man in british guiana showed how they misunderstood his stoicism who thought him devoid of feeling he was however in a hard position as it was said that he had attempted the experiment and living in london had to subsist entirely on italian organgrinders and his end was terrible for just when he had begun sir paul swiller read his great paper at the royal society proving that the savages were not only quite right in eating their enemies but right on moral and hygienic grounds since it was true that the qualities of the enemy when eaten passed into the eater the notion that the nature of an italian organman was irrevocably growing and burgeoning inside him was almost more than the kindly old professor could bear  there was mr benjamin kidd who said that the growing note of our race would be the care for and knowledge of the future his idea was developed more powerfully by william borker who wrote that passage which every schoolboy knows by heart about men in future ages weeping by the graves of their descendants and tourists being shown over the scene of the historic battle which was to take place some centuries afterwards  and mr stead too was prominent who thought that england would in the twentieth century be united to america and his young lieutenant graham podge who included the states of france germany and russia in the american union the state of russia being abbreviated to ra  there was mr sidney webb also who said that the future would see a continuously increasing order and neatness in the life of the people and his poor friend fipps who went mad and ran about the country with an axe hacking branches off the trees whenever there were not the same number on both sides  all these clever men were prophesying with every variety of ingenuity what would happen soon and they all did it in the same way by taking something they saw going strong as the saying is and carrying it as far as ever their imagination could stretch this they said was the true and simple way of anticipating the future just as said dr pellkins in a fine passagejust as when we see a pig in a litter larger than the other pigs we know that by an unalterable law of the inscrutable it will some day be larger than an elephantjust as we know when we see weeds and dandelions growing more and more thickly in a garden that they must in spite of all our efforts grow taller than the chimneypots and swallow the house from sight so we know and reverently acknowledge that when any power in human politics has shown for any period of time any considerable activity it will go on until it reaches to the sky  and it did certainly appear that the prophets had put the people engaged in the old game of cheat the prophet in a quite unprecedented difficulty it seemed really hard to do anything without fulfilling some of their prophecies  but there was nevertheless in the eyes of labourers in the streets of peasants in the fields of sailors and children and especially women a strange look that kept the wise men in a perfect fever of doubt they could not fathom the motionless mirth in their eyes they still had something up their sleeve they were still playing the game of cheat the prophet  then the wise men grew like wild things and swayed hither and thither crying what can it be what can it be what will london be like a century hence is there anything we have not thought of houses upside downmore hygienic perhaps men walking on handsmake feet flexible dont you know moon  motorcars  no heads and so they swayed and wondered until they died and were buried nicely  then the people went and did what they liked let me no longer conceal the painful truth the people had cheated the prophets of the twentieth century when the curtain goes up on this story eighty years after the present date london is almost exactly like what it is now     chapter iithe man in green   very few words are needed to explain why london a hundred years hence will be very like it is now or rather since i must slip into a prophetic past why london when my story opens was very like it was in those enviable days when i was still alive  the reason can be stated in one sentence the people had absolutely lost faith in revolutions all revolutions are doctrinalsuch as the french one or the one that introduced christianity for it stands to common sense that you cannot upset all existing things customs and compromises unless you believe in something outside them something positive and divine now england during this century lost all belief in this it believed in a thing called evolution and it said all theoretic changes have ended in blood and ennui if we change we must change slowly and safely as the animals do natures revolutions are the only successful ones there has been no conservative reaction in favour of tails  and some things did change things that were not much thought of dropped out of sight things that had not often happened did not happen at all thus for instance the actual physical force ruling the country the soldiers and police grew smaller and smaller and at last vanished almost to a point the people combined could have swept the few policemen away in ten minutes they did not because they did not believe it would do them the least good they had lost faith in revolutions  democracy was dead for no one minded the governing class governing england was now practically a despotism but not an hereditary one some one in the official class was made king no one cared how no one cared who he was merely an universal secretary  in this manner it happened that everything in london was very quiet that vague and somewhat depressed reliance upon things happening as they have always happened which is with all londoners a mood had become an assumed condition there was really no reason for any man doing anything but the thing he had done the day before  there was therefore no reason whatever why the three young men who had always walked up to their government office together should not walk up to it together on this particular wintry and cloudy morning everything in that age had become mechanical and government clerks especially all those clerks assembled regularly at their posts three of those clerks always walked into town together all the neighbourhood knew them two of them were tall and one short and on this particular morning the short clerk was only a few seconds late to join the other two as they passed his gate he could have overtaken them in three strides he could have called after them easily but he did not  for some reason that will never be understood until all souls are judged if they are ever judged the idea was at this time classed with fetish worship he did not join his two companions but walked steadily behind them the day was dull their dress was dull everything was dull but in some odd impulse he walked through street after street through district after district looking at the backs of the two men who would have swung round at the sound of his voice now there is a law written in the darkest of the books of life and it is this if you look at a thing nine hundred and ninetynine times you are perfectly safe if you look at it the thousandth time you are in frightful danger of seeing it for the first time  so the short government official looked at the coattails of the tall government officials and through street after street and round corner after corner saw only coattails coattails and again coattailswhen he did not in the least know why something happened to his eyes  two black dragons were walking backwards in front of him two black dragons were looking at him with evil eyes the dragons were walking backwards it was true but they kept their eyes fixed on him none the less the eyes which he saw were in truth only the two buttons at the back of a frockcoat perhaps some traditional memory of their meaningless character gave this halfwitted prominence to their gaze the slit between the tails was the noseline of the monster whenever the tails flapped in the winter wind the dragons licked their lips it was only a momentary fancy but the small clerk found it imbedded in his soul ever afterwards he never could again think of men in frockcoats except as dragons walking backwards he explained afterwards quite tactfully and nicely to his two official friends that while feeling an inexpressible regard for each of them he could not seriously regard the face of either of them as anything but a kind of tail it was he admitted a handsome taila tail elevated in the air but if he said any true friend of theirs wished to see their faces to look into the eyes of their soul that friend must be allowed to walk reverently round behind them so as to see them from the rear there he would see the two black dragons with the blind eyes  but when first the two black dragons sprang out of the fog upon the small clerk they had merely the effect of all miraclesthey changed the universe he discovered the fact that all romantics knowthat adventures happen on dull days and not on sunny ones when the chord of monotony is stretched most tight then it breaks with a sound like song he had scarcely noticed the weather before but with the four dead eyes glaring at him he looked round and realised the strange dead day  the morning was wintry and dim not misty but darkened with that shadow of cloud or snow which steeps everything in a green or copper twilight the light there is on such a day seems not so much to come from the clear heavens as to be a phosphorescence clinging to the shapes themselves the load of heaven and the clouds is like a load of waters and the men move like fishes feeling that they are on the floor of a sea everything in a london street completes the fantasy the carriages and cabs themselves resemble deepsea creatures with eyes of flame he had been startled at first to meet two dragons now he found he was among deepsea dragons possessing the deep sea  the two young men in front were like the small young man himself welldressed the lines of their frockcoats and silk hats had that luxuriant severity which makes the modern fop hideous as he is a favourite exercise of the modern draughtsman that element which mr max beerbohm has admirably expressed in speaking of certain congruities of dark cloth and the rigid perfection of linen  they walked with the gait of an affected snail and they spoke at the longest intervals dropping a sentence at about every sixth lamppost  they crawled on past the lampposts their mien was so immovable that a fanciful description might almost say that the lampposts crawled past the men as in a dream then the small man suddenly ran after them and said  i want to get my hair cut i say do you know a little shop anywhere where they cut your hair properly i keep on having my hair cut but it keeps on growing again  one of the tall men looked at him with the air of a pained naturalist  why here is a little place cried the small man with a sort of imbecile cheerfulness as the bright bulging window of a fashionable toiletsaloon glowed abruptly out of the foggy twilight do you know i often find hairdressers when i walk about london ill lunch with you at cicconanis you know im awfully fond of hairdressers shops theyre miles better than those nasty butchers and he disappeared into the doorway  the man called james continued to gaze after him a monocle screwed into his eye  what the devil do you make of that fellow he asked his companion a pale young man with a high nose  the pale young man reflected conscientiously for some minutes and then said  had a knock on his head when he was a kid i should think  no i dont think its that replied the honourable james barker ive sometimes fancied he was a sort of artist lambert  bosh cried mr lambert briefly  i admit i cant make him out resumed barker abstractedly he never opens his mouth without saying something so indescribably halfwitted that to call him a fool seems the very feeblest attempt at characterisation but theres another thing about him thats rather funny do you know that he has the one collection of japanese lacquer in europe have you ever seen his books all greek poets and mediæval french and that sort of thing have you ever been in his rooms its like being inside an amethyst and he moves about in all that and talks likelike a turnip  well damn all books your blue books as well said the ingenuous mr lambert with a friendly simplicity you ought to understand such things what do you make of him  hes beyond me returned barker but if you asked me for my opinion i should say he was a man with a taste for nonsense as they call itartistic fooling and all that kind of thing and i seriously believe that he has talked nonsense so much that he has half bewildered his own mind and doesnt know the difference between sanity and insanity he has gone round the mental world so to speak and found the place where the east and the west are one and extreme idiocy is as good as sense but i cant explain these psychological games  you cant explain them to me replied mr wilfrid lambert with candour  as they passed up the long streets towards their restaurant the copper twilight cleared slowly to a pale yellow and by the time they reached it they stood discernible in a tolerable winter daylight the honourable james barker one of the most powerful officials in the english government by this time a rigidly official one was a lean and elegant young man with a blank handsome face and bleak blue eyes he had a great amount of intellectual capacity of that peculiar kind which raises a man from throne to throne and lets him die loaded with honours without having either amused or enlightened the mind of a single man wilfrid lambert the youth with the nose which appeared to impoverish the rest of his face had also contributed little to the enlargement of the human spirit but he had the honourable excuse of being a fool  lambert would have been called a silly man barker with all his cleverness might have been called a stupid man but mere silliness and stupidity sank into insignificance in the presence of the awful and mysterious treasures of foolishness apparently stored up in the small figure that stood waiting for them outside cicconanis the little man whose name was auberon quin had an appearance compounded of a baby and an owl his round head round eyes seemed to have been designed by nature playfully with a pair of compasses his flat dark hair and preposterously long frockcoat gave him something of the look of a childs noah when he entered a room of strangers they mistook him for a small boy and wanted to take him on their knees until he spoke when they perceived that a boy would have been more intelligent  i have been waiting quite a long time said quin mildly its awfully funny i should see you coming up the street at last  why asked lambert staring you told us to come here yourself  my mother used to tell people to come to places said the sage  they were about to turn into the restaurant with a resigned air when their eyes were caught by something in the street the weather though cold and blank was now quite clear and across the dull brown of the wood pavement and between the dull grey terraces was moving something not to be seen for miles roundnot to be seen perhaps at that time in englanda man dressed in bright colours a small crowd hung on the mans heels  he was a tall stately man clad in a military uniform of brilliant green splashed with great silver facings from the shoulder swung a short green furred cloak somewhat like that of a hussar the lining of which gleamed every now and then with a kind of tawny crimson his breast glittered with medals round his neck was the red ribbon and star of some foreign order and a long straight sword with a blazing hilt trailed and clattered along the pavement at this time the pacific and utilitarian development of europe had relegated all such customs to the museums the only remaining force the small but wellorganised police were attired in a sombre and hygienic manner but even those who remembered the last life guards and lancers who disappeared in 1912 must have known at a glance that this was not and never had been an english uniform and this conviction would have been heightened by the yellow aquiline face like dante carved in bronze which rose crowned with white hair out of the green military collar a keen and distinguished but not an english face  the magnificence with which the greenclad gentleman walked down the centre of the road would be something difficult to express in human language for it was an ingrained simplicity and arrogance something in the mere carriage of the head and body which made ordinary moderns in the street stare after him but it had comparatively little to do with actual conscious gestures or expression in the matter of these merely temporary movements the man appeared to be rather worried and inquisitive but he was inquisitive with the inquisitiveness of a despot and worried as with the responsibilities of a god the men who lounged and wondered behind him followed partly with an astonishment at his brilliant uniform that is to say partly because of that instinct which makes us all follow one who looks like a madman but far more because of that instinct which makes all men follow and worship any one who chooses to behave like a king he had to so sublime an extent that great quality of royaltyan almost imbecile unconsciousness of everybody that people went after him as they do after kingsto see what would be the first thing or person he would take notice of and all the time as we have said in spite of his quiet splendour there was an air about him as if he were looking for somebody an expression of inquiry  suddenly that expression of inquiry vanished none could tell why and was replaced by an expression of contentment amid the rapt attention of the mob of idlers the magnificent green gentleman deflected himself from his direct course down the centre of the road and walked to one side of it he came to a halt opposite to a large poster of colmans mustard erected on a wooden hoarding his spectators almost held their breath  he took from a small pocket in his uniform a little penknife with this he made a slash at the stretched paper completing the rest of the operation with his fingers he tore off a strip or rag of paper yellow in colour and wholly irregular in outline then for the first time the great being addressed his adoring onlookers  can any one he said with a pleasing foreign accent lend me a pin  mr lambert who happened to be nearest and who carried innumerable pins for the purpose of attaching innumerable buttonholes lent him one which was received with extravagant but dignified bows and hyperboles of thanks  the gentleman in green then with every appearance of being gratified and even puffed up pinned the piece of yellow paper to the green silk and silverlace adornments of his breast then he turned his eyes round again searching and unsatisfied  anything else i can do sir asked lambert with the absurd politeness of the englishman when once embarrassed  red said the stranger vaguely red  i beg your pardon  i beg yours also señor said the stranger bowing i was wondering whether any of you had any red about you  any red about uswell reallyno i dont think i havei used to carry a red bandanna once but  barker asked auberon quin suddenly wheres your red cockatoo wheres your red cockatoo  what do you mean asked barker desperately what cockatoo youve never seen me with any cockatoo  i know said auberon vaguely mollified wheres it been all the time  barker swung round not without resentment  i am sorry sir he said shortly but civilly none of us seem to have anything red to lend you but why if one may ask  i thank you señor it is nothing i can since there is nothing else fulfil my own requirements  and standing for a second of thought with the penknife in his hand he stabbed his left palm the blood fell with so full a stream that it struck the stones without dripping the foreigner pulled out his handkerchief and tore a piece from it with his teeth the rag was immediately soaked in scarlet  since you are so generous señor he said another pin perhaps  lambert held one out with eyes protruding like a frogs  the red linen was pinned beside the yellow paper and the foreigner took off his hat  i have to thank you all gentlemen he said and wrapping the remainder of the handkerchief round his bleeding hand he resumed his walk with an overwhelming stateliness  while all the rest paused in some disorder little mr auberon quin ran after the stranger and stopped him with hat in hand considerably to everybodys astonishment he addressed him in the purest spanish  señor he said in that language pardon a hospitality perhaps indiscreet towards one who appears to be a distinguished but a solitary guest in london will you do me and my friends with whom you have held some conversation the honour of lunching with us at the adjoining restaurant  the man in the green uniform had turned a fiery colour of pleasure at the mere sound of his own language and he accepted the invitation with that profusion of bows which so often shows in the case of the southern races the falsehood of the notion that ceremony has nothing to do with feeling  señor he said your language is my own but all my love for my people shall not lead me to deny to yours the possession of so chivalrous an entertainer let me say that the tongue is spanish but the heart english and he passed with the rest into cicconanis  now perhaps said barker over the fish and sherry intensely polite but burning with curiosity perhaps it would be rude of me to ask why you did that  did what señor asked the guest who spoke english quite well though in a manner indefinably american  well said the englishman in some confusion i mean tore a strip off a hoarding and  er  cut yourself  and  to tell you that señor answered the other with a certain sad pride involves merely telling you who i am i am juan del fuego president of nicaragua  the manner with which the president of nicaragua leant back and drank his sherry showed that to him this explanation covered all the facts observed and a great deal more barkers brow however was still a little clouded  and the yellow paper he began with anxious friendliness and the red rag  the yellow paper and the red rag said fuego with indescribable grandeur are the colours of nicaragua  but nicaragua  began barker with great hesitation nicaragua is no longer a  nicaragua has been conquered like athens nicaragua has been annexed like jerusalem cried the old man with amazing fire the yankee and the german and the brute powers of modernity have trampled it with the hoofs of oxen but nicaragua is not dead nicaragua is an idea  auberon quin suggested timidly a brilliant idea  yes said the foreigner snatching at the word you are right generous englishman an idea brillant a burning thought señor you asked me why in my desire to see the colours of my country i snatched at paper and blood can you not understand the ancient sanctity of colours the church has her symbolic colours and think of what colours mean to usthink of the position of one like myself who can see nothing but those two colours nothing but the red and the yellow to me all shapes are equal all common and noble things are in a democracy of combination wherever there is a field of marigolds and the red cloak of an old woman there is nicaragua wherever there is a field of poppies and a yellow patch of sand there is nicaragua wherever there is a lemon and a red sunset there is my country wherever i see a red pillarbox and a yellow sunset there my heart beats blood and a splash of mustard can be my heraldry if there be yellow mud and red mud in the same ditch it is better to me than white stars  and if said quin with equal enthusiasm there should happen to be yellow wine and red wine at the same lunch you could not confine yourself to sherry let me order some burgundy and complete as it were a sort of nicaraguan heraldry in your inside  barker was fiddling with his knife and was evidently making up his mind to say something with the intense nervousness of the amiable englishman  i am to understand then he said at last with a cough that you ahem were the president of nicaragua when it made itserone must of course agreeits quite heroic resistance toer  the expresident of nicaragua waved his hand  you need not hesitate in speaking to me he said im quite fully aware that the whole tendency of the world of today is against nicaragua and against me i shall not consider it any diminution of your evident courtesy if you say what you think of the misfortunes that have laid my republic in ruins  barker looked immeasurably relieved and gratified  you are most generous president he said with some hesitation over the title and i will take advantage of your generosity to express the doubts which i must confess we moderns have about such things aserthe nicaraguan independence  so your sympathies are said del fuego quite calmly with the big nation which  pardon me pardon me president said barker warmly my sympathies are with no nation you misunderstand i think the modern intellect we do not disapprove of the fire and extravagance of such commonwealths as yours only to become more extravagant on a larger scale we do not condemn nicaragua because we think britain ought to be more nicaraguan we do not discourage small nationalities because we wish large nationalities to have all their smallness all their uniformity of outlook all their exaggeration of spirit if i differ with the greatest respect from your nicaraguan enthusiasm it is not because a nation or ten nations were against you it is because civilisation was against you we moderns believe in a great cosmopolitan civilisation one which shall include all the talents of all the absorbed peoples  the señor will forgive me said the president may i ask the señor how under ordinary circumstances he catches a wild horse  i never catch a wild horse replied barker with dignity  precisely said the other and there ends your absorption of the talents that is what i complain of your cosmopolitanism when you say you want all peoples to unite you really mean that you want all peoples to unite to learn the tricks of your people if the bedouin arab does not know how to read some english missionary or schoolmaster must be sent to teach him to read but no one ever says this schoolmaster does not know how to ride on a camel let us pay a bedouin to teach him you say your civilisation will include all talents will it do you really mean to say that at the moment when the esquimaux has learnt to vote for a county council you will have learnt to spear a walrus i recur to the example i gave in nicaragua we had a way of catching wild horsesby lassooing the fore feetwhich was supposed to be the best in south america if you are going to include all the talents go and do it if not permit me to say what i have always said that something went from the world when nicaragua was civilised  something perhaps replied barker but that something a mere barbarian dexterity i do not know that i could chip flints as well as a primeval man but i know that civilisation can make these knives which are better and i trust to civilisation  you have good authority answered the nicaraguan many clever men like you have trusted to civilisation many clever babylonians many clever egyptians many clever men at the end of rome can you tell me in a world that is flagrant with the failures of civilisation what there is particularly immortal about yours  i think you do not quite understand president what ours is answered barker you judge it rather as if england was still a poor and pugnacious island you have been long out of europe many things have happened  and what asked the other would you call the summary of those things  the summary of those things answered barker with great animation is that we are rid of the superstitions and in becoming so we have not merely become rid of the superstitions which have been most frequently and most enthusiastically so described the superstition of big nationalities is bad but the superstition of small nationalities is worse the superstition of reverencing our own country is bad but the superstition of reverencing other peoples countries is worse it is so everywhere and in a hundred ways the superstition of monarchy is bad and the superstition of aristocracy is bad but the superstition of democracy is the worst of all  the old gentleman opened his eyes with some surprise  are you then he said no longer a democracy in england  barker laughed  the situation invites paradox he said we are in a sense the purest democracy we have become a despotism have you not noticed how continually in history democracy becomes despotism people call it the decay of democracy it is simply its fulfilment why take the trouble to number and register and enfranchise all the innumerable john robinsons when you can take one john robinson with the same intellect or lack of intellect as all the rest and have done with it the old idealistic republicans used to found democracy on the idea that all men were equally intelligent believe me the sane and enduring democracy is founded on the fact that all men are equally idiotic why should we not choose out of them one as much as another all that we want for government is a man not criminal and insane who can rapidly look over some petitions and sign some proclamations to think what time was wasted in arguing about the house of lords tories saying it ought to be preserved because it was clever and radicals saying it ought to be destroyed because it was stupid and all the time no one saw that it was right because it was stupid because that chance mob of ordinary men thrown there by accident of blood were a great democratic protest against the lower house against the eternal insolence of the aristocracy of talents we have established now in england the thing towards which all systems have dimly groped the dull popular despotism without illusions we want one man at the head of our state not because he is brilliant or virtuous but because he is one man and not a chattering crowd to avoid the possible chance of hereditary diseases or such things we have abandoned hereditary monarchy the king of england is chosen like a juryman upon an official rotation list beyond that the whole system is quietly despotic and we have not found it raise a murmur  do you really mean asked the president incredulously that you choose any ordinary man that comes to hand and make him despotthat you trust to the chance of some alphabetical list  and why not cried barker did not half the historical nations trust to the chance of the eldest sons of eldest sons and did not half of them get on tolerably well to have a perfect system is impossible to have a system is indispensable all hereditary monarchies were a matter of luck so are alphabetical monarchies can you find a deep philosophical meaning in the difference between the stuarts and the hanoverians believe me i will undertake to find a deep philosophical meaning in the contrast between the dark tragedy of the as and the solid success of the bs  and you risk it asked the other though the man may be a tyrant or a cynic or a criminal  we risk it answered barker with a perfect placidity suppose he is a tyranthe is still a check on a hundred tyrants suppose he is a cynic it is to his interest to govern well suppose he is a criminalby removing poverty and substituting power we put a check on his criminality in short by substituting despotism we have put a total check on one criminal and a partial check on all the rest  the nicaraguan old gentleman leaned over with a queer expression in his eyes  my church sir he said has taught me to respect faith i do not wish to speak with any disrespect of yours however fantastic but do you really mean that you will trust to the ordinary man the man who may happen to come next as a good despot  i do said barker simply he may not be a good man but he will be a good despot for when he comes to a mere business routine of government he will endeavour to do ordinary justice do we not assume the same thing in a jury  the old president smiled  i dont know he said that i have any particular objection in detail to your excellent scheme of government my only objection is a quite personal one it is that if i were asked whether i would belong to it i should ask first of all if i was not permitted as an alternative to be a toad in a ditch that is all you cannot argue with the choice of the soul  of the soul said barker knitting his brows i cannot pretend to say anything but speaking in the interests of the public  mr auberon quin rose suddenly to his feet  if youll excuse me gentlemen he said i will step out for a moment into the air  im so sorry auberon said lambert goodnaturedly do you feel bad  not bad exactly said auberon with selfrestraint rather good if anything strangely and richly good the fact is i want to reflect a little on those beautiful words that have just been uttered speaking yes that was the phrase speaking in the interests of the public one cannot get the honey from such things without being alone for a little  is he really off his chump do you think asked lambert  the old president looked after him with queerly vigilant eyes  he is a man i think he said who cares for nothing but a joke he is a dangerous man  lambert laughed in the act of lifting some maccaroni to his mouth  dangerous he said you dont know little quin sir  every man is dangerous said the old man without moving who cares only for one thing i was once dangerous myself  and with a pleasant smile he finished his coffee and rose bowing profoundly passed out into the fog which had again grown dense and sombre three days afterwards they heard that he had died quietly in lodgings in soho                                       drowned somewhere else in the dark sea of fog was a little figure shaking and quaking with what might at first sight have seemed terror or ague but which was really that strange malady a lonely laughter he was repeating over and over to himself with a rich accentbut speaking in the interests of the public     chapter iiithe hill of humour   in a little square garden of yellow roses beside the sea said auberon quin there was a nonconformist minister who had never been to wimbledon his family did not understand his sorrow or the strange look in his eyes but one day they repented their neglect for they heard that a body had been found on the shore battered but wearing patent leather boots as it happened it turned out not to be the minister at all but in the dead mans pocket there was a return ticket to maidstone  there was a short pause as quin and his friends barker and lambert went swinging on through the slushy grass of kensington gardens then auberon resumed  that story he said reverently is the test of humour  they walked on further and faster wading through higher grass as they began to climb a slope  i perceive continued auberon that you have passed the test and consider the anecdote excruciatingly funny since you say nothing only coarse humour is received with pothouse applause the great anecdote is received in silence like a benediction you felt pretty benedicted didnt you barker  i saw the point said barker somewhat loftily  do you know said quin with a sort of idiot gaiety i have lots of stories as good as that listen to this one  and he slightly cleared his throat  dr polycarp was as you all know an unusually sallow bimetallist there people of wide experience would say there goes the sallowest bimetallist in cheshire once this was said so that he overheard it it was said by an actuary under a sunset of mauve and grey polycarp turned upon him sallow he cried fiercely sallow quis tulerit gracchos de seditione querentes it was said that no actuary ever made game of dr polycarp again  barker nodded with a simple sagacity lambert only grunted  here is another continued the insatiable quin in a hollow of the greygreen hills of rainy ireland lived an old old woman whose uncle was always cambridge at the boat race but in her greygreen hollows she knew nothing of this she didnt know that there was a boat race also she did not know that she had an uncle she had heard of nobody at all except of george the first of whom she had heard i know not why and in whose historical memory she put her simple trust and by and by in gods good time it was discovered that this uncle of hers was not really her uncle and they came and told her so she smiled through her tears and said only virtue is its own reward  again there was a silence and then lambert said  it seems a bit mysterious  mysterious cried the other the true humour is mysterious do you not realise the chief incident of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  and whats that asked lambert shortly  it is very simple replied the other hitherto it was the ruin of a joke that people did not see it now it is the sublime victory of a joke that people do not see it humour my friends is the one sanctity remaining to mankind it is the one thing you are thoroughly afraid of look at that tree  his interlocutors looked vaguely towards a beech that leant out towards them from the ridge of the hill  if said mr quin i were to say that you did not see the great truths of science exhibited by that tree though they stared any man of intellect in the face what would you think or say you would merely regard me as a pedant with some unimportant theory about vegetable cells if i were to say that you did not see in that tree the vile mismanagement of local politics you would dismiss me as a socialist crank with some particular fad about public parks if i were to say that you were guilty of the supreme blasphemy of looking at that tree and not seeing in it a new religion a special revelation of god you would simply say i was a mystic and think no more about me but ifand he lifted a pontifical handif i say that you cannot see the humour of that tree and that i see the humour of itmy god you will roll about at my feet  he paused a moment and then resumed  yes a sense of humour a weird and delicate sense of humour is the new religion of mankind it is towards that men will strain themselves with the asceticism of saints exercises spiritual exercises will be set in it it will be asked can you see the humour of this iron railing or can you see the humour of this field of corn can you see the humour of the stars can you see the humour of the sunsets how often i have laughed myself to sleep over a violet sunset  quite so said mr barker with an intelligent embarrassment  let me tell you another story how often it happens that the mps for essex are less punctual than one would suppose the least punctual essex mp perhaps was james wilson who said in the very act of plucking a poppy  lambert suddenly faced round and struck his stick into the ground in a defiant attitude  auberon he said chuck it i wont stand it its all bosh  both men stared at him for there was something very explosive about the words as if they had been corked up painfully for a long time  you have began quin no  i dont care a curse said lambert violently whether i have a delicate sense of humour or not i wont stand it its all a confounded fraud theres no joke in those infernal tales at all you know there isnt as well as i do  well replied quin slowly it is true that i with my rather gradual mental processes did not see any joke in them but the finer sense of barker perceived it  barker turned a fierce red but continued to stare at the horizon  you ass said lambert why cant you be like other people why cant you say something really funny or hold your tongue the man who sits on his hat in a pantomime is a long sight funnier than you are  quin regarded him steadily they had reached the top of the ridge and the wind struck their faces  lambert said auberon you are a great and good man though im hanged if you look it you are more you are a great revolutionist or deliverer of the world and i look forward to seeing you carved in marble between luther and danton if possible in your present attitude the hat slightly on one side i said as i came up the hill that the new humour was the last of the religions you have made it the last of the superstitions but let me give you a very serious warning be careful how you ask me to do anything outré to imitate the man in the pantomime and to sit on my hat because i am a man whose soul has been emptied of all pleasures but folly and for twopence id do it  do it then said lambert swinging his stick impatiently it would be funnier than the bosh you and barker talk  quin standing on the top of the hill stretched his hand out towards the main avenue of kensington gardens  two hundred yards away he said are all your fashionable acquaintances with nothing on earth to do but to stare at each other and at us we are standing upon an elevation under the open sky a peak as it were of fantasy a sinai of humour we are in a great pulpit or platform lit up with sunlight and half london can see us be careful how you suggest things to me for there is in me a madness which goes beyond martyrdom the madness of an utterly idle man  i dont know what you are talking about said lambert contemptuously i only know id rather you stood on your silly head than talked so much  auberon for goodness sake  cried barker springing forward but he was too late faces from all the benches and avenues were turned in their direction groups stopped and small crowds collected and the sharp sunlight picked out the whole scene in blue green and black like a picture in a childs toybook and on the top of the small hill mr auberon quin stood with considerable athletic neatness upon his head and waved his patentleather boots in the air  for gods sake quin get up and dont be an idiot cried barker wringing his hands we shall have the whole town here  yes get up get up man said lambert amused and annoyed i was only fooling get up  auberon did so with a bound and flinging his hat higher than the trees proceeded to hop about on one leg with a serious expression barker stamped wildly  oh lets get home barker and leave him said lambert some of your proper and correct police will look after him here they come  two gravelooking men in quiet uniforms came up the hill towards them one held a paper in his hand  there he is officer said lambert cheerfully we aint responsible for him  the officer looked at the capering mr quin with a quiet eye  we have not come gentlemen he said about what i think you are alluding to we have come from headquarters to announce the selection of his majesty the king it is the rule inherited from the old régime that the news should be brought to the new sovereign immediately wherever he is so we have followed you across kensington gardens  barkers eyes were blazing in his pale face he was consumed with ambition throughout his life with a certain dull magnanimity of the intellect he had really believed in the chance method of selecting despots but this sudden suggestion that the selection might have fallen upon him unnerved him with pleasure  which of us he began and the respectful official interrupted him  not you sir i am sorry to say if i may be permitted to say so we know your services to the government and should be very thankful if it were the choice has fallen  god bless my soul said lambert jumping back two paces not me dont say im autocrat of all the russias  no sir said the officer with a slight cough and a glance towards auberon who was at that moment putting his head between his legs and making a noise like a cow the gentleman whom we have to congratulate seems at the momentereroccupied  not quin shrieked barker rushing up to him it cant be auberon for gods sake pull yourself together youve been made king  with his head still upside down between his legs mr quin answered modestly  i am not worthy i cannot reasonably claim to equal the great men who have previously swayed the sceptre of britain perhaps the only peculiarity that i can claim is that i am probably the first monarch that ever spoke out his soul to the people of england with his head and body in this position this may in some sense give me to quote a poem that i wrote in my youth  a nobler office on the earth than valour power of brain or birth could give the warrior kings of old  the intellect clarified by this posture  lambert and barker made a kind of rush at him  dont you understand cried lambert its not a joke theyve really made you king by gosh they must have rum taste  the great bishops of the middle ages said quin kicking his legs in the air as he was dragged up more or less upside down were in the habit of refusing the honour of election three times and then accepting it a mere matter of detail separates me from those great men i will accept the post three times and refuse it afterwards oh i will toil for you my faithful people you shall have a banquet of humour  by this time he had been landed the right way up and the two men were still trying in vain to impress him with the gravity of the situation  did you not tell me wilfrid lambert he said that i should be of more public value if i adopted a more popular form of humour and when should a popular form of humour be more firmly riveted upon me than now when i have become the darling of a whole people officer he continued addressing the startled messenger are there no ceremonies to celebrate my entry into the city  ceremonies began the official with embarrassment have been more or less neglected for some little time and  auberon quin began gradually to take off his coat  all ceremony he said consists in the reversal of the obvious thus men when they wish to be priests or judges dress up like women kindly help me on with this coat and he held it out  but your majesty said the officer after a moments bewilderment and manipulation youre putting it on with the tails in front  the reversal of the obvious said the king calmly is as near as we can come to ritual with our imperfect apparatus lead on  the rest of that afternoon and evening was to barker and lambert a nightmare which they could not properly realise or recall the king with his coat on the wrong way went towards the streets that were awaiting him and the old kensington palace which was the royal residence as he passed small groups of men the groups turned into crowds and gave forth sounds which seemed strange in welcoming an autocrat barker walked behind his brain reeling and as the crowds grew thicker and thicker the sounds became more and more unusual and when he had reached the great marketplace opposite the church barker knew that he had reached it though he was roods behind because a cry went up such as had never before greeted any of the kings of the earth     book ii     chapter ithe charter of the cities   lambert was standing bewildered outside the door of the kings apartments amid the scurry of astonishment and ridicule he was just passing out into the street in a dazed manner when james barker dashed by him  where are you going he asked  to stop all this foolery of course replied barker and he disappeared into the room  he entered it headlong slamming the door and slapping his incomparable silk hat on the table his mouth opened but before he could speak the king said  your hat if you please  fidgetting with his fingers and scarcely knowing what he was doing the young politician held it out  the king placed it on his own chair and sat on it  a quaint old custom he explained smiling above the ruins when the king receives the representatives of the house of barker the hat of the latter is immediately destroyed in this manner it represents the absolute finality of the act of homage expressed in the removal of it it declares that never until that hat shall once more appear upon your head a contingency which i firmly believe to be remote shall the house of barker rebel against the crown of england  barker stood with clenched fist and shaking lip  your jokes he began and my property and then exploded with an oath and stopped again  continue continue said the king waving his hands  what does it all mean cried the other with a gesture of passionate rationality are you mad  not in the least replied the king pleasantly madmen are always serious they go mad from lack of humour you are looking serious yourself james  why cant you keep it to your own private life expostulated the other youve got plenty of money and plenty of houses now to play the fool in but in the interests of the public  epigrammatic said the king shaking his finger sadly at him none of your daring scintillations here as to why i dont do it in private i rather fail to understand your question the answer is of comparative limpidity i dont do it in private because it is funnier to do it in public you appear to think that it would be amusing to be dignified in the banquet hall and in the street and at my own fireside i could procure a fireside to keep the company in a roar but that is what every one does every one is grave in public and funny in private my sense of humour suggests the reversal of this it suggests that one should be funny in public and solemn in private i desire to make the state functions parliaments coronations and so on one roaring oldfashioned pantomime but on the other hand i shut myself up alone in a small storeroom for two hours a day where i am so dignified that i come out quite ill  by this time barker was walking up and down the room his frock coat flapping like the black wings of a bird  well you will ruin the country thats all he said shortly  it seems to me said auberon that the tradition of ten centuries is being broken and the house of barker is rebelling against the crown of england it would be with regret for i admire your appearance that i should be obliged forcibly to decorate your head with the remains of this hat but  what i cant understand said barker flinging up his fingers with a feverish american movement is why you dont care about anything else but your games  the king stopped sharply in the act of lifting the silken remnants dropped them and walked up to barker looking at him steadily  i made a kind of vow he said that i would not talk seriously which always means answering silly questions but the strong man will always be gentle with politicians  the shape my scornful looks deride required a god to form  if i may so theologically express myself and for some reason i cannot in the least understand i feel impelled to answer that question of yours and to answer it as if there were really such a thing in the world as a serious subject you ask me why i dont care for anything else can you tell me in the name of all the gods you dont believe in why i should care for anything else  dont you realise common public necessities cried barker is it possible that a man of your intelligence does not know that it is every ones interest  dont you believe in zoroaster is it possible that you neglect mumbojumbo returned the king with startling animation does a man of your intelligence come to me with these damned early victorian ethics if on studying my features and manner you detect any particular resemblance to the prince consort i assure you you are mistaken did herbert spencer ever convince youdid he ever convince anybodydid he ever for one mad moment convince himselfthat it must be to the interest of the individual to feel a public spirit do you believe that if you rule your department badly you stand any more chance or one half of the chance of being guillotined that an angler stands of being pulled into the river by a strong pike herbert spencer refrained from theft for the same reason that he refrained from wearing feathers in his hair because he was an english gentleman with different tastes i am an english gentleman with different tastes he liked philosophy i like art he liked writing ten books on the nature of human society i like to see the lord chamberlain walking in front of me with a piece of paper pinned to his coattails it is my humour are you answered at any rate i have said my last serious word today and my last serious word i trust for the remainder of my life in this paradise of fools the remainder of my conversation with you today which i trust will be long and stimulating i propose to conduct in a new language of my own by means of rapid and symbolic movements of the left leg and he began to pirouette slowly round the room with a preoccupied expression  barker ran round the room after him bombarding him with demands and entreaties but he received no response except in the new language he came out banging the door again and sick like a man coming on shore as he strode along the streets he found himself suddenly opposite cicconanis restaurant and for some reason there rose up before him the green fantastic figure of the spanish general standing as he had seen him last at the door with the words on his lips you cannot argue with the choice of the soul  the king came out from his dancing with the air of a man of business legitimately tired he put on an overcoat lit a cigar and went out into the purple night  illustration im king of the castle  i will go he said and mingle with the people  he passed swiftly up a street in the neighbourhood of notting hill when suddenly he felt a hard object driven into his waistcoat he paused put up his single eyeglass and beheld a boy with a wooden sword and a paper cocked hat wearing that expression of awed satisfaction with which a child contemplates his work when he has hit some one very hard the king gazed thoughtfully for some time at his assailant and slowly took a notebook from his breastpocket  i have a few notes he said for my dying speech and he turned over the leaves dying speech for political assassination ditto if by former friendhm hm dying speech for death at hands of injured husband repentant dying speech for same cynical i am not quite sure which meets the present  im the king of the castle said the boy truculently and very pleased with nothing in particular  the king was a kindhearted man and very fond of children like all people who are fond of the ridiculous  infant he said im glad you are so stalwart a defender of your old inviolate notting hill look up nightly to that peak my child where it lifts itself among the stars so ancient so lonely so unutterably notting so long as you are ready to die for the sacred mountain even if it were ringed with all the armies of bayswater  the king stopped suddenly and his eyes shone  perhaps he said perhaps the noblest of all my conceptions a revival of the arrogance of the old mediæval cities applied to our glorious suburbs clapham with a city guard wimbledon with a city wall surbiton tolling a bell to raise its citizens west hampstead going into battle with its own banner it shall be done i the king have said it and hastily presenting the boy with half a crown remarking for the warchest of notting hill he ran violently home at such a rate of speed that crowds followed him for miles on reaching his study he ordered a cup of coffee and plunged into profound meditation upon the project at length he called his favourite equerry captain bowler for whom he had a deep affection founded principally upon the shape of his whiskers  bowler he said isnt there some society of historical research or something of which i am an honorary member  yes sir said captain bowler rubbing his nose you are a member of the encouragers of egyptian renaissance and the teutonic tombs club and the society for the recovery of london antiquities and  that is admirable said the king the london antiquities does my trick go to the society for the recovery of london antiquities and speak to their secretary and their subsecretary and their president and their vicepresident saying the king of england is proud but the honorary member of the society for the recovery of london antiquities is prouder than kings i should like to tell you of certain discoveries i have made touching the neglected traditions of the london boroughs the revelations may cause some excitement stirring burning memories and touching old wounds in shepherds bush and bayswater in pimlico and south kensington the king hesitates but the honorary member is firm i approach you invoking the vows of my initiation the sacred seven cats the poker of perfection and the ordeal of the indescribable instant forgive me if i mix you up with the clannagael or some other club i belong to and ask you to permit me to read a paper at your next meeting on the wars of the london boroughs say all this to the society bowler remember it very carefully for it is most important and i have forgotten it altogether and send me another cup of coffee and some of the cigars that we keep for vulgar and successful people i am going to write my paper  the society for the recovery of london antiquities met a month after in a corrugated iron hall on the outskirts of one of the southern suburbs of london a large number of people had collected there under the coarse and flaring gasjets when the king arrived perspiring and genial on taking off his greatcoat he was perceived to be in evening dress wearing the garter his appearance at the small table adorned only with a glass of water was received with respectful cheering  the chairman mr huggins said that he was sure that they had all been pleased to listen to such distinguished lecturers as they had heard for some time past hear hear mr burton hear hear mr cambridge professor king loud and continued cheers our old friend peter jessop sir william white loud laughter and other eminent men had done honour to their little venture cheers but there were other circumstances which lent a certain unique quality to the present occasion hear hear so far as his recollection went and in connection with the society for the recovery of london antiquities it went very far loud cheers he did not remember that any of their lecturers had borne the title of king he would therefore call upon king auberon briefly to address the meeting  the king began by saying that this speech might be regarded as the first declaration of his new policy for the nation at this supreme hour of my life i feel that to no one but the members of the society for the recovery of london antiquities can i open my heart cheers if the world turns upon my policy and the storms of popular hostility begin to rise no no i feel that it is here with my brave recoverers around me that i can best meet them sword in hand loud cheers  his majesty then went on to explain that now old age was creeping upon him he proposed to devote his remaining strength to bringing about a keener sense of local patriotism in the various municipalities of london how few of them knew the legends of their own boroughs how many there were who had never heard of the true origin of the wink of wandsworth what a large proportion of the younger generation in chelsea neglected to perform the old chelsea chuff pimlico no longer pumped the pimlies battersea had forgotten the name of blick  there was a short silence and then a voice said shame  the king continued being called however unworthily to this high estate i have resolved that so far as possible this neglect shall cease i desire no military glory i lay claim to no constitutional equality with justinian or alfred if i can go down to history as the man who saved from extinction a few old english customs if our descendants can say it was through this man humble as he was that the ten turnips are still eaten in fulham and the putney parish councillor still shaves one half of his head i shall look my great fathers reverently but not fearfully in the face when i go down to the last house of kings  the king paused visibly affected but collecting himself resumed once more  i trust that to very few of you at least i need dwell on the sublime origins of these legends the very names of your boroughs bear witness to them so long as hammersmith is called hammersmith its people will live in the shadow of that primal hero the blacksmith who led the democracy of the broadway into battle till he drove the chivalry of kensington before him and overthrew them at that place which in honour of the best blood of the defeated aristocracy is still called kensington gore men of hammersmith will not fail to remember that the very name of kensington originated from the lips of their hero for at the great banquet of reconciliation held after the war when the disdainful oligarchs declined to join in the songs of the men of the broadway which are to this day of a rude and popular character the great republican leader with his rough humour said the words which are written in gold upon his monument little birds that can sing and wont sing must be made to sing so that the eastern knights were called cansings or kensings ever afterwards but you also have great memories o men of kensington you showed that you could sing and sing great warsongs even after the dark day of kensington gore history will not forget those three knights who guarded your disordered retreat from hyde park so called from your hiding there those three knights after whom knightsbridge is named nor will it forget the day of your reemergence purged in the fire of calamity cleansed of your oligarchic corruptions when sword in hand you drove the empire of hammersmith back mile by mile swept it past its own broadway and broke it at last in a battle so long and bloody that the birds of prey have left their name upon it men have called it with austere irony the ravenscourt i shall not i trust wound the patriotism of bayswater or the lonelier pride of brompton or that of any other historic township by taking these two special examples i select them not because they are more glorious than the rest but partly from personal association i am myself descended from one of the three heroes of knightsbridge and partly from the consciousness that i am an amateur antiquarian and cannot presume to deal with times and places more remote and more mysterious it is not for me to settle the question between two such men as professor hugg and sir william whisky as to whether notting hill means nutting hill in allusion to the rich woods which no longer cover it or whether it is a corruption of nothingill referring to its reputation among the ancients as an earthly paradise when a podkins and a jossy confess themselves doubtful about the boundaries of west kensington said to have been traced in the blood of oxen i need not be ashamed to confess a similar doubt i will ask you to excuse me from further history and to assist me with your encouragement in dealing with the problem which faces us today is this ancient spirit of the london townships to die out are our omnibus conductors and policemen to lose altogether that light which we see so often in their eyes the dreamy light of  old unhappy faroff things and battles long ago  to quote the words of a littleknown poet who was a friend of my youth i have resolved as i have said so far as possible to preserve the eyes of policemen and omnibus conductors in their present dreamy state for what is a state without dreams and the remedy i propose is as follows  tomorrow morning at twentyfive minutes past ten if heaven spares my life i purpose to issue a proclamation it has been the work of my life and is about half finished with the assistance of a whisky and soda i shall conclude the other half tonight and my people will receive it tomorrow all these boroughs where you were born and hope to lay your bones shall be reinstated in their ancient magnificencehammersmith kensington bayswater chelsea battersea clapham balham and a hundred others each shall immediately build a city wall with gates to be closed at sunset each shall have a city guard armed to the teeth each shall have a banner a coatofarms and if convenient a gathering cry i will not enter into the details now my heart is too full they will be found in the proclamation itself you will all however be subject to enrolment in the local city guards to be summoned together by a thing called the tocsin the meaning of which i am studying in my researches into history personally i believe a tocsin to be some kind of highly paid official if therefore any of you happen to have such a thing as a halberd in the house i should advise you to practise with it in the garden  here the king buried his face in his handkerchief and hurriedly left the platform overcome by emotions  the members of the society for the recovery of london antiquities rose in an indescribable state of vagueness some were purple with indignation an intellectual few were purple with laughter the great majority found their minds a blank there remains a tradition that one pale face with burning blue eyes remained fixed upon the lecturer and after the lecture a redhaired boy ran out of the room     chapter iithe council of the provosts   the king got up early next morning and came down three steps at a time like a schoolboy having eaten his breakfast hurriedly but with an appetite he summoned one of the highest officials of the palace and presented him with a shilling go and buy me he said a shilling paintbox which you will get unless the mists of time mislead me in a shop at the corner of the second and dirtier street that leads out of rochester row i have already requested the master of the buckhounds to provide me with cardboard it seemed to me i know not why that it fell within his department  the king was happy all that morning with his cardboard and his paintbox he was engaged in designing the uniforms and coatsofarms for the various municipalities of london they gave him deep and no inconsiderable thought he felt the responsibility  i cannot think he said why people should think the names of places in the country more poetical than those in london shallow romanticists go away in trains and stop in places called hugmyinthehole or bumpsonthepuddle and all the time they could if they liked go and live at a place with the dim divine name of st johns wood i have never been to st johns wood i dare not i should be afraid of the innumerable night of fir trees afraid to come upon a bloodred cup and the beating of the wings of the eagle but all these things can be imagined by remaining reverently in the harrow train  and he thoughtfully retouched his design for the headdress of the halberdier of st johns wood a design in black and red compounded of a pine tree and the plumage of an eagle then he turned to another card let us think of milder matters he said lavender hill could any of your glebes and combes and all the rest of it produce so fragrant an idea think of a mountain of lavender lifting itself in purple poignancy into the silver skies and filling mens nostrils with a new breath of lifea purple hill of incense it is true that upon my few excursions of discovery on a halfpenny tram i have failed to hit the precise spot but it must be there some poet called it by its name there is at least warrant enough for the solemn purple plumes following the botanical formation of lavender which i have required people to wear in the neighbourhood of clapham junction it is so everywhere after all i have never been actually to southfields but i suppose a scheme of lemons and olives represent their austral instincts i have never visited parsons green or seen either the green or the parson but surely the palegreen shovelhats i have designed must be more or less in the spirit i must work in the dark and let my instincts guide me the great love i bear to my people will certainly save me from distressing their noble spirit or violating their great traditions  as he was reflecting in this vein the door was flung open and an official announced mr barker and mr lambert  mr barker and mr lambert were not particularly surprised to find the king sitting on the floor amid a litter of watercolour sketches they were not particularly surprised because the last time they had called on him they had found him sitting on the floor surrounded by a litter of childrens bricks and the time before surrounded by a litter of wholly unsuccessful attempts to make paper darts but the trend of the royal infants remarks uttered from amid this infantile chaos was not quite the same affair  for some time they let him babble on conscious that his remarks meant nothing and then a horrible thought began to steal over the mind of james barker he began to think that the kings remarks did not mean nothing  in gods name auberon he suddenly volleyed out startling the quiet hall you dont mean that you are really going to have these city guards and city walls and things  i am indeed said the infant in a quiet voice why shouldnt i have them i have modelled them precisely on your political principles do you know what ive done barker ive behaved like a true barkerian ive  but perhaps it wont interest you the account of my barkerian conduct  oh go on go on cried barker  the account of my barkerian conduct said auberon calmly seems not only to interest but to alarm you yet it is very simple it merely consists in choosing all the provosts under any new scheme by the same principle by which you have caused the central despot to be appointed each provost of each city under my charter is to be appointed by rotation sleep therefore my barker a rosy sleep  barkers wild eyes flared  but in gods name dont you see quin that the thing is quite different in the centre it doesnt matter so much just because the whole object of despotism is to get some sort of unity but if any damned parish can go to any damned man  i see your difficulty said king auberon calmly you feel that your talents may be neglected listen and he rose with immense magnificence i solemnly give to my liege subject james barker my special and splendid favour the right to override the obvious text of the charter of the cities and to be in his own right lord high provost of south kensington and now my dear james you are all right good day  but began barker  the audience is at an end provost said the king smiling  how far his confidence was justified it would require a somewhat complicated description to explain the great proclamation of the charter of the free cities appeared in due course that morning and was posted by billstickers all over the front of the palace the king assisting them with animated directions and standing in the middle of the road with his head on one side contemplating the result it was also carried up and down the main thoroughfares by sandwichmen and the king was with difficulty restrained from going out in that capacity himself being in fact found by the groom of the stole and captain bowler struggling between two boards his excitement had positively to be quieted like that of a child  the reception which the charter of the cities met at the hands of the public may mildly be described as mixed in one sense it was popular enough in many happy homes that remarkable legal document was read aloud on winter evenings amid uproarious appreciation when everything had been learnt by heart from that quaint but immortal old classic mr w w jacobs but when it was discovered that the king had every intention of seriously requiring the provisions to be carried out of insisting that the grotesque cities with their tocsins and city guards should really come into existence things were thrown into a far angrier confusion londoners had no particular objection to the king making a fool of himself but they became indignant when it became evident that he wished to make fools of them and protests began to come in  the lord high provost of the good and valiant city of west kensington wrote a respectful letter to the king explaining that upon state occasions it would of course be his duty to observe what formalities the king thought proper but that it was really awkward for a decent householder not to be allowed to go out and put a postcard in a pillarbox without being escorted by five heralds who announced with formal cries and blasts of a trumpet that the lord high provost desired to catch the post  the lord high provost of north kensington who was a prosperous draper wrote a curt business note like a man complaining of a railway company stating that definite inconvenience had been caused him by the presence of the halberdiers whom he had to take with him everywhere when attempting to catch an omnibus to the city he had found that while room could have been found for himself the halberdiers had a difficulty in getting in to the vehiclebelieve him theirs faithfully  the lord high provost of shepherds bush said his wife did not like men hanging round the kitchen  the king was always delighted to listen to these grievances delivering lenient and kingly answers but as he always insisted as the absolute sine qua non that verbal complaints should be presented to him with the fullest pomp of trumpets plumes and halberds only a few resolute spirits were prepared to run the gauntlet of the little boys in the street  among these however was prominent the abrupt and businesslike gentleman who ruled north kensington and he had before long occasion to interview the king about a matter wider and even more urgent than the problem of the halberdiers and the omnibus this was the great question which then and for long afterwards brought a stir to the blood and a flush to the cheek of all the speculative builders and house agents from shepherds bush to the marble arch and from westbourne grove to high street kensington i refer to the great affair of the improvements in notting hill the scheme was conducted chiefly by mr buck the abrupt north kensington magnate and by mr wilson the provost of bayswater a great thoroughfare was to be driven through three boroughs through west kensington north kensington and notting hill opening at one end into hammersmith broadway and at the other into westbourne grove the negotiations buyings sellings bullying and bribing took ten years and by the end of it buck who had conducted them almost singlehanded had proved himself a man of the strongest type of material energy and material diplomacy and just as his splendid patience and more splendid impatience had finally brought him victory when workmen were already demolishing houses and walls along the great line from hammersmith a sudden obstacle appeared that had neither been reckoned with nor dreamed of a small and strange obstacle which like a speck of grit in a great machine jarred the whole vast scheme and brought it to a standstill and mr buck the draper getting with great impatience into his robes of office and summoning with indescribable disgust his halberdiers hurried over to speak to the king  ten years had not tired the king of his joke there were still new faces to be seen looking out from the symbolic headgears he had designed gazing at him from amid the pastoral ribbons of shepherds bush or from under the sombre hoods of the blackfriars road and the interview which was promised him with the provost of north kensington he anticipated with a particular pleasure for he never really enjoyed he said the full richness of the mediæval garments unless the people compelled to wear them were very angry and businesslike  mr buck was both at the kings command the door of the audiencechamber was thrown open and a herald appeared in the purple colours of mr bucks commonwealth emblazoned with the great eagle which the king had attributed to north kensington in vague reminiscence of russia for he always insisted on regarding north kensington as some kind of semiarctic neighbourhood the herald announced that the provost of that city desired audience of the king  from north kensington said the king rising graciously what news does he bring from that land of high hills and fair women he is welcome  the herald advanced into the room and was immediately followed by twelve guards clad in purple who were followed by an attendant bearing the banner of the eagle who was followed by another attendant bearing the keys of the city upon a cushion who was followed by mr buck in a great hurry when the king saw his strong animal face and steady eyes he knew that he was in the presence of a great man of business and consciously braced himself  well well he said cheerily coming down two or three steps from a daïs and striking his hands lightly together i am glad to see you never mind never mind ceremony is not everything  i dont understand your majesty said the provost stolidly  never mind never mind said the king gaily a knowledge of courts is by no means an unmixed merit you will do it next time no doubt  the man of business looked at him sulkily from under his black brows and said again without show of civility  i dont follow you  well well replied the king goodnaturedly if you ask me i dont mind telling you not because i myself attach any importance to these forms in comparison with the honest heart but it is usualit is usualthat is all for a man when entering the presence of royalty to lie down on his back on the floor and elevating his feet towards heaven as the source of royal power to say three times monarchical institutions improve the manners but there theresuch pomp is far less truly dignified than your simple kindliness  the provosts face was red with anger and he maintained silence  and now said the king lightly and with the exasperating air of a man softening a snub what delightful weather we are having you must find your official robes warm my lord i designed them for your own snowbound land  theyre as hot as hell said buck briefly i came here on business  right said the king nodding a great number of times with quite unmeaning solemnity right right right business as the sad glad old persian said is business be punctual rise early point the pen to the shoulder point the pen to the shoulder for you know not whence you come nor why point the pen to the shoulder for you know not when you go nor where  the provost pulled a number of papers from his pocket and savagely flapped them open  your majesty may have heard he began sarcastically of hammersmith and a thing called a road we have been at work ten years buying property and getting compulsory powers and fixing compensation and squaring vested interests and now at the very end the thing is stopped by a fool old prout who was provost of notting hill was a business man and we dealt with him quite satisfactorily but hes dead and the cursed lot has fallen on a young man named wayne whos up to some game thats perfectly incomprehensible to me we offer him a better price than any one ever dreamt of but he wont let the road go through and his council seems to be backing him up its midsummer madness  the king who was rather inattentively engaged in drawing the provosts nose with his finger on the windowpane heard the last two words  what a perfect phrase that is he said midsummer madness  the chief point is continued buck doggedly that the only part that is really in question is one dirty little streetpump streeta street with nothing in it but a publichouse and a penny toyshop and that sort of thing all the respectable people of notting hill have accepted our compensation but the ineffable wayne sticks out over pump street says hes provost of notting hill hes only provost of pump street  a good thought replied auberon i like the idea of a provost of pump street why not let him alone  and drop the whole scheme cried out buck with a burst of brutal spirit ill be damned if we do no im for sending in workmen to pull down without more ado  strike for the purple eagle cried the king hot with historical associations  ill tell you what it is said buck losing his temper altogether if your majesty would spend less time in insulting respectable people with your silly coatsofarms and more time over the business of the nation  the kings brow wrinkled thoughtfully  the situation is not bad he said the haughty burgher defying the king in his own palace the burghers head should be thrown back and the right arm extended the left may be lifted towards heaven but that i leave to your private religious sentiment i have sunk back in this chair stricken with baffled fury now again please  bucks mouth opened like a dogs but before he could speak another herald appeared at the door  the lord high provost of bayswater he said desires an audience  admit him said auberon this is a jolly day  the halberdiers of bayswater wore a prevailing uniform of green and the banner which was borne after them was emblazoned with a green baywreath on a silver ground which the king in the course of his researches into a bottle of champagne had discovered to be the quaint old punning cognisance of the city of bayswater  it is a fit symbol said the king your immortal baywreath fulham may seek for wealth and kensington for art but when did the men of bayswater care for anything but glory  immediately behind the banner and almost completely hidden by it came the provost of the city clad in splendid robes of green and silver with white fur and crowned with bay he was an anxious little man with red whiskers originally the owner of a small sweetstuff shop  our cousin of bayswater said the king with delight what can we get for you the king was heard also distinctly to mutter cold beef cold am cold chicken his voice dying into silence  i came to see your majesty said the provost of bayswater whose name was wilson about that pump street affair  i have just been explaining the situation to his majesty said buck curtly but recovering his civility i am not sure however whether his majesty knows how much the matter affects you also  it affects both of us yer see yer majesty as this scheme was started for the benefit of the ole neighbourhood so mr buck and me we put our eads together  the king clasped his hands  perfect he cried in ecstacy your heads together i can see it cant you do it now oh do do it now  a smothered sound of amusement appeared to come from the halberdiers but mr wilson looked merely bewildered and mr buck merely diabolical  i suppose he began bitterly but the king stopped him with a gesture of listening  hush he said i think i hear some one else coming i seem to hear another herald a herald whose boots creak  as he spoke another voice cried from the doorway  the lord high provost of south kensington desires an audience  the lord high provost of south kensington cried the king why that is my old friend james barker what does he want i wonder if the tender memories of friendship have not grown misty i fancy he wants something for himself probably money how are you james  mr james barker whose guard was attired in a splendid blue and whose blue banner bore three gold birds singing rushed in his blue and gold robes into the room despite the absurdity of all the dresses it was worth noticing that he carried his better than the rest though he loathed it as much as any of them he was a gentleman and a very handsome man and could not help unconsciously wearing even his preposterous robe as it should be worn he spoke quickly but with the slight initial hesitation he always showed in addressing the king due to suppressing an impulse to address his old acquaintance in the old way  your majestypray forgive my intrusion it is about this man in pump street i see you have buck here so you have probably heard what is necessary i  the king swept his eyes anxiously round the room which now blazed with the trappings of three cities  there is one thing necessary he said  yes your majesty said mr wilson of bayswater a little eagerly what does yer majesty think necessary  a little yellow said the king firmly send for the provost of west kensington  amid some materialistic protests he was sent for and arrived with his yellow halberdiers in his saffron robes wiping his forehead with a handkerchief after all placed as he was he had a good deal to say on the matter  welcome west kensington said the king i have long wished to see you touching that matter of the hammersmith land to the south of the rowton house will you hold it feudally from the provost of hammersmith you have only to do him homage by putting his left arm in his overcoat and then marching home in state  no your majesty id rather not said the provost of west kensington who was a pale young man with a fair moustache and whiskers who kept a successful dairy  the king struck him heartily on the shoulder  the fierce old west kensington blood he said they are not wise who ask it to do homage  then he glanced again round the room it was full of a roaring sunset of colour and he enjoyed the sight possible to so few artiststhe sight of his own dreams moving and blazing before him in the foreground the yellow of the west kensington liveries outlined itself against the dark blue draperies of south kensington the crests of these again brightened suddenly into green as the almost woodland colours of bayswater rose behind them and over and behind all the great purple plumes of north kensington showed almost funereal and black  there is something lacking said the kingsomething lacking what canah there it is there it is  in the doorway had appeared a new figure a herald in flaming red he cried in a loud but unemotional voice  the lord high provost of notting hill desires an audience     chapter iiienter a lunatic   the king of the fairies who was it is to be presumed the godfather of king auberon must have been very favourable on this particular day to his fantastic godchild for with the entrance of the guard of the provost of notting hill there was a certain more or less inexplicable addition to his delight the wretched navvies and sandwichmen who carried the colours of bayswater or south kensington engaged merely for the day to satisfy the royal hobby slouched into the room with a comparatively hangdog air and a great part of the kings intellectual pleasure consisted in the contrast between the arrogance of their swords and feathers and the meek misery of their faces but these notting hill halberdiers in their red tunics belted with gold had the air rather of an absurd gravity they seemed so to speak to be taking part in the joke they marched and wheeled into position with an almost startling dignity and discipline  they carried a yellow banner with a great red lion named by the king as the notting hill emblem after a small publichouse in the neighbourhood which he once frequented  between the two lines of his followers there advanced towards the king a tall redhaired young man with high features and bold blue eyes he would have been called handsome but that a certain indefinable air of his nose being too big for his face and his feet for his legs gave him a look of awkwardness and extreme youth his robes were red according to the kings heraldry and alone among the provosts he was girt with a great sword this was adam wayne the intractable provost of notting hill  the king flung himself back in his chair and rubbed his hands  what a day what a day he said to himself now therell be a row id no idea it would be such fun as it is these provosts are so very indignant so very reasonable so very right this fellow by the look in his eyes is even more indignant than the rest no sign in those large blue eyes at any rate of ever having heard of a joke hell remonstrate with the others and theyll remonstrate with him and theyll all make themselves sumptuously happy remonstrating with me  welcome my lord he said aloud what news from the hill of a hundred legends what have you for the ear of your king i know that troubles have arisen between you and these others our cousins but these troubles it shall be our pride to compose and i doubt not and cannot doubt that your love for me is not less tender no less ardent than theirs  mr buck made a bitter face and james barkers nostrils curled wilson began to giggle faintly and the provost of west kensington followed in a smothered way but the big blue eyes of adam wayne never changed and he called out in an odd boyish voice down the hall  i bring homage to my king i bring him the only thing i havemy sword  and with a great gesture he flung it down on the ground and knelt on one knee behind it  there was a dead silence  i beg your pardon said the king blankly  you speak well sire said adam wayne as you ever speak when you say that my love is not less than the love of these small would it be if it were not more for i am the heir of your schemethe child of the great charter i stand here for the rights the charter gave me and i swear by your sacred crown that where i stand i stand fast  illustration i bring homage to my king  the eyes of all five men stood out of their heads  then buck said in his jolly jarring voice is the whole world mad  the king sprang to his feet and his eyes blazed  yes he cried in a voice of exultation the whole world is mad but adam wayne and me it is true as death what i told you long ago james barker seriousness sends men mad you are mad because you care for politics as mad as a man who collects tram tickets buck is mad because he cares for money as mad as a man who lives on opium wilson is mad because he thinks himself right as mad as a man who thinks himself god almighty the provost of west kensington is mad because he thinks he is respectable as mad as a man who thinks he is a chicken all men are mad but the humorist who cares for nothing and possesses everything i thought that there was only one humorist in england foolsdoltsopen your cows eyes there are two in notting hillin that unpromising elevationthere has been born an artist you thought to spoil my joke and bully me out of it by becoming more and more modern more and more practical more and more bustling and rational oh what a feast it was to answer you by becoming more and more august more and more gracious more and more ancient and mellow but this lad has seen how to bowl me out he has answered me back vaunt for vaunt rhetoric for rhetoric he has lifted the only shield i cannot break the shield of an impenetrable pomposity listen to him you have come my lord about pump street  about the city of notting hill answered wayne proudly of which pump street is a living and rejoicing part  not a very large part said barker contemptuously  that which is large enough for the rich to covet said wayne drawing up his head is large enough for the poor to defend  the king slapped both his legs and waved his feet for a second in the air  every respectable person in notting hill cut in buck with his cold coarse voice is for us and against you i have plenty of friends in notting hill  your friends are those who have taken your gold for other mens hearthstones my lord buck said provost wayne i can well believe they are your friends  theyve never sold dirty toys anyhow said buck laughing shortly  theyve sold dirtier things said wayne calmly they have sold themselves  its no good my buckling said the king rolling about on his chair you cant cope with this chivalrous eloquence you cant cope with an artist you cant cope with the humorist of notting hill oh nunc dimittisthat i have lived to see this day provost wayne you stand firm  let them wait and see said wayne if i stood firm before do you think i shall weaken now that i have seen the face of the king for i fight for something greater if greater there can be than the hearthstones of my people and the lordship of the lion i fight for your royal vision for the great dream you dreamt of the league of the free cities you have given me this liberty if i had been a beggar and you had flung me a coin if i had been a peasant in a dance and you had flung me a favour do you think i would have let it be taken by any ruffians on the road this leadership and liberty of notting hill is a gift from your majesty and if it is taken from me by god it shall be taken in battle and the noise of that battle shall be heard in the flats of chelsea and in the studios of st johns wood  it is too muchit is too much said the king nature is weak i must speak to you brother artist without further disguise let me ask you a solemn question adam wayne lord high provost of notting hill dont you think it splendid  splendid cried adam wayne it has the splendour of god  bowled out again said the king you will keep up the pose funnily of course it is serious but seriously isnt it funny  what asked wayne with the eyes of a baby  hang it all dont play any more the whole businessthe charter of the cities isnt it immense  immense is no unworthy word for that glorious design  oh hang you but of course i see you want me to clear the room of these reasonable sows you want the two humorists alone together leave us gentlemen  buck threw a sour look at barker and at a sullen signal the whole pageant of blue and green of red gold and purple rolled out of the room leaving only two in the great hall the king sitting in his seat on the daïs and the redclad figure still kneeling on the floor before his fallen sword  the king bounded down the steps and smacked provost wayne on the back  before the stars were made he cried we were made for each other it is too beautiful think of the valiant independence of pump street that is the real thing it is the deification of the ludicrous  the kneeling figure sprang to his feet with a fierce stagger  ludicrous he cried with a fiery face  oh come come said the king impatiently you neednt keep it up with me the augurs must wink sometimes from sheer fatigue of the eyelids let us enjoy this for half an hour not as actors but as dramatic critics isnt it a joke  adam wayne looked down like a boy and answered in a constrained voice  i do not understand your majesty i cannot believe that while i fight for your royal charter your majesty deserts me for these dogs of the gold hunt  oh damn yourbut whats this what the devils this  the king stared into the young provosts face and in the twilight of the room began to see that his face was quite white and his lip shaking  what in gods name is the matter cried auberon holding his wrist  wayne flung back his face and the tears were shining on it  i am only a boy he said but its true i would paint the red lion on my shield if i had only my blood  king auberon dropped the hand and stood without stirring thunderstruck  my god in heaven he said is it possible that there is within the four seas of britain a man who takes notting hill seriously  and my god in heaven said wayne passionately is it possible that there is within the four seas of britain a man who does not take it seriously  the king said nothing but merely went back up the steps of the daïs like a man dazed he fell back in his chair again and kicked his heels  if this sort of thing is to go on he said weakly i shall begin to doubt the superiority of art to life in heavens name do not play with me do you really mean that you aregod help mea notting hill patriot that you are  wayne made a violent gesture and the king soothed him wildly  all rightall righti see you are but let me take it in you do really propose to fight these modern improvers with their boards and inspectors and surveyors and all the rest of it  are they so terrible asked wayne scornfully  the king continued to stare at him as if he were a human curiosity  and i suppose he said that you think that the dentists and small tradesmen and maiden ladies who inhabit notting hill will rally with warhymns to your standard  if they have blood they will said the provost  and i suppose said the king with his head back among the cushions that it never crossed your mind thathis voice seemed to lose itself luxuriantlynever crossed your mind that any one ever thought that the idea of a notting hill idealism waserslightlyslightly ridiculous  of course they think so said wayne  what was the meaning of mocking the prophets  where asked the king leaning forwardwhere in heavens name did you get this miraculously inane idea  you have been my tutor sire said the provost in all that is high and honourable  eh said the king  it was your majesty who first stirred my dim patriotism into flame ten years ago when i was a boy i am only nineteen i was playing on the slope of pump street with a wooden sword and a paper helmet dreaming of great wars in an angry trance i struck out with my sword and stood petrified for i saw that i had struck you sire my king as you wandered in a noble secrecy watching over your peoples welfare but i need have had no fear then was i taught to understand kingliness you neither shrank nor frowned you summoned no guards you invoked no punishments but in august and burning words which are written in my soul never to be erased you told me ever to turn my sword against the enemies of my inviolate city like a priest pointing to the altar you pointed to the hill of notting so long you said as you are ready to die for the sacred mountain even if it were ringed with all the armies of bayswater i have not forgotten the words and i have reason now to remember them for the hour is come and the crown of your prophecy the sacred hill is ringed with the armies of bayswater and i am ready to die  the king was lying back in his chair a kind of wreck  oh lord lord lord he murmured what a life what a life all my work i seem to have done it all so youre the redhaired boy that hit me in the waistcoat what have i done god what have i done i thought i would have a joke and i have created a passion i tried to compose a burlesque and it seems to be turning halfway through into an epic what is to be done with such a world in the lords name wasnt the joke broad and bold enough i abandoned my subtle humour to amuse you and i seem to have brought tears to your eyes whats to be done with people when you write a pantomime for themcall the sausages classic festoons and the policeman cut in two a tragedy of public duty but why am i talking why am i asking questions of a nice young gentleman who is totally mad what is the good of it what is the good of anything oh lord oh lord  suddenly he pulled himself upright  dont you really think the sacred notting hill at all absurd  absurd asked wayne blankly why should i  the king stared back equally blankly  i beg your pardon he said  notting hill said the provost simply is a rise or high ground of the common earth on which men have built houses to live in which they are born fall in love pray marry and die why should i think it absurd  the king smiled  because my leonidas he began then suddenly he knew not how found his mind was a total blank after all why was it absurd why was it absurd he felt as if the floor of his mind had given way he felt as all men feel when their first principles are hit hard with a question barker always felt so when the king said why trouble about politics  the kings thoughts were in a kind of rout he could not collect them  it is generally felt to be a little funny he said vaguely  i suppose said adam turning on him with a fierce suddennessi suppose you fancy crucifixion was a serious affair  well i began auberoni admit i have generally thought it had its graver side  then you are wrong said wayne with incredible violence crucifixion is comic it is exquisitely diverting it was an absurd and obscene kind of impaling reserved for people who were made to be laughed atfor slaves and provincials for dentists and small tradesmen as you would say i have seen the grotesque gallowsshape which the little roman gutterboys scribbled on walls as a vulgar joke blazing on the pinnacles of the temples of the world and shall i turn back  the king made no answer  adam went on his voice ringing in the roof  this laughter with which men tyrannise is not the great power you think it peter was crucified and crucified head downwards what could be funnier than the idea of a respectable old apostle upside down what could be more in the style of your modern humour but what was the good of it upside down or right side up peter was peter to mankind upside down he stills hangs over europe and millions move and breathe only in the life of his church  king auberon got up absently  there is something in what you say he said you seem to have been thinking young man  only feeling sire answered the provost i was born like other men in a spot of the earth which i loved because i had played boys games there and fallen in love and talked with my friends through nights that were nights of the gods and i feel the riddle these little gardens where we told our loves these streets where we brought out our dead why should they be commonplace why should they be absurd why should it be grotesque to say that a pillarbox is poetic when for a year i could not see a red pillarbox against the yellow evening in a certain street without being wracked with something of which god keeps the secret but which is stronger than sorrow or joy why should any one be able to raise a laugh by saying the cause of notting hillnotting hill where thousands of immortal spirits blaze with alternate hope and fear  auberon was flicking dust off his sleeve with quite a new seriousness on his face distinct from the owlish solemnity which was the pose of his humour  it is very difficult he said at last it is a damned difficult thing i see what you mean i agree with you even up to a pointor i should like to agree with you if i were young enough to be a prophet and poet i feel a truth in everything you say until you come to the words notting hill and then i regret to say that the old adam awakes roaring with laughter and makes short work of the new adam whose name is wayne  for the first time provost wayne was silent and stood gazing dreamily at the floor evening was closing in and the room had grown darker  i know he said in a strange almost sleepy voice there is truth in what you say too it is hard not to laugh at the common namesi only say we should not i have thought of a remedy but such thoughts are rather terrible  what thoughts asked auberon  the provost of notting hill seemed to have fallen into a kind of trance in his eyes was an elvish light  i know of a magic wand but it is a wand that only one or two may rightly use and only seldom it is a fairy wand of great fear stronger than those who use itoften frightful often wicked to use but whatever is touched with it is never again wholly common whatever is touched with it takes a magic from outside the world if i touch with this fairy wand the railways and the roads of notting hill men will love them and be afraid of them for ever  what the devil are you talking about asked the king  it has made mean landscapes magnificent and hovels outlast cathedrals went on the madman why should it not make lampposts fairer than greek lamps and an omnibusride like a painted ship the touch of it is the finger of a strange perfection  what is your wand cried the king impatiently  there it is said wayne and pointed to the floor where his sword lay flat and shining  the sword cried the king and sprang up straight on the daïs  yes yes cried wayne hoarsely the things touched by that are not vulgar the things touched by that  king auberon made a gesture of horror  you will shed blood for that he cried for a cursed point of view  oh you kings you kings cried out adam in a burst of scorn how humane you are how tender how considerate you will make war for a frontier or the imports of a foreign harbour you will shed blood for the precise duty on lace or the salute to an admiral but for the things that make life itself worthy or miserablehow humane you are i say here and i know well what i speak of there were never any necessary wars but the religious wars there were never any just wars but the religious wars there were never any humane wars but the religious wars for these men were fighting for something that claimed at least to be the happiness of a man the virtue of a man a crusader thought at least that islam hurt the soul of every man king or tinker that it could really capture i think buck and barker and these rich vultures hurt the soul of every man hurt every inch of the ground hurt every brick of the houses that they can really capture do you think i have no right to fight for notting hill you whose english government has so often fought for tomfooleries if as your rich friends say there are no gods and the skies are dark above us what should a man fight for but the place where he had the eden of childhood and the short heaven of first love if no temples and no scriptures are sacred what is sacred if a mans own youth is not sacred  the king walked a little restlessly up and down the daïs  it is hard he said biting his lips to assent to a view so desperateso responsible  as he spoke the door of the audience chamber fell ajar and through the aperture came like the sudden chatter of a bird the high nasal but wellbred voice of barker  i said to him quite plainlythe public interests  auberon turned on wayne with violence  what the devil is all this what am i saying what are you saying have you hypnotised me curse your uncanny blue eyes let me go give me back my sense of humour give it me backgive it me back i say  i solemnly assure you said wayne uneasily with a gesture as if feeling all over himself that i havent got it  the king fell back in his chair and went into a roar of rabelaisian laughter  i dont think you have he cried     book iii     chapter ithe mental condition of adam wayne   a little while after the kings accession a small book of poems appeared called hymns on the hill they were not good poems nor was the book successful but it attracted a certain amount of attention from one particular school of critics the king himself who was a member of the school reviewed it in his capacity of literary critic to straight from the stables a sporting journal they were known as the hammock school because it had been calculated malignantly by an enemy that no less than thirteen of their delicate criticisms had begun with the words i read this book in a hammock half asleep in the sleepy sunlight i  after that there were important differences under these conditions they liked everything but especially everything silly next to authentic goodness in a book they saidnext to authentic goodness in a book and that alas we never find we desire a rich badness thus it happened that their praise as indicating the presence of a rich badness was not universally sought after and authors became a little disquieted when they found the eye of the hammock school fixed upon them with peculiar favour  the peculiarity of hymns on the hill was the celebration of the poetry of london as distinct from the poetry of the country this sentiment or affectation was of course not uncommon in the twentieth century nor was it although sometimes exaggerated and sometimes artificial by any means without a great truth at its root for there is one respect in which a town must be more poetical than the country since it is closer to the spirit of man for london if it be not one of the masterpieces of man is at least one of his sins a street is really more poetical than a meadow because a street has a secret a street is going somewhere and a meadow nowhere but in the case of the book called hymns on the hill there was another peculiarity which the king pointed out with great acumen in his review he was naturally interested in the matter for he had himself published a volume of lyrics about london under his pseudonym of daisy daydream  this difference as the king pointed out consisted in the fact that while mere artificers like daisy daydream on whose elaborate style the king over his signature of thunderbolt was perhaps somewhat too severe thought to praise london by comparing it to the countryusing nature that is as a background from which all poetical images had to be drawnthe more robust author of hymns on the hill praised the country or nature by comparing it to the town and used the town itself as a background take said the critic the typically feminine lines to the inventor of the hansom cab  poet whose cunning carved this amorous shell            where twain may dwell  surely wrote the king no one but a woman could have written those lines a woman has always a weakness for nature with her art is only beautiful as an echo or shadow of it she is praising the hansom cab by theme and theory but her soul is still a child by the sea picking up shells she can never be utterly of the town as a man can indeed do we not speak with sacred propriety of a man about town who ever spoke of a woman about town however much physically about town a woman may be she still models herself on nature she tries to carry nature with her she bids grasses to grow on her head and furry beasts to bite her about the throat in the heart of a dim city she models her hat on a flaring cottage garden of flowers we with our nobler civic sentiment model ours on a chimney pot the ensign of civilisation and rather than be without birds she will commit massacre that she may turn her head into a tree with dead birds to sing on it  this kind of thing went on for several pages and then the critic remembered his subject and returned to it  poet whose cunning carved this amorous shell           where twain may dwell  the peculiarity of these fine though feminine lines continued thunderbolt is as we have said that they praise the hansom cab by comparing it to the shell to a natural thing now hear the author of hymns on the hill and how he deals with the same subject in his fine nocturne entitled the last omnibus he relieves the rich and poignant melancholy of the theme by a sudden sense of rushing at the end  the wind round the old street corner swung sudden and quick as a cab  here the distinction is obvious daisy daydream thinks it a great compliment to a hansom cab to be compared to one of the spiral chambers of the sea and the author of hymns on the hill thinks it a great compliment to the immortal whirlwind to be compared to a hackney coach he surely is the real admirer of london we have no space to speak of all his perfect applications of the idea of the poem in which for instance a ladys eyes are compared not to stars but to two perfect streetlamps guiding the wanderer we have no space to speak of the fine lyric recalling the elizabethan spirit in which the poet instead of saying that the rose and the lily contend in her complexion says with a purer modernism that the red omnibus of hammersmith and the white omnibus of fulham fight there for the mastery how perfect the image of two contending omnibuses  here somewhat abruptly the review concluded probably because the king had to send off his copy at that moment as he was in some want of money but the king was a very good critic whatever he may have been as king and he had to a considerable extent hit the right nail on the head hymns on the hill was not at all like the poems originally published in praise of the poetry of london and the reason was that it was really written by a man who had seen nothing else but london and who regarded it therefore as the universe it was written by a raw redheaded lad of seventeen named adam wayne who had been born in notting hill an accident in his seventh year prevented his being taken away to the seaside and thus his whole life had been passed in his own pump street and in its neighbourhood and the consequence was that he saw the streetlamps as things quite as eternal as the stars the two fires were mingled he saw the houses as things enduring like the mountains and so he wrote about them as one would write about mountains nature puts on a disguise when she speaks to every man to this man she put on the disguise of notting hill nature would mean to a poet born in the cumberland hills a stormy skyline and sudden rocks nature would mean to a poet born in the essex flats a waste of splendid waters and splendid sunsets so nature meant to this man wayne a line of violet roofs and lemon lamps the chiaroscuro of the town he did not think it clever or funny to praise the shadows and colours of the town he had seen no other shadows or colours and so he praised thembecause they were shadows and colours he saw all this because he was a poet though in practice a bad poet it is too often forgotten that just as a bad man is nevertheless a man so a bad poet is nevertheless a poet  mr waynes little volume of verse was a complete failure and he submitted to the decision of fate with a quite rational humility went back to his work which was that of a drapers assistant and wrote no more he still retained his feeling about the town of notting hill because he could not possibly have any other feeling because it was the back and base of his brain but he does not seem to have made any particular attempt to express it or insist upon it  he was a genuine natural mystic one of those who live on the border of fairyland but he was perhaps the first to realise how often the boundary of fairyland runs through a crowded city twenty feet from him for he was very shortsighted the red and white and yellow suns of the gaslights thronged and melted into each other like an orchard of fiery trees the beginning of the woods of elfland  but oddly enough it was because he was a small poet that he came to his strange and isolated triumph it was because he was a failure in literature that he became a portent in english history he was one of those to whom nature has given the desire without the power of artistic expression he had been a dumb poet from his cradle he might have been so to his grave and carried unuttered into the darkness a treasure of new and sensational song but he was born under the lucky star of a single coincidence he happened to be at the head of his dingy municipality at the time of the kings jest at the time when all municipalities were suddenly commanded to break out into banners and flowers out of the long procession of the silent poets who have been passing since the beginning of the world this one man found himself in the midst of an heraldic vision in which he could act and speak and live lyrically while the author and the victims alike treated the whole matter as a silly public charade this one man by taking it seriously sprang suddenly into a throne of artistic omnipotence armour music standards watchfires the noise of drums all the theatrical properties were thrown before him this one poor rhymster having burnt his own rhymes began to live that life of open air and acted poetry of which all the poets of the earth have dreamed in vain the life for which the iliad is only a cheap substitute  upwards from his abstracted childhood adam wayne had grown strongly and silently in a certain quality or capacity which is in modern cities almost entirely artificial but which can be natural and was primarily almost brutally natural in him the quality or capacity of patriotism it exists like other virtues and vices in a certain undiluted reality it is not confused with all kinds of other things a child speaking of his country or his village may make every mistake in mandeville or tell every lie in munchausen but in his statement there will be no psychological lies any more than there can be in a good song adam wayne as a boy had for his dull streets in notting hill the ultimate and ancient sentiment that went out to athens or jerusalem he knew the secret of the passion those secrets which make real old national songs sound so strange to our civilisation he knew that real patriotism tends to sing about sorrows and forlorn hopes much more than about victory he knew that in proper names themselves is half the poetry of all national poems above all he knew the supreme psychological fact about patriotism as certain in connection with it as that a fine shame comes to all lovers the fact that the patriot never under any circumstances boasts of the largeness of his country but always and of necessity boasts of the smallness of it  all this he knew not because he was a philosopher or a genius but because he was a child any one who cares to walk up a side slum like pump street can see a little adam claiming to be king of a pavingstone and he will always be proudest if the stone is almost too narrow for him to keep his feet inside it  it was while he was in such a dream of defensive battle marking out some strip of street or fortress of steps as the limit of his haughty claim that the king had met him and with a few words flung in mockery ratified for ever the strange boundaries of his soul thenceforward the fanciful idea of the defence of notting hill in war became to him a thing as solid as eating or drinking or lighting a pipe he disposed his meals for it altered his plans for it lay awake in the night and went over it again two or three shops were to him an arsenal an area was to him a moat corners of balconies and turns of stone steps were points for the location of a culverin or an archer it is almost impossible to convey to any ordinary imagination the degree to which he had transmitted the leaden london landscape to a romantic gold the process began almost in babyhood and became habitual like a literal madness it was felt most keenly at night when london is really herself when her lights shine in the dark like the eyes of innumerable cats and the outline of the dark houses has the bold simplicity of blue hills but for him the night revealed instead of concealing and he read all the blank hours of morning and afternoon by a contradictory phrase in the light of that darkness to this man at any rate the inconceivable had happened the artificial city had become to him nature and he felt the curbstones and gaslamps as things as ancient as the sky  one instance may suffice walking along pump street with a friend he said as he gazed dreamily at the iron fence of a little front garden how those railings stir ones blood  his friend who was also a great intellectual admirer looked at them painfully but without any particular emotion he was so troubled about it that he went back quite a large number of times on quiet evenings and stared at the railings waiting for something to happen to his blood but without success at last he took refuge in asking wayne himself he discovered that the ecstacy lay in the one point he had never noticed about the railings even after his six visitsthe fact that they were like the great majority of othersin london shaped at the top after the manner of a spear as a child wayne had half unconsciously compared them with the spears in pictures of lancelot and st george and had grown up under the shadow of the graphic association now whenever he looked at them they were simply the serried weapons that made a hedge of steel round the sacred homes of notting hill he could not have cleansed his mind of that meaning even if he tried it was not a fanciful comparison or anything like it it would not have been true to say that the familiar railings reminded him of spears it would have been far truer to say that the familiar spears occasionally reminded him of railings  a couple of days after his interview with the king adam wayne was pacing like a caged lion in front of five shops that occupied the upper end of the disputed street they were a grocers a chemists a barbers an old curiosity shop and a toyshop that sold also newspapers it was these five shops which his childish fastidiousness had first selected as the essentials of the notting hill campaign the citadel of the city if notting hill was the heart of the universe and pump street was the heart of notting hill this was the heart of pump street the fact that they were all small and side by side realised that feeling for a formidable comfort and compactness which as we have said was the heart of his patriotism and of all patriotism the grocer who had a wine and spirit licence was included because he could provision the garrison the old curiosity shop because it contained enough swords pistols partisans crossbows and blunderbusses to arm a whole irregular regiment the toy and paper shop because wayne thought a free press an essential centre for the soul of pump street the chemists to cope with outbreaks of disease among the besieged and the barbers because it was in the middle of all the rest and the barbers son was an intimate friend and spiritual affinity  it was a cloudless october evening settling down through purple into pure silver around the roofs and chimneys of the steep little street which looked black and sharp and dramatic in the deep shadows the gaslit shop fronts gleamed like five fires in a row and before them darkly outlined like a ghost against some purgatorial furnaces passed to and fro the tall birdlike figure and eagle nose of adam wayne  he swung his stick restlessly and seemed fitfully talking to himself  there are after all enigmas he said even to the man who has faith there are doubts that remain even after the true philosophy is completed in every rung and rivet and here is one of them is the normal human need the normal human condition higher or lower than those special states of the soul which call out a doubtful and dangerous glory those special powers of knowledge or sacrifice which are made possible only by the existence of evil which should come first to our affections the enduring sanities of peace or the halfmaniacal virtues of battle which should come first the man great in the daily round or the man great in emergency which should come first to return to the enigma before me the grocer or the chemist which is more certainly the stay of the city the swift chivalrous chemist or the benignant allproviding grocer in such ultimate spiritual doubts it is only possible to choose a side by the higher instincts and to abide the issue in any case i have made my choice may i be pardoned if i choose wrongly but i choose the grocer  good morning sir said the grocer who was a middleaged man partially bald with harsh red whiskers and beard and forehead lined with all the cares of the small tradesman what can i do for you sir  wayne removed his hat on entering the shop with a ceremonious gesture which slight as it was made the tradesman eye him with the beginnings of wonder  i come sir he said soberly to appeal to your patriotism  why sir said the grocer that sounds like the times when i was a boy and we used to have elections  you will have them again said wayne firmly and far greater things listen mr mead i know the temptations which a grocer has to a too cosmopolitan philosophy i can imagine what it must be to sit all day as you do surrounded with wares from all the ends of the earth from strange seas that we have never sailed and strange forests that we could not even picture no eastern king ever had such argosies or such cargoes coming from the sunrise and the sunset and solomon in all his glory was not enriched like one of you india is at your elbow he cried lifting his voice and pointing his stick at a drawer of rice the grocer making a movement of some alarm china is before you demerara is behind you america is above your head and at this very moment like some old spanish admiral you hold tunis in your hands  mr mead dropped the box of dates which he was just lifting and then picked it up again vaguely  wayne went on with a heightened colour but a lowered voice  i know i say the temptations of so international so universal a vision of wealth i know that it must be your danger not to fall like many tradesmen into too dusty and mechanical a narrowness but rather to be too broad to be too general too liberal if a narrow nationalism be the danger of the pastrycook who makes his own wares under his own heavens no less is cosmopolitanism the danger of the grocer but i come to you in the name of that patriotism which no wanderings or enlightenments should ever wholly extinguish and i ask you to remember notting hill for after all in this cosmopolitan magnificence she has played no small part your dates may come from the tall palms of barbary your sugar from the strange islands of the tropics your tea from the secret villages of the empire of the dragon that this room might be furnished forests may have been spoiled under the southern cross and leviathans speared under the polar star but you yourselfsurely no inconsiderable treasureyou yourself the brain that wields these vast interestsyou yourself at least have grown to strength and wisdom between these grey houses and under this rainy sky this city which made you and thus made your fortunes is threatened with war come forth and tell to the ends of the earth this lesson oil is from the north and fruits from the south rices are from india and spices from ceylon sheep are from new zealand and men from notting hill  the grocer sat for some little while with dim eyes and his mouth open looking rather like a fish then he scratched the back of his head and said nothing then he said  anything out of the shop sir  wayne looked round in a dazed way seeing a pile of tins of pineapple chunks he waved his stick generally towards them  yes he said ill take those  all those sir said the grocer with greatly increased interest  yes yes all those replied wayne still a little bewildered like a man splashed with cold water  very good sir thank you sir said the grocer with animation you may count upon my patriotism sir  i count upon it already said wayne and passed out into the gathering night  the grocer put the box of dates back in its place  what a nice fellow he is he said its odd how often they are nice much nicer than those as are all right  meanwhile adam wayne stood outside the glowing chemists shop unmistakably wavering  what a weakness it is he muttered i have never got rid of it from childhoodthe fear of this magic shop the grocer is rich he is romantic he is poetical in the truest sense but he is notno he is not supernatural but the chemist all the other shops stand in notting hill but this stands in elfland look at those great burning bowls of colour it must be from them that god paints the sunsets it is superhuman and the superhuman is all the more uncanny when it is beneficent that is the root of the fear of god i am afraid but i must be a man and enter  he was a man and entered a short dark young man was behind the counter with spectacles and greeted him with a bright but entirely businesslike smile  a fine evening sir he said  fine indeed strange father said adam stretching his hands somewhat forward it is on such clear and mellow nights that your shop is most itself then they appear most perfect those moons of green and gold and crimson which from afar oft guide the pilgrim of pain and sickness to this house of merciful witchcraft  can i get you anything asked the chemist  let me see said wayne in a friendly but vague manner let me have some sal volatile  eightpence tenpence or one and sixpence a bottle said the young man genially  one and sixone and six replied wayne with a wild submissiveness i come to ask you mr bowles a terrible question  he paused and collected himself  it is necessary he mutteredit is necessary to be tactful and to suit the appeal to each profession in turn  i come he resumed aloud to ask you a question which goes to the roots of your miraculous toils mr bowles shall all this witchery cease and he waved his stick around the shop  meeting with no answer he continued with animation  in notting hill we have felt to its core the elfish mystery of your profession and now notting hill itself is threatened  anything more sir asked the chemist  oh said wayne somewhat disturbedoh what is it chemists sell quinine i think thank you shall it be destroyed i have met these men of bayswater and north kensingtonmr bowles they are materialists they see no witchery in your work even when it is wrought within their own borders they think the chemist is commonplace they think him human  the chemist appeared to pause only a moment to take in the insult and immediately said  and the next article please  alum said the provost wildly i resume it is in this sacred town alone that your priesthood is reverenced therefore when you fight for us you fight not only for yourself but for everything you typify you fight not only for notting hill but for fairyland for as surely as buck and barker and such men hold sway the sense of fairyland in some strange manner diminishes  anything more sir asked mr bowles with unbroken cheerfulness  oh yes jujubesgregory powdermagnesia the danger is imminent in all this matter i have felt that i fought not merely for my own city though to that i owe all my blood but for all places in which these great ideas could prevail i am fighting not merely for notting hill but for bayswater itself for north kensington itself for if the goldhunters prevail these also will lose all their ancient sentiments and all the mystery of their national soul i know i can count upon you  oh yes sir said the chemist with great animation we are always glad to oblige a good customer  adam wayne went out of the shop with a deep sense of fulfilment of soul  it is so fortunate he said to have tact to be able to play upon the peculiar talents and specialities the cosmopolitanism of the grocer and the worldold necromancy of the chemist where should i be without tact     chapter iithe remarkable mr turnbull   after two more interviews with shopmen however the patriots confidence in his own psychological diplomacy began vaguely to wane despite the care with which he considered the peculiar rationale and the peculiar glory of each separate shop there seemed to be something unresponsive about the shopmen whether it was a dark resentment against the uninitiate for peeping into their masonic magnificence he could not quite conjecture  his conversation with the man who kept the shop of curiosities had begun encouragingly the man who kept the shop of curiosities had indeed enchanted him with a phrase he was standing drearily at the door of his shop a wrinkled man with a grey pointed beard evidently a gentleman who had come down in the world  and how does your commerce go you strange guardian of the past said wayne affably  well sir not very well replied the man with that patient voice of his class which is one of the most heartbreaking things in the world things are terribly quiet  waynes eyes shone suddenly  a great saying he said worthy of a man whose merchandise is human history terribly quiet that is in two words the spirit of this age as i have felt it from my cradle i sometimes wondered how many other people felt the oppression of this union between quietude and terror i see blank wellordered streets and men in black moving about inoffensively sullenly it goes on day after day day after day and nothing happens but to me it is like a dream from which i might wake screaming to me the straightness of our life is the straightness of a thin cord stretched tight its stillness is terrible it might snap with a noise like thunder and you who sit amid the débris of the great wars you who sit as it were upon a battlefield you know that war was less terrible than this evil peace you know that the idle lads who carried those swords under francis or elizabeth the rude squire or baron who swung that mace about in picardy or northumberland battles may have been terribly noisy but were not like us terribly quiet  whether it was a faint embarrassment of conscience as to the original source and date of the weapons referred to or merely an engrained depression the guardian of the past looked if anything a little more worried  but i do not think continued wayne that this horrible silence of modernity will last though i think for the present it will increase what a farce is this modern liberality freedom of speech means practically in our modern civilisation that we must only talk about unimportant things we must not talk about religion for that is illiberal we must not talk about bread and cheese for that is talking shop we must not talk about death for that is depressing we must not talk about birth for that is indelicate it cannot last something must break this strange indifference this strange dreamy egoism this strange loneliness of millions in a crowd something must break it why should it not be you and i can you do nothing else but guard relics  the shopman wore a gradually clearing expression which would have led those unsympathetic with the cause of the red lion to think that the last sentence was the only one to which he had attached any meaning  i am rather old to go into a new business he said and i dont quite know what to be either  why not said wayne gently having reached the crisis of his delicate persuasionwhy not be a colonel  it was at this point in all probability that the interview began to yield more disappointing results the man appeared inclined at first to regard the suggestion of becoming a colonel as outside the sphere of immediate and relevant discussion a long exposition of the inevitable war of independence coupled with the purchase of a doubtful sixteenthcentury sword for an exaggerated price seemed to resettle matters wayne left the shop however somewhat infected with the melancholy of its owner  that melancholy was completed at the barbers  shaving sir inquired that artist from inside his shop  war replied wayne standing on the threshold  i beg your pardon said the other sharply  war said wayne warmly but not for anything inconsistent with the beautiful and the civilised arts war for beauty war for society war for peace a great chance is offered you of repelling that slander which in defiance of the lives of so many artists attributes poltroonery to those who beautify and polish the surface of our lives why should not hairdressers be heroes why should not  now you get out said the barber irascibly we dont want any of your sort here you get out  and he came forward with the desperate annoyance of a mild person when enraged  adam wayne laid his hand for a moment on the sword then dropped it  notting hill he said will need her bolder sons and he turned gloomily to the toyshop  it was one of those queer little shops so constantly seen in the side streets of london which must be called toyshops only because toys upon the whole predominate for the remainder of goods seem to consist of almost everything else in the worldtobacco exercisebooks sweetstuff novelettes halfpenny paper clips halfpenny pencil sharpeners bootlaces and cheap fireworks it also sold newspapers and a row of dirtylooking posters hung along the front of it  i am afraid said wayne as he entered that i am not getting on with these tradesmen as i should is it that i have neglected to rise to the full meaning of their work is there some secret buried in each of these shops which no mere poet can discover  he stepped to the counter with a depression which he rapidly conquered as he addressed the man on the other side of ita man of short stature and hair prematurely white and the look of a large baby  sir said wayne i am going from house to house in this street of ours seeking to stir up some sense of the danger which now threatens our city nowhere have i felt my duty so difficult as here for the toyshop keeper has to do with all that remains to us of eden before the first wars began you sit here meditating continually upon the wants of that wonderful time when every staircase leads to the stars and every gardenpath to the other end of nowhere is it thoughtlessly do you think that i strike the dark old drum of peril in the paradise of children but consider a moment do not condemn me hastily even that paradise itself contains the rumour or beginning of that danger just as the eden that was made for perfection contained the terrible tree for judge childhood even by your own arsenal of its pleasures you keep bricks you make yourself thus doubtless the witness of the constructive instinct older than the destructive you keep dolls you make yourself the priest of that divine idolatry you keep noahs arks you perpetuate the memory of the salvation of all life as a precious an irreplaceable thing but do you keep only sir the symbols of this prehistoric sanity this childish rationality of the earth do you not keep more terrible things what are those boxes seemingly of lead soldiers that i see in that glass case are they not witnesses to that terror and beauty that desire for a lovely death which could not be excluded even from the immortality of eden do not despise the lead soldiers mr turnbull  i dont said mr turnbull of the toyshop shortly but with great emphasis  i am glad to hear it replied wayne i confess that i feared for my military schemes the awful innocence of your profession how i thought to myself will this man used only to the wooden swords that give pleasure think of the steel swords that give pain but i am at least partly reassured your tone suggests to me that i have at least the entry of a gate of your fairylandthe gate through which the soldiers enter for it cannot be deniedi ought sir no longer to deny that it is of soldiers that i come to speak let your gentle employment make you merciful towards the troubles of the world let your own silvery experience tone down our sanguine sorrows for there is war in notting hill  the little toyshop keeper sprang up suddenly slapping his fat hands like two fans on the counter  war he cried not really sir is it true oh what a joke oh what a sight for sore eyes  wayne was almost taken aback by this outburst  i am delighted he stammered i had no notion  he sprang out of the way just in time to avoid mr turnbull who took a flying leap over the counter and dashed to the front of the shop  you look here sir he said you just look here  he came back with two of the torn posters in his hand which were flapping outside his shop  look at those sir he said and flung them down on the counter  wayne bent over them and read on one  last fighting reduction of the central dervish city remarkable etc  on the other he read  last small republic annexed nicaraguan capital surrenders after a months fighting great slaughter  wayne bent over them again evidently puzzled then he looked at the dates they were both dated in august fifteen years before  why do you keep these old things he said startled entirely out of his absurd tact of mysticism why do you hang them outside your shop  because said the other simply they are the records of the last war you mentioned war just now it happens to be my hobby  wayne lifted his large blue eyes with an infantile wonder  come with me said turnbull shortly and led him into a parlour at the back of the shop  in the centre of the parlour stood a large deal table on it were set rows and rows of the tin and lead soldiers which were part of the shopkeepers stock the visitor would have thought nothing of it if it had not been for a certain odd grouping of them which did not seem either entirely commercial or entirely haphazard  you are acquainted no doubt said turnbull turning his big eyes upon wayneyou are acquainted no doubt with the arrangement of the american and nicaraguan troops in the last battle and he waved his hand towards the table  i am afraid not said wayne i  ah you were at that time occupied too much perhaps with the dervish affair you will find it in this corner and he pointed to a part of the floor where there was another arrangement of childrens soldiers grouped here and there  you seem said wayne to be interested in military matters  i am interested in nothing else answered the toyshop keeper simply  wayne appeared convulsed with a singular suppressed excitement  in that case he said i may approach you with an unusual degree of confidence touching the matter of the defence of notting hill i  defence of notting hill yes sir this way sir said turnbull with great perturbation just step into this side room and he led wayne into another apartment in which the table was entirely covered with an arrangement of childrens bricks a second glance at it told wayne that the bricks were arranged in the form of a precise and perfect plan of notting hill sir said turnbull impressively you have by a kind of accident hit upon the whole secret of my life as a boy i grew up among the last wars of the world when nicaragua was taken and the dervishes wiped out and i adopted it as a hobby sir as you might adopt astronomy or birdstuffing i had no illwill to any one but i was interested in war as a science as a game and suddenly i was bowled out the big powers of the world having swallowed up all the small ones came to that confounded agreement and there was no more war there was nothing more for me to do but to do what i do nowto read the old campaigns in dirty old newspapers and to work them out with tin soldiers one other thing had occurred to me i thought it an amusing fancy to make a plan of how this district or ours ought to be defended if it were ever attacked it seems to interest you too  if it were ever attacked repeated wayne awed into an almost mechanical enunciation mr turnbull it is attacked thank heaven i am bringing to at least one human being the news that is at bottom the only good news to any son of adam your life has not been useless your work has not been play now when the hair is already grey on your head turnbull you shall have your youth god has not destroyed he has only deferred it let us sit down here and you shall explain to me this military map of notting hill for you and i have to defend notting hill together  mr turnbull looked at the other for a moment then hesitated and then sat down beside the bricks and the stranger he did not rise again for seven hours when the dawn broke                                       the headquarters of provost adam wayne and his commanderinchief consisted of a small and somewhat unsuccessful milkshop at the corner of pump street the blank white morning had only just begun to break over the blank london buildings when wayne and turnbull were to be found seated in the cheerless and unswept shop wayne had something feminine in his character he belonged to that class of persons who forget their meals when anything interesting is in hand he had had nothing for sixteen hours but hurried glasses of milk and with a glass standing empty beside him he was writing and sketching and dotting and crossing out with inconceivable rapidity with a pencil and a piece of paper turnbull was of that more masculine type in which a sense of responsibility increases the appetite and with his sketchmap beside him he was dealing strenuously with a pile of sandwiches in a paper packet and a tankard of ale from the tavern opposite whose shutters had just been taken down neither of them spoke and there was no sound in the living stillness except the scratching of waynes pencil and the squealing of an aimlesslooking cat at length wayne broke the silence by saying  seventeen pounds eight shillings and ninepence  turnbull nodded and put his head in the tankard  that said wayne is not counting the five pounds you took yesterday what did you do with it  ah that is rather interesting replied turnbull with his mouth full i used that five pounds in a kindly and philanthropic act  wayne was gazing with mystification in his queer and innocent eyes  i used that five pounds continued the other in giving no less than forty little london boys rides in hansom cabs  are you insane asked the provost  it is only my light touch returned turnbull these hansomcab rides will raise the toneraise the tone my dear fellowof our london youths widen their horizon brace their nervous system make them acquainted with the various public monuments of our great city education wayne education how many excellent thinkers have pointed out that political reform is useless until we produce a cultured populace so that twenty years hence when these boys are grown up  mad said wayne laying down his pencil and five pounds gone  you are in error explained turnbull you grave creatures can never be brought to understand how much quicker work really goes with the assistance of nonsense and good meals stripped of its decorative beauties my statement was strictly accurate last night i gave forty halfcrowns to forty little boys and sent them all over london to take hansom cabs i told them in every case to tell the cabman to bring them to this spot in half an hour from now the declaration of war will be posted up at the same time the cabs will have begun to come in you will have ordered out the guard the little boys will drive up in state we shall commandeer the horses for cavalry use the cabs for barricade and give the men the choice between serving in our ranks and detention in our basements and cellars the little boys we can use as scouts the main thing is that we start the war with an advantage unknown in all the other armieshorses and now he said finishing his beer i will go and drill the troops  and he walked out of the milkshop leaving the provost staring  a minute or two afterwards the provost laughed he only laughed once or twice in his life and then he did it in a queer way as if it were an art he had not mastered even he saw something funny in the preposterous coup of the halfcrowns and the little boys he did not see the monstrous absurdity of the whole policy and the whole war he enjoyed it seriously as a crusade that is he enjoyed it far more than any joke can be enjoyed turnbull enjoyed it partly as a joke even more perhaps as a reversion from the things he hatedmodernity and monotony and civilisation to break up the vast machinery of modern life and use the fragments as engines of war to make the barricade of omnibuses and points of vantage of chimneypots was to him a game worth infinite risk and trouble he had that rational and deliberate preference which will always to the end trouble the peace of the world the rational and deliberate preference for a short life and a merry one     chapter iiithe experiment of mr buck   an earnest and eloquent petition was sent up to the king signed with the names of wilson barker buck swindon and others it urged that at the forthcoming conference to be held in his majestys presence touching the final disposition of the property in pump street it might be held not inconsistent with political decorum and with the unutterable respect they entertained for his majesty if they appeared in ordinary morning dress without the costume decreed for them as provosts so it happened that the company appeared at that council in frockcoats and that the king himself limited his love of ceremony to appearing after his not unusual manner in evening dress with one orderin this case not the garter but the button of the club of old clippers best pals a decoration obtained with difficulty from a halfpenny boys paper thus also it happened that the only spot of colour in the room was adam wayne who entered in great dignity with the great red robes and the great sword  we have met said auberon to decide the most arduous of modern problems may we be successful and he sat down gravely  buck turned his chair a little and flung one leg over the other  your majesty he said quite goodhumouredly there is only one thing i cant understand and that is why this affair is not settled in five minutes heres a small property which is worth a thousand to us and is not worth a hundred to any one else we offer the thousand its not businesslike i know for we ought to get it for less and its not reasonable and its not fair on us but im damned if i can see why its difficult  the difficulty may be very simply stated said wayne you may offer a million and it will be very difficult for you to get pump street  but look here mr wayne cried barker striking in with a kind of cold excitement just look here youve no right to take up a position like that youve a right to stand out for a bigger price but you arent doing that youre refusing what you and every sane man knows to be a splendid offer simply from malice or spiteit must be malice or spite and that kind of thing is really criminal its against the public good the kings government would be justified in forcing you  with his lean fingers spread on the table he stared anxiously at waynes face which did not move  in forcing you  it would he repeated  it shall said buck shortly turning to the table with a jerk we have done our best to be decent  wayne lifted his large eyes slowly  was it my lord buck he inquired who said that the king of england shall do something  buck flushed and said testily  i mean it mustit ought to as i say weve done our best to be generous i defy any one to deny it as it is mr wayne i dont want to say a word thats uncivil i hope its not uncivil to say that you can be and ought to be in gaol it is criminal to stop public works for a whim a man might as well burn ten thousand onions in his front garden or bring up his children to run naked in the street as do what you say you have a right to do people have been compelled to sell before now the king could compel you and i hope he will  until he does said wayne calmly the power and government of this great nation is on my side and not yours and i defy you to defy it  in what sense cried barker with his feverish eyes and hands is the government on your side  with one ringing movement wayne unrolled a great parchment on the table it was decorated down the sides with wild watercolour sketches of vestrymen in crowns and wreaths  the charter of the cities he began  buck exploded in a brutal oath and laughed  that tomfools joke havent we had enough  and there you sit cried wayne springing erect and with a voice like a trumpet with no argument but to insult the king before his face  buck rose also with blazing eyes  i am hard to bully he beganand the slow tones of the king struck in with incomparable gravity  my lord buck i must ask you to remember that your king is present it is not often that he needs to protect himself among his subjects  barker turned to him with frantic gestures  for gods sake dont back up the madman now he implored have your joke another time oh for heavens sake  my lord provost of south kensington said king auberon steadily i do not follow your remarks which are uttered with a rapidity unusual at court nor do your wellmeant efforts to convey the rest with your fingers materially assist me i say that my lord provost of north kensington to whom i spoke ought not in the presence of his sovereign to speak disrespectfully of his sovereigns ordinances do you disagree  barker turned restlessly in his chair and buck cursed without speaking the king went on in a comfortable voice  my lord provost of notting hill proceed  wayne turned his blue eyes on the king and to every ones surprise there was a look in them not of triumph but of a certain childish distress  i am sorry your majesty he said i fear i was more than equally to blame with the lord provost of north kensington we were debating somewhat eagerly and we both rose to our feet i did so first i am ashamed to say the provost of north kensington is therefore comparatively innocent i beseech your majesty to address your rebuke chiefly at least to me mr buck is not innocent for he did no doubt in the heat of the moment speak disrespectfully but the rest of the discussion he seems to me to have conducted with great good temper  buck looked genuinely pleased for business men are all simpleminded and have therefore that degree of communion with fanatics the king for some reason looked for the first time in his life ashamed  this very kind speech of the provost of notting hill began buck pleasantly seems to me to show that we have at least got on to a friendly footing now come mr wayne five hundred pounds have been offered to you for a property you admit not to be worth a hundred well i am a rich man and i wont be outdone in generosity let us say fifteen hundred pounds and have done with it and let us shake hands and he rose glowing and laughing  fifteen hundred pounds whispered mr wilson of bayswater can we do fifteen hundred pounds  ill stand the racket said buck heartily mr wayne is a gentleman and has spoken up for me so i suppose the negotiations are at an end  wayne bowed  they are indeed at an end i am sorry i cannot sell you the property  what cried mr barker starting to his feet  mr buck has spoken correctly said the king  i have i have cried buck springing up also i said  mr buck has spoken correctly said the king the negotiations are at an end  all the men at the table rose to their feet wayne alone rose without excitement  have i then he said your majestys permission to depart i have given my last answer  you have it said auberon smiling but not lifting his eyes from the table and amid a dead silence the provost of notting hill passed out of the room  well said wilson turning round to barkerwell  barker shook his head desperately  the man ought to be in an asylum he said but one thing is clearwe need not bother further about him the man can be treated as mad  of course said buck turning to him with sombre decisiveness youre perfectly right barker he is a good enough fellow but he can be treated as mad lets put it in simple form go and tell any twelve men in any town go and tell any doctor in any town that there is a man offered fifteen hundred pounds for a thing he could sell commonly for four hundred and that when asked for a reason for not accepting it he pleads the inviolate sanctity of notting hill and calls it the holy mountain what would they say what more can we have on our side than the common sense of everybody on what else do all laws rest ill tell you barker whats better than any further discussion lets send in workmen on the spot to pull down pump street and if old wayne says a word arrest him as a lunatic thats all  barkers eyes kindled  i always regarded you buck if you dont mind my saying so as a very strong man ill follow you  so of course will i said wilson  buck rose again impulsively  your majesty he said glowing with popularity i beseech your majesty to consider favourably the proposal to which we have committed ourselves your majestys leniency our own offers have fallen in vain on that extraordinary man he may be right he may be god he may be the devil but we think it for practical purposes more probable that he is off his head unless that assumption were acted on all human affairs would go to pieces we act on it and we propose to start operations in notting hill at once  the king leaned back in his chair  the charter of the cities  he said with a rich intonation  but buck being finally serious was also cautious and did not again make the mistake of disrespect  your majesty he said bowing i am not here to say a word against anything your majesty has said or done you are a far better educated man than i and no doubt there were reasons upon intellectual grounds for those proceedings but may i ask you and appeal to your common goodnature for a sincere answer when you drew up the charter of the cities did you contemplate the rise of a man like adam wayne did you expect that the charterwhether it was an experiment or a scheme of decoration or a jokecould ever really come to thisto stopping a vast scheme of ordinary business to shutting up a road to spoiling the chances of cabs omnibuses railway stations to disorganising half a city to risking a kind of civil war whatever were your objects were they that  barker and wilson looked at him admiringly the king more admiringly still  provost buck said auberon you speak in public uncommonly well i give you your point with the magnanimity of an artist my scheme did not include the appearance of mr wayne alas would that my poetic power had been great enough  i thank your majesty said buck courteously but quickly your majestys statements are always clear and studied therefore i may draw a deduction as the scheme whatever it was on which you set your heart did not include the appearance of mr wayne it will survive his removal why not let us clear away this particular pump street which does interfere with our plans and which does not by your majestys own statement interfere with yours  caught out said the king enthusiastically and quite impersonally as if he were watching a cricket match  this man wayne continued buck would be shut up by any doctors in england but we only ask to have it put before them meanwhile no ones interests not even in all probability his own can be really damaged by going on with the improvements in notting hill not our interests of course for it has been the hard and quiet work of ten years not the interests of notting hill for nearly all its educated inhabitants desire the change not the interests of your majesty for you say with characteristic sense that you never contemplated the rise of the lunatic at all not as i say his own interests for the man has a kind heart and many talents and a couple of good doctors would probably put him righter than all the free cities and sacred mountains in creation i therefore assume if i may use so bold a word that your majesty will not offer any obstacle to our proceeding with the improvements  and mr buck sat down amid subdued but excited applause among the allies  mr buck said the king i beg your pardon for a number of beautiful and sacred thoughts in which you were generally classified as a fool but there is another thing to be considered suppose you send in your workmen and mr wayne does a thing regrettable indeed but of which i am sorry to say i think him quite capableknocks their teeth out  i have thought of that your majesty said mr buck easily and i think it can simply be guarded against let us send in a strong guard of say a hundred mena hundred of the north kensington halberdiers he smiled grimly of whom your majesty is so fond or say a hundred and fifty the whole population of pump street i fancy is only about a hundred  still they might stand together and lick you said the king dubiously  then say two hundred said buck gaily  it might happen said the king restlessly that one notting hiller fought better than two north kensingtons  it might said buck coolly then say two hundred and fifty  the king bit his lip  and if they are beaten too he said viciously  your majesty said buck and leaned back easily in his chair suppose they are if anything be clear it is clear that all fighting matters are mere matters of arithmetic here we have a hundred and fifty say of notting hill soldiers or say two hundred if one of them can fight two of uswe can send in not four hundred but six hundred and smash him that is all it is out of all immediate probability that one of them could fight four of us so what i say is this run no risks finish it at once send in eight hundred men and smash himsmash him almost without seeing him and go on with the improvements  and mr buck pulled out a bandanna and blew his nose  do you know mr buck said the king staring gloomily at the table the admirable clearness of your reason produces in my mind a sentiment which i trust i shall not offend you by describing as an aspiration to punch your head you irritate me sublimely what can it be in me is it the relic of a moral sense  but your majesty said barker eagerly and suavely does not refuse our proposals  my dear barker your proposals are as damnable as your manners i want to have nothing to do with them suppose i stopped them altogether what would happen  barker answered in a very low voice  revolution  the king glanced quickly at the men round the table they were all looking down silently their brows were red  he rose with a startling suddenness and an unusual pallor  gentlemen he said you have overruled me therefore i can speak plainly i think adam wayne who is as mad as a hatter worth more than a million of you but you have the force and i admit the common sense and he is lost take your eight hundred halberdiers and smash him it would be more sportsmanlike to take two hundred  more sportsmanlike said buck grimly but a great deal less humane we are not artists and streets purple with gore do not catch our eye in the right way  it is pitiful said auberon with five or six times their number there will be no fight at all  i hope not said buck rising and adjusting his gloves we desire no fight your majesty we are peaceable business men  well said the king wearily the conference is at an end at last  and he went out of the room before any one else could stir                                       forty workmen a hundred bayswater halberdiers two hundred from south and three from north kensington assembled at the foot of holland walk and marched up it under the general direction of barker who looked flushed and happy in full dress at the end of the procession a small and sulky figure lingered like an urchin it was the king  barker he said at length appealingly you are an old friend of mineyou understand my hobbies as i understand yours why cant you let it alone i hoped that such fun might come out of this wayne business why cant you let it alone it doesnt really so much matter to youwhats a road or so for me its the one joke that may save me from pessimism take fewer men and give me an hours fun really and truly james if you collected coins or hummingbirds and i could buy one with the price of your road i would buy it i collect incidentsthose rare those precious things let me have one pay a few pounds for it give these notting hillers a chance let them alone  auberon said barker kindly forgetting all royal titles in a rare moment of sincerity i do feel what you mean i have had moments when these hobbies have hit me i have had moments when i have sympathised with your humours i have had moments though you may not easily believe it when i have sympathised with the madness of adam wayne but the world auberon the real world is not run on these hobbies it goes on great brutal wheels of factswheels on which you are the butterfly and wayne is the fly on the wheel  auberons eyes looked frankly at the others  thank you james what you say is true it is only a parenthetical consolation to me to compare the intelligence of flies somewhat favourably with the intelligence of wheels but it is the nature of flies to die soon and the nature of wheels to go on for ever go on with the wheel goodbye old man  and james barker went on laughing with a high colour slapping his bamboo on his leg  the king watched the tail of the retreating regiment with a look of genuine depression which made him seem more like a baby than ever then he swung round and struck his hands together  in a world without humour he said the only thing to do is to eat and how perfect an exception how can these people strike dignified attitudes and pretend that things matter when the total ludicrousness of life is proved by the very method by which it is supported a man strikes the lyre and says life is real life is earnest and then goes into a room and stuffs alien substances into a hole in his head i think nature was indeed a little broad in her humour in these matters but we all fall back on the pantomime as i have in this municipal affair nature has her farces like the act of eating or the shape of the kangaroo for the more brutal appetite she keeps her stars and mountains for those who can appreciate something more subtly ridiculous he turned to his equerry but as i said eating let us have a picnic like two nice little children just run and bring me a table and a dozen courses or so and plenty of champagne and under these swinging boughs bowler we will return to nature  it took about an hour to erect in holland lane the monarchs simple repast during which time he walked up and down and whistled but still with an unaffected air of gloom he had really been done out of a pleasure he had promised himself and had that empty and sickened feeling which a child has when disappointed of a pantomime when he and the equerry had sat down however and consumed a fair amount of dry champagne his spirits began mildly to revive  things take too long in this world he said i detest all this barkerian business about evolution and the gradual modification of things i wish the world had been made in six days and knocked to pieces again in six more and i wish i had done it the jokes good enough in a broad way sun and moon and the image of god and all that but they keep it up so damnably long did you ever long for a miracle bowler  no sir said bowler who was an evolutionist and had been carefully brought up  then i have answered the king i have walked along a street with the best cigar in the cosmos in my mouth and more burgundy inside me than you ever saw in your life and longed that the lamppost would turn into an elephant to save me from the hell of blank existence take my word for it my evolutionary bowler dont you believe people when they tell you that people sought for a sign and believed in miracles because they were ignorant they did it because they were wise filthily vilely wisetoo wise to eat or sleep or put on their boots with patience this seems delightfully like a new theory of the origin of christianity which would itself be a thing of no mean absurdity take some more wine  the wind blew round them as they sat at their little table with its white cloth and bright winecups and flung the treetops of holland park against each other but the sun was in that strong temper which turns green into gold the king pushed away his plate lit a cigar slowly and went on  yesterday i thought that something next door to a really entertaining miracle might happen to me before i went to amuse the worms to see that redhaired maniac waving a great sword and making speeches to his incomparable followers would have been a glimpse of that land of youth from which the fates shut us out i had planned some quite delightful things a congress of knightsbridge with a treaty and myself in the chair and perhaps a roman triumph with jolly old barker led in chains and now these wretched prigs have gone and stamped out the exquisite mr wayne altogether and i suppose they will put him in a private asylum somewhere in their damned humane way think of the treasures daily poured out to his unappreciative keeper i wonder whether they would let me be his keeper but life is a vale never forget at any moment of your existence to regard it in the light of a vale this graceful habit if not acquired in youth  the king stopped with his cigar lifted for there had slid into his eyes the startled look of a man listening he did not move for a few moments then he turned his head sharply towards the high thin and lathlike paling which fenced certain long gardens and similar spaces from the lane from behind it there was coming a curious scrambling and scraping noise as of a desperate thing imprisoned in this box of thin wood the king threw away his cigar and jumped on to the table from this position he saw a pair of hands hanging with a hungry clutch on the top of the fence then the hands quivered with a convulsive effort and a head shot up between themthe head of one of the bayswater town council his eyes and whiskers wild with fear he swung himself over and fell on the other side on his face and groaned openly and without ceasing the next moment the thin taut wood of the fence was struck as by a bullet so that it reverberated like a drum and over it came tearing and cursing with torn clothes and broken nails and bleeding faces twenty men at one rush the king sprang five feet clear off the table on to the ground the moment after the table was flung over sending bottles and glasses flying and the débris was literally swept along the ground by that stream of men pouring past and bowler was borne along with them as the king said in his famous newspaper article like a captured bride the great fence swung and split under the load of climbers that still scaled and cleared it tremendous gaps were torn in it by this living artillery and through them the king could see more and more frantic faces as in a dream and more and more men running they were as miscellaneous as if some one had taken the lid off a human dustbin some were untouched some were slashed and battered and bloody some were splendidly dressed some tattered and half naked some were in the fantastic garb of the burlesque cities some in the dullest modern dress the king stared at all of them but none of them looked at the king suddenly he stepped forward  barker he said what is all this  beaten said the politicianbeaten all to hell and he plunged past with nostrils shaking like a horses and more and more men plunged after him  almost as he spoke the last standing strip of fence bowed and snapped flinging as from a catapult a new figure upon the road he wore the flaming red of the halberdiers of notting hill and on his weapon there was blood and in his face victory in another moment masses of red glowed through the gaps of the fence and the pursuers with their halberds came pouring down the lane pursued and pursuers alike swept by the little figure with the owlish eyes who had not taken his hands out of his pockets  the king had still little beyond the confused sense of a man caught in a torrentthe feeling of men eddying by then something happened which he was never able afterwards to describe and which we cannot describe for him suddenly in the dark entrance between the broken gates of a garden there appeared framed a flaming figure  adam wayne the conqueror with his face flung back and his mane like a lions stood with his great sword point upwards the red raiment of his office flapping round him like the red wings of an archangel and the king saw he knew not how something new and overwhelming the great green trees and the great red robes swung together in the wind the sword seemed made for the sunlight the preposterous masquerade born of his own mockery towered over him and embraced the world this was the normal this was sanity this was nature and he himself with his rationality and his detachment and his black frockcoat he was the exception and the accidenta blot of black upon a world of crimson and gold     book iv     chapter ithe battle of the lamps   mr buck who though retired frequently went down to his big drapery stores in kensington high street was locking up those premises being the last to leave it was a wonderful evening of green and gold but that did not trouble him very much if you had pointed it out he would have agreed seriously for the rich always desire to be artistic  he stepped out into the cool air buttoning up his light yellow coat and blowing great clouds from his cigar when a figure dashed up to him in another yellow overcoat but unbuttoned and flying behind him  hullo barker said the draper any of our summer articles youre too late factory acts barker humanity and progress my boy  oh dont chatter cried barker stamping weve been beaten  beatenby what asked buck mystified  by wayne  buck looked at barkers fierce white face for the first time as it gleamed in the lamplight  come and have a drink he said  they adjourned to a cushioned and glaring buffet and buck established himself slowly and lazily in a seat and pulled out his cigarcase  have a smoke he said  barker was still standing and on the fret but after a moments hesitation he sat down as if he might spring up again the next minute they ordered drinks in silence  how did it happen asked buck turning his big bold eyes on him  how the devil do i know cried barker it happened likelike a dream how can two hundred men beat six hundred how can they  well said buck coolly how did they you ought to know  i dont know i cant describe said the other drumming on the table it seemed like this we were six hundred and marched with those damned poleaxes of auberonsthe only weapons weve got we marched two abreast we went up holland walk between the high palings which seemed to me to go straight as an arrow for pump street i was near the tail of the line and it was a long one when the end of it was still between the high palings the head of the line was already crossing holland park avenue then the head plunged into the network of narrow streets on the other side and the tail and myself came out on the great crossing when we also had reached the northern side and turned up a small street that points crookedly as it were towards pump street the whole thing felt different the streets dodged and bent so much that the head of our line seemed lost altogether it might as well have been in north america and all this time we hadnt seen a soul  illustration map of the seat of war  buck who was idly dabbing the ash of his cigar on the ashtray began to move it deliberately over the table making feathery grey lines a kind of map  but though the little streets were all deserted which got a trifle on my nerves as we got deeper and deeper into them a thing began to happen that i couldnt understand sometimes a long way aheadthree turns or corners ahead as it werethere broke suddenly a sort of noise clattering and confused cries and then stopped then when it happened something i cant describe ita kind of shake or stagger went down the line as if the line were a live thing whose head had been struck or had been an electric cord none of us knew why we were moving but we moved and jostled then we recovered and went on through the little dirty streets round corners and up twisted ways the little crooked streets began to give me a feeling i cant explainas if it were a dream i felt as if things had lost their reason and we should never get out of the maze odd to hear me talk like that isnt it the streets were quite wellknown streets all down on the map but the fact remains i wasnt afraid of something happening i was afraid of nothing ever happeningnothing ever happening for all gods eternity  he drained his glass and called for more whisky he drank it and went on  and then something did happen buck its the solemn truth that nothing has ever happened to you in your life nothing had ever happened to me in my life  nothing ever happened said buck staring what do you mean  nothing has ever happened repeated barker with a morbid obstinacy you dont know what a thing happening means you sit in your office expecting customers and customers come you walk in the street expecting friends and friends meet you you want a drink and get it you feel inclined for a bet and make it you expect either to win or lose and you do either one or the other but things happening and he shuddered ungovernably  go on said buck shortly get on  as we walked wearily round the corners something happened when something happens it happens first and you see it afterwards it happens of itself and you have nothing to do with it it proves a dreadful thingthat there are other things besides ones self i can only put it in this way we went round one turning two turnings three turnings four turnings five then i lifted myself slowly up from the gutter where i had been shot half senseless and was beaten down again by living men crashing on top of me and the world was full of roaring and big men rolling about like ninepins  buck looked at his map with knitted brows  was that portobello road he asked  yes said barkeryes portobello road i saw it afterwards but my god what a place it was buck have you ever stood and let a six foot of man lash and lash at your head with six feet of pole with six pounds of steel at the end because when you have had that experience as walt whitman says you reexamine philosophies and religions  i have no doubt said buck if that was portobello road dont you see what happened  i know what happened exceedingly well i was knocked down four times an experience which as i say has an effect on the mental attitude and another thing happened too i knocked down two men after the fourth fall there was not much bloodshedmore brutal rushing and throwingfor nobody could use their weapons after the fourth fall i say i got up like a devil and i tore a poleaxe out of a mans hand and struck where i saw the scarlet of waynes fellows struck again and again two of them went over bleeding on the stones thank god and i laughed and found myself sprawling in the gutter again and got up again and struck again and broke my halberd to pieces i hurt a mans head though  buck set down his glass with a bang and spat out curses through his thick moustache  what is the matter asked barker stopping for the man had been calm up to now and now his agitation was far more violent than his own  the matter said buck bitterly dont you see how these maniacs have got us why should two idiots one a clown and the other a screaming lunatic make sane men so different from themselves look here barker i will give you a picture a very wellbred young man of this century is dancing about in a frockcoat he has in his hands a nonsensical seventeenthcentury halberd with which he is trying to kill men in a street in notting hill damn it dont you see how theyve got us never mind how you feltthat is how you looked the king would put his cursed head on one side and call it exquisite the provost of notting hill would put his cursed nose in the air and call it heroic but in heavens name what would you have called ittwo days before  barker bit his lip  you havent been through it buck he said you dont understand fightingthe atmosphere  i dont deny the atmosphere said buck striking the table i only say its their atmosphere its adam waynes atmosphere its the atmosphere which you and i thought had vanished from an educated world for ever  well it hasnt said barker and if you have any lingering doubts lend me a poleaxe and ill show you  there was a long silence and then buck turned to his neighbour and spoke in that goodtempered tone that comes of a power of looking facts in the facethe tone in which he concluded great bargains  barker he said you are right this old thingthis fighting has come back it has come back suddenly and taken us by surprise so it is first blood to adam wayne but unless reason and arithmetic and everything else have gone crazy it must be next and last blood to us but when an issue has really arisen there is only one thing to doto study that issue as such and win in it barker since it is fighting we must understand fighting i must understand fighting as coolly and completely as i understand drapery you must understand fighting as coolly and completely as you understand politics now look at the facts i stick without hesitation to my original formula fighting when we have the stronger force is only a matter of arithmetic it must be you asked me just now how two hundred men could defeat six hundred i can tell you two hundred men can defeat six hundred when the six hundred behave like fools when they forget the very conditions they are fighting in when they fight in a swamp as if it were a mountain when they fight in a forest as if it were a plain when they fight in streets without remembering the object of streets  what is the object of streets asked barker  what is the object of supper cried buck furiously isnt it obvious this military science is mere common sense the object of a street is to lead from one place to another therefore all streets join therefore street fighting is quite a peculiar thing you advanced into that hive of streets as if you were advancing into an open plain where you could see everything instead of that you were advancing into the bowels of a fortress with streets pointing at you streets turning on you streets jumping out at you and all in the hands of the enemy do you know what portobello road is it is the only point on your journey where two side streets run up opposite each other wayne massed his men on the two sides and when he had let enough of your line go past cut it in two like a worm dont you see what would have saved you  barker shook his head  cant your atmosphere help you asked buck bitterly must i attempt explanations in the romantic manner suppose that as you were fighting blindly with the red notting hillers who imprisoned you on both sides you had heard a shout from behind them suppose oh romantic barker that behind the red tunics you had seen the blue and gold of south kensington taking them in the rear surrounding them in their turn and hurling them on to your halberds  if the thing had been possible began barker cursing  the thing would have been as possible said buck simply as simple as arithmetic there are a certain number of street entries that lead to pump street there are not nine hundred there are not nine million they do not grow in the night they do not increase like mushrooms it must be possible with such an overwhelming force as we have to advance by all of them at once in every one of the arteries or approaches we can put almost as many men as wayne can put into the field altogether once do that and we have him to demonstration it is like a proposition of euclid  you think that is certain said barker anxious but dominated delightfully  ill tell you what i think said buck getting up jovially i think adam wayne made an uncommonly spirited little fight and i think i am confoundedly sorry for him  buck you are a great man cried barker rising also youve knocked me sensible again i am ashamed to say it but i was getting romantic of course what you say is adamantine sense fighting being physical must be mathematical we were beaten because we were neither mathematical nor physical nor anything elsebecause we deserved to be beaten hold all the approaches and with our force we must have him when shall we open the next campaign  now said buck and walked out of the bar  now cried barker following him eagerly do you mean now it is so late  buck turned on him stamping  do you think fighting is under the factory acts he said and he called a cab notting hill gate station he said and the two drove off                                       a genuine reputation can sometimes be made in an hour buck in the next sixty or eighty minutes showed himself a really great man of action his cab carried him like a thunderbolt from the king to wilson from wilson to swindon from swindon to barker again if his course was jagged it had the jaggedness of the lightning only two things he carried with himhis inevitable cigar and the map of north kensington and notting hill there were as he again and again pointed out with every variety of persuasion and violence only nine possible ways of approaching pump street within a quarter of a mile round it three out of westbourne grove two out of ladbroke grove and four out of notting hill high street and he had detachments of two hundred each stationed at every one of the entrances before the last green of that strange sunset had sunk out of the black sky  the sky was particularly black and on this alone was one false protest raised against the triumphant optimism of the provost of north kensington he overruled it with his infectious common sense  there is no such thing he said as night in london you have only to follow the line of street lamps look here is the map two hundred purple north kensington soldiers under myself march up ossington street two hundred more under captain bruce of the north kensington guard up clanricarde gardens1 two hundred yellow west kensingtons under provost swindon attack from pembridge road two hundred more of my men from the eastern streets leading away from queens road two detachments of yellows enter by two roads from westbourne grove lastly two hundred green bayswaters come down from the north through chepstow place and two hundred more under provost wilson himself through the upper part of pembridge road gentlemen it is mate in two moves the enemy must either mass in pump street and be cut to pieces or they must retreat past the gaslight  coke co and rush on my four hundred or they must retreat past st lukes church and rush on the six hundred from the west unless we are all mad its plain come on to your quarters and await captain braces signal to advance then you have only to walk up a line of gaslamps and smash this nonsense by pure mathematics tomorrow we shall all be civilians again  footnote 1 clanricarde gardens at this time was no longer a culdesac but was connected by pump street to pembridge square see map  his optimism glowed like a great fire in the night and ran round the terrible ring in which wayne was now held helpless the fight was already over one mans energy for one hour had saved the city from war  for the next ten minutes buck walked up and down silently beside the motionless clump of his two hundred he had not changed his appearance in any way except to sling across his yellow overcoat a case with a revolver in it so that his lightclad modern figure showed up oddly beside the pompous purple uniforms of his halberdiers which darkly but richly coloured the black night  at length a shrill trumpet rang from some way up the street it was the signal of advance buck briefly gave the word and the whole purple line with its dimly shining steel moved up the side alley before it was a slope of street long straight and shining in the dark it was a sword pointed at pump street the heart at which nine other swords were pointed that night  a quarter of an hours silent marching brought them almost within earshot of any tumult in the doomed citadel but still there was no sound and no sign of the enemy this time at any rate they knew that they were closing in on it mechanically and they marched on under the lamplight and the dark without any of that eerie sense of ignorance which barker had felt when entering the hostile country by one avenue alone  haltpoint arms cried buck suddenly and as he spoke there came a clatter of feet tumbling along the stones but the halberds were levelled in vain the figure that rushed up was a messenger from the contingent of the north  victory mr buck he cried panting they are ousted provost wilson of bayswater has taken pump street  buck ran forward in his excitement  then which way are they retreating it must be either by st lukes to meet swindon or by the gas company to meet us run like mad to swindon and see that the yellows are holding the st lukes road we will hold this never fear we have them in an iron trap run  as the messenger dashed away into the darkness the great guard of north kensington swung on with the certainty of a machine yet scarcely a hundred yards further their halberdpoints again fell in line gleaming in the gaslight for again a clatter of feet was heard on the stones and again it proved to be only the messenger  mr provost he said the yellow west kensingtons have been holding the road by st lukes for twenty minutes since the capture of pump street pump street is not two hundred yards away they cannot be retreating down that road  then they are retreating down this said provost buck with a final cheerfulness and by good fortune down a welllighted road though it twists about forward  as they moved along the last three hundred yards of their journey buck fell for the first time in his life perhaps into a kind of philosophical reverie for men of his type are always made kindly and as it were melancholy by success  i am sorry for poor old wayne i really am he thought he spoke up splendidly for me at that council and he blacked old barkers eye with considerable spirit but i dont see what a man can expect when he fights against arithmetic to say nothing of civilisation and what a wonderful hoax all this military genius is i suspect ive just discovered what cromwell discovered that a sensible tradesman is the best general and that a man who can buy men and sell men can lead and kill them the things simply like adding up a column in a ledger if wayne has two hundred men he cant put two hundred men in nine places at once if theyre ousted from pump street theyre flying somewhere if theyre not flying past the church theyre flying past the works and so we have them we business men should have no chance at all except that cleverer people than we get bees in their bonnets that prevent them from reasoning properlyso we reason alone and so i who am comparatively stupid see things as god sees them as a vast machine my god whats this and he clapped his hands to his eyes and staggered back  then through the darkness he cried in a dreadful voice  did i blaspheme god i am struck blind  what wailed another voice behind him the voice of a certain wilfred jarvis of north kensington  blind cried buck blind  im blind too cried jarvis in an agony  fools all of you said a gross voice behind them were all blind the lamps have gone out  the lamps but why where cried buck turning furiously in the darkness how are we to get on how are we to chase the enemy where have they gone  the enemy went said the rough voice behind and then stopped doubtfully  where shouted buck stamping like a madman  they went said the gruff voice past the gas works and theyve used their chance  great god thundered buck and snatched at his revolver do you mean theyve turned out  but almost before he had spoken the words he was hurled like a stone from catapult into the midst of his own men  notting hill notting hill cried frightful voices out of the darkness and they seemed to come from all sides for the men of north kensington unacquainted with the road had lost all their bearings in the black world of blindness  notting hill notting hill cried the invisible people and the invaders were hewn down horribly with black steel with steel that gave no glint against any light                                       buck though badly maimed with the blow of a halberd kept an angry but splendid sanity he groped madly for the wall and found it struggling with crawling fingers along it he found a side opening and retreated into it with the remnants of his men their adventures during that prodigious night are not to be described they did not know whether they were going towards or away from the enemy not knowing where they themselves were or where their opponents were it was mere irony to ask where was the rest of their army for a thing had descended upon them which london does not knowdarkness which was before the stars were made and they were as much lost in it as if they had been made before the stars every now and then as those frightful hours wore on they buffeted in the darkness against living men who struck at them and at whom they struck with an idiot fury when at last the grey dawn came they found they had wandered back to the edge of the uxbridge road they found that in those horrible eyeless encounters the north kensingtons and the bayswaters and the west kensingtons had again and again met and butchered each other and they heard that adam wayne was barricaded in pump street     chapter iithe correspondent of the court journal   journalism had become like most other such things in england under the cautious government and philosophy represented by james barker somewhat sleepy and much diminished in importance this was partly due to the disappearance of party government and public speaking partly to the compromise or deadlock which had made foreign wars impossible but mostly of course to the temper of the whole nation which was that of a people in a kind of backwater perhaps the most well known of the remaining newspapers was the court journal which was published in a dusty but genteellooking office just out of kensington high street for when all the papers of a people have been for years growing more and more dim and decorous and optimistic the dimmest and most decorous and most optimistic is very likely to win in the journalistic competition which was still going on at the beginning of the twentieth century the final victor was the court journal  for some mysterious reason the king had a great affection for hanging about in the court journal office smoking a morning cigarette and looking over files like all ingrainedly idle men he was very fond of lounging and chatting in places where other people were doing work but one would have thought that even in the prosaic england of his day he might have found a more bustling centre  on this particular morning however he came out of kensington palace with a more alert step and a busier air than usual he wore an extravagantly long frockcoat a palegreen waistcoat a very full and dégagé black tie and curious yellow gloves this was his uniform as colonel of a regiment of his own creation the 1st decadents green it was a beautiful sight to see him drilling them he walked quickly across the park and the high street lighting his cigarette as he went and flung open the door of the court journal office  youve heard the news pallyyouve heard the news he said  the editors name was hoskins but the king called him pally which was an abbreviation of paladium of our liberties  well your majesty said hoskins slowly he was a worried gentlemanly looking person with a wandering brown beardwell your majesty i have heard rather curious things but i  youll hear more of them said the king dancing a few steps of a kind of negro shuffle youll hear more of them my bloodandthunder tribune do you know what i am going to do for you  no your majesty replied the paladium vaguely  im going to put your paper on strong dashing enterprising lines said the king now where are your posters of last nights defeat  i did not propose your majesty said the editor to have any posters exactly  paper paper cried the king wildly bring me paper as big as a house ill do you posters stop i must take my coat off he began removing that garment with an air of set intensity flung it playfully at mr hoskins head entirely enveloping him and looked at himself in the glass the coat off he said and the hat on that looks like a subeditor it is indeed the very essence of subediting well he continued turning round abruptly come along with that paper  the paladium had only just extricated himself reverently from the folds of the kings frockcoat and said bewildered  i am afraid your majesty  oh youve got no enterprise said auberon whats that roll in the corner wallpaper decorations for your private residence art in the home pally fling it over here and ill paint such posters on the back of it that when you put it up in your drawingroom youll paste the original pattern against the wall and the king unrolled the wallpaper spreading it over the whole floor now give me the scissors he cried and took them himself before the other could stir  he slit the paper into about five pieces each nearly as big as a door then he took a big blue pencil and went down on his knees on the dusty oilcloth and began to write on them in huge letters  from the front general buck defeated darkness danger and death wayne said to be in pump street feeling in the city  he contemplated it for some time with his head on one side and got up with a sigh  not quite intense enough he saidnot alarming i want the court journal to be feared as well as loved lets try something more hardhitting and he went down on his knees again after sucking the blue pencil for some time he began writing again busily how will this do he said       waynes wonderful victory  i suppose he said looking up appealingly and sucking the pencili suppose we couldnt say wictorywaynes wonderful wictory no no refinement pally refinement i have it  wayne wins astounding fight in the dark the gaslamps in their courses fought against buck  nothing like our fine old english translation what else can we say well anything to annoy old buck and he added thoughtfully in smaller letters       rumoured courtmartial on general buck  those will do for the present he said and turned them both face downwards paste please  the paladium with an air of great terror brought the paste out of an inner room  the king slabbed it on with the enjoyment of a child messing with treacle then taking one of his huge compositions fluttering in each hand he ran outside and began pasting them up in prominent positions over the front of the office  and now said auberon entering again with undiminished vivacitynow for the leading article  he picked up another of the large strips of wallpaper and laying it across a desk pulled out a fountainpen and began writing with feverish intensity reading clauses and fragments aloud to himself and rolling them on his tongue like wine to see if they had the pure journalistic flavour  the news of the disaster to our forces in notting hill awful as it isawful as it isno distressing as it is may do some good if it draws attention to the whatshisname inefficiency scandalous inefficiency of course of the governments preparations in our present state of information it would be premature what a jolly wordit would be premature to cast any reflections upon the conduct of general buck whose services upon so many stricken fields ha ha and whose honourable scars and laurels give him a right to have judgment upon him at least suspended but there is one matter on which we must speak plainly we have been silent on it too long from feelings perhaps of mistaken caution perhaps of mistaken loyalty this situation would never have arisen but for what we can only call the indefensible conduct of the king it pains us to say such things but speaking as we do in the public interests i plagiarise from barkers famous epigram we shall not shrink because of the distress we may cause to any individual even the most exalted at this crucial moment of our country the voice of the people demands with a single tongue where is the king what is he doing while his subjects tear each other in pieces in the streets of a great city are his amusements and his dissipations of which we cannot pretend to be ignorant so engrossing that he can spare no thought for a perishing nation it is with a deep sense of our responsibility that we warn that exalted person that neither his great position nor his incomparable talents will save him in the hour of delirium from the fate of all those who in the madness of luxury or tyranny have met the english people in the rare day of its wrath  i am now said the king going to write an account of the battle by an eyewitness and he picked up a fourth sheet of wallpaper almost at the same moment buck strode quickly into the office he had a bandage round his head  i was told he said with his usual gruff civility that your majesty was here  and of all things on earth cried the king with delight here is an eyewitness an eyewitness who i regret to observe has at present only one eye to witness with can you write us the special article buck have you a rich style  buck with a selfrestraint which almost approached politeness took no notice whatever of the kings maddening geniality  i took the liberty your majesty he said shortly of asking mr barker to come here also  as he spoke indeed barker came swinging into the office with his usual air of hurry  what is happening now asked buck turning to him with a kind of relief  fighting still going on said barker the four hundred from west kensington were hardly touched last night they hardly got near the place poor wilsons bayswater men got cut about though they fought confoundedly well they took pump street once what mad things do happen in the world to think that of all of us it should be little wilson with the red whiskers who came out best  the king made a note on his paper       romantic conduct of mr wilson  yes said buck it makes one a bit less proud of ones hs  the king suddenly folded or crumpled up the paper and put it in his pocket  i have an idea he said i will be an eyewitness i will write you such letters from the front as will be more gorgeous than the real thing give me my coat paladium i entered this room a mere king of england i leave it special war correspondent of the court journal it is useless to stop me pally it is vain to cling to my knees buck it is hopeless barker to weep upon my neck when duty callsthe remainder of the sentiment escapes me you will receive my first article this evening by the eightoclock post  and running out of the office he jumped upon a blue bayswater omnibus that went swinging by  well said barker gloomily well  barker said buck business may be lower than politics but war is as i discovered last night a long sight more like business you politicians are such ingrained demagogues that even when you have a despotism you think of nothing but public opinion so you learn to tack and run and are afraid of the first breeze now we stick to a thing and get it and our mistakes help us look here at this moment weve beaten wayne  beaten wayne repeated barker  why the dickens not cried the other flinging out his hands look here i said last night that we had them by holding the nine entrances well i was wrong we should have had them but for a singular eventthe lamps went out but for that it was certain has it occurred to you my brilliant barker that another singular event has happened since that singular event of the lamps going out  what event asked barker  by an astounding coincidence the sun has risen cried out buck with a savage air of patience why the hell arent we holding all those approaches now and passing in on them again it should have been done at sunrise the confounded doctor wouldnt let me go out you were in command  barker smiled grimly  it is a gratification to me my dear buck to be able to say that we anticipated your suggestions precisely we went as early as possible to reconnoitre the nine entrances unfortunately while we were fighting each other in the dark like a lot of drunken navvies mr waynes friends were working very hard indeed three hundred yards from pump street at every one of those entrances there is a barricade nearly as high as the houses they were finishing the last in pembridge road when we arrived our mistakes he cried bitterly and flung his cigarette on the ground it is not we who learn from them  there was a silence for a few moments and barker lay back wearily in a chair the office clock ticked exactly in the stillness  at length barker said suddenly  buck does it ever cross your mind what this is all about the hammersmith to maida vale thoroughfare was an uncommonly good speculation you and i hoped a great deal from it but is it worth it it will cost us thousands to crush this ridiculous riot suppose we let it alone  and be thrashed in public by a redhaired madman whom any two doctors would lock up cried out buck starting to his feet what do you propose to do mr barker to apologise to the admirable mr wayne to kneel to the charter of the cities to clasp to your bosom the flag of the red lion to kiss in succession every sacred lamppost that saved notting hill no by god my men fought jolly wellthey were beaten by a trick and theyll fight again  buck said barker i always admired you and you were quite right in what you said the other day  in what  in saying said barker rising quietly that we had all got into adam waynes atmosphere and out of our own my friend the whole territorial kingdom of adam wayne extends to about nine streets with barricades at the end of them but the spiritual kingdom of adam wayne extends god knows whereit extends to this office at any rate the redhaired madman whom any two doctors would lock up is filling this room with his roaring unreasonable soul and it was the redhaired madman who said the last word you spoke  buck walked to the window without replying you understand of course he said at last i do not dream of giving in                                       the king meanwhile was rattling along on the top of his blue omnibus the traffic of london as a whole had not of course been greatly disturbed by these events for the affair was treated as a notting hill riot and that area was marked off as if it had been in the hands of a gang of recognised rioters the blue omnibuses simply went round as they would have done if a road were being mended and the omnibus on which the correspondent of the court journal was sitting swept round the corner of queens road bayswater  the king was alone on the top of the vehicle and was enjoying the speed at which it was going  forward my beauty my arab he said patting the omnibus encouragingly fleetest of all thy bounding tribe are thy relations with thy driver i wonder those of the bedouin and his steed does he sleep side by side with thee  his meditations were broken by a sudden and jarring stoppage looking over the edge he saw that the heads of the horses were being held by men in the uniform of waynes army and heard the voice of an officer calling out orders  illustration king auberon descended from the omnibus with dignity  king auberon descended from the omnibus with dignity the guard or picket of red halberdiers who had stopped the vehicle did not number more than twenty and they were under the command of a short dark cleverlooking young man conspicuous among the rest as being clad in an ordinary frockcoat but girt round the waist with a red sash and a long seventeenthcentury sword a shiny silk hat and spectacles completed the outfit in a pleasing manner  to whom have i the honour of speaking said the king endeavouring to look like charles i in spite of personal difficulties  the dark man in spectacles lifted his hat with equal gravity  my name is bowles he said i am a chemist i am also a captain of o company of the army of notting hill i am distressed at having to incommode you by stopping the omnibus but this area is covered by our proclamation and we intercept all traffic may i ask to whom i have the honourwhy good gracious i beg your majestys pardon i am quite overwhelmed at finding myself concerned with the king  auberon put up his hand with indescribable grandeur  not with the king he said with the special war correspondent of the court journal  i beg your majestys pardon began mr bowles doubtfully  do you call me majesty i repeat said auberon firmly i am a representative of the press i have chosen with a deep sense of responsibility the name of pinker i should desire a veil to be drawn over the past  very well sir said mr bowles with an air of submission in our eyes the sanctity of the press is at least as great as that of the throne we desire nothing better than that our wrongs and our glories should be widely known may i ask mr pinker if you have any objection to being presented to the provost and to general turnbull  the provost i have had the honour of meeting said auberon easily we old journalists you know meet everybody i should be most delighted to have the same honour again general turnbull also it would be a gratification to know the younger men are so interesting we of the old fleet street gang lose touch with them  will you be so good as to step this way said the leader of o company  i am always good said mr pinker lead on     chapter iiithe great army of south kensington   the article from the special correspondent of the court journal arrived in due course written on very coarse copypaper in the kings arabesque of handwriting in which three words filled a page and yet were illegible moreover the contribution was the more perplexing at first as it opened with a succession of erased paragraphs the writer appeared to have attempted the article once or twice in several journalistic styles at the side of one experiment was written try american style and the fragment began  the king must go we want gritty men flapdoodle is all very  and then broke off followed by the note good sound journalism safer try it  the experiment in good sound journalism appeared to begin  the greatest of english poets has said that a rose by any   this also stopped abruptly the next annotation at the side was almost undecipherable but seemed to be something like  how about old steevens and the mot juste eg  morning winked a little wearily at me over the curt edge of campden hill and its houses with their sharp shadows under the abrupt black cardboard of the outline it took some little time to detect colours but at length i saw a brownish yellow shifting in the obscurity and i knew that it was the guard of swindons west kensington army they are being held as a reserve and lining the whole ridge above the bayswater road their camp and their main force is under the great waterworks tower on campden hill i forgot to say that the waterworks tower looked swart  as i passed them and came over the curve of silver street i saw the blue cloudy masses of barkers men blocking the entrance to the highroad like a sapphire smoke good the disposition of the allied troops under the general management of mr wilson appears to be as follows the yellow army if i may so describe the west kensingtonians lies as i have said in a strip along the ridge its furthest point westward being the west side of campden hill road its furthest point eastward the beginning of kensington gardens the green army of wilson lines the notting hill high road itself from queens road to the corner of pembridge road curving round the latter and extending some three hundred yards up towards westbourne grove westbourne grove itself is occupied by barker of south kensington the fourth side of this rough square the queens road side is held by some of bucks purple warriors  the whole resembles some ancient and dainty dutch flowerbed along the crest of campden hill lie the golden crocuses of west kensington they are as it were the first fiery fringe of the whole northward lies our hyacinth barker with all his blue hyacinths round to the southwest run the green rushes of wilson of bayswater and a line of violet irises aptly symbolised by mr buck complete the whole the argent exterior  i am losing the style i should have said curving with a whisk instead of merely curving also i should have called the hyacinths sudden i cannot keep this up war is too rapid for this style of writing please ask officeboy to insert mots justes  the truth is that there is nothing to report that commonplace element which is always ready to devour all beautiful things as the black pig in the irish mythology will finally devour the stars and gods that commonplace element as i say has in its black piggish way devoured finally the chances of any romance in this affair that which once consisted of absurd but thrilling combats in the streets has degenerated into something which is the very prose of warfareit has degenerated into a siege a siege may be defined as a peace plus the inconvenience of war of course wayne cannot hold out there is no more chance of help from anywhere else than of ships from the moon and if old wayne had stocked his street with tinned meats till all his garrison had to sit on them he couldnt hold out for more than a month or two as a matter of melancholy fact he has done something rather like this he has stocked his street with food until there must be uncommonly little room to turn round but what is the good to hold out for all that time and then to give in of necessity what does it mean it means waiting until your victories are forgotten and then taking the trouble to be defeated i cannot understand how wayne can be so inartistic  and how odd it is that one views a thing quite differently when one knows it is defeated i always thought wayne was rather fine but now when i know that he is done for there seem to be nothing else but wayne all the streets seem to point at him all the chimneys seem to lean towards him i suppose it is a morbid feeling but pump street seems to be the only part of london that i feel physically i suppose i say that it is morbid i suppose it is exactly how a man feels about his heart when his heart is weak pump streetthe heart is a pump and i am drivelling  our finest leader at the front is beyond all question general wilson he has adopted alone among the other provosts the uniform of his own halberdiers although that fine old sixteenthcentury garb was not originally intended to go with red sidewhiskers it was he who against a most admirable and desperate defence broke last night into pump street and held it for at least half an hour he was afterwards expelled from it by general turnbull of notting hill but only after desperate fighting and the sudden descent of that terrible darkness which proved so much more fatal to the forces of general buck and general swindon  provost wayne himself with whom i had with great good fortune a most interesting interview bore the most eloquent testimony to the conduct of general wilson and his men his precise words are as follows i have bought sweets at his funny little shop when i was four years old and ever since i never noticed anything i am ashamed to say except that he talked through his nose and didnt wash himself particularly and he came over our barricade like a devil from hell i repeated this speech to general wilson himself with some delicate improvements and he seemed pleased with it he does not however seem pleased with anything so much just now as he is with the wearing of a sword i have it from the front on the best authority that general wilson was not completely shaved yesterday it is believed in military circles that he is growing a moustache  as i have said there is nothing to report i walk wearily to the pillarbox at the corner of pembridge road to post my copy nothing whatever has happened except the preparations for a particularly long and feeble siege during which i trust i shall not be required to be at the front as i glance up pembridge road in the growing dusk the aspect of that road reminds me that there is one note worth adding general buck has suggested with characteristic acumen to general wilson that in order to obviate the possibility of such a catastrophe as overwhelmed the allied forces in the last advance on notting hill the catastrophe i mean of the extinguished lamps each soldier should have a lighted lantern round his neck this is one of the things which i really admire about general buck he possesses what people used to mean by the humility of the man of science that is he learns steadily from his mistakes wayne may score off him in some other way but not in that way the lanterns look like fairy lights as they curve round the end of pembridge road                                       lateri write with some difficulty because the blood will run down my face and make patterns on the paper blood is a very beautiful thing that is why it is concealed if you ask why blood runs down my face i can only reply that i was kicked by a horse if you ask me what horse i can reply with some pride that it was a warhorse if you ask me how a warhorse came on the scene in our simple pedestrian warfare i am reduced to the necessity so painful to a special correspondent of recounting my experiences  i was as i have said in the very act of posting my copy at the pillarbox and of glancing as i did so up the glittering curve of pembridge road studded with the lights of wilsons men i dont know what made me pause to examine the matter but i had a fancy that the line of lights where it melted into the indistinct brown twilight was more indistinct than usual i was almost certain that in a certain stretch of the road where there had been five lights there were now only four i strained my eyes i counted them again and there were only three a moment after there were only two an instant after only one and an instant after that the lanterns near to me swung like jangled bells as if struck suddenly they flared and fell and for the moment the fall of them was like the fall of the sun and stars out of heaven it left everything in a primal blindness as a matter of fact the road was not yet legitimately dark there were still red rays of a sunset in the sky and the brown gloaming was still warmed as it were with a feeling as of firelight but for three seconds after the lanterns swung and sank i saw in front of me a blackness blocking the sky and with the fourth second i knew that this blackness which blocked the sky was a man on a great horse and i was trampled and tossed aside as a swirl of horsemen swept round the corner as they turned i saw that they were not black but scarlet they were a sortie of the besieged wayne riding ahead  i lifted myself from the gutter blinded with blood from a very slight skinwound and queerly enough not caring either for the blindness or for the slightness of the wound for one mortal minute after that amazing cavalcade had spun past there was dead stillness on the empty road and then came barker and all his halberdiers running like devils in the track of them it had been their business to guard the gate by which the sortie had broken out but they had not reckoned and small blame to them on cavalry as it was barker and his men made a perfectly splendid run after them almost catching waynes horses by the tails  nobody can understand the sortie it consists only of a small number of waynes garrison turnbull himself with the vast mass of it is undoubtedly still barricaded in pump street sorties of this kind are natural enough in the majority of historical sieges such as the siege of paris in 1870 because in such cases the besieged are certain of some support outside but what can be the object of it in this case wayne knows or if he is too mad to know anything at least turnbull knows that there is not and never has been the smallest chance of support for him outside that the mass of the sane modern inhabitants of london regard his farcical patriotism with as much contempt as they do the original idiotcy that gave it birththe folly of our miserable king what wayne and his horsemen are doing nobody can even conjecture the general theory round here is that he is simply a traitor and has abandoned the besieged but all such larger but yet more soluble riddles are as nothing compared to the one small but unanswerable riddle where did they get the horses                                       lateri have heard a most extraordinary account of the origin of the appearance of the horses it appears that that amazing person general turnbull who is now ruling pump street in the absence of wayne sent out on the morning of the declaration of war a vast number of little boys or cherubs of the gutter as we pressmen say with halfcrowns in their pockets to take cabs all over london no less than a hundred and sixty cabs met at pump street were commandeered by the garrison the men were set free the cabs used to make barricades and the horses kept in pump street where they were fed and exercised for several days until they were sufficiently rapid and efficient to be used for this wild ride out of the town if this is so and i have it on the best possible authority the method of the sortie is explained but we have no explanation of its object just as barkers blues were swinging round the corner after them they were stopped but not by an enemy only by the voice of one man and he a friend red wilson of bayswater ran alone along the main road like a madman waving them back with a halberd snatched from a sentinel he was in supreme command and barker stopped at the corner staring and bewildered we could hear wilsons voice loud and distinct out of the dusk so that it seemed strange that the great voice should come out of the little body halt south kensington guard this entry and prevent them returning i will pursue forward the green guards  a wall of dark blue uniforms and a wood of poleaxes was between me and wilson for barkers men blocked the mouth of the road in two rigid lines but through them and through the dusk i could hear the clear orders and the clank of arms and see the green army of wilson marching by towards the west they were our great fightingmen wilson had filled them with his own fire in a few days they had become veterans each of them wore a silver medal of a pump to boast that they alone of all the allied armies had stood victorious in pump street  i managed to slip past the detachment of barkers blues who are guarding the end of pembridge road and a sharp spell of running brought me to the tail of wilsons green army as it swung down the road in pursuit of the flying wayne the dusk had deepened into almost total darkness for some time i only heard the throb of the marching pace then suddenly there was a cry and the tall fighting men were flung back on me almost crushing me and again the lanterns swung and jingled and the cold nozzles of great horses pushed into the press of us they had turned and charged us  you fools came the voice of wilson cleaving our panic with a splendid cold anger dont you see the horses have no riders  it was true we were being plunged at by a stampede of horses with empty saddles what could it mean had wayne met some of our men and been defeated or had he flung these horses at us as some kind of ruse or mad new mode of warfare such as he seemed bent on inventing or did he and his men want to get away in disguise or did they want to hide in houses somewhere  never did i admire any mans intellect even my own so much as i did wilsons at that moment without a word he simply pointed the halberd which he still grasped to the southern side of the road as you know the streets running up to the ridge of campden hill from the main road are peculiarly steep they are more like sudden flights of stairs we were just opposite aubrey road the steepest of all up that it would have been far more difficult to urge halftrained horses than to run up on ones feet  left wheel hallooed wilson they have gone up here he added to me who happened to be at his elbow  why i ventured to ask  cant say for certain replied the bayswater general theyve gone up here in a great hurry anyhow theyve simply turned their horses loose because they couldnt take them up i fancy i know i fancy theyre trying to get over the ridge to kensingston or hammersmith or somewhere and are striking up here because its just beyond the end of our line damned fools not to have gone further along the road though theyve only just shaved our last outpost lambert is hardly four hundred yards from here and ive sent him word  lambert i said not young wilfrid lambertmy old friend  wilfrid lamberts his name said the general used to be a man about town silly fellow with a big nose that kind of man always volunteers for some war or other and whats funnier he generally isnt half bad at it lambert is distinctly good the yellow west kensingtons i always reckoned the weakest part of the army but he has pulled them together uncommonly well though hes subordinate to swindon whos a donkey in the attack from pembridge road the other night he showed great pluck  he has shown greater pluck than that i said he has criticised my sense of humour that was his first engagement  this remark was i am sorry to say lost on the admirable commander of the allied forces we were in the act of climbing the last half of aubrey road which is so abrupt a slope that it looks like an oldfashioned map leaning up against the wall there are lines of little trees one above the other as in the oldfashioned map  we reached the top of it panting somewhat and were just about to turn the corner by a place called in chivalrous anticipation of our wars of sword and axe tower creçy when we were suddenly knocked in the stomach i can use no other term by a horde of men hurled back upon us they wore the red uniform of wayne their halberds were broken their foreheads bleeding but the mere impetus of their retreat staggered us as we stood at the last ridge of the slope  good old lambert yelled out suddenly the stolid mr wilson of bayswater in an uncontrollable excitement damned jolly old lambert hes got there already hes driving them back on us hurrah hurrah forward the green guards  we swung round the corner eastwards wilson running first brandishing the halberd  will you pardon a little egotism every one likes a little egotism when it takes the form as mine does in this case of a disgraceful confession the thing is really a little interesting because it shows how the merely artistic habit has bitten into men like me it was the most intensely exciting occurrence that had ever come to me in my life and i was really intensely excited about it and yet as we turned that corner the first impression i had was of something that had nothing to do with the fight at all i was stricken from the sky as by a thunderbolt by the height of the waterworks tower on campden hill i dont know whether londoners generally realise how high it looks when one comes out in this way almost immediately under it for the second it seemed to me that at the foot of it even human war was a triviality for the second i felt as if i had been drunk with some trivial orgie and that i had been sobered by the shock of that shadow a moment afterwards i realised that under it was going on something more enduring than stone and something wilder than the dizziest heightthe agony of man and i knew that compared to that this overwhelming tower was itself a triviality it was a mere stalk of stone which humanity could snap like a stick  i dont know why i have talked so much about this silly old waterworks tower which at the very best was only a tremendous background it was that certainly a sombre and awful landscape against which our figures were relieved but i think the real reason was that there was in my own mind so sharp a transition from the tower of stone to the man of flesh for what i saw first when i had shaken off as it were the shadow of the tower was a man and a man i knew  lambert stood at the further corner of the street that curved round the tower his figure outlined in some degree by the beginning of moonrise he looked magnificent a hero but he looked something much more interesting than that he was as it happened in almost precisely the same swaggering attitude in which he had stood nearly fifteen years ago when he swung his walkingstick and struck it into the ground and told me that all my subtlety was drivel and upon my soul i think he required more courage to say that than to fight as he does now for then he was fighting against something that was in the ascendant fashionable and victorious and now he is fighting at the risk of his life no doubt merely against something which is already dead which is impossible futile of which nothing has been more impossible and futile than this very sortie which has brought him into contact with it people nowadays allow infinitely too little for the psychological sense of victory as a factor in affairs then he was attacking the degraded but undoubtedly victorious quin now he is attacking the interesting but totally extinguished wayne  his name recalls me to the details of the scene the facts were these a line of red halberdiers headed by wayne were marching up the street close under the northern wall which is in fact the bottom of a sort of dyke or fortification of the waterworks lambert and his yellow west kensingtons had that instant swept round the corner and had shaken the waynites heavily hurling back a few of the more timid as i have just described into our very arms when our force struck the tail of waynes every one knew that all was up with him his favourite military barber was struck down his grocer was stunned he himself was hurt in the thigh and reeled back against the wall we had him in a trap with two jaws is that you shouted lambert genially to wilson across the hemmedin host of notting hill thats about the ticket replied general wilson keep them under the wall  the men of notting hill were falling fast adam wayne threw up his long arms to the wall above him and with a spring stood upon it a gigantic figure against the moon he tore the banner out of the hands of the standardbearer below him and shook it out suddenly above our heads so that it was like thunder in the heavens  round the red lion he cried swords round the red lion halberds round the red lion they are the thorns round rose  his voice and the crack of the banner made a momentary rally and lambert whose idiotic face was almost beautiful with battle felt it as by an instinct and cried  drop your publichouse flag you footler drop it  the banner of the red lion seldom stoops said wayne proudly letting it out luxuriantly on the night wind  the next moment i knew that poor adams sentimental theatricality had cost him much lambert was on the wall at a bound his sword in his teeth and had slashed at waynes head before he had time to draw his sword his hands being busy with the enormous flag he stepped back only just in time to avoid the first cut and let the flagstaff fall so that the spearblade at the end of it pointed to lambert  the banner stoops cried wayne in a voice that must have startled streets the banner of notting hill stoops to a hero and with the words he drove the spearpoint and half the flagstaff through lamberts body and dropped him dead upon the road below a stone upon the stones of the street  notting hill notting hill cried wayne in a sort of divine rage her banner is all the holier for the blood of a brave enemy up on the wall patriots up on the wall notting hill  with his long strong arm he actually dragged a man up on to the wall to be silhouetted against the moon and more and more men climbed up there pulled themselves and were pulled till clusters and crowds of the halfmassacred men of pump street massed upon the wall above us  notting hill notting hill cried wayne unceasingly  well what about bayswater said a worthy workingman in wilsons army irritably bayswater for ever  we have won cried wayne striking his flagstaff in the ground bayswater for ever we have taught our enemies patriotism  oh cut these fellows up and have done with it cried one of lamberts lieutenants who was reduced to something bordering on madness by the responsibility of succeeding to the command  let us by all means try said wilson grimly and the two armies closed round the third                                       i simply cannot describe what followed i am sorry but there is such a thing as physical fatigue as physical nausea and i may add as physical terror suffice it to say that the above paragraph was written about 11 pm and that it is now about 2 am and that the battle is not finished and is not likely to be suffice it further to say that down the steep streets which lead from the waterworks tower to the notting hill high road blood has been running and is running in great red serpents that curl out into the main thoroughfare and shine in the moon                                       laterthe final touch has been given to all this terrible futility hours have passed morning has broken men are still swaying and fighting at the foot of the tower and round the corner of aubrey road the fight has not finished but i know it is a farce  news has just come to show that waynes amazing sortie followed by the amazing resistance through a whole night on the wall of the waterworks is as if it had not been what was the object of that strange exodus we shall probably never know for the simple reason that every one who knew will probably be cut to pieces in the course of the next two or three hours  i have heard about three minutes ago that buck and bucks methods have won after all he was perfectly right of course when one comes to think of it in holding that it was physically impossible for a street to defeat a city while we thought he was patrolling the eastern gates with his purple army while we were rushing about the streets and waving halberds and lanterns while poor old wilson was scheming like moltke and fighting like achilles to entrap the wild provost of notting hillmr buck retired draper has simply driven down in a hansom cab and done something about as plain as butter and about as useful and nasty he has gone down to south kensington brompton and fulham and by spending about four thousand pounds of his private means has raised an army of nearly as many men that is to say an army big enough to beat not only wayne but wayne and all his present enemies put together the army i understand is encamped along high street kensington and fills it from the church to addison road bridge it is to advance by ten different roads uphill to the north  i cannot endure to remain here everything makes it worse than it need be the dawn for instance has broken round campden hill splendid spaces of silver edged with gold are torn out of the sky worse still wayne and his men feel the dawn their faces though bloody and pale are strangely hopeful  insupportably pathetic worst of all for the moment they are winning if it were not for buck and the new army they might just and only just win  i repeat i cannot stand it it is like watching that wonderful play of old maeterlincks you know my partiality for the healthy jolly old authors of the nineteenth century in which one has to watch the quiet conduct of people inside a parlour while knowing that the very men are outside the door whose word can blast it all with tragedy and this is worse for the men are not talking but writhing and bleeding and dropping dead for a thing that is already settledand settled against them the great grey masses of men still toil and tug and sway hither and thither around the great grey tower and the tower is still motionless as it will always be motionless these men will be crushed before the sun is set and new men will arise and be crushed and new wrongs done and tyranny will always rise again like the sun and injustice will always be as fresh as the flowers of spring and the stone tower will always look down on it matter in its brutal beauty will always look down on those who are mad enough to consent to die and yet more mad since they consent to live                                       thus ended abruptly the first and last contribution of the special correspondent of the court journal to that valued periodical  the correspondent himself as has been said was simply sick and gloomy at the last news of the triumph of buck he slouched sadly down the steep aubrey road up which he had the night before run in so unusual an excitement and strolled out into the empty dawnlit main road looking vaguely for a cab he saw nothing in the vacant space except a blueandgold glittering thing running very fast which looked at first like a very tall beetle but turned out to his great astonishment to be barker  have you heard the good news asked that gentleman  yes said quin with a measured voice i have heard the glad tidings of great joy shall we take a hansom down to kensington i see one over there  they took the cab and were in four minutes fronting the ranks of the multitudinous and invincible army quin had not spoken a word all the way and something about him had prevented the essentially impressionable barker from speaking either  the great army as it moved up kensington high street calling many heads to the numberless windows for it was long indeedlonger than the lives of most of the tolerably youngsince such an army had been seen in london compared with the vast organisation which was now swallowing up the miles with buck at its head as leader and the king hanging at its tail as journalist the whole story of our problem was insignificant in the presence of that army the red notting hills and the green bayswaters were alike tiny and straggling groups in its presence the whole struggle round pump street was like an anthill under the hoof of an ox every man who felt or looked at that infinity of men knew that it was the triumph of bucks brutal arithmetic whether wayne was right or wrong wise or foolish was quite a fair matter for discussion but it was a matter of history at the foot of church street opposite kensington church they paused in their glowing good humour  let us send some kind of messenger or herald up to them said buck turning to barker and the king let us send and ask them to cave in without more muddle  what shall we say to them said barker doubtfully  the facts of the case are quite sufficient rejoined buck it is the facts of the case that make an army surrender let us simply say that our army that is fighting their army and their army that is fighting our army amount altogether to about a thousand men say that we have four thousand it is very simple of the thousand fighting they have at the very most three hundred so that with those three hundred they have now to fight four thousand seven hundred men let them do it if it amuses them  and the provost of north kensington laughed  the herald who was despatched up church street in all the pomp of the south kensington blue and gold with the three birds on his tabard was attended by two trumpeters  what will they do when they consent asked barker for the sake of saying something in the sudden stillness of that immense army  i know my wayne very well said buck laughing when he submits he will send a red herald flaming with the lion of notting hill even defeat will be delightful to him since it is formal and romantic  the king who had strolled up to the head of the line broke silence for the first time  i shouldnt wonder he said if he defied you and didnt send the herald after all i dont think you do know your wayne quite so well as you think  all right your majesty said buck easily if it isnt disrespectful ill put my political calculations in a very simple form ill lay you ten pounds to a shilling the herald comes with the surrender  all right said auberon i may be wrong but its my notion of adam wayne that hell die in his city and that till he is dead it will not be a safe property  the bets made your majesty said buck  another long silence ensued in the course of which barker alone amid the motionless army strolled and stamped in his restless way  then buck suddenly leant forward  its taking your money your majesty he said i knew it was there comes the herald from adam wayne  its not cried the king peering forward also you brute its a red omnibus  its not said buck calmly and the king did not answer for down the centre of the spacious and silent church street was walking beyond question the herald of the red lion with two trumpeters  buck had something in him which taught him how to be magnanimous in his hour of success he felt magnanimous towards wayne whom he really admired magnanimous towards the king off whom he had scored so publicly and above all magnanimous towards barker who was the titular leader of this vast south kensington army which his own talent had evoked  general barker he said bowing do you propose now to receive the message from the besieged  barker bowed also and advanced towards the herald  has your master mr adam wayne received our request for surrender he asked  the herald conveyed a solemn and respectful affirmative  barker resumed coughing slightly but encouraged  what answer does your master send  the herald again inclined himself submissively and answered in a kind of monotone  my message is this adam wayne lord high provost of notting hill under the charter of king auberon and the laws of god and all mankind free and of a free city greets james barker lord high provost of south kensington by the same rights free and honourable leader of the army of the south with all friendly reverence and with all constitutional consideration he desires james barker to lay down his arms and the whole army under his command to lay down their arms also  before the words were ended the king had run forward into the open space with shining eyes the rest of the staff and the forefront of the army were literally struck breathless when they recovered they began to laugh beyond restraint the revulsion was too sudden  the lord high provost of notting hill continued the herald does not propose in the event of your surrender to use his victory for any of those repressive purposes which others have entertained against him he will leave you your free laws and your free cities your flags and your governments he will not destroy the religion of south kensington or crush the old customs of bayswater  an irrepressible explosion of laughter went up from the forefront of the great army  the king must have had something to do with this humour said buck slapping his thigh its too deliciously insolent barker have a glass of wine  and in his conviviality he actually sent a soldier across to the restaurant opposite the church and brought out two glasses for a toast  when the laughter had died down the herald continued quite monotonously  in the event of your surrendering your arms and dispersing under the superintendence of our forces these local rights of yours shall be carefully observed in the event of your not doing so the lord high provost of notting hill desires to announce that he has just captured the waterworks tower just above you on campden hill and that within ten minutes from now that is on the reception through me of your refusal he will open the great reservoir and flood the whole valley where you stand in thirty feet of water god save king auberon  buck had dropped his glass and sent a great splash of wine over the road  butbut he said and then by a last and splendid effort of his great sanity looked the facts in the face  we must surrender he said you could do nothing against fifty thousand tons of water coming down a steep hill ten minutes hence we must surrender our four thousand men might as well be four vicisti galilæe perkins you may as well get me another glass of wine  in this way the vast army of south kensington surrendered and the empire of notting hill began one further fact in this connection is perhaps worth mentioningthe fact that after his victory adam wayne caused the great tower on campden hill to be plated with gold and inscribed with a great epitaph saying that it was the monument of wilfrid lambert the heroic defender of the place and surmounted with a statue in which his large nose was done something less than justice to     book v     chapter ithe empire of notting hill   on the evening of the third of october twenty years after the great victory of notting hill which gave it the dominion of london king auberon came as of old out of kensington palace  he had changed little save for a streak or two of grey in his hair for his face had always been old and his step slow and as it were decrepit  if he looked old it was not because of anything physical or mental it was because he still wore with a quaint conservatism the frockcoat and high hat of the days before the great war i have survived the deluge he said i am a pyramid and must behave as such  as he passed up the street the kensingtonians in their picturesque blue smocks saluted him as a king and then looked after him as a curiosity it seemed odd to them that men had once worn so elvish an attire  the king cultivating the walk attributed to the oldest inhabitant gaffer auberon his friends were now confidentially desired to call him went toddling northward he paused with reminiscence in his eye at the southern gate of notting hill one of those nine great gates of bronze and steel wrought with reliefs of the old battles by the hand of chiffy himself  ah he said shaking his head and assuming an unnecessary air of age and a provincialism of accentah i mind when there warnt none of this here  he passed through the ossington gate surmounted by a great lion wrought in red copper on yellow brass with the motto nothing ill the guard in red and gold saluted him with his halberd  it was about sunset and the lamps were being lit auberon paused to look at them for they were chiffys finest work and his artistic eye never failed to feast on them in memory of the great battle of the lamps each great iron lamp was surmounted by a veiled figure sword in hand holding over the flame an iron hood or extinguisher as if ready to let it fall if the armies of the south and west should again show their flags in the city thus no child in notting hill could play about the streets without the very lampposts reminding him of the salvation of his country in the dreadful year  old wayne was right in a way commented the king the sword does make things beautiful it has made the whole world romantic by now and to think people once thought me a buffoon for suggesting a romantic notting hill deary me deary me i think that is the expressionit seems like a previous existence  turning a corner he found himself in pump street opposite the four shops which adam wayne had studied twenty years before he entered idly the shop of mr mead the grocer mr mead was somewhat older like the rest of the world and his red beard which he now wore with a moustache and long and full was partly blanched and discoloured he was dressed in a long and richly embroidered robe of blue brown and crimson interwoven with an eastern complexity of pattern and covered with obscure symbols and pictures representing his wares passing from hand to hand and from nation to nation round his neck was the chain with the blue argosy cut in turquoise which he wore as grand master of the grocers the whole shop had the sombre and sumptuous look of its owner the wares were displayed as prominently as in the old days but they were now blended and arranged with a sense of tint and grouping too often neglected by the dim grocers of those forgotten days the wares were shown plainly but shown not so much as an old grocer would have shown his stock but rather as an educated virtuoso would have shown his treasures the tea was stored in great blue and green vases inscribed with the nine indispensable sayings of the wise men of china other vases of a confused orange and purple less rigid and dominant more humble and dreamy stored symbolically the tea of india a row of caskets of a simple silvery metal contained tinned meats each was wrought with some rude but rhythmic form as a shell a horn a fish or an apple to indicate what material had been canned in it  your majesty said mr mead sweeping an oriental reverence this is an honour to me but yet more an honour to the city  auberon took off his hat  mr mead he said notting hill whether in giving or taking can deal in nothing but honour do you happen to sell liquorice  liquorice sire said mr mead is not the least important of our benefits out of the dark heart of arabia  and going reverently towards a green and silver canister made in the form of an arabian mosque he proceeded to serve his customer  i was just thinking mr mead said the king reflectively i dont know why i should think about it just now but i was just thinking of twenty years ago do you remember the times before the war  the grocer having wrapped up the liquorice sticks in a piece of paper inscribed with some appropriate sentiment lifted his large grey eyes dreamily and looked at the darkening sky outside  oh yes your majesty he said i remember these streets before the lord provost began to rule us i cant remember how we felt very well all the great songs and the fighting change one so and i dont think we can really estimate all we owe to the provost but i can remember his coming into this very shop twentytwo years ago and i remember the things he said the singular thing is that as far as i remember i thought the things he said odd at that time now its the things that i said as far as i can recall them that seem to me oddas odd as a madmans antics  ah said the king and looked at him with an unfathomable quietness  i thought nothing of being a grocer then he said isnt that odd enough for anybody i thought nothing of all the wonderful places that my goods come from and wonderful ways that they are made i did not know that i was for all practical purposes a king with slaves spearing fishes near the secret pool and gathering fruits in the islands under the world my mind was a blank on the thing i was as mad as a hatter  the king turned also and stared out into the dark where the great lamps that commemorated the battle were already flaming  and is this the end of poor old wayne he said half to himself to inflame every one so much that he is lost himself in the blaze is this his victory that he my incomparable wayne is now only one in a world of waynes has he conquered and become by conquest commonplace must mr mead the grocer talk as high as he lord what a strange world in which a man cannot remain unique even by taking the trouble to go mad  and he went dreamily out of the shop  he paused outside the next one almost precisely as the provost had done two decades before  illustration a fine evening sir said the chemist  how uncommonly creepy this shop looks he said but yet somehow encouragingly creepy invitingly creepy it looks like something in a jolly old nursery story in which you are frightened out of your skin and yet know that things always end well the way those low sharp gables are carved like great black bats wings folded down and the way those queercoloured bowls underneath are made to shine like giants eyeballs it looks like a benevolent warlocks hut it is apparently a chemists  almost as he spoke mr bowles the chemist came to his shop door in a long black velvet gown and hood monastic as it were but yet with a touch of the diabolic his hair was still quite black and his face even paler than of old the only spot of colour he carried was a red star cut in some precious stone of strong tint hung on his breast he belonged to the society of the red star of charity founded on the lamps displayed by doctors and chemists  a fine evening sir said the chemist why i can scarcely be mistaken in supposing it to be your majesty pray step inside and share a bottle of salvolatile or anything that may take your fancy as it happens there is an old acquaintance of your majestys in my shop carousing if i may be permitted the term upon that beverage at this moment  the king entered the shop which was an aladdins garden of shades and hues for as the chemists scheme of colour was more brilliant than the grocers scheme so it was arranged with even more delicacy and fancy never if the phrase may be employed had such a nosegay of medicines been presented to the artistic eye  but even the solemn rainbow of that evening interior was rivalled or even eclipsed by the figure standing in the centre of the shop his form which was a large and stately one was clad in a brilliant blue velvet cut in the richest renaissance fashion and slashed so as to show gleams and gaps of a wonderful lemon or pale yellow he had several chains round his neck and his plumes which were of several tints of bronze and gold hung down to the great gold hilt of his long sword he was drinking a dose of salvolatile and admiring its opal tint the king advanced with a slight mystification towards the tall figure whose face was in shadow then he said  by the great lord of luck barker  the figure removed his plumed cap showing the same dark head and long almost equine face which the king had so often seen rising out of the high collar of bond street except for a grey patch on each temple it was totally unchanged  your majesty said barker this is a meeting nobly retrospective a meeting that has about it a certain october gold i drink to old days and he finished his salvolatile with simple feeling  i am delighted to see you again barker said the king it is indeed long since we met what with my travels in asia minor and my book having to be written you have read my life of prince albert for children of course we have scarcely met twice since the great war that is twenty years ago  i wonder said barker thoughtfully if i might speak freely to your majesty  well said auberon its rather late in the day to start speaking respectfully flap away my bird of freedom  well your majesty replied barker lowering his voice i dont think it will be so long to the next war  what do you mean asked auberon  we will stand this insolence no longer burst out barker fiercely we are not slaves because adam wayne twenty years ago cheated us with a waterpipe notting hill is notting hill it is not the world we in south kensington we also have memoriesay and hopes if they fought for these trumpery shops and a few lampposts shall we not fight for the great high street and the sacred natural history museum  great heavens said the astounded auberon will wonders never cease have the two greatest marvels been achieved have you turned altruistic and has wayne turned selfish are you the patriot and he the tyrant  it is not from wayne himself altogether that the evil comes answered barker he indeed is now mostly wrapped in dreams and sits with his old sword beside the fire but notting hill is the tyrant your majesty its council and its crowds have been so intoxicated by the spreading over the whole city of waynes old ways and visions that they try to meddle with every one and rule every one and civilise every one and tell every one what is good for him i do not deny the great impulse which his old war wild as it seemed gave to the civic life of our time it came when i was still a young man and i admit it enlarged my career but we are not going to see our own cities flouted and thwarted from day to day because of something wayne did for us all nearly a quarter of a century ago i am just waiting here for news upon this very matter it is rumoured that notting hill has vetoed the statue of general wilson they are putting up opposite chepstow place if that is so it is a black and white shameless breach of the terms on which we surrendered to turnbull after the battle of the tower we were to keep our own customs and selfgovernment if that is so  it is so said a deep voice and both men turned round  a burly figure in purple robes with a silver eagle hung round his neck and moustaches almost as florid as his plumes stood in the doorway  yes he said acknowledging the kings start i am provost buck and the news is true these men of the hill have forgotten that we fought round the tower as well as they and that it is sometimes foolish as well as base to despise the conquered  let us step outside said barker with a grim composure  buck did so and stood rolling his eyes up and down the lamplit street  i would like to have a go at smashing all this he muttered though i am over sixty i would like  his voice ended in a cry and he reeled back a step with his hands to his eyes as he had done in those streets twenty years before  darkness he crieddarkness again what does it mean  for in truth every lamp in the street had gone out so that they could not see even each others outline except faintly the voice of the chemist came with startling cheerfulness out of the density  oh dont you know he said did they never tell you this is the feast of the lamps the anniversary of the great battle that almost lost and just saved notting hill dont you know your majesty that on this night twentyone years ago we saw wilsons green uniforms charging down this street and driving wayne and turnbull back upon the gasworks fighting with their handful like fiends from hell and that then in that great hour wayne sprang through a window of the gasworks with one blow of his hand brought darkness on the whole city and then with a cry like a lions that was heard through four streets flew at wilsons men sword in hand and swept them bewildered as they were and ignorant of the map clear out of the sacred street again and dont you know that upon that night every year all lights are turned out for half an hour while we sing the notting hill anthem in the darkness hark there it begins  through the night came a crash of drums and then a strong swell of human voices  when the world was in the balance there was night on notting hill there was night on notting hill it was nobler than the day on the cities where the lights are and the firesides glow from the seas and from the deserts came the thing we did not know came the darkness came the darkness came the darkness on the foe       and the old guard of god turned to bay   for the old guard of god turns to bay turns to bay   and the stars fall down before it ere its banners fall today   for when armies were around us as a howling and a horde   when falling was the citadel and broken was the sword   the darkness came upon them like the dragon of the lord       when the old guard of god turned to bay  the voices were just uplifting themselves in a second verse when they were stopped by a scurry and a yell barker had bounded into the street with a cry of south kensington and a drawn dagger in less time than a man could blink the whole packed street was full of curses and struggling barker was flung back against the shopfront but used the second only to draw his sword as well as his dagger and calling out this is not the first time ive come through the thick of you flung himself again into the press it was evident that he had drawn blood at last for a more violent outcry arose and many other knives and swords were discernible in the faint light barker after having wounded more than one man seemed on the point of being flung back again when buck suddenly stepped out into the street he had no weapon for he affected rather the peaceful magnificence of the great burgher than the pugnacious dandyism which had replaced the old sombre dandyism in barker but with a blow of his clenched fist he broke the pane of the next shop which was the old curiosity shop and plunging in his hand snatched a kind of japanese scimitar and calling out kensington kensington rushed to barkers assistance  barkers sword was broken but he was laying about him with his dagger just as buck ran up a man of notting hill struck barker down but buck struck the man down on top of him and barker sprang up again the blood running down his face  suddenly all these cries were cloven by a great voice that seemed to fall out of heaven it was terrible to buck and barker and the king from its seeming to come out the empty skies but it was more terrible because it was a familiar voice and one which at the same time they had not heard for so long  turn up the lights said the voice from above them and for a moment there was no reply but only a tumult  in the name of notting hill and of the great council of the city turn up the lights  there was again a tumult and a vagueness for a moment then the whole street and every object in it sprang suddenly out of the darkness as every lamp sprang into life and looking up they saw standing upon a balcony near the roof of one of the highest houses the figure and the face of adam wayne his red hair blowing behind him a little streaked with grey   what is this my people he said is it altogether impossible to make a thing good without it immediately insisting on being wicked the glory of notting hill in having achieved its independence has been enough for me to dream of for many years as i sat beside the fire is it really not enough for you who have had so many other affairs to excite and distract you notting hill is a nation why should it condescend to be a mere empire you wish to pull down the statue of general wilson which the men of bayswater have so rightly erected in westbourne grove fools who erected that statue did bayswater erect it no notting hill erected it do you not see that it is the glory of our achievement that we have infected the other cities with the idealism of notting hill it is we who have created not only our own side but both sides of this controversy o too humble fools why should you wish to destroy your enemies you have done something more to them you have created your enemies you wish to pull down that gigantic silver hammer which stands like an obelisk in the centre of the broadway of hammersmith fools before notting hill arose did any person passing through hammersmith broadway expect to see there a gigantic silver hammer you wish to abolish the great bronze figure of a knight standing upon the artificial bridge at knightsbridge fools who would have thought of it before notting hill arose i have even heard and with deep pain i have heard it that the evil eye of our imperial envy has been cast towards the remote horizon of the west and that we have objected to the great black monument of a crowned raven which commemorates the skirmish of ravenscourt park who created all these things were they there before we came cannot you be content with that destiny which was enough for athens which was enough for nazareth the destiny the humble purpose of creating a new world is athens angry because romans and florentines have adopted her phraseology for expressing their own patriotism is nazareth angry because as a little village it has become the type of all little villages out of which as the snobs say no good can come has athens asked every one to wear the chlamys are all followers of the nazarene compelled to wear turbans no but the soul of athens went forth and made men drink hemlock and the soul of nazareth went forth and made men consent to be crucified so has the soul of notting hill gone forth and made men realise what it is to live in a city just as we inaugurated our symbols and ceremonies so they have inaugurated theirs and are you so mad as to contend against them notting hill is right it has always been right it has moulded itself on its own necessities its own sine quâ non it has accepted its own ultimatum because it is a nation it has created itself and because it is a nation it can destroy itself notting hill shall always be the judge if it is your will because of this matter of general wilsons statue to make war upon bayswater  a roar of cheers broke in upon his words and further speech was impossible pale to the lips the great patriot tried again and again to speak but even his authority could not keep down the dark and roaring masses in the street below him he said something further but it was not audible he descended at last sadly from the garret in which he lived and mingled with the crowd at the foot of the houses finding general turnbull he put his hand on his shoulder with a queer affection and gravity and said  tomorrow old man we shall have a new experience as fresh as the flowers of spring we shall be defeated you and i have been through three battles together and have somehow or other missed this peculiar delight it is unfortunate that we shall not probably be able to exchange our experiences because as it most annoyingly happens we shall probably both be dead  turnbull looked dimly surprised  i dont mind so much about being dead he said but why should you say that we shall be defeated  the answer is very simple replied wayne calmly it is because we ought to be defeated we have been in the most horrible holes before now but in all those i was perfectly certain that the stars were on our side and that we ought to get out now i know that we ought not to get out and that takes away from me everything with which i won  as wayne spoke he started a little for both men became aware that a third figure was listening to thema small figure with wondering eyes  is it really true my dear wayne said the king interrupting that you think you will be beaten tomorrow  there can be no doubt about it whatever replied adam wayne the real reason is the one of which i have just spoken but as a concession to your materialism i will add that they have an organised army of a hundred allied cities against our one that in itself however would be unimportant  quin with his round eyes seemed strangely insistent  you are quite sure he said that you must be beaten  i am afraid said turnbull gloomily that there can be no doubt about it  then cried the king flinging out his arms give me a halberd give me a halberd somebody i desire all men to witness that i auberon king of england do here and now abdicate and implore the provost of notting hill to permit me to enlist in his army give me a halberd  he seized one from some passing guard and shouldering it stamped solemnly after the shouting columns of halberdiers which were by this time parading the streets he had however nothing to do with the wrecking of the statue of general wilson which took place before morning     chapter iithe last battle   the day was cloudy when wayne went down to die with all his army in kensington gardens it was cloudy again when that army had been swallowed up by the vast armies of a new world there had been an almost uncanny interval of sunshine in which the provost of notting hill with all the placidity of an onlooker had gazed across to the hostile armies on the great spaces of verdure opposite the long strips of green and blue and gold lay across the park in squares and oblongs like a proposition in euclid wrought in a rich embroidery but the sunlight was a weak and as it were a wet sunlight and was soon swallowed up wayne spoke to the king with a queer sort of coldness and languor as to the military operations it was as he had said the night beforethat being deprived of his sense of an impracticable rectitude he was in effect being deprived of everything he was out of date and at sea in a mere world of compromise and competition of empire against empire of the tolerably right and the tolerably wrong when his eye fell on the king however who was marching very gravely with a top hat and a halberd it brightened slightly  well your majesty he said you at least ought to be proud today if your children are fighting each other at least those who win are your children other kings have distributed justice you have distributed life other kings have ruled a nation you have created nations others have made kingdoms you have begotten them look at your children father and he stretched his hand out towards the enemy  auberon did not raise his eyes  see how splendidly cried wayne the new cities come onthe new cities from across the river see where battersea advances over thereunder the flag of the lost dog and putneydont you see the man on the white boar shining on their standard as the sun catches it it is the coming of a new age your majesty notting hill is not a common empire it is a thing like athens the mother of a mode of life of a manner of living which shall renew the youth of the worlda thing like nazareth when i was young i remember in the old dreary days wiseacres used to write books about how trains would get faster and all the world be one empire and tramcars go to the moon and even as a child i used to say to myself far more likely that we shall go on the crusades again or worship the gods of the city and so it has been and i am glad though this is my last battle  even as he spoke there came a crash of steel from the left and he turned his head  wilson he cried with a kind of joy red wilson has charged our left no one can hold him in he eats swords he is as keen a soldier as turnbull but less patientless really great ha and barker is moving how barker has improved how handsome he looks it is not all having plumes it is also having a soul in ones daily life ha  and another crash of steel on the right showed that barker had closed with notting hill on the other side  turnbull is there cried wayne see him hurl them back barker is checked turnbull chargeswins but our left is broken wilson has smashed bowles and mead and may turn our flank forward the provosts guard  and the whole centre moved forward waynes face and hair and sword flaming in the van  the king ran suddenly forward  the next instant a great jar that went through it told that it had met the enemy and right over against them through the wood of their own weapons auberon saw the purple eagle of buck of north kensington  on the left red wilson was storming the broken ranks his little green figure conspicuous even in the tangle of men and weapons with the flaming red moustaches and the crown of laurel bowles slashed at his head and tore away some of the wreath leaving the rest bloody and with a roar like a bulls wilson sprang at him and after a rattle of fencing plunged his point into the chemist who fell crying notting hill then the notting hillers wavered and bayswater swept them back in confusion wilson had carried everything before him  on the right however turnbull had carried the red lion banner with a rush against barkers men and the banner of the golden birds bore up with difficulty against it barkers men fell fast in the centre wayne and buck were engaged stubborn and confused so far as the fighting went it was precisely equal but the fighting was a farce for behind the three small armies with which waynes small army was engaged lay the great sea of the allied armies which looked on as yet as scornful spectators but could have broken all four armies by moving a finger  suddenly they did move some of the front contingents the pastoral chiefs from shepherds bush with their spears and fleeces were seen advancing and the rude clans from paddington green they were advancing for a very good reason buck of north kensington was signalling wildly he was surrounded and totally cut off his regiments were a struggling mass of people islanded in a red sea of notting hill  the allies had been too careless and confident they had allowed barkers force to be broken to pieces by turnbull and the moment that was done the astute old leader of notting hill swung his men round and attacked buck behind and on both sides at the same moment wayne cried charge and struck him in front like a thunderbolt  twothirds of bucks men were cut to pieces before their allies could reach them then the sea of cities came on with their banners like breakers and swallowed notting hill for ever the battle was not over for not one of waynes men would surrender and it lasted till sundown and long after but it was decided the story of notting hill was ended  when turnbull saw it he ceased a moment from fighting and looked round him the evening sunlight struck his face it looked like a childs  i have had my youth he said then snatching an axe from a man he dashed into the thick of the spears of shepherds bush and died somewhere far in the depths of their reeling ranks then the battle roared on every man of notting hill was slain before night  wayne was standing by a tree alone after the battle several men approached him with axes one struck at him his foot seemed partly to slip but he flung his hand out and steadied himself against the tree  barker sprang after him sword in hand and shaking with excitement  how large now my lord he cried is the empire of notting hill  wayne smiled in the gathering dark  always as large as this he said and swept his sword round in a semicircle of silver  barker dropped wounded in the neck and wilson sprang over his body like a tigercat rushing at wayne at the same moment there came behind the lord of the red lion a cry and a flare of yellow and a mass of the west kensington halberdiers ploughed up the slope kneedeep in grass bearing the yellow banner of the city before them and shouting aloud  at the same second wilson went down under waynes sword seemingly smashed like a fly the great sword rose again like a bird but wilson seemed to rise with it and his sword being broken sprang at waynes throat like a dog the foremost of the yellow halberdiers had reached the tree and swung his axe above the struggling wayne with a curse the king whirled up his own halberd and dashed the blade in the mans face he reeled and rolled down the slope just as the furious wilson was flung on his back again and again he was on his feet and again at waynes throat then he was flung again but this time laughing triumphantly grasped in his hand was the red and yellow favour that wayne wore as provost of notting hill he had torn it from the place where it had been carried for twentyfive years  with a shout the west kensington men closed round wayne the great yellow banner flapping over his head  where is your favour now provost cried the west kensington leader  and a laugh went up  adam struck at the standardbearer and brought him reeling forward as the banner stooped he grasped the yellow folds and tore off a shred a halberdier struck him on the shoulder wounding bloodily  here is one colour he cried pushing the yellow into his belt and here he cried pointing to his own bloodhere is the other  at the same instant the shock of a sudden and heavy halberd laid the king stunned or dead in the wild visions of vanishing consciousness he saw again something that belonged to an utterly forgotten time something that he had seen somewhere long ago in a restaurant he saw with his swimming eyes red and yellow the colours of nicaragua  quin did not see the end wilson wild with joy sprang again at adam wayne and the great sword of notting hill was whirled above once more then men ducked instinctively at the rushing noise of the sword coming down out of the sky and wilson of bayswater was smashed and wiped down upon the floor like a fly nothing was left of him but a wreck but the blade that had broken him was broken in dying he had snapped the great sword and the spell of it the sword of wayne was broken at the hilt one rush of the enemy carried wayne by force against the tree they were too close to use halberd or even sword they were breast to breast even nostrils to nostrils but buck got his dagger free  kill him he cried in a strange stifled voice kill him good or bad he is none of us do not be blinded by the face god have we not been blinded all along and he drew his arm back for a stab and seemed to close his eyes  wayne did not drop the hand that hung on to the treebranch but a mighty heave went over his breast and his whole huge figure like an earthquake over great hills and with that convulsion of effort he rent the branch out of the tree with tongues of torn wood and swaying it once only he let the splintered club fall on buck breaking his neck the planner of the great road fell face foremost dead with his dagger in a grip of steel  for you and me and for all brave men my brother said wayne in his strange chant there is good wine poured in the inn at the end of the world  the packed men made another lurch or heave towards him it was almost too dark to fight clearly he caught hold of the oak again this time getting his hand into a wide crevice and grasping as it were the bowels of the tree the whole crowd numbering some thirty men made a rush to tear him away from it they hung on with all their weight and numbers and nothing stirred a solitude could not have been stiller than that group of straining men then there was a faint sound  his hand is slipping cried two men in exultation  you dont know much of him said another grimly a man of the old war more likely his bone cracks  it is neitherby god it is neither said one of the first two  what is it then asked the second  the tree is falling he replied  as the tree falleth so shall it lie said waynes voice out of the darkness and it had the same sweet and yet horrible air that it had had throughout of coming from a great distance from before or after the event even when he was struggling like an eel or battering like a madman he spoke like a spectator as the tree falleth so shall it lie he said men have called that a gloomy text it is the essence of all exultation i am doing now what i have done all my life what is the only happiness what is the only universality i am clinging to something let it fall and there let it lie fools you go about and see the kingdoms of the earth and are liberal and wise and cosmopolitan which is all that the devil can give youall that he could offer to christ only to be spurned away i am doing what the truly wise do when a child goes out into the garden and takes hold of a tree saying let this tree be all i have that moment its roots take hold on hell and its branches on the stars the joy i have is what the lover knows when a woman is everything it is what a savage knows when his idol is everything it is what i know when notting hill is everything i have a city let it stand or fall  as he spoke the turf lifted itself like a living thing and out of it rose slowly like crested serpents the roots of the oak then the great head of the tree that seemed a green cloud among grey ones swept the sky suddenly like a broom and the whole tree heeled over like a ship smashing every one in its fall     chapter iiitwo voices   in a place in which there was total darkness for hours there was also for hours total silence then a voice spoke out of the darkness no one could have told from where and said aloud  so ends the empire of notting hill as it began in blood so it ended in blood and all things are always the same  and there was silence again and then again there was a voice but it had not the same tone it seemed that it was not the same voice  if all things are always the same it is because they are always heroic if all things are always the same it is because they are always new to each man one soul only is given to each soul only is given a little powerthe power at some moments to outgrow and swallow up the stars if age after age that power comes upon men whatever gives it to them is great whatever makes men feel old is meanan empire or a skinflint shop whatever makes men feel young is greata great war or a lovestory and in the darkest of the books of god there is written a truth that is also a riddle it is of the new things that men tireof fashions and proposals and improvements and change it is the old things that startle and intoxicate it is the old things that are young there is no sceptic who does not feel that many have doubted before there is no rich and fickle man who does not feel that all his novelties are ancient there is no worshipper of change who does not feel upon his neck the vast weight of the weariness of the universe but we who do the old things are fed by nature with a perpetual infancy no man who is in love thinks that any one has been in love before no woman who has a child thinks that there have been such things as children no people that fight for their own city are haunted with the burden of the broken empires yes o dark voice the world is always the same for it is always unexpected  a little gust of wind blew through the night and then the first voice answered  but in this world there are some be they wise or foolish whom nothing intoxicates there are some who see all your disturbances like a cloud of flies they know that while men will laugh at your notting hill and will study and rehearse and sing of athens and jerusalem athens and jerusalem were silly suburbs like your notting hill they know that the earth itself is a suburb and can feel only drearily and respectably amused as they move upon it  they are philosophers or they are fools said the other voice they are not men men live as i say rejoicing from age to age in something fresher than progressin the fact that with every baby a new sun and a new moon are made if our ancient humanity were a single man it might perhaps be that he would break down under the memory of so many loyalties under the burden of so many diverse heroisms under the load and terror of all the goodness of men but it has pleased god so to isolate the individual soul that it can only learn of all other souls by hearsay and to each one goodness and happiness come with the youth and violence of lightning as momentary and as pure and the doom of failure that lies on all human systems does not in real fact affect them any more than the worms of the inevitable grave affect a childrens game in a meadow notting hill has fallen notting hill has died but that is not the tremendous issue notting hill has lived  but if answered the other voice if what is achieved by all these efforts be only the common contentment of humanity why do men so extravagantly toil and die in them has nothing been done by notting hill than any chance clump of farmers or clan of savages would not have done without it what might have been done to notting hill if the world had been different may be a deep question but there is a deeper what could have happened to the world if notting hill had never been  the other voice replied  the same that would have happened to the world and all the starry systems if an appletree grew six apples instead of seven something would have been eternally lost there has never been anything in the world absolutely like notting hill there will never be anything quite like it to the crack of doom i cannot believe anything but that god loved it as he must surely love anything that is itself and unreplaceable but even for that i do not care if god with all his thunders hated it i loved it  and with the voice a tall strange figure lifted itself out of the débris in the halfdarkness  the other voice came after a long pause and as it were hoarsely  but suppose the whole matter were really a hocuspocus suppose that whatever meaning you may choose in your fancy to give to it the real meaning of the whole was mockery suppose it was all folly suppose  i have been in it answered the voice from the tall and strange figure and i know it was not  a smaller figure seemed half to rise in the dark  suppose i am god said the voice and suppose i made the world in idleness suppose the stars that you think eternal are only the idiot fireworks of an everlasting schoolboy suppose the sun and the moon to which you sing alternately are only the two eyes of one vast and sneering giant opened alternately in a neverending wink suppose the trees in my eyes are as foolish as enormous toadstools suppose socrates and charlemagne are to me only beasts made funnier by walking on their hind legs suppose i am god and having made things laugh at them  and suppose i am man answered the other and suppose that i give the answer that shatters even a laugh suppose i do not laugh back at you do not blaspheme you do not curse you but suppose standing up straight under the sky with every power of my being i thank you for the fools paradise you have made suppose i praise you with a literal pain of ecstasy for the jest that has brought me so terrible a joy if we have taken the childs games and given them the seriousness of a crusade if we have drenched your grotesque dutch garden with the blood of martyrs we have turned a nursery into a temple i ask you in the name of heaven who wins  the sky close about the crests of the hills and trees was beginning to turn from black to grey with a random suggestion of the morning the slight figure seemed to crawl towards the larger one and the voice was more human  but suppose friend it said suppose that in a bitterer and more real sense it was all a mockery suppose that there had been from the beginning of these great wars one who watched them with a sense that is beyond expression a sense of detachment of responsibility of irony of agony suppose that there were one who knew it was all a joke  the tall figure answered  he could not know it for it was not all a joke  and a gust of wind blew away some clouds that sealed the skyline and showed a strip of silver behind his great dark legs then the other voice came having crept nearer still  illustration wayne it was all a joke  adam wayne it said there are men who confess only in articulo mortis there are people who blame themselves only when they can no longer help others i am one of them here upon the field of the bloody end of it all i come to tell you plainly what you would never understand before do you know who i am  i know you auberon quin answered the tall figure and i shall be glad to unburden your spirit of anything that lies upon it  adam wayne said the other voice of what i have to say you cannot in common reason be glad to unburden me wayne it was all a joke when i made these cities i cared no more for them than i care for a centaur or a merman or a fish with legs or a pig with feathers or any other absurdity when i spoke to you solemnly and encouragingly about the flag of your freedom and the peace of your city i was playing a vulgar practical joke on an honest gentleman a vulgar practical joke that has lasted for twenty years though no one could believe it of me perhaps it is the truth that i am a man both timid and tenderhearted i never dared in the early days of your hope or the central days of your supremacy to tell you this i never dared to break the colossal calm of your face god knows why i should do it now when my farce has ended in tragedy and the ruin of all your people but i say it now wayne it was done as a joke  there was silence and the freshening breeze blew the sky clearer and clearer leaving great spaces of the white dawn  at last wayne said very slowly  you did it all only as a joke  yes said quin briefly  when you conceived the idea went on wayne dreamily of an army for bayswater and a flag for notting hill there was no gleam no suggestion in your mind that such things might be real and passionate  no answered auberon turning his round white face to the morning with a dull and splendid sincerity i had none at all  wayne sprang down from the height above him and held out his hand  i will not stop to thank you he said with a curious joy in his voice for the great good for the world you have actually wrought all that i think of that i have said to you a moment ago even when i thought that your voice was the voice of a derisive omnipotence its laughter older than the winds of heaven but let me say what is immediate and true you and i auberon quin have both of us throughout our lives been again and again called mad and we are mad we are mad because we are not two men but one man we are mad because we are two lobes of the same brain and that brain has been cloven in two and if you ask for the proof of it it is not hard to find it is not merely that you the humorist have been in these dark days stripped of the joy of gravity it is not merely that i the fanatic have had to grope without humour it is that though we seem to be opposite in everything we have been opposite like man and woman aiming at the same moment at the same practical thing we are the father and the mother of the charter of the cities  quin looked down at the débris of leaves and timber the relics of the battle and stampede now glistening in the growing daylight and finally said  yet nothing can alter the antagonismthe fact that i laughed at these things and you adored them  waynes wild face flamed with something godlike as he turned it to be struck by the sunrise  i know of something that will alter that antagonism something that is outside us something that you and i have all our lives perhaps taken too little account of the equal and eternal human being will alter that antagonism for the human being sees no real antagonism between laughter and respect the human being the common man whom mere geniuses like you and me can only worship like a god when dark and dreary days come you and i are necessary the pure fanatic the pure satirist we have between us remedied a great wrong we have lifted the modern cities into that poetry which every one who knows mankind knows to be immeasurably more common than the commonplace but in healthy people there is no war between us we are but the two lobes of the brain of a ploughman laughter and love are everywhere the cathedrals built in the ages that loved god are full of blasphemous grotesques the mother laughs continually at the child the lover laughs continually at the lover the wife at the husband the friend at the friend auberon quin we have been too long separated let us go out together you have a halberd and i a sword let us start our wanderings over the world for we are its two essentials come it is already day  in the blank white light auberon hesitated a moment then he made the formal salute with his halberd and they went away together into the unknown world   the end     mr lanes new fiction   the new military novel  life in a garrison
