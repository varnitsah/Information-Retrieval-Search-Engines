                188     the elements of drawing was written during the winter of 1856 the first edition was published in 1857 the second followed in the same year with some additions and slight alterations the third edition consisted of sixth thousand 1859 seventh thousand 1860 and eighth thousand 1861  the work was partly reproduced in our sketching club by the rev r st john tyrwhitt ma 1874 with new editions in 1875 1882 and 1886  mr ruskin meant during his tenure of the slade professorship at oxford to recast his teaching and to write a systematic manual for the use of his drawing school under the title of the laws of f√©sole of this only vol i was completed 1879 second edition 1882  as therefore the elements of drawing has never been completely superseded and as many readers of mr ruskins works have expressed a desire to possess the book in its old form it is now reprinted as it stood in 1859     advertisement  to  the second edition   as one or two questions asked of me since the publication of this work have indicated points requiring elucidation i have added a few short notes in the first appendix it is not i think desirable otherwise to modify the form or add to the matter of a book as it passes through successive editions i have therefore only mended the wording of some obscure sentences with which exception the text remains and will remain in its original form which i had carefully considered should the public find the book useful and call for further editions of it such additional notes as may be necessary will be always placed in the first appendix where they can be at once referred to in any library by the possessors of the earlier editions and i will take care they shall not be numerous    august 3 1857     preface   i it may perhaps be thought that in prefacing a manual of drawing i ought to expatiate on the reasons why drawing should be learned but those reasons appear to me so many and so weighty that i cannot quickly state or enforce them with the readers permission as this volume is too large already i will waive all discussion respecting the importance of the subject and touch only on those points which may appear questionable in the method of its treatment  ii in the first place the book is not calculated for the use of children under the age of twelve or fourteen i do not think it advisable to engage a child in any but the most voluntary practice of art if it has talent for drawing it will be continually scrawling on what paper it can get and should be allowed to scrawl at its own free will due praise being given for every appearance of care or truth in its efforts it should be allowed to amuse itself with cheap colors almost as soon as it has sense enough to wish for them if it merely daubs the paper with shapeless stains the colorbox may be taken away till it knows better but as soon as it begins painting red coats on soldiers striped flags to ships etc it should have colors at command and without restraining its choice of subject in that imaginative and historical art of a military tendency which children delight in generally quite as valuable by the way as any historical art delighted in by their elders it should be gently led by the parents to try to draw in such childish fashion as may be the things it can see and likesbirds or butterflies or flowers or fruit  iii in later years the indulgence of using the color should only be granted as a reward after it has shown care and progress in its drawings with pencil a limited number of good and amusing prints should always be within a boys reach in these days of cheap illustration he can hardly possess a volume of nursery tales without good woodcuts in it and should be encouraged to copy what he likes best of this kind but should be firmly restricted to a few prints and to a few books if a child has many toys it will get tired of them and break them if a boy has many prints he will merely dawdle and scrawl over them it is by the limitation of the number of his possessions that his pleasure in them is perfected and his attention concentrated the parents need give themselves no trouble in instructing him as far as drawing is concerned beyond insisting upon economical and neat habits with his colors and paper showing him the best way of holding pencil and rule and so far as they take notice of his work pointing out where a line is too short or too long or too crooked when compared with the copy accuracy being the first and last thing they look for if the child shows talent for inventing or grouping figures the parents should neither check nor praise it they may laugh with it frankly or show pleasure in what it has done just as they show pleasure in seeing it well or cheerful but they must not praise it for being clever any more than they would praise it for being stout they should praise it only for what costs it selfdenial namely attention and hard work otherwise they will make it work for vanitys sake and always badly the best books to put into its hands are those illustrated by george cruikshank or by richter see appendix at about the age of twelve or fourteen it is quite time enough to set youth or girl to serious work and then this book will i think be useful to them and i have good hope it may be so likewise to persons of more advanced age wishing to know something of the first principles of art  iv yet observe that the method of study recommended is not brought forward as absolutely the best but only as the best which i can at present devise for an isolated student it is very likely that farther experience in teaching may enable me to modify it with advantage in several important respects but i am sure the main principles of it are sound and most of the exercises as useful as they can be rendered without a masters superintendence the method differs however so materially from that generally adopted by drawingmasters that a word or two of explanation may be needed to justify what might otherwise be thought willful eccentricity  v the manuals at present published on the subject of drawing are all directed as far as i know to one or other of two objects either they propose to give the student a power of dexterous sketching with pencil or watercolor so as to emulate at considerable distance the slighter work of our secondrate artists or they propose to give him such accurate command of mathematical forms as may afterwards enable him to design rapidly and cheaply for manufactures when drawing is taught as an accomplishment the first is the aim usually proposed while the second is the object kept chiefly in view at marlborough house and in the branch government schools of design  vi of the fitness of the modes of study adopted in those schools to the end specially intended judgment is hardly yet possible only it seems to me that we are all too much in the habit of confusing art as applied to manufacture with manufacture itself for instance the skill by which an inventive workman designs and molds a beautiful cup is skill of true art but the skill by which that cup is copied and afterwards multiplied a thousandfold is skill of manufacture and the faculties which enable one workman to design and elaborate his original piece are not to be developed by the same system of instruction as those which enable another to produce a maximum number of approximate copies of it in a given time farther it is surely inexpedient that any reference to purposes of manufacture should interfere with the education of the artist himself try first to manufacture a raphael then let raphael direct your manufacture he will design you a plate or cup or a house or a palace whenever you want it and design them in the most convenient and rational way but do not let your anxiety to reach the platter and the cup interfere with your education of the raphael obtain first the best work you can and the ablest hands irrespective of any consideration of economy or facility of production then leave your trained artist to determine how far art can be popularized or manufacture ennobled  vii now i believe that irrespective of differences in individual temper and character the excellence of an artist as such depends wholly on refinement of perception and that it is this mainly which a master or a school can teach so that while powers of invention distinguish man from man powers of perception distinguish school from school all great schools enforce delicacy of drawing and subtlety of sight and the only rule which i have as yet found to be without exception respecting art is that all great art is delicate  viii therefore the chief aim and bent of the following system is to obtain first a perfectly patient and to the utmost of the pupils power a delicate method of work such as may insure his seeing truly for i am nearly convinced that when once we see keenly enough there is very little difficulty in drawing what we see but even supposing that this difficulty be still great i believe that the sight is a more important thing than the drawing and i would rather teach drawing that my pupils may learn to love nature than teach the looking at nature that they may learn to draw it is surely also a more important thing for young people and unprofessional students to know how to appreciate the art of others than to gain much power in art themselves now the modes of sketching ordinarily taught are inconsistent with this power of judgment no person trained to the superficial execution of modern watercolor painting can understand the work of titian or leonardo they must forever remain blind to the refinement of such mens penciling and the precision of their thinking but however slight a degree of manipulative power the student may reach by pursuing the mode recommended to him in these letters i will answer for it that he cannot go once through the advised exercises without beginning to understand what masterly work means and by the time he has gained some proficiency in them he will have a pleasure in looking at the painting of the great schools and a new perception of the exquisiteness of natural scenery such as would repay him for much more labor than i have asked him to undergo  ix that labor is nevertheless sufficiently irksome nor is it possible that it should be otherwise so long as the pupil works unassisted by a master for the smooth and straight road which admits unembarrassed progress must i fear be dull as well as smooth and the hedges need to be close and trim when there is no guide to warn or bring back the erring traveler the system followed in this work will therefore at first surprise somewhat sorrowfully those who are familiar with the practice of our class at the working mens college for there the pupil having the master at his side to extricate him from such embarrassments as his first efforts may lead into is at once set to draw from a solid object and soon finds entertainment in his efforts and interest in his difficulties of course the simplest object which it is possible to set before the eye is a sphere and practically i find a childs toy a white leather ball better than anything else as the gradations on balls of plaster of paris which i use sometimes to try the strength of pupils who have had previous practice are a little too delicate for a beginner to perceive it has been objected that a circle or the outline of a sphere is one of the most difficult of all lines to draw it is soa but i do not want it to be drawn all that his study of the ball is to teach the pupil is the way in which shade gives the appearance of projection this he learns most satisfactorily from a sphere because any solid form terminated by straight lines or flat surfaces owes some of its appearance of projection to its perspective but in the sphere what without shade was a flat circle becomes merely by the added shade the image of a solid ball and this fact is just as striking to the learner whether his circular outline be true or false he is therefore never allowed to trouble himself about it if he makes the ball look as oval as an egg the degree of error is simply pointed out to him and he does better next time and better still the next but his mind is always fixed on the gradation of shade and the outline left to take in due time care of itself i call it outline for the sake of immediate intelligibilitystrictly speaking it is merely the edge of the shade no pupil in my class being ever allowed to draw an outline in the ordinary sense it is pointed out to him from the first that nature relieves one mass or one tint against another but outlines none the outline exercise the second suggested in this letter is recommended not to enable the pupil to draw outlines but as the only means by which unassisted he can test his accuracy of eye and discipline his hand when the master is by errors in the form and extent of shadows can be pointed out as easily as in outline and the handling can be gradually corrected in details of the work but the solitary student can only find out his own mistakes by help of the traced limit and can only test the firmness of his hand by an exercise in which nothing but firmness is required and during which all other considerations as of softness complexity etc are entirely excluded  x both the system adopted at the working mens college and that recommended here agree however in one principle which i consider the most important and special of all that are involved in my teaching namely the attaching its full importance from the first to local color i believe that the endeavor to separate in the course of instruction the observation of light and shade from that of local color has always been and must always be destructive of the students power of accurate sight and that it corrupts his taste as much as it retards his progress i will not occupy the readers time by any discussion of the principle here but i wish him to note it as the only distinctive one in my system so far as it is a system for the recommendation to the pupil to copy faithfully and without alteration whatever natural object he chooses to study is serviceable among other reasons just because it gets rid of systematic rules altogether and teaches people to draw as country lads learn to ride without saddle or stirrups my main object being at first not to get my pupils to hold their reins prettily but to sit like a jackanapes never off  xi in these written instructions therefore it has always been with regret that i have seen myself forced to advise anything like monotonous or formal discipline but to the unassisted student such formalities are indispensable and i am not without hope that the sense of secure advancement and the pleasure of independent effort may render the following out of even the more tedious exercises here proposed possible to the solitary learner without weariness but if it should be otherwise and he finds the first steps painfully irksome i can only desire him to consider whether the acquirement of so great a power as that of pictorial expression of thought be not worth some toil or whether it is likely in the natural order of matters in this working world that so great a gift should be attainable by those who will give no price for it  xii one task however of some difficulty the student will find i have not imposed upon him namely learning the laws of perspective it would be worth while to learn them if he could do so easily but without a masters help and in the way perspective is at present explained in treatises the difficulty is greater than the gain for perspective is not of the slightest use except in rudimentary work you can draw the rounding line of a table in perspective but you cannot draw the sweep of a sea bay you can foreshorten a log of wood by it but you cannot foreshorten an arm its laws are too gross and few to be applied to any subtle form therefore as you must learn to draw the subtle forms by the eye certainly you may draw the simple ones no great painters ever trouble themselves about perspective and very few of them know its laws they draw everything by the eye and naturally enough disdain in the easy parts of their work rules which cannot help them in difficult ones it would take about a months labor to draw imperfectly by laws of perspective what any great venetian will draw perfectly in five minutes when he is throwing a wreath of leaves round a head or bending the curves of a pattern in and out among the folds of drapery it is true that when perspective was first discovered everybody amused themselves with it and all the great painters put fine saloons and arcades behind their madonnas merely to show that they could draw in perspective but even this was generally done by them only to catch the public eye and they disdained the perspective so much that though they took the greatest pains with the circlet of a crown or the rim of a crystal cup in the heart of their picture they would twist their capitals of columns and towers of churches about in the background in the most wanton way wherever they liked the lines to go provided only they left just perspective enough to please the public  xiii in modern days i doubt if any artist among us except david roberts knows so much perspective as would enable him to draw a gothic arch to scale at a given angle and distance turner though he was professor of perspective to the royal academy did not know what he professed and never as far as i remember drew a single building in true perspective in his life he drew them only with as much perspective as suited him prout also knew nothing of perspective and twisted his buildings as turner did into whatever shapes he liked i do not justify this and would recommend the student at least to treat perspective with common civility but to pay no court to it the best way he can learn it by himself is by taking a pane of glass fixed in a frame so that it can be set upright before the eye at the distance at which the proposed sketch is intended to be seen let the eye be placed at some fixed point opposite the middle of the pane of glass but as high or as low as the student likes then with a brush at the end of a stick and a little bodycolor that will adhere to the glass the lines of the landscape may be traced on the glass as you see them through it when so traced they are all in true perspective if the glass be sloped in any direction the lines are still in true perspective only it is perspective calculated for a sloping plane while common perspective always supposes the plane of the picture to be vertical it is good in early practice to accustom yourself to inclose your subject before sketching it with a light frame of wood held upright before you it will show you what you may legitimately take into your picture and what choice there is between a narrow foreground near you and a wide one farther off also what height of tree or building you can properly take in etcb  xiv of figure drawing nothing is said in the following pages because i do not think figures as chief subjects can be drawn to any good purpose by an amateur as accessaries in landscape they are just to be drawn on the same principles as anything else  xv lastly if any of the directions given subsequently to the student should be found obscure by him or if at any stage of the recommended practice he find himself in difficulties which i have not enough provided against he may apply by letter to mr ward who is my under drawingmaster at the working mens college 45 great ormond street and who will give any required assistance on the lowest terms that can remunerate him for the occupation of his time i have not leisure myself in general to answer letters of inquiry however much i may desire to do so but mr ward has always the power of referring any question to me when he thinks it necessary i have good hope however that enough guidance is given in this work to prevent the occurrence of any serious embarrassment and i believe that the student who obeys its directions will find on the whole that the best answerer of questions is perseverance and the best drawingmasters are the woods and hills    1857   footnotes    a or more accurately appears to be so because any one can see     an error in a circle    b if the student is fond of architecture and wishes to know more     of perspective than he can learn in this rough way mr runciman of     49 acacia road st johns wood who was my first drawingmaster     and to whom i owe many happy hours can teach it him quickly     easily and rightly mr runciman has died since this was written     mr wards present address is bedford chambers 28 southampton     street strand london wc     the  elements of drawing     letter i  on first practice   1 my dear readerwhether this book is to be of use to you or not depends wholly on your reason for wishing to learn to draw if you desire only to possess a graceful accomplishment to be able to converse in a fluent manner about drawing or to amuse yourself listlessly in listless hours i cannot help you but if you wish to learn drawing that you may be able to set down clearly and usefully records of such things as cannot be described in words either to assist your own memory of them or to convey distinct ideas of them to other people if you wish to obtain quicker perceptions of the beauty of the natural world and to preserve something like a true image of beautiful things that pass away or which you must yourself leave if also you wish to understand the minds of great painters and to be able to appreciate their work sincerely seeing it for yourself and loving it not merely taking up the thoughts of other people about it then i can help you or which is better show you how to help yourself  2 only you must understand first of all that these powers which indeed are noble and desirable cannot be got without work it is much easier to learn to draw well than it is to learn to play well on any musical instrument but you know that it takes three or four years of practice giving three or four hours a day to acquire even ordinary command over the keys of a piano and you must not think that a masterly command of your pencil and the knowledge of what may be done with it can be acquired without painstaking or in a very short time the kind of drawing which is taught or supposed to be taught in our schools in a term or two perhaps at the rate of an hours practice a week is not drawing at all it is only the performance of a few dexterous not always even that evolutions on paper with a blacklead pencil profitless alike to performer and beholder unless as a matter of vanity and that the smallest possible vanity if any young person after being taught what is in polite circles called drawing will try to copy the commonest piece of real worksuppose a lithograph on the titlepage of a new opera air or a woodcut in the cheapest illustrated newspaper of the daythey will find themselves entirely beaten and yet that common lithograph was drawn with coarse chalk much more difficult to manage than the pencil of which an accomplished young lady is supposed to have command and that woodcut was drawn in urgent haste and half spoiled in the cutting afterwards and both were done by people whom nobody thinks of as artists or praises for their power both were done for daily bread with no more artists pride than any simple handicraftsmen feel in the work they live by  3 do not therefore think that you can learn drawing any more than a new language without some hard and disagreeable labor but do not on the other hand if you are ready and willing to pay this price fear that you may be unable to get on for want of special talent it is indeed true that the persons who have peculiar talent for art draw instinctively and get on almost without teaching though never without toil it is true also that of inferior talent for drawing there are many degrees it will take one person a much longer time than another to attain the same results and the results thus painfully attained are never quite so satisfactory as those got with greater ease when the faculties are naturally adapted to the study but i have never yet in the experiments i have made met with a person who could not learn to draw at all and in general there is a satisfactory and available power in every one to learn drawing if he wishes just as nearly all persons have the power of learning french latin or arithmetic in a decent and useful degree if their lot in life requires them to possess such knowledge  4 supposing then that you are ready to take a certain amount of pains and to bear a little irksomeness and a few disappointments bravely i can promise you that an hours practice a day for six months or an hours practice every other day for twelve months or disposed in whatever way you find convenient some hundred and fifty hours practice will give you sufficient power of drawing faithfully whatever you want to draw and a good judgment up to a certain point of other peoples work of which hours if you have one to spare at present we may as well begin at once   exercise i  5 everything that you can see in the world around you presents itself to your eyes only as an arrangement of patches of different colors variously shaded1 some of these patches of color have an appearance of lines or texture within them as a piece of cloth or silk has of threads or an animals skin shows texture of hairs but whether this be the case or not the first broad aspect of the thing is that of a patch of some definite color and the first thing to be learned is how to produce extents of smooth color without texture  6 this can only be done properly with a brush but a brush being soft at the point causes so much uncertainty in the touch of an unpracticed hand that it is hardly possible to learn to draw first with it and it is better to take in early practice some instrument with a hard and fine point both that we may give some support to the hand and that by working over the subject with so delicate a point the attention may be properly directed to all the most minute parts of it even the best artists need occasionally to study subjects with a pointed instrument in order thus to discipline their attention and a beginner must be content to do so for a considerable period  illustration fig 1  7 also observe that before we trouble ourselves about differences of color we must be able to lay on one color properly in whatever gradations of depth and whatever shapes we want we will try therefore first to lay on tints or patches of gray of whatever depth we want with a pointed instrument take any finely pointed steel pen one of gillotts lithographic crowquills is best and a piece of quite smooth but not shining notepaper cream laid and get some ink that has stood already some time in the inkstand so as to be quite black and as thick as it can be without clogging the pen take a rule and draw four straight lines so as to inclose a square or nearly a square about as large as a fig 1 i say nearly a square because it does not in the least matter whether it is quite square or not the object being merely to get a space inclosed by straight lines  8 now try to fill in that square space with crossed lines so completely and evenly that it shall look like a square patch of gray silk or cloth cut out and laid on the white paper as at b cover it quickly first with straightish lines in any direction you like not troubling yourself to draw them much closer or neater than those in the square a let them quite dry before retouching them if you draw three or four squares side by side you may always be going on with one while the others are drying then cover these lines with others in a different direction and let those dry then in another direction still and let those dry always wait long enough to run no risk of blotting and then draw the lines as quickly as you can each ought to be laid on as swiftly as the dash of the pen of a good writer but if you try to reach this great speed at first you will go over the edge of the square which is a fault in this exercise yet it is better to do so now and then than to draw the lines very slowly for if you do the pen leaves a little dot of ink at the end of each line and these dots spoil your work so draw each line quickly stopping always as nearly as you can at the edge of the square the ends of lines which go over the edge are afterwards to be removed with the penknife but not till you have done the whole work otherwise you roughen the paper and the next line that goes over the edge makes a blot  9 when you have gone over the whole three or four times you will find some parts of the square look darker than other parts now try to make the lighter parts as dark as the rest so that the whole may be of equal depth or darkness you will find on examining the work that where it looks darkest the lines are closest or there are some much darker lines than elsewhere therefore you must put in other lines or little scratches and dots between the lines in the paler parts and where there are any very conspicuous dark lines scratch them out lightly with the penknife for the eye must not be attracted by any line in particular the more carefully and delicately you fill in the little gaps and holes the better you will get on faster by doing two or three squares perfectly than a great many badly as the tint gets closer and begins to look even work with very little ink in your pen so as hardly to make any mark on the paper and at last where it is too dark use the edge of your penknife very lightly and for some time to wear it softly into an even tone you will find that the greatest difficulty consists in getting evenness one bit will always look darker than another bit of your square or there will be a granulated and sandy look over the whole when you find your paper quite rough and in a mess give it up and begin another square but do not rest satisfied till you have done your best with every square the tint at last ought at least to be as close and even as that in b fig 1 you will find however that it is very difficult to get a pale tint because naturally the ink lines necessary to produce a close tint at all blacken the paper more than you want you must get over this difficulty not so much by leaving the lines wide apart as by trying to draw them excessively fine lightly and swiftly being very cautious in filling in and at last passing the penknife over the whole by keeping several squares in progress at one time and reserving your pen for the light one just when the ink is nearly exhausted you may get on better the paper ought at last to look lightly and evenly toned all over with no lines distinctly visible   exercise ii  10 as this exercise in shading is very tiresome it will be well to vary it by proceeding with another at the same time the power of shading rightly depends mainly on lightness of hand and keenness of sight but there are other qualities required in drawing dependent not merely on lightness but steadiness of hand and the eye to be perfect in its power must be made accurate as well as keen and not only see shrewdly but measure justly  11 possess yourself therefore of any cheap work on botany containing outline plates of leaves and flowers it does not matter whether bad or good baxters british flowering plants is quite good enough copy any of the simplest outlines first with a soft pencil following it by the eye as nearly as you can if it does not look right in proportions rub out and correct it always by the eye till you think it is right when you have got it to your mind lay tracingpaper on the book on this paper trace the outline you have been copying and apply it to your own and having thus ascertained the faults correct them all patiently till you have got it as nearly accurate as may be work with a very soft pencil and do not rub out so hard2 as to spoil the surface of your paper never mind how dirty the paper gets but do not roughen it and let the false outlines alone where they do not really interfere with the true one it is a good thing to accustom yourself to hew and shape your drawing out of a dirty piece of paper when you have got it as right as you can take a quill pen not very fine at the point rest your hand on a book about an inch and a half thick so as to hold the pen long and go over your pencil outline with ink raising your pen point as seldom as possible and never leaning more heavily on one part of the line than on another in most outline drawings of the present day parts of the curves are thickened to give an effect of shade all such outlines are bad but they will serve well enough for your exercises provided you do not imitate this character it is better however if you can to choose a book of pure outlines it does not in the least matter whether your pen outline be thin or thick but it matters greatly that it should be equal not heavier in one place than in another the power to be obtained is that of drawing an even line slowly and in any direction all dashing lines or approximations to penmanship are bad the pen should as it were walk slowly over the ground and you should be able at any moment to stop it or to turn it in any other direction like a wellmanaged horse  12 as soon as you can copy every curve slowly and accurately you have made satisfactory progress but you will find the difficulty is in the slowness it is easy to draw what appears to be a good line with a sweep of the hand or with what is called freedom3 the real difficulty and masterliness is in never letting the hand be free but keeping it under entire control at every part of the line   exercise iii  13 meantime you are always to be going on with your shaded squares and chiefly with these the outline exercises being taken up only for rest  illustration fig 2  as soon as you find you have some command of the pen as a shading instrument and can lay a pale or dark tint as you choose try to produce gradated spaces like fig 2 the dark tint passing gradually into the lighter ones nearly all expression of form in drawing depends on your power of gradating delicately and the gradation is always most skillful which passes from one tint into another very little paler draw therefore two parallel lines for limits to your work as in fig 2 and try to gradate the shade evenly from white to black passing over the greatest possible distance yet so that every part of the band may have visible change in it the perception of gradation is very deficient in all beginners not to say in many artists and you will probably for some time think your gradation skillful enough when it is quite patchy and imperfect by getting a piece of gray shaded ribbon and comparing it with your drawing you may arrive in early stages of your work at a wholesome dissatisfaction with it widen your band little by little as you get more skillful so as to give the gradation more lateral space and accustom yourself at the same time to look for gradated spaces in nature the sky is the largest and the most beautiful watch it at twilight after the sun is down and try to consider each pane of glass in the window you look through as a piece of paper colored blue or gray or purple as it happens to be and observe how quietly and continuously the gradation extends over the space in the window of one or two feet square observe the shades on the outside and inside of a common white cup or bowl which make it look round and hollow4 and then on folds of white drapery and thus gradually you will be led to observe the more subtle transitions of the light as it increases or declines on flat surfaces at last when your eye gets keen and true you will see gradation on everything in nature  14 but it will not be in your power yet awhile to draw from any objects in which the gradations are varied and complicated nor will it be a bad omen for your future progress and for the use that art is to be made of by you if the first thing at which you aim should be a little bit of sky so take any narrow space of evening sky that you can usually see between the boughs of a tree or between two chimneys or through the corner of a pane in the window you like best to sit at and try to gradate a little space of white paper as evenly as that is gradatedas tenderly you cannot gradate it without color no nor with color either but you may do it as evenly or if you get impatient with your spots and lines of ink when you look at the beauty of the sky the sense you will have gained of that beauty is something to be thankful for but you ought not to be impatient with your pen and ink for all great painters however delicate their perception of color are fond of the peculiar effect of light which may be got in a penandink sketch and in a woodcut by the gleaming of the white paper between the black lines and if you cannot gradate well with pure black lines you will never gradate well with pale ones by looking at any common woodcuts in the cheap publications of the day you may see how gradation is given to the sky by leaving the lines farther and farther apart but you must make your lines as fine as you can as well as far apart towards the light and do not try to make them long or straight but let them cross irregularly in any directions easy to your hand depending on nothing but their gradation for your effect on this point of direction of lines however i shall have to tell you more presently in the meantime do not trouble yourself about it   exercise iv  15 as soon as you find you can gradate tolerably with the pen take an h or hh pencil using its point to produce shade from the darkest possible to the palest in exactly the same manner as the pen lightening however now with indiarubber instead of the penknife you will find that all pale tints of shade are thus easily producible with great precision and tenderness but that you cannot get the same dark power as with the pen and ink and that the surface of the shade is apt to become glossy and metallic or dirtylooking or sandy persevere however in trying to bring it to evenness with the fine point removing any single speck or line that may be too black with the point of the knife you must not scratch the whole with the knife as you do the ink if you find the texture very speckledlooking lighten it all over with indiarubber and recover it again with sharp and excessively fine touches of the pencil point bringing the parts that are too pale to perfect evenness with the darker spots  you cannot use the point too delicately or cunningly in doing this work with it as if you were drawing the down on a butterflys wing  16 at this stage of your progress if not before you may be assured that some clever friend will come in and hold up his hands in mocking amazement and ask you who could set you to that niggling and if you persevere in it you will have to sustain considerable persecution from your artistical acquaintances generally who will tell you that all good drawing depends on boldness but never mind them you do not hear them tell a child beginning music to lay its little hand with a crash among the keys in imitation of the great masters yet they might as reasonably as they may tell you to be bold in the present state of your knowledge bold in the sense of being undaunted yes but bold in the sense of being careless confident or exhibitorynono and a thousand times no for even if you were not a beginner it would be bad advice that made you bold mischief may easily be done quickly but good and beautiful work is generally done slowly you will find no boldness in the way a flower or a birds wing is painted and if nature is not bold at her work do you think you ought to be at yours so never mind what people say but work with your pencil point very patiently and if you can trust me in anything trust me when i tell you that though there are all kinds and ways of artlarge work for large places small work for narrow places slow work for people who can wait and quick work for people who cannotthere is one quality and i think only one in which all great and good art agreesit is all delicate art coarse art is always bad art you cannot understand this at present because you do not know yet how much tender thought and subtle care the great painters put into touches that at first look coarse but believe me it is true and you will find it is so in due time  17 you will be perhaps also troubled in these first essays at pencil drawing by noticing that more delicate gradations are got in an instant by a chance touch of the indiarubber than by an hours labor with the point and you may wonder why i tell you to produce tints so painfully which might it appears be obtained with ease but there are two reasons the first that when you come to draw forms you must be able to gradate with absolute precision in whatever place and direction you wish not in any wise vaguely as the indiarubber does it and secondly that all natural shadows are more or less mingled with gleams of light in the darkness of ground there is the light of the little pebbles or dust in the darkness of foliage the glitter of the leaves in the darkness of flesh transparency in that of a stone granulation in every case there is some mingling of light which cannot be represented by the leaden tone which you get by rubbing or by an instrument known to artists as the stump when you can manage the point properly you will indeed be able to do much also with this instrument or with your fingers but then you will have to retouch the flat tints afterwards so as to put life and light into them and that can only be done with the point labor on therefore courageously with that only   exercise v  illustration fig 3  18 when you can manage to tint and gradate tenderly with the pencil point get a good large alphabet and try to tint the letters into shape with the pencil point do not outline them first but measure their height and extreme breadth with the compasses as a b a c fig 3 and then scratch in their shapes gradually the letter a inclosed within the lines being in what turner would have called a state of forwardness then when you are satisfied with the shape of the letter draw penandink lines firmly round the tint as at d and remove any touches outside the limit first with the indiarubber and then with the penknife so that all may look clear and right if you rub out any of the pencil inside the outline of the letter retouch it closing it up to the inked line the straight lines of the outline are all to be ruled5 but the curved lines are to be drawn by the eye and hand and you will soon find what good practice there is in getting the curved letters such as bs cs etc to stand quite straight and come into accurate form  19 all these exercises are very irksome and they are not to be persisted in alone neither is it necessary to acquire perfect power in any of them an entire master of the pencil or brush ought indeed to be able to draw any form at once as giotto his circle but such skill as this is only to be expected of the consummate master having pencil in hand all his life and all day longhence the force of giottos proof of his skill and it is quite possible to draw very beautifully without attaining even an approximation to such a power the main point being not that every line should be precisely what we intend or wish but that the line which we intended or wished to draw should be right if we always see rightly and mean rightly we shall get on though the hand may stagger a little but if we mean wrongly or mean nothing it does not matter how firm the hand is do not therefore torment yourself because you cannot do as well as you would like but work patiently sure that every square and letter will give you a certain increase of power and as soon as you can draw your letters pretty well here is a more amusing exercise for you   exercise vi  20 choose any tree that you think pretty which is nearly bare of leaves and which you can see against the sky or against a pale wall or other light ground it must not be against strong light or you will find the looking at it hurt your eyes nor must it be in sunshine or you will be puzzled by the lights on the boughs but the tree must be in shade and the sky blue or gray or dull white a wholly gray or rainy day is the best for this practice  21 you will see that all the boughs of the tree are dark against the sky consider them as so many dark rivers to be laid down in a map with absolute accuracy and without the least thought about the roundness of the stems map them all out in flat shade scrawling them in with pencil just as you did the limbs of your letters then correct and alter them rubbing out and out again never minding how much your paper is dirtied only not destroying its surface until every bough is exactly or as near as your utmost power can bring it right in curvature and in thickness look at the white interstices between them with as much scrupulousness as if they were little estates which you had to survey and draw maps of for some important lawsuit involving heavy penalties if you cut the least bit of a corner off any of them or gave the hedge anywhere too deep a curve and try continually to fancy the whole tree nothing but a flat ramification on a white ground do not take any trouble about the little twigs which look like a confused network or mist leave them all out6 drawing only the main branches as far as you can see them distinctly your object at present being not to draw a tree but to learn how to do so when you have got the thing as nearly right as you canand it is better to make one good study than twenty left unnecessarily inaccuratetake your pen and put a fine outline to all the boughs as you did to your letter taking care as far as possible to put the outline within the edge of the shade so as not to make the boughs thicker the main use of the outline is to affirm the whole more clearly to do away with little accidental roughnesses and excrescences and especially to mark where boughs cross or come in front of each other as at such points their arrangement in this kind of sketch is unintelligible without the outline it may perfectly well happen that in nature it should be less distinct than your outline will make it but it is better in this kind of sketch to mark the facts clearly the temptation is always to be slovenly and careless and the outline is like a bridle and forces our indolence into attention and precision the outline should be about the thickness of that in fig 4 which represents the ramification of a small stone pine only i have not endeavored to represent the pencil shading within the outline as i could not easily express it in a woodcut and you have nothing to do at present with the indication of foliage above of which in another place you may also draw your trees as much larger than this figure as you like only however large they may be keep the outline as delicate and draw the branches far enough into their outer sprays to give quite as slender ramification as you have in this figure otherwise you do not get good enough practice out of them  illustration fig 4  22 you cannot do too many studies of this kind every one will give you some new notion about trees but when you are tired of tree boughs take any forms whatever which are drawn in flat color one upon another as patterns on any kind of cloth or flat china tiles for instance executed in two colors only and practice drawing them of the right shape and size by the eye and filling them in with shade of the depth required  in doing this you will first have to meet the difficulty of representing depth of color by depth of shade thus a pattern of ultramarine blue will have to be represented by a darker tint of gray than a pattern of yellow  23 and now it is both time for you to begin to learn the mechanical use of the brush and necessary for you to do so in order to provide yourself with the gradated scale of color which you will want if you can by any means get acquainted with any ordinary skillful watercolor painter and prevail on him to show you how to lay on tints with a brush by all means do so not that you are yet nor for a long while yet to begin to color but because the brush is often more convenient than the pencil for laying on masses or tints of shade and the sooner you know how to manage it as an instrument the better if however you have no opportunity of seeing how watercolor is laid on by a workman of any kind the following directions will help you   exercise vii  24 get a shilling cake of prussian blue dip the end of it in water so as to take up a drop and rub it in a white saucer till you cannot rub much more and the color gets dark thick and oilylooking put two teaspoonfuls of water to the color you have rubbed down and mix it well up with a camelshair brush about three quarters of an inch long  25 then take a piece of smooth but not glossy bristol board or pasteboard divide it with your pencil and rule into squares as large as those of the very largest chessboard they need not be perfect squares only as nearly so as you can quickly guess rest the pasteboard on something sloping as much as an ordinary desk then dipping your brush into the color you have mixed and taking up as much of the liquid as it will carry begin at the top of one of the squares and lay a pond or runlet of color along the top edge lead this pond of color gradually downwards not faster at one place than another but as if you were adding a row of bricks to a building all along only building down instead of up dipping the brush frequently so as to keep the color as full in that and in as great quantity on the paper as you can so only that it does not run down anywhere in a little stream but if it should never mind go on quietly with your square till you have covered it all in when you get to the bottom the color will lodge there in a great wave have ready a piece of blottingpaper dry your brush on it and with the dry brush take up the superfluous color as you would with a sponge till it all looks even  26 in leading the color down you will find your brush continually go over the edge of the square or leave little gaps within it do not endeavor to retouch these nor take much care about them the great thing is to get the color to lie smoothly where it reaches not in alternate blots and pale patches try therefore to lead it over the square as fast as possible with such attention to your limit as you are able to give the use of the exercise is indeed to enable you finally to strike the color up to the limit with perfect accuracy but the first thing is to get it eventhe power of rightly striking the edge comes only by time and practice even the greatest artists rarely can do this quite perfectly  27 when you have done one square proceed to do another which does not communicate with it when you have thus done all the alternate squares as on a chessboard turn the pasteboard upside down begin again with the first and put another coat over it and so on over all the others the use of turning the paper upside down is to neutralize the increase of darkness towards the bottom of the squares which would otherwise take place from the ponding of the color  28 be resolved to use blottingpaper or a piece of rag instead of your lips to dry the brush the habit of doing so once acquired will save you from much partial poisoning take care however always to draw the brush from root to point otherwise you will spoil it you may even wipe it as you would a pen when you want it very dry without doing harm provided you do not crush it upwards get a good brush at first and cherish it it will serve you longer and better than many bad ones  29 when you have done the squares all over again do them a third time always trying to keep your edges as neat as possible when your color is exhausted mix more in the same proportions two teaspoonfuls to as much as you can grind with a drop and when you have done the alternate squares three times over as the paper will be getting very damp and dry more slowly begin on the white squares and bring them up to the same tint in the same way the amount of jagged dark line which then will mark the limits of the squares will be the exact measure of your unskillfulness  30 as soon as you tire of squares draw circles with compasses and then draw straight lines irregularly across circles and fill up the spaces so produced between the straight line and the circumference and then draw any simple shapes of leaves according to the exercise no ii and fill up those until you can lay on color quite evenly in any shape you want  31 you will find in the course of this practice as you cannot always put exactly the same quantity of water to the color that the darker the color is the more difficult it becomes to lay it on evenly therefore when you have gained some definite degree of power try to fill in the forms required with a full brush and a dark tint at once instead of laying several coats one over another always taking care that the tint however dark be quite liquid and that after being laid on so much of it is absorbed as to prevent its forming a black line at the edge as it dries a little experience will teach you how apt the color is to do this and how to prevent it not that it needs always to be prevented for a great master in watercolors will sometimes draw a firm outline when he wants one simply by letting the color dry in this way at the edge  32 when however you begin to cover complicated forms with the darker color no rapidity will prevent the tint from drying irregularly as it is led on from part to part you will then find the following method useful lay in the color very pale and liquid so pale indeed that you can only just see where it is on the paper lead it up to all the outlines and make it precise in form keeping it thoroughly wet everywhere then when it is all in shape take the darker color and lay some of it into the middle of the liquid color it will spread gradually in a branchy kind of way and you may now lead it up to the outlines already determined and play it with the brush till it fills its place well then let it dry and it will be as flat and pure as a single dash yet defining all the complicated forms accurately  33 having thus obtained the power of laying on a tolerably flat tint you must try to lay on a gradated one prepare the color with three or four teaspoonfuls of water then when it is mixed pour away about twothirds of it keeping a teaspoonful of pale color sloping your paper as before draw two pencil lines all the way down leaving a space between them of the width of a square on your chessboard begin at the top of your paper between the lines and having struck on the first brushful of color and led it down a little dip your brush deep in water and mix up the color on the plate quickly with as much more water as the brush takes up at that one dip then with this paler color lead the tint farther down dip in water again mix the color again and thus lead down the tint always dipping in water once between each replenishing of the brush and stirring the color on the plate well but as quickly as you can go on until the color has become so pale that you cannot see it then wash your brush thoroughly in water and carry the wave down a little farther with that and then absorb it with the dry brush and leave it to dry  34 if you get to the bottom of your paper before your color gets pale you may either take longer paper or begin with the tint as it was when you left off on another sheet but be sure to exhaust it to pure whiteness at last when all is quite dry recommence at the top with another similar mixture of color and go down in the same way then again and then again and so continually until the color at the top of the paper is as dark as your cake of prussian blue and passes down into pure white paper at the end of your column with a perfectly smooth gradation from one into the other  35 you will find at first that the paper gets mottled or wavy instead of evenly gradated this is because at some places you have taken up more water in your brush than at others or not mixed it thoroughly on the plate or led one tint too far before replenishing with the next practice only will enable you to do it well the best artists cannot always get gradations of this kind quite to their minds nor do they ever leave them on their pictures without aftertouching  36 as you get more power and can strike the color more quickly down you will be able to gradate in less compass7 beginning with a small quantity of color and adding a drop of water instead of a brushful with finer brushes also you may gradate to a less scale but slight skill will enable you to test the relations of color to shade as far as is necessary for your immediate progress which is to be done thus  37 take cakes of lake of gamboge of sepia of blueblack of cobalt and vermilion and prepare gradated columns exactly as you have done with the prussian blue of the lake and blueblack8 cut a narrow slip all the way down of each gradated color and set the three slips side by side fasten them down and rule lines at equal distances across all the three so as to divide them into fifty degrees and number the degrees of each from light to dark 1 2 3 etc if you have gradated them rightly the darkest part either of the red or blue will be nearly equal in power to the darkest part of the blueblack and any degree of the black slip will also accurately enough for our purpose balance in weight the degree similarly numbered in the red or the blue slip then when you are drawing from objects of a crimson or blue color if you can match their color by any compartment of the crimson or blue in your scales the gray in the compartment of the gray scale marked with the same number is the gray which must represent that crimson or blue in your light and shade drawing  38 next prepare scales with gamboge cobalt and vermilion you will find that you cannot darken these beyond a certain point9 for yellow and scarlet so long as they remain yellow and scarlet cannot approach to black we cannot have properly speaking a dark yellow or dark scarlet make your scales of full yellow blue and scarlet halfway down passing then gradually to white afterwards use lake to darken the upper half of the vermilion and gamboge and prussian blue to darken the cobalt you will thus have three more scales passing from white nearly to black through yellow and orange through skyblue and through scarlet by mixing the gamboge and prussian blue you may make another with green mixing the cobalt and lake another with violet the sepia alone will make a forcible brown one and so on until you have as many scales as you like passing from black to white through different colors then supposing your scales properly gradated and equally divided the compartment or degree no 1 of the gray will represent in chiaroscuro the no 1 of all the other colors no 2 of gray the no 2 of the other colors and so on  39 it is only necessary however in this matter that you should understand the principle for it would never be possible for you to gradate your scales so truly as to make them practically accurate and serviceable and even if you could unless you had about ten thousand scales and were able to change them faster than ever juggler changed cards you could not in a day measure the tints on so much as one side of a frostbitten apple but when once you fully understand the principle and see how all colors contain as it were a certain quantity of darkness or power of dark relief from whitesome more some less and how this pitch or power of each may be represented by equivalent values of gray you will soon be able to arrive shrewdly at an approximation by a glance of the eye without any measuring scale at all  40 you must now go on again with the pen drawing patterns and any shapes of shade that you think pretty as veinings in marble or tortoiseshell spots in surfaces of shells etc as tenderly as you can in the darknesses that correspond to their colors and when you find you can do this successfully it is time to begin rounding   exercise viii  41 go out into your garden or into the road and pick up the first round or oval stone you can find not very white nor very dark and the smoother it is the better only it must not shine draw your table near the window and put the stone which i will suppose is about the size of a in fig 5 it had better not be much larger on a piece of not very white paper on the table in front of you sit so that the light may come from your left else the shadow of the pencil point interferes with your sight of your work you must not let the sun fall on the stone but only ordinary light therefore choose a window which the sun does not come in at if you can shut the shutters of the other windows in the room it will be all the better but this is not of much consequence  42 now if you can draw that stone you can draw anything i mean anything that is drawable many things sea foam for instance cannot be drawn at all only the idea of them more or less suggested but if you can draw the stone rightly everything within reach of art is also within yours  for all drawing depends primarily on your power of representing roundness if you can once do that all the rest is easy and straightforward if you cannot do that nothing else that you may be able to do will be of any use for nature is all made up of roundnesses not the roundness of perfect globes but of variously curved surfaces boughs are rounded leaves are rounded stones are rounded clouds are rounded cheeks are rounded and curls are rounded there is no more flatness in the natural world than there is vacancy the world itself is round and so is all that is in it more or less except human work which is often very flat indeed  illustration fig 5  therefore set yourself steadily to conquer that round stone and you have won the battle  43 look your stone antagonist boldly in the face you will see that the side of it next the window is lighter than most of the paper that the side of it farthest from the window is darker than the paper and that the light passes into the dark gradually while a shadow is thrown to the right on the paper itself by the stone the general appearance of things being more or less as in a fig 5 the spots on the stone excepted of which more presently  44 now remember always what was stated in the outset that everything you can see in nature is seen only so far as it is lighter or darker than the things about it or of a different color from them it is either seen as a patch of one color on a ground of another or as a pale thing relieved from a dark thing or a dark thing from a pale thing and if you can put on patches of color or shade of exactly the same size shape and gradations as those on the object and its ground you will produce the appearance of the object and its ground the best draughtsmantitian and paul veronese themselvescould do no more than this and you will soon be able to get some power of doing it in an inferior way if you once understand the exceeding simplicity of what is to be done suppose you have a brown book on a white sheet of paper on a red tablecloth you have nothing to do but to put on spaces of red white and brown in the same shape and gradated from dark to light in the same degrees and your drawing is done if you will not look at what you see if you try to put on brighter or duller colors than are there if you try to put them on with a dash or a blot or to cover your paper with vigorous lines or to produce anything in fact but the plain unaffected and finished tranquillity of the thing before you you need not hope to get on nature will show you nothing if you set yourself up for her master but forget yourself and try to obey her and you will find obedience easier and happier than you think  45 the real difficulties are to get the refinement of the forms and the evenness of the gradations you may depend upon it when you are dissatisfied with your work it is always too coarse or too uneven it may not be wrongin all probability is not wrong in any socalled great point but its edges are not true enough in outline and its shades are in blotches or scratches or full of white holes get it more tender and more true and you will find it is more powerful  46 do not therefore think your drawing must be weak because you have a finely pointed pen in your hand till you can draw with that you can draw with nothing when you can draw with that you can draw with a log of wood charred at the end true boldness and power are only to be gained by care even in fencing and dancing all ultimate ease depends on early precision in the commencement much more in singing or drawing  47 now i do not want you to copy my sketch in fig 5 but to copy the stone before you in the way that my sketch is done to which end first measure the extreme length of the stone with compasses and mark that length on your paper then between the points marked leave something like the form of the stone in light scrawling the paper all over round it b in fig 5 is a beginning of this kind rather leave too much room for the high light than too little and then more cautiously fill in the shade shutting the light gradually up and putting in the dark slowly on the dark side you need not plague yourself about accuracy of shape because till you have practiced a great deal it is impossible for you to draw the shape of the stone quite truly and you must gradually gain correctness by means of these various exercises what you have mainly to do at present is to get the stone to look solid and round not much minding what its exact contour isonly draw it as nearly right as you can without vexation and you will get it more right by thus feeling your way to it in shade than if you tried to draw the outline at first for you can see no outline what you see is only a certain space of gradated shade with other such spaces about it and those pieces of shade you are to imitate as nearly as you can by scrawling the paper over till you get them to the right shape with the same gradations which they have in nature and this is really more likely to be done well if you have to fight your way through a little confusion in the sketch than if you have an accurately traced outline for instance having sketched the fossil seaurchin at a in fig 5 whose form though irregular required more care in following than that of a common stone i was going to draw it also under another effect reflected light bringing its dark side out from the background but when i had laid on the first few touches i thought it would be better to stop and let you see how i had begun it at b in which beginning it will be observed that nothing is so determined but that i can more or less modify and add to or diminish the contour as i work on the lines which suggest the outline being blended with the others if i do not want them and the having to fill up the vacancies and conquer the irregularities of such a sketch will probably secure a higher completion at last than if half an hour had been spent in getting a true outline before beginning  48 in doing this however take care not to get the drawing too dark in order to ascertain what the shades of it really are cut a round hole about half the size of a pea in a piece of white paper the color of that you use to draw on hold this bit of paper with the hole in it between you and your stone and pass the paper backwards and forwards so as to see the different portions of the stone or other subject through the hole you will find that thus the circular hole looks like one of the patches of color you have been accustomed to match only changing in depth as it lets different pieces of the stone be seen through it you will be able thus actually to match the color of the stone at any part of it by tinting the paper beside the circular opening and you will find that this opening never looks quite black but that all the roundings of the stone are given by subdued grays10  49 you will probably find also that some parts of the stone or of the paper it lies on look luminous through the opening so that the little circle then tells as a light spot instead of a dark spot when this is so you cannot imitate it for you have no means of getting light brighter than white paper but by holding the paper more sloped towards the light you will find that many parts of the stone which before looked light through the hole then look dark through it and if you can place the paper in such a position that every part of the stone looks slightly dark the little hole will tell always as a spot of shade and if your drawing is put in the same light you can imitate or match every gradation you will be amazed to find under these circumstances how slight the differences of tint are by which through infinite delicacy of gradation nature can express form  if any part of your subject will obstinately show itself as a light through the hole that part you need not hope to imitate leave it white you can do no more  50 when you have done the best you can to get the general form proceed to finish by imitating the texture and all the cracks and stains of the stone as closely as you can and note in doing this that cracks or fissures of any kind whether between stones in walls or in the grain of timber or rocks or in any of the thousand other conditions they present are never expressible by single black lines or lines of simple shadow a crack must always have its complete system of light and shade however small its scale it is in reality a little ravine with a dark or shady side and light or sunny side and usually shadow in the bottom this is one of the instances in which it may be as well to understand the reason of the appearance it is not often so in drawing for the aspects of things are so subtle and confused that they cannot in general be explained and in the endeavor to explain some we are sure to lose sight of others while the natural overestimate of the importance of those on which the attention is fixed causes us to exaggerate them so that merely scientific draughtsmen caricature a third part of nature and miss twothirds the best scholar is he whose eye is so keen as to see at once how the thing looks and who need not therefore trouble himself with any reasons why it looks so but few people have this acuteness of perception and to those who are destitute of it a little pointing out of rule and reason will be a help especially when a master is not near them i never allow my own pupils to ask the reason of anything because as i watch their work i can always show them how the thing is and what appearance they are missing in it but when a master is not by to direct the sight science may here and there be allowed to do so in his stead  51 generally then every solid illumined objectfor instance the stone you are drawinghas a light side turned towards the light a dark side turned away from the light and a shadow which is cast on something else as by the stone on the paper it is set upon you may sometimes be placed so as to see only the light side and shadow sometimes only the dark side and shadow and sometimes both or either without the shadow but in most positions solid objects will show all the three as the stone does here  52 hold up your hand with the edge of it towards you as you sit now with your side to the window so that the flat of your hand is turned to the window you will see one side of your hand distinctly lighted the other distinctly in shade here are light side and dark side with no seen shadow the shadow being detached perhaps on the table perhaps on the other side of the room you need not look for it at present  53 take a sheet of notepaper and holding it edgewise as you hold your hand wave it up and down past the side of your hand which is turned from the light the paper being of course farther from the window you will see as it passes a strong gleam of light strike on your hand and light it considerably on its dark side this light is reflected light it is thrown back from the paper on which it strikes first in coming from the window to the surface of your hand just as a ball would be if somebody threw it through the window at the wall and you caught it at the rebound  next instead of the notepaper take a red book or a piece of scarlet cloth you will see that the gleam of light falling on your hand as you wave the book is now reddened take a blue book and you will find the gleam is blue thus every object will cast some of its own color back in the light that it reflects  54 now it is not only these books or papers that reflect light to your hand every object in the room on that side of it reflects some but more feebly and the colors mixing all together form a neutral11 light which lets the color of your hand itself be more distinctly seen than that of any object which reflects light to it but if there were no reflected light that side of your hand would look as black as a coal  55 objects are seen therefore in general partly by direct light and partly by light reflected from the objects around them or from the atmosphere and clouds the color of their light sides depends much on that of the direct light and that of the dark sides on the colors of the objects near them it is therefore impossible to say beforehand what color an object will have at any point of its surface that color depending partly on its own tint and partly on infinite combinations of rays reflected from other things the only certain fact about dark sides is that their color will be changeful and that a picture which gives them merely darker shades of the color of the light sides must assuredly be bad  56 now lay your hand flat on the white paper you are drawing on you will see one side of each finger lighted one side dark and the shadow of your hand on the paper here therefore are the three divisions of shade seen at once and although the paper is white and your hand of a rosy color somewhat darker than white yet you will see that the shadow all along just under the finger which casts it is darker than the flesh and is of a very deep gray the reason of this is that much light is reflected from the paper to the dark side of your finger but very little is reflected from other things to the paper itself in that chink under your finger  57 in general for this reason a shadow or at any rate the part of the shadow nearest the object is darker than the dark side of the object i say in general because a thousand accidents may interfere to prevent its being so take a little bit of glass as a wineglass or the inkbottle and play it about a little on the side of your hand farthest from the window you will presently find you are throwing gleams of light all over the dark side of your hand and in some positions of the glass the reflection from it will annihilate the shadow altogether and you will see your hand dark on the white paper now a stupid painter would represent for instance a drinkingglass beside the hand of one of his figures and because he had been taught by rule that shadow was darker than the dark side he would never think of the reflection from the glass but paint a dark gray under the hand just as if no glass were there but a great painter would be sure to think of the true effect and paint it and then comes the stupid critic and wonders why the hand is so light on its dark side  58 thus it is always dangerous to assert anything as a rule in matters of art yet it is useful for you to remember that in a general way a shadow is darker than the dark side of the thing that casts it supposing the colors otherwise the same that is to say when a white object casts a shadow on a white surface or a dark object on a dark surface the rule will not hold if the colors are different the shadow of a black object on a white surface being of course not so dark usually as the black thing casting it the only way to ascertain the ultimate truth in such matters is to look for it but in the meantime you will be helped by noticing that the cracks in the stone are little ravines on one side of which the light strikes sharply while the other is in shade this dark side usually casts a little darker shadow at the bottom of the crack and the general tone of the stone surface is not so bright as the light bank of the ravine and therefore if you get the surface of the object of a uniform tint more or less indicative of shade and then scratch out a white spot or streak in it of any shape by putting a dark touch beside this white one you may turn it as you choose into either a ridge or an incision into either a boss or a cavity if you put the dark touch on the side of it nearest the sun or rather nearest the place that the light comes from you will make it a cut or cavity if you put it on the opposite side you will make it a ridge or mound and the complete success of the effect depends less on depth of shade than on the rightness of the drawing that is to say on the evident correspondence of the form of the shadow with the form that casts it in drawing rocks or wood or anything irregularly shaped you will gain far more by a little patience in following the forms carefully though with slight touches than by labored finishing of texture of surface and transparencies of shadow  59 when you have got the whole well into shape proceed to lay on the stains and spots with great care quite as much as you gave to the forms very often spots or bars of local color do more to express form than even the light and shade and they are always interesting as the means by which nature carries light into her shadows and shade into her lights an art of which we shall have more to say hereafter in speaking of composition a in fig 5 is a rough sketch of a fossil seaurchin in which the projections of the shell are of black flint coming through a chalky surface these projections form dark spots in the light and their sides rising out of the shadow form smaller whiter spots in the dark you may take such scattered lights as these out with the penknife provided you are just as careful to place them rightly as if you got them by a more laborious process  60 when you have once got the feeling of the way in which gradation expresses roundness and projection you may try your strength on anything natural or artificial that happens to take your fancy provided it be not too complicated in form i have asked you to draw a stone first because any irregularities and failures in your shading will be less offensive to you as being partly characteristic of the rough stone surface than they would be in a more delicate subject and you may as well go on drawing rounded stones of different shapes for a little while till you find you can really shade delicately you may then take up folds of thick white drapery a napkin or towel thrown carelessly on the table is as good as anything and try to express them in the same way only now you will find that your shades must be wrought with perfect unity and tenderness or you will lose the flow of the folds always remember that a little bit perfected is worth more than many scrawls whenever you feel yourself inclined to scrawl give up work resolutely and do not go back to it till next day of course your towel or napkin must be put on something that may be locked up so that its folds shall not be disturbed till you have finished if you find that the folds will not look right get a photograph of a piece of drapery there are plenty now to be bought taken from the sculpture of the cathedrals of rheims amiens and chartres which will at once educate your hand and your taste and copy some piece of that you will then ascertain what it is that is wanting in your studies from nature whether more gradation or greater watchfulness of the disposition of the folds probably for some time you will find yourself failing painfully in both for drapery is very difficult to follow in its sweeps but do not lose courage for the greater the difficulty the greater the gain in the effort if your eye is more just in measurement of form than delicate in perception of tint a pattern on the folded surface will help you try whether it does or not and if the patterned drapery confuses you keep for a time to the simple white one but if it helps you continue to choose patterned stuffs tartans and simple checkered designs are better at first than flowered ones and even though it should confuse you begin pretty soon to use a pattern occasionally copying all the distortions and perspective modifications of it among the folds with scrupulous care  61 neither must you suppose yourself condescending in doing this the greatest masters are always fond of drawing patterns and the greater they are the more pains they take to do it truly12 nor can there be better practice at any time as introductory to the nobler complication of natural detail for when you can draw the spots which follow the folds of a printed stuff you will have some chance of following the spots which fall into the folds of the skin of a leopard as he leaps but if you cannot draw the manufacture assuredly you will never be able to draw the creature so the cloudings on a piece of wood carefully drawn will be the best introduction to the drawing of the clouds of the sky or the waves of the sea and the dead leafpatterns on a damask drapery well rendered will enable you to disentangle masterfully the living leafpatterns of a thorn thicket or a violet bank  62 observe however in drawing any stuffs or bindings of books or other finely textured substances do not trouble yourself as yet much about the wooliness or gauziness of the thing but get it right in shade and fold and true in pattern we shall see in the course of afterpractice how the penned lines may be made indicative of texture but at present attend only to the light and shade and pattern you will be puzzled at first by lustrous surfaces but a little attention will show you that the expression of these depends merely on the right drawing of their light and shade and reflections put a small black japanned tray on the table in front of some books and you will see it reflects the objects beyond it as in a little black rippled pond its own color mingling always with that of the reflected objects draw these reflections of the books properly making them dark and distorted as you will see that they are and you will find that this gives the luster to your tray it is not well however to draw polished objects in general practice only you should do one or two in order to understand the aspect of any lustrous portion of other things such as you cannot avoid the gold for instance on the edges of books or the shining of silk and damask in which lies a great part of the expression of their folds observe also that there are very few things which are totally without luster you will frequently find a light which puzzles you on some apparently dull surface to be the dim image of another object  63 and now as soon as you can conscientiously assure me that with the point of the pen or pencil you can lay on any form and shade you like i give you leave to use the brush with one colorsepia or blue black or mixed cobalt and blue black or neutral tint and this will much facilitate your study and refresh you but preliminary you must do one or two more exercises in tinting   exercise ix  64 prepare your color as directed for exercise vii take a brush full of it and strike it on the paper in any irregular shape as the brush gets dry sweep the surface of the paper with it as if you were dusting the paper very lightly every such sweep of the brush will leave a number of more or less minute interstices in the color the lighter and faster every dash the better then leave the whole to dry and as soon as it is dry with little color in your brush so that you can bring it to a fine point fill up all the little interstices one by one so as to make the whole as even as you can and fill in the larger gaps with more color always trying to let the edges of the first and of the newly applied color exactly meet and not lap over each other when your new color dries you will find it in places a little paler than the first retouch it therefore trying to get the whole to look quite one piece a very small bit of color thus filled up with your very best care and brought to look as if it had been quite even from the first will give you better practice and more skill than a great deal filled in carelessly so do it with your best patience not leaving the most minute spot of white and do not fill in the large pieces first and then go to the small but quietly and steadily cover in the whole up to a marked limit then advance a little farther and so on thus always seeing distinctly what is done and what undone   exercise x  65 lay a coat of the blue prepared as usual over a whole square of paper let it dry then another coat over four fifths of the square or thereabouts leaving the edge rather irregular than straight and let it dry then another coat over three fifths another over two fifths and the last over one fifth so that the square may present the appearance of gradual increase in darkness in five bands each darker than the one beyond it then with the brush rather dry as in the former exercise when filling up the interstices try with small touches like those used in the pen etching only a little broader to add shade delicately beyond each edge so as to lead the darker tints into the paler ones imperceptibly by touching the paper very lightly and putting a multitude of little touches crossing and recrossing in every direction you will gradually be able to work up to the darker tints outside of each so as quite to efface their edges and unite them tenderly with the next tint the whole square when done should look evenly shaded from dark to pale with no bars only a crossing texture of touches something like chopped straw over the whole13  66 next take your rounded pebble arrange it in any light and shade you like outline it very loosely with the pencil put on a wash of color prepared very pale quite flat over all of it except the highest light leaving the edge of your color quite sharp then another wash extending only over the darker parts leaving the edge of that sharp also as in tinting the square then another wash over the still darker parts and another over the darkest leaving each edge to dry sharp then with the small touches efface the edges reinforce the darks and work the whole delicately together as you would with the pen till you have got it to the likeness of the true light and shade you will find that the tint underneath is a great help and that you can now get effects much more subtle and complete than with the pen merely  67 the use of leaving the edges always sharp is that you may not trouble or vex the color but let it lie as it falls suddenly on the paper color looks much more lovely when it has been laid on with a dash of the brush and left to dry in its own way than when it has been dragged about and disturbed so that it is always better to let the edges and forms be a little wrong even if one cannot correct them afterwards than to lose this fresh quality of the tint very great masters in water color can lay on the true forms at once with a dash and bad masters in water color lay on grossly false forms with a dash and leave them false for people in general not knowing false from true are as much pleased with the appearance of power in the irregular blot as with the presence of power in the determined one but we in our beginnings must do as much as we can with the broad dash and then correct with the point till we are quite right we must take care to be right at whatever cost of pains and then gradually we shall find we can be right with freedom  68 i have hitherto limited you to color mixed with two or three teaspoonfuls of water but in finishing your light and shade from the stone you may as you efface the edge of the palest coat towards the light use the color for the small touches with more and more water till it is so pale as not to be perceptible thus you may obtain a perfect gradation to the light and in reinforcing the darks when they are very dark you may use less and less water if you take the color tolerably dark on your brush only always liquid not pasty and dash away the superfluous color on blotting paper you will find that touching the paper very lightly with the dry brush you can by repeated touches produce a dusty kind of bloom very valuable in giving depth to shadow but it requires great patience and delicacy of hand to do this properly you will find much of this kind of work in the grounds and shadows of william hunts drawings14  69 as you get used to the brush and color you will gradually find out their ways for yourself and get the management of them and you will often save yourself much discouragement by remembering what i have so often assertedthat if anything goes wrong it is nearly sure to be refinement that is wanting not force and connection not alteration if you dislike the state your drawing is in do not lose patience with it nor dash at it nor alter its plan nor rub it desperately out at the place you think wrong but look if there are no shadows you can gradate more perfectly no little gaps and rents you can fill no forms you can more delicately define and do not rush at any of the errors or incompletions thus discerned but efface or supply slowly and you will soon find your drawing take another look a very useful expedient in producing some effects is to wet the paper and then lay the color on it more or less wet according to the effect you want you will soon see how prettily it gradates itself as it dries when dry you can reinforce it with delicate stippling when you want it darker also while the color is still damp on the paper by drying your brush thoroughly and touching the color with the brush so dried you may take out soft lights with great tenderness and precision try all sorts of experiments of this kind noticing how the color behaves but remembering always that your final results must be obtained and can only be obtained by pure work with the point as much as in the pen drawing  70 you will find also as you deal with more and more complicated subjects that natures resources in light and shade are so much richer than yours that you cannot possibly get all or anything like all the gradations of shadow in any given group when this is the case determine first to keep the broad masses of things distinct if for instance there is a green book and a white piece of paper and a black inkstand in the group be sure to keep the white paper as a light mass the green book as a middle tint mass the black inkstand as a dark mass and do not shade the folds in the paper or corners of the book so as to equal in depth the darkness of the inkstand the great difference between the masters of light and shade and imperfect artists is the power of the former to draw so delicately as to express form in a darkcolored object with little light and in a lightcolored object with little darkness and it is better even to leave the forms here and there unsatisfactorily rendered than to lose the general relations of the great masses and this observe not because masses are grand or desirable things in your composition for with composition at present you have nothing whatever to do but because it is a fact that things do so present themselves to the eyes of men and that we see paper book and inkstand as three separate things before we see the wrinkles or chinks or corners of any of the three understand therefore at once that no detail can be as strongly expressed in drawing as it is in reality and strive to keep all your shadows and marks and minor markings on the masses lighter than they appear to be in nature you are sure otherwise to get them too dark you will in doing this find that you cannot get the projection of things sufficiently shown but never mind that there is no need that they should appear to project but great need that their relations of shade to each other should be preserved all deceptive projection is obtained by partial exaggeration of shadow and whenever you see it you may be sure the drawing is more or less bad a thoroughly fine drawing or painting will always show a slight tendency towards flatness  71 observe on the other hand that however white an object may be there is always some small point of it whiter than the rest you must therefore have a slight tone of gray over everything in your picture except on the extreme high lights even the piece of white paper in your subject must be toned slightly down unless and there are thousand chances against its being so it should all be turned so as fully to front the light by examining the treatment of the white objects in any pictures accessible to you by paul veronese or titian you will soon understand this15  72 as soon as you feel yourself capable of expressing with the brush the undulations of surfaces and the relations of masses you may proceed to draw more complicated and beautiful things16 and first the boughs of trees now not in mere dark relief but in full rounding take the first bit of branch or stump that comes to hand with a fork in it cut off the ends of the forking branches so as to leave the whole only about a foot in length get a piece of paper the same size fix your bit of branch in some place where its position will not be altered and draw it thoroughly in all its light and shade full size striving above all things to get an accurate expression of its structure at the fork of the branch when once you have mastered the tree at its armpits you will have little more trouble with it  73 always draw whatever the background happens to be exactly as you see it wherever you have fastened the bough you must draw whatever is behind it ugly or not else you will never know whether the light and shade are right they may appear quite wrong to you only for want of the background and this general law is to be observed in all your studies whatever you draw draw completely and unalteringly else you never know if what you have done is right or whether you could have done it rightly had you tried there is nothing visible out of which you may not get useful practice  74 next to put the leaves on your boughs gather a small twig with four or five leaves on it put it into water put a sheet of lightcolored or white paper behind it so that all the leaves may be relieved in dark from the white field then sketch in their dark shape carefully with pencil as you did the complicated boughs in order to be sure that all their masses and interstices are right in shape before you begin shading and complete as far as you can with pen and ink in the manner of fig 6 which is a young shoot of lilac  75 you will probably in spite of all your pattern drawings be at first puzzled by leaf foreshortening especially because the look of retirement or projection depends not so much on the perspective of the leaves themselves as on the double sight of the two eyes now there are certain artifices by which good painters can partly conquer this difficulty as slight exaggerations of force or color in the nearer parts and of obscurity in the more distant ones but you must not attempt anything of this kind when you are first sketching the leaves shut one of your eyes fix a point in the background to bring the point of one of the leaves against and so sketch the whole bough as you see it in a fixed position looking with one eye only your drawing never can be made to look like the object itself as you see that object with both eyes17 but it can be made perfectly like the object seen with one and you must be content when you have got a resemblance on these terms  76 in order to get clearly at the notion of the thing to be done take a single long leaf hold it with its point towards you and as flat as you can so as to see nothing of it but its thinness as if you wanted to know how thin it was outline it so then slope it down gradually towards you and watch it as it lengthens out to its full length held perpendicularly down before you draw it in three or four different positions between these extremes with its ribs as they appear in each position and you will soon find out how it must be  illustration fig 6  77 draw first only two or three of the leaves then larger clusters and practice in this way more and more complicated pieces of bough and leafage till you find you can master the most difficult arrangements not consisting of more than ten or twelve leaves you will find as you do this if you have an opportunity of visiting any gallery of pictures that you take a much more lively interest than before in the work of the great masters you will see that very often their best backgrounds are composed of little more than a few sprays of leafage carefully studied brought against the distant sky and that another wreath or two form the chief interest of their foregrounds if you live in london you may test your progress accurately by the degree of admiration you feel for the leaves of vine round the head of the bacchus in titians bacchus and ariadne all this however will not enable you to draw a mass of foliage you will find on looking at any rich piece of vegetation that it is only one or two of the nearer clusters that you can by any possibility draw in this complete manner the mass is too vast and too intricate to be thus dealt with  illustration fig 7  78 you must now therefore have recourse to some confused mode of execution capable of expressing the confusion of nature and first you must understand what the character of that confusion is if you look carefully at the outer sprays of any tree at twenty or thirty yards distance you will see them defined against the sky in masses which at first look quite definite but if you examine them you will see mingled with the real shapes of leaves many indistinct lines which are some of them stalks of leaves and some leaves seen with the edge turned towards you and coming into sight in a broken way for supposing the real leaf shape to be as at a fig 7 this when removed some yards from the eye will appear dark against the sky as at b then when removed some yards farther still the stalk and point disappear altogether the middle of the leaf becomes little more than a line and the result is the condition at c only with this farther subtlety in the look of it inexpressible in the woodcut that the stalk and point of the leaf though they have disappeared to the eye have yet some influence in checking the light at the places where they exist and cause a slight dimness about the part of the leaf which remains visible so that its perfect effect could only be rendered by two layers of color one subduing the sky tone a little the next drawing the broken portions of the leaf as at c and carefully indicating the greater darkness of the spot in the middle where the under side of the leaf is  illustration fig 8  this is the perfect theory of the matter in practice we cannot reach such accuracy but we shall be able to render the general look of the foliage satisfactorily by the following mode of practice  79 gather a spray of any tree about a foot or eighteen inches long fix it firmly by the stem in anything that will support it steadily put it about eight feet away from you or ten if you are farsighted put a sheet of not very white paper behind it as usual then draw very carefully first placing them with pencil and then filling them up with ink every leafmass and stalk of it in simple black profile as you see them against the paper fig 8 is a bough of phillyrea so drawn do not be afraid of running the leaves into a black mass when they come together this exercise is only to teach you what the actual shapes of such masses are when seen against the sky  80 make two careful studies of this kind of one bough of every common treeoak ash elm birch beech etc in fact if you are good and industrious you will make one such study carefully at least three times a week until you have examples of every sort of tree and shrub you can get branches of you are to make two studies of each bough for this reasonall masses of foliage have an upper and under surface and the side view of them or profile shows a wholly different organization of branches from that seen in the view from above they are generally seen more or less in profile as you look at the whole tree and nature puts her best composition into the profile arrangement but the view from above or below occurs not unfrequently also and it is quite necessary you should draw it if you wish to understand the anatomy of the tree the difference between the two views is often far greater than you could easily conceive for instance in fig 9 a is the upper view and b the profile of a single spray of phillyrea fig 8 is an intermediate view of a larger bough seen from beneath but at some lateral distance also  81 when you have done a few branches in this manner take one of the drawings you have made and put it first a yard away from you then a yard and a half then two yards observe how the thinner stalks and leaves gradually disappear leaving only a vague and slight darkness where they were and make another study of the effect at each distance taking care to draw nothing more than you really see for in this consists all the difference between what would be merely a miniature drawing of the leaves seen near and a fullsize drawing of the same leaves at a distance by full size i mean the size which they would really appear of if their outline were traced through a pane of glass held at the same distance from the eye at which you mean to hold your drawing you can always ascertain this full size of any object by holding your paper upright before you at the distance from your eye at which you wish your drawing to be seen bring its edge across the object you have to draw and mark upon this edge the points where the outline of the object crosses or goes behind the edge of the paper you will always find it thus measured smaller than you supposed  illustration fig 9  82 when you have made a few careful experiments of this kind on your own drawings which are better for practice at first than the real trees because the black profile in the drawing is quite stable and does not shake and is not confused by sparkles of luster on the leaves you may try the extremities of the real trees only not doing much at a time for the brightness of the sky will dazzle and perplex your sight and this brightness causes i believe some loss of the outline itself at least the chemical action of the light in a photograph extends much within the edges of the leaves and as it were eats them away so that no tree extremity stand it ever so still nor any other form coming against bright sky is truly drawn by a photograph and if you once succeed in drawing a few sprays rightly you will find the result much more lovely and interesting than any photograph can be  83 all this difficulty however attaches to the rendering merely the dark form of the sprays as they come against the sky within those sprays and in the heart of the tree there is a complexity of a much more embarrassing kind for nearly all leaves have some luster and all are more or less translucent letting light through them therefore in any given leaf besides the intricacies of its own proper shadows and foreshortenings there are three series of circumstances which alter or hide its forms first shadows cast on it by other leavesoften very forcibly secondly light reflected from its lustrous surface sometimes the blue of the sky sometimes the white of clouds or the sun itself flashing like a star thirdly forms and shadows of other leaves seen as darknesses through the translucent parts of the leaf a most important element of foliage effect but wholly neglected by landscape artists in general  84 the consequence of all this is that except now and then by chance the form of a complete leaf is never seen but a marvelous and quaint confusion very definite indeed in its evidence of direction of growth and unity of action but wholly indefinable and inextricable part by part by any amount of patience you cannot possibly work it out in facsimile though you took a twelvemonths time to a tree and you must therefore try to discover some mode of execution which will more or less imitate by its own variety and mystery the variety and mystery of nature without absolute delineation of detail  85 now i have led you to this conclusion by observation of tree form only because in that the thing to be proved is clearest but no natural object exists which does not involve in some part or parts of it this inimitableness this mystery of quantity which needs peculiarity of handling and trick of touch to express it completely if leaves are intricate so is moss so is foam so is rock cleavage so are fur and hair and texture of drapery and of clouds and although methods and dexterities of handling are wholly useless if you have not gained first the thorough knowledge of the form of the thing so that if you cannot draw a branch perfectly then much less a tree and if not a wreath of mist perfectly much less a flock of clouds and if not a single grass blade perfectly much less a grass bank yet having once got this power over decisive form you may safelyand must in order to perfection of workcarry out your knowledge by every aid of method and dexterity of hand  86 but in order to find out what method can do you must now look at art as well as at nature and see what means painters and engravers have actually employed for the expression of these subtleties whereupon arises the question what opportunity you have to obtain engravings you ought if it is at all in your power to possess yourself of a certain number of good examples of turners engraved works if this be not in your power you must just make the best use you can of the shop windows or of any plates of which you can obtain a loan very possibly the difficulty of getting sight of them may stimulate you to put them to better use but supposing your means admit of your doing so possess yourself first of the illustrated edition either of rogerss italy or rogerss poems and then of about a dozen of the plates named in the annexed lists the prefixed letters indicate the particular points deserving your study in each engraving18 be sure therefore that your selection includes at all events one plate marked with each letter do not get more than twelve of these plates nor even all the twelve at first for the more engravings you have the less attention you will pay to them it is a general truth that the enjoyment derivable from art cannot be increased in quantity beyond a certain point by quantity of possession it is only spread as it were over a larger surface and very often dulled by finding ideas repeated in different works now for a beginner it is always better that his attention should be concentrated on one or two good things and all his enjoyment founded on them than that he should look at many with divided thoughts he has much to discover and his best way of discovering it is to think long over few things and watch them earnestly it is one of the worst errors of this age to try to know and to see too much the men who seem to know everything never in reality know anything rightly beware of handbook knowledge  87 these engravings are in general more for you to look at than to copy and they will be of more use to you when we come to talk of composition than they are at present still it will do you a great deal of good sometimes to try how far you can get their delicate texture or gradations of tone as your penandink drawing will be apt to incline too much to a scratchy and broken kind of shade for instance the texture of the white convent wall and the drawing of its tiled roof in the vignette at p 227 of rogerss poems is as exquisite as work can possibly be and it will be a great and profitable achievement if you can at all approach it in like manner if you can at all imitate the dark distant country at p 7 or the sky at p 80 of the same volume or the foliage at pp 12 and 144 it will be good gain and if you can once draw the rolling clouds and running river at p 9 of the italy or the city in the vignette of aosta at p 25 or the moonlight at p 223 you will find that even nature herself cannot afterwards very terribly puzzle you with her torrents or towers or moonlight  88 you need not copy touch for touch but try to get the same effect and if you feel discouraged by the delicacy required and begin to think that engraving is not drawing and that copying it cannot help you to draw remember that it differs from common drawing only by the difficulties it has to encounter you perhaps have got into a careless habit of thinking that engraving is a mere business easy enough when one has got into the knack of it on the contrary it is a form of drawing more difficult than common drawing by exactly so much as it is more difficult to cut steel than to move the pencil over paper it is true that there are certain mechanical aids and methods which reduce it at certain stages either to pure machine work or to more or less a habit of hand and arm but this is not so in the foliage you are trying to copy of which the best and prettiest parts are always etchedthat is drawn with a fine steel point and free hand only the line made is white instead of black which renders it much more difficult to judge of what you are about and the trying to copy these plates will be good for you because it will awaken you to the real labor and skill of the engraver and make you understand a little how people must work in this world who have really to do anything in it  89 do not however suppose that i give you the engraving as a modelfar from it but it is necessary you should be able to do as well19 before you think of doing better and you will find many little helps and hints in the various work of it only remember that all engravers foregrounds are bad whenever you see the peculiar wriggling parallel lines of modern engravings become distinct you must not copy nor admire it is only the softer masses and distances and portions of the foliage in the plates marked f which you may copy the best for this purpose if you can get it is the chain bridge over the tees of the england series the thicket on the right is very beautiful and instructive and very like turner the foliage in the ludlow and powis is also remarkably good  90 besides these line engravings and to protect you from what harm there is in their influence you are to provide yourself if possible with a rembrandt etching or a photograph of one of figures not landscape it does not matter of what subject or whether a sketchy or finished one but the sketchy ones are generally cheapest and will teach you most copy it as well as you can noticing especially that rembrandts most rapid lines have steady purpose and that they are laid with almost inconceivable precision when the object becomes at all interesting the prodigal son death of the virgin abraham and isaac and such others containing incident and character rather than chiaroscuro will be the most instructive you can buy one copy it well then exchange it at little loss for another and so gradually obtain a good knowledge of his system whenever you have an opportunity of examining his work at museums etc do so with the greatest care not looking at many things but a long time at each you must also provide yourself if possible with an engraving of albert d√ºrers this you will not be able to copy but you must keep it beside you and refer to it as a standard of precision in line if you can get one with a wing in it it will be best the crest with the cock that with the skull and satyr and the melancholy are the best you could have but any will do perfection in chiaroscuro drawing lies between these two masters rembrandt and d√ºrer rembrandt is often too loose and vague and d√ºrer has little or no effect of mist or uncertainty if you can see anywhere a drawing by leonardo you will find it balanced between the two characters but there are no engravings which present this perfection and your style will be best formed therefore by alternate study of rembrandt and d√ºrer lean rather to d√ºrer it is better for amateurs to err on the side of precision than on that of vagueness and though as i have just said you cannot copy a d√ºrer yet try every now and then a quarter of an inch square or so and see how much nearer you can come you cannot possibly try to draw the leafy crown of the melancholia too often  91 if you cannot get either a rembrandt or a d√ºrer you may still learn much by carefully studying any of george cruikshanks etchings or leechs woodcuts in punch on the free side with alfred rethels and richters20 on the severe side but in so doing you will need to notice the following points  92 when either the material as the copper or wood or the time of an artist does not permit him to make a perfect drawingthat is to say one in which no lines shall be prominently visibleand he is reduced to show the black lines either drawn by the pen or on the wood it is better to make these lines help as far as may be the expression of texture and form you will thus find many textures as of cloth or grass or flesh and many subtle effects of light expressed by leech with zigzag or crossed or curiously broken lines and you will see that alfred rethel and richter constantly express the direction and rounding of surfaces by the direction of the lines which shade them all these various means of expression will be useful to you as far as you can learn them provided you remember that they are merely a kind of shorthand telling certain facts not in quite the right way but in the only possible way under the conditions and provided in any after use of such means you never try to show your own dexterity but only to get as much record of the object as you can in a given time and that you continually make efforts to go beyond such shorthand and draw portions of the objects rightly  93 and touching this question of direction of lines as indicating that of surface observe these few points  illustration fig 10  if lines are to be distinctly shown it is better that so far as they can indicate anything by their direction they should explain rather than oppose the general character of the object thus in the piece of woodcut from titian fig 10 the lines are serviceable by expressing not only the shade of the trunk but partly also its roundness and the flow of its grain and albert d√ºrer whose work was chiefly engraving sets himself always thus to make his lines as valuable as possible telling much by them both of shade and direction of surface and if you were always to be limited to engraving on copper and did not want to express effects of mist or darkness as well as delicate forms albert d√ºrers way of work would be the best example for you but inasmuch as the perfect way of drawing is by shade without lines and the great painters always conceive their subject as complete even when they are sketching it most rapidly you will find that when they are not limited in means they do not much trust to direction of line but will often scratch in the shade of a rounded surface with nearly straight lines that is to say with the easiest and quickest lines possible to themselves when the hand is free the easiest line for it to draw is one inclining from the left upwards to the right or vice vers√¢ from the right downwards to the left and when done very quickly the line is hooked a little at the end by the effort at return to the next hence you will always find the pencil chalk or pen sketch of a very great master full of these kind of lines and even if he draws carefully you will find him using simple straight lines from left to right when an inferior master would have used curved ones fig 11 is a fair facsimile of part of a sketch of raphaels which exhibits these characters very distinctly even the careful drawings of leonardo da vinci are shaded most commonly with straight lines and you may always assume it as a point increasing the probability of a drawing being by a great master if you find rounded surfaces such as those of cheeks or lips shaded with straight lines  illustration fig 11  94 but you will also now understand how easy it must be for dishonest dealers to forge or imitate scrawled sketches like fig 11 and pass them for the work of great masters and how the power of determining the genuineness of a drawing depends entirely on your knowing the facts of the objects drawn and perceiving whether the hasty handling is all conducive to the expression of those truths in a great mans work at its fastest no line is thrown away and it is not by the rapidity but the economy of the execution that you know him to be great now to judge of this economy you must know exactly what he meant to do otherwise you cannot of course discern how far he has done it that is you must know the beauty and nature of the thing he was drawing all judgment of art thus finally founds itself on knowledge of nature  95 but farther observe that this scrawled or economic or impetuous execution is never affectedly impetuous if a great man is not in a hurry he never pretends to be if he has no eagerness in his heart he puts none into his hand if he thinks his effect would be better got with two lines he never to show his dexterity tries to do it with one be assured therefore and this is a matter of great importance that you will never produce a great drawing by imitating the execution of a great master acquire his knowledge and share his feelings and the easy execution will fall from your hand as it did from his but if you merely scrawl because he scrawled or blot because he blotted you will not only never advance in power but every able draughtsman and every judge whose opinion is worth having will know you for a cheat and despise you accordingly  96 again observe respecting the use of outline  all merely outlined drawings are bad for the simple reason that an artist of any power can always do more and tell more by quitting his outlines occasionally and scratching in a few lines for shade than he can by restricting himself to outline only hence the fact of his so restricting himself whatever may be the occasion shows him to be a bad draughtsman and not to know how to apply his power economically this hard law however bears only on drawings meant to remain in the state in which you see them not on those which were meant to be proceeded with or for some mechanical use it is sometimes necessary to draw pure outlines as an incipient arrangement of a composition to be filled up afterwards with color or to be pricked through and used as patterns or tracings but if with no such ultimate object making the drawing wholly for its own sake and meaning it to remain in the state he leaves it an artist restricts himself to outline he is a bad draughtsman and his work is bad there is no exception to this law a good artist habitually sees masses not edges and can in every case make his drawing more expressive with any given quantity of work by rapid shade than by contours so that all good work whatever is more or less touched with shade and more or less interrupted as outline  illustration fig 12  97 hence the published works of retzsch and all the english imitations of them and all outline engravings from pictures are bad work and only serve to corrupt the public taste and of such outlines the worst are those which are darkened in some part of their course by way of expressing the dark side as flaxmans from dante and such others because an outline can only be true so long as it accurately represents the form of the given object with one of its edges thus the outline a and the outline b fig 12 are both true outlines of a ball because however thick the line may be whether we take the interior or exterior edge of it that edge of it always draws a true circle but c is a false outline of a ball because either the inner or outer edge of the black line must be an untrue circle else the line could not be thicker in one place than another hence all force as it is called is gained by falsification of the contours so that no artist whose eye is true and fine could endure to look at it it does indeed often happen that a painter sketching rapidly and trying again and again for some line which he cannot quite strike blackens or loads the first line by setting others beside and across it and then a careless observer supposes it has been thickened on purpose or sometimes also at a place where shade is afterwards to inclose the form the painter will strike a broad dash of this shade beside his outline at once looking as if he meant to thicken the outline whereas this broad line is only the first installment of the future shadow and the outline is really drawn with its inner edge21 and thus far from good draughtsmen darkening the lines which turn away from the light the tendency with them is rather to darken them towards the light for it is there in general that shade will ultimately inclose them the best example of this treatment that i know is raphaels sketch in the louvre of the head of the angel pursuing heliodorus the one that shows part of the left eye where the dark strong lines which terminate the nose and forehead towards the light are opposed to tender and light ones behind the ear and in other places towards the shade you will see in fig 11 the same principle variously exemplified the principal dark lines in the head and drapery of the arms being on the side turned to the light  illustration fig 13  98 all these refinements and ultimate principles however do not affect your drawing for the present you must try to make your outlines as equal as possible and employ pure outline only for the two following purposes either 1 to steady your hand as in exercise ii for if you cannot draw the line itself you will never be able to terminate your shadow in the precise shape required when the line is absent or 2 to give you shorthand memoranda of forms when you are pressed for time thus the forms of distant trees in groups are defined for the most part by the light edge of the rounded mass of the nearer one being shown against the darker part of the rounded mass of a more distant one and to draw this properly nearly as much work is required to round each tree as to round the stone in fig 5 of course you cannot often get time to do this but if you mark the terminal line of each tree as is done by d√ºrer in fig 13 you will get a most useful memorandum of their arrangement and a very interesting drawing only observe in doing this you must not because the procedure is a quick one hurry that procedure itself you will find on copying that bit of d√ºrer that every one of his lines is firm deliberate and accurately descriptive as far as it goes it means a bush of such a size and such a shape definitely observed and set down it contains a true signalement of every nuttree and appletree and higher bit of hedge all round that village if you have not time to draw thus carefully do not draw at allyou are merely wasting your work and spoiling your taste when you have had four or five years practice you may be able to make useful memoranda at a rapid rate but not yet except sometimes of light and shade in a way of which i will tell you presently and this use of outline note farther is wholly confined to objects which have edges or limits you can outline a tree or a stone when it rises against another tree or stone but you cannot outline folds in drapery or waves in water if these are to be expressed at all it must be by some sort of shade and therefore the rule that no good drawing can consist throughout of pure outline remains absolute you see in that woodcut of d√ºrers his reason for even limiting himself so much to outline as he has in those distant woods and plains is that he may leave them in bright light to be thrown out still more by the dark sky and the dark village spire and the scene becomes real and sunny only by the addition of these shades  illustration fig 14  99 understanding then thus much of the use of outline we will go back to our question about treedrawing left unanswered at page 48  illustration fig 15  we were you remember in pursuit of mystery among the leaves now it is quite easy to obtain mystery and disorder to any extent but the difficulty is to keep organization in the midst of mystery and you will never succeed in doing this unless you lean always to the definite side and allow yourself rarely to become quite vague at least through all your early practice so after your single groups of leaves your first step must be to conditions like figs 14 and 15 which are careful facsimiles of two portions of a beautiful woodcut of d√ºrers the flight into egypt copy these carefullynever mind how little at a time but thoroughly then trace the d√ºrer and apply it to your drawing and do not be content till the one fits the other else your eye is not true enough to carry you safely through meshes of real leaves and in the course of doing this you will find that not a line nor dot of d√ºrers can be displaced without harm that all add to the effect and either express something or illumine something or relieve something if afterwards you copy any of the pieces of modern tree drawing of which so many rich examples are given constantly in our cheap illustrated periodicals any of the christmas numbers of last years illustrated news or others are full of them you will see that though good and forcible general effect is produced the lines are thrown in by thousands without special intention and might just as well go one way as another so only that there be enough of them to produce all together a wellshaped effect of intricacy and you will find that a little careless scratching about with your pen will bring you very near the same result without an effort but that no scratching of pen nor any fortunate chance nor anything but downright skill and thought will imitate so much as one leaf of d√ºrers yet there is considerable intricacy and glittering confusion in the interstices of those vine leaves of his as well as of the grass  illustration fig 16  100 when you have got familiarized to his firm manner you may draw from nature as much as you like in the same way and when you are tired of the intense care required for this you may fall into a little more easy massing of the leaves as in fig 10 p 55 this is facsimil√´d from an engraving after titian but an engraving not quite firstrate in manner the leaves being a little too formal still it is a good enough model for your times of rest and when you cannot carry the thing even so far as this you may sketch the forms of the masses as in fig 1622 taking care always to have thorough command over your hand that is not to let the mass take a free shape because your hand ran glibly over the paper but because in nature it has actually a free and noble shape and you have faithfully followed the same  101 and now that we have come to questions of noble shape as well as true shape and that we are going to draw from nature at our pleasure other considerations enter into the business which are by no means confined to first practice but extend to all practice these as this letter is long enough i should think to satisfy even the most exacting of correspondents i will arrange in a second letter praying you only to excuse the tiresomeness of this first onetiresomeness inseparable from directions touching the beginning of any artand to believe me even though i am trying to set you to dull and hard work                                        very faithfully yours                                                           j ruskin   footnotes    1 nbthis note is only for the satisfaction of incredulous     or curious readers you may miss it if you are in a hurry or are     willing to take the statement in the text on trust      the perception of solid form is entirely a matter of experience we     see nothing but flat colors and it is only by a series of     experiments that we find out that a stain of black or gray indicates     the dark side of a solid substance or that a faint hue indicates     that the object in which it appears is far away the whole technical     power of painting depends on our recovery of what may be called the     innocence of the eye that is to say of a sort of childish     perception of these flat stains of color merely as such without     consciousness of what they signifyas a blind man would see them     if suddenly gifted with sight      for instance when grass is lighted strongly by the sun in certain     directions it is turned from green into a peculiar and somewhat     dustylooking yellow if we had been born blind and were suddenly     endowed with sight on a piece of grass thus lighted in some parts by     the sun it would appear to us that part of the grass was green and     part a dusty yellow very nearly of the color of primroses and if     there were primroses near we should think that the sunlighted grass     was another mass of plants of the same sulphuryellow color we     should try to gather some of them and then find that the color went     away from the grass when we stood between it and the sun but not     from the primroses and by a series of experiments we should find     out that the sun was really the cause of the color in the onenot     in the other we go through such processes of experiment     unconsciously in childhood and having once come to conclusions     touching the signification of certain colors we always suppose that     we see what we only know and have hardly any consciousness of the     real aspect of the signs we have learned to interpret very few     people have any idea that sunlighted grass is yellow      now a highly accomplished artist has always reduced himself as     nearly as possible to this condition of infantine sight he sees the     colors of nature exactly as they are and therefore perceives at     once in the sunlighted grass the precise relation between the two     colors that form its shade and light to him it does not seem shade     and light but bluish green barred with gold      strive therefore first of all to convince yourself of this great     fact about sight this in your hand which you know by experience     and touch to be a book is to your eye nothing but a patch of white     variously gradated and spotted this other thing near you which by     experience you know to be a table is to your eye only a patch of     brown variously darkened and veined and so on and the whole art     of painting consists merely in perceiving the shape and depth of     these patches of color and putting patches of the same size depth     and shape on canvas the only obstacle to the success of painting     is that many of the real colors are brighter and paler than it is     possible to put on canvas we must put darker ones to represent     them    2 stale crumb of bread is better if you are making a delicate     drawing than indiarubber for it disturbs the surface of the paper     less but it crumbles about the room and makes a mess and besides     you waste the good bread which is wrong and your drawing will not     for a long while be worth the crumbs so use indiarubber very     lightly or if heavily pressing it only not passing it over the     paper and leave what pencil marks will not come away so without     minding them in a finished drawing the uneffaced penciling is often     serviceable helping the general tone and enabling you to take out     little bright lights    3 what is usually so much sought after under the term freedom is     the character of the drawing of a great master in a hurry whose     hand is so thoroughly disciplined that when pressed for time he can     let it fly as it will and it will not go far wrong but the hand of     a great master at real work is never free its swiftest dash is     under perfect government paul veronese or tintoret could pause     within a hairs breadth of any appointed mark in their fastest     touches and follow within a hairs breadth the previously     intended curve you must never therefore aim at freedom it is not     required of your drawing that it should be free but that it should     be right in time you will be able to do right easily and then your     work will be free in the best sense but there is no merit in doing     wrong easily      these remarks however do not apply to the lines used in shading     which it will be remembered are to be made as quickly as possible     the reason of this is that the quicker a line is drawn the lighter     it is at the ends and therefore the more easily joined with other     lines and concealed by them the object in perfect shading being to     conceal the lines as much as possible      and observe in this exercise the object is more to get firmness of     hand than accuracy of eye for outline for there are no outlines in     nature and the ordinary student is sure to draw them falsely if he     draws them at all do not therefore be discouraged if you find     mistakes continue to occur in your outlines be content at present     if you find your hand gaining command over the curves    4 if you can get any pieces of dead white porcelain not glazed     they will be useful models    5 artists who glance at this book may be surprised at this     permission my chief reason is that i think it more necessary that     the pupils eye should be trained to accurate perception of the     relations of curve and right lines by having the latter absolutely     true than that he should practice drawing straight lines but also     i believe though i am not quite sure of this that he never ought     to be able to draw a straight line i do not believe a perfectly     trained hand ever can draw a line without some curvature in it or     some variety of direction prout could draw a straight line but i     do not believe raphael could nor tintoret a great draughtsman can     as far as i have observed draw every line but a straight one    6 or if you feel able to do so scratch them in with confused     quick touches indicating the general shape of the cloud or mist of     twigs round the main branches but do not take much trouble about     them    7 it is more difficult at first to get in color a narrow     gradation than an extended one but the ultimate difficulty is as     with the pen to make the gradation go far    8 of course all the columns of color are to be of equal length    9 the degree of darkness you can reach with the given color is     always indicated by the color of the solid cake in the box    10 the figure a fig 5 is very dark but this is to give an     example of all kinds of depths of tint without repeated figures    11 nearly neutral in ordinary circumstances but yet with quite     different tones in its neutrality according to the colors of the     various reflected rays that compose it    12 if we had any business with the reasons of this i might     perhaps be able to show you some metaphysical ones for the     enjoyment by truly artistical minds of the changes wrought by     light and shade and perspective in patterned surfaces but this is     at present not to the point and all that you need to know is that     the drawing of such things is good exercise and moreover a kind of     exercise which titian veronese tintoret giorgione and turner     all enjoyed and strove to excel in    13 the use of acquiring this habit of execution is that you may be     able when you begin to color to let one hue be seen in minute     portions gleaming between the touches of another    14 william hunt of the old watercolor society    15 at marlborough house in 1857 among the four principal     examples of turners later watercolor drawing perhaps the most     neglected was that of fishingboats and fish at sunset it is one of     his most wonderful works though unfinished if you examine the     larger white fishingboat sail you will find it has a little spark     of pure white in its righthand upper corner about as large as a     minute pins head and that all the surface of the sail is gradated     to that focus try to copy this sail once or twice and you will     begin to understand turners work similarly the wing of the cupid     in correggios large picture in the national gallery is focused to     two little grains of white at the top of it the points of light on     the white flower in the wreath round the head of the dancing     childfaun in titians bacchus and ariadne exemplify the same     thing    16 i shall not henceforward number the exercises recommended as     they are distinguished only by increasing difficulty of subject not     by difference of method    17 if you understand the principle of the stereoscope you will     know why if not it does not matter trust me for the truth of the     statement as i cannot explain the principle without diagrams and     much loss of time see however note 1 in appendix i    18 the plates marked with a star are

the appendix on works to be     studied    21 see note 2 in appendix i    22 this sketch is not of a tree standing on its head though it     looks like it you will find it explained presently     letter ii  sketching from nature   102 my dear readerthe work we have already gone through together has i hope enabled you to draw with fair success either rounded and simple masses like stones or complicated arrangements of form like those of leaves provided only these masses or complexities will stay quiet for you to copy and do not extend into quantity so great as to baffle your patience but if we are now to go out to the fields and to draw anything like a complete landscape neither of these conditions will any more be observed for us the clouds will not wait while we copy their heaps or clefts the shadows will escape from us as we try to shape them each in its stealthy minute march still leaving light where its tremulous edge had rested the moment before and involving in eclipse objects that had seemed safe from its influence and instead of the small clusters of leaves which we could reckon point by point embarrassing enough even though numerable we have now leaves as little to be counted as the sands of the sea and restless perhaps as its foam  103 in all that we have to do now therefore direct imitation becomes more or less impossible it is always to be aimed at so far as it is possible and when you have time and opportunity some portions of a landscape may as you gain greater skill be rendered with an approximation almost to mirrored portraiture still whatever skill you may reach there will always be need of judgment to choose and of speed to seize certain things that are principal or fugitive and you must give more and more effort daily to the observance of characteristic points and the attainment of concise methods  104 i have directed your attention early to foliage for two reasons first that it is always accessible as a study and secondly that its modes of growth present simple examples of the importance of leading or governing lines it is by seizing these leading lines when we cannot seize all that likeness and expression are given to a portrait and grace and a kind of vital truth to the rendering of every natural form i call it vital truth because these chief lines are always expressive of the past history and present action of the thing they show in a mountain first how it was built or heaped up and secondly how it is now being worn away and from what quarter the wildest storms strike it in a tree they show what kind of fortune it has had to endure from its childhood how troublesome trees have come in its way and pushed it aside and tried to strangle or starve it where and when kind trees have sheltered it and grown up lovingly together with it bending as it bent what winds torment it most what boughs of it behave best and bear most fruit and so on in a wave or cloud these leading lines show the run of the tide and of the wind and the sort of change which the water or vapor is at any moment enduring in its form as it meets shore or counterwave or melting sunshine now remember nothing distinguishes great men from inferior men more than their always whether in life or in art knowing the way things are going your dunce thinks they are standing still and draws them all fixed your wise man sees the change or changing in them and draws them sothe animal in its motion the tree in its growth the cloud in its course the mountain in its wearing away try always whenever you look at a form to see the lines in it which have had power over its past fate and will have power over its futurity those are its awful lines see that you seize on those whatever else you miss thus the leafage in fig 16 p 63 grew round the root of a stone pine on the brow of a crag at sestri near genoa and all the sprays of it are thrust away in their first budding by the great rude root and spring out in every direction round it as water splashes when a heavy stone is thrown into it then when they have got clear of the root they begin to bend up again some of them being little stone pines themselves have a great notion of growing upright if they can and this struggle of theirs to recover their straight road towards the sky after being obliged to grow sideways in their early years is the effort that will mainly influence their future destiny and determine if they are to be crabbed forky pines striking from that rock of sestri whose clefts nourish them with bared red lightning of angry arms towards the sea or if they are to be goodly and solemn pines with trunks like pillars of temples and the purple burning of their branches sheathed in deep globes of cloudy green those then are their fateful lines see that you give that spring and resilience whatever you leave ungiven depend upon it their chief beauty is in these  illustration fig 17  105 so in trees in general and bushes large or small you will notice that though the boughs spring irregularly and at various angles there is a tendency in all to stoop less and less as they near the top of the tree this structure typified in the simplest possible terms at c fig 17 is common to all trees that i know of and it gives them a certain plumy character and aspect of unity in the hearts of their branches which are essential to their beauty the stem does not merely send off a wild branch here and there to take its own way but all the branches share in one great fountainlike impulse each has a curve and a path to take which fills a definite place and each terminates all its minor branches at its outer extremity so as to form a greater outer curve whose character and proportion are peculiar for each species that is to say the general type or idea of a tree is not as a fig 17 but as b in which observe the boughs all carry their minor divisions right out to the bounding curve not but that smaller branches by thousands terminate in the heart of the tree but the idea and main purpose in every branch are to carry all its child branches well out to the air and light and let each of them however small take its part in filling the united flow of the bounding curve so that the type of each separate bough is again not a but b fig 18 approximating that is to say so far to the structure of a plant of broccoli as to throw the great mass of spray and leafage out to a rounded surface therefore beware of getting into a careless habit of drawing boughs with successive sweeps of the pen or brush one hanging to the other as in fig 19 if you look at the treeboughs in any painting of wilsons you will see this structure and nearly every other that is to be avoided in their intensest types you will also notice that wilson never conceives a tree as a round mass but flat as if it had been pressed and dried most people in drawing pines seem to fancy in the same way that the boughs come out only on two sides of the trunk instead of all round it always therefore take more pains in trying to draw the boughs of trees that grow towards you than those that go off to the sides anybody can draw the latter but the foreshortened ones are not so easy it will help you in drawing them to observe that in most trees the ramification of each branch though not of the tree itself is more or less flattened and approximates in its position to the look of a hand held out to receive something or shelter something if you take a lookingglass and hold your hand before it slightly hollowed with the palm upwards and the fingers open as if you were going to support the base of some great bowl larger than you could easily hold and sketch your hand as you see it in the glass with the points of the fingers towards you it will materially help you in understanding the way trees generally hold out their hands and if then you will turn yours with its palm downwards as if you were going to try to hide something but with the fingers expanded you will get a good type of the action of the lower boughs in cedars and such other spreading trees  illustration fig 18  illustration fig 19  106 fig 20 will give you a good idea of the simplest way in which these and other such facts can be rapidly expressed if you copy it carefully you will be surprised to find how the touches all group together in expressing the plumy toss of the tree branches and the springing of the bushes out of the bank and the undulation of the ground note the careful drawing of the footsteps made by the climbers of the little mound on the left23 it is facsimil√´d from an etching of turners and is as good an example as you can have of the use of pure and firm lines it will also show you how the particular action in foliage or anything else to which you wish to direct attention may be intensified by the adjuncts the tall and upright trees are made to look more tall and upright still because their line is continued below by the figure of the farmer with his stick and the rounded bushes on the bank are made to look more rounded because their line is continued in one broad sweep by the black dog and the boy climbing the wall these figures are placed entirely with this object as we shall see more fully hereafter when we come to talk about composition but if you please we will not talk about that yet awhile what i have been telling you about the beautiful lines and action of foliage has nothing to do with composition but only with fact and the brief and expressive representation of fact but there will be no harm in your looking forward if you like to do so to the account in letter iii of the law of radiation and reading what is said there about tree growth indeed it would in some respects have been better to have said it here than there only it would have broken up the account of the principles of composition somewhat awkwardly  illustration fig 20  107 now although the lines indicative of action are not always quite so manifest in other things as in trees a little attention will soon enable you to see that there are such lines in everything in an old house roof a bad observer and bad draughtsman will only see and draw the spotty irregularity of tiles or slates all over but a good draughtsman will see all the bends of the under timbers where they are weakest and the weight is telling on them most and the tracks of the run of the water in time of rain where it runs off fastest and where it lies long and feeds the moss and he will be careful however few slates he draws to mark the way they bend together towards those hollows which have the future fate of the roof in them and crowd gradually together at the top of the gable partly diminishing in perspective partly perhaps diminished on purpose they are so in most english old houses by the slatelayer so in ground there is always the direction of the run of the water to be noticed which rounds the earth and cuts it into hollows and generally in any bank or height worth drawing a trace of bedded or other internal structure besides figure 20 will give you some idea of the way in which such facts may be expressed by a few lines do you not feel the depression in the ground all down the hill where the footsteps are and how the people always turn to the left at the top losing breath a little and then how the water runs down in that other hollow towards the valley behind the roots of the trees  108 now i want you in your first sketches from nature to aim exclusively at understanding and representing these vital facts of form using the pennot now the steel but the quillfirmly and steadily never scrawling with it but saying to yourself before you lay on a single touchthat leaf is the main one that bough is the guiding one and this touch so long so broad means that part of itpoint or side or knot as the case may be resolve always as you look at the thing what you will take and what miss of it and never let your hand run away with you or get into any habit or method of touch if you want a continuous line your hand should pass calmly from one end of it to the other without a tremor if you want a shaking and broken line your hand should shake or break off as easily as a musicians finger shakes or stops on a note only remember this that there is no general way of doing any thing no recipe can be given you for so much as the drawing of a cluster of grass the grass may be ragged and stiff or tender and flowing sunburnt and sheepbitten or rank and languid fresh or dry lustrous or dull look at it and try to draw it as it is and dont think how somebody told you to do grass so a stone may be round or angular polished or rough cracked all over like an illglazed teacup or as united and broad as the breast of hercules it may be as flaky as a wafer as powdery as a field puffball it may be knotted like a ships hawser or kneaded like hammered iron or knit like a damascus saber or fused like a glass bottle or crystallized like hoarfrost or veined like a forest leaf look at it and dont try to remember how anybody told you to do a stone  109 as soon as you find that your hand obeys you thoroughly and that you can render any form with a firmness and truth approaching that of turners or d√ºrers work24 you must add a simple but equally careful light and shade to your pen drawing so as to make each study as complete as possible for which you must prepare yourself thus get if you have the means a good impression of one plate of turners liber studiorum if possible one of the subjects named in the note below25 if you cannot obtain or even borrow for a little while any of these engravings you must use a photograph instead how i will tell you presently but if you can get the turner it will be best you will see that it is composed of a firm etching in line with mezzotint shadow laid over it you must first copy the etched part of it accurately to which end put the print against the window and trace slowly with the greatest care every black line retrace this on smooth drawingpaper and finally go over the whole with your pen looking at the original plate always so that if you err at all it may be on the right side not making a line which is too curved or too straight already in the tracing more curved or more straight as you go over it and in doing this never work after you are tired nor to get the thing done for if it is badly done it will be of no use to you the true zeal and patience of a quarter of an hour are better than the sulky and inattentive labor of a whole day if you have not made the touches right at the first going over with the pen retouch them delicately with little ink in your pen thickening or reinforcing them as they need you cannot give too much care to the facsimile then keep this etched outline by you in order to study at your ease the way in which turner uses his line as preparatory for the subsequent shadow26 it is only in getting the two separate that you will be able to reason on this next copy once more though for the fourth time any part of this etching which you like and put on the light and shade with the brush and any brown color that matches that of the plate27 working it with the point of the brush as delicately as if you were drawing with pencil and dotting and crosshatching as lightly as you can touch the paper till you get the gradations of turners engraving  110 in this exercise as in the former one a quarter of an inch worked to close resemblance of the copy is worth more than the whole subject carelessly done not that in drawing afterwards from nature you are to be obliged to finish every gradation in this way but that once having fully accomplished the drawing something rightly you will thenceforward feel and aim at a higher perfection than you could otherwise have conceived and the brush will obey you and bring out quickly and clearly the loveliest results with a submissiveness which it would have wholly refused if you had not put it to severest work nothing is more strange in art than the way that chance and materials seem to favor you when once you have thoroughly conquered them make yourself quite independent of chance get your result in spite of it and from that day forward all things will somehow fall as you would have them show the camels hair and the color in it that no bending nor blotting is of any use to escape your will that the touch and the shade shall finally be right if it costs you a years toil and from that hour of corrective conviction said camels hair will bend itself to all your wishes and no blot will dare to transgress its appointed border if you cannot obtain a print from the liber studiorum get a photograph28 of some general landscape subject with high hills and a village or picturesque town in the middle distance and some calm water of varied character a stream with stones in it if possible and copy any part of it you like in this same brown color working as i have just directed you to do from the liber a great deal with the point of the brush you are under a twofold disadvantage here however first there are portions in every photograph too delicately done for you at present to be at all able to copy and secondly there are portions always more obscure or dark than there would be in the real scene and involved in a mystery which you will not be able as yet to decipher both these characters will be advantageous to you for future study after you have gained experience but they are a little against you in early attempts at tinting still you must fight through the difficulty and get the power of producing delicate gradations with brown or gray like those of the photograph  111 now observe the perfection of work would be tinted shadow like photography without any obscurity or exaggerated darkness and as long as your effect depends in anywise on visible lines your art is not perfect though it may be firstrate of its kind but to get complete results in tints merely requires both long time and consummate skill and you will find that a few wellput pen lines with a tint dashed over or under them get more expression of facts than you could reach in any other way by the same expenditure of time the use of the liber studiorum print to you is chiefly as an example of the simplest shorthand of this kind a shorthand which is yet capable of dealing with the most subtle natural effects for the firm etching gets at the expression of complicated details as leaves masonry textures of ground etc while the overlaid tint enables you to express the most tender distances of sky and forms of playing light mist or cloud most of the best drawings by the old masters are executed on this principle the touches of the pen being useful also to give a look of transparency to shadows which could not otherwise be attained but by great finish of tinting and if you have access to any ordinarily good public gallery or can make friends of any printsellers who have folios either of old drawings or facsimiles of them you will not be at a loss to find some example of this unity of pen with tinting multitudes of photographs also are now taken from the best drawings by the old masters and i hope that our mechanics institutes and other societies organized with a view to public instruction will not fail to possess themselves of examples of these and to make them accessible to students of drawing in the vicinity a single print from turners liber to show the unison of tint with pen etching and the st catherine photographed by thurston thompson from raphaels drawing in the louvre to show the unity of the soft tinting of the stump with chalk would be all that is necessary and would i believe be in many cases more serviceable than a larger collection and certainly than a whole gallery of secondrate prints two such examples are peculiarly desirable because all other modes of drawing with pen separately or chalk separately or color separately may be seen by the poorest student in any cheap illustrated book or in shop windows but this unity of tinting with line he cannot generally see but by some special inquiry and in some out of the way places he could not find a single example of it supposing that this should be so in your own case and that you cannot meet with any example of this kind try to make the matter out alone thus  112 take a small and simple photograph allow yourself half an hour to express its subjects with the pen only using some permanent liquid color instead of ink outlining its buildings or trees firmly and laying in the deeper shadows as you have been accustomed to do in your bolder pen drawings then when this etching is dry take your sepia or gray and tint it over getting now the finer gradations of the photograph and finally taking out the higher lights with penknife or blotting paper you will soon find what can be done in this way and by a series of experiments you may ascertain for yourself how far the pen may be made serviceable to reinforce shadows mark characters of texture outline unintelligible masses and so on the more time you have the more delicate you may make the pen drawing blending it with the tint the less you have the more distinct you must keep the two practice in this way from one photograph allowing yourself sometimes only a quarter of an hour for the whole thing sometimes an hour sometimes two or three hours in each case drawing the whole subject in full depth of light and shade but with such degree of finish in the parts as is possible in the given time and this exercise observe you will do well to repeat frequently whether you can get prints and drawings as well as photographs or not  113 and now at last when you can copy a piece of liber studiorum or its photographic substitute faithfully you have the complete means in your power of working from nature on all subjects that interest you which you should do in four different ways  first when you have full time and your subject is one that will stay quiet for you make perfect light and shade studies or as nearly perfect as you can with gray or brown color of any kind reinforced and defined with the pen  114 secondly when your time is short or the subject is so rich in detail that you feel you cannot complete it intelligibly in light and shade make a hasty study of the effect and give the rest of the time to a d√ºreresque expression of the details if the subject seems to you interesting and there are points about it which you cannot understand try to get five spare minutes to go close up to it and make a nearer memorandum not that you are ever to bring the details of this nearer sketch into the farther one but that you may thus perfect your experience of the aspect of things and know that such and such a look of a tower or cottage at five hundred yards off means that sort of tower or cottage near while also this nearer sketch will be useful to prevent any future misinterpretation of your own work if you have time however far your light and shade study in the distance may have been carried it is always well for these reasons to make also your d√ºreresque and your near memoranda for if your light and shade drawing be good much of the interesting detail must be lost in it or disguised  115 your hasty study of effect may be made most easily and quickly with a soft pencil dashed over when done with one tolerably deep tone of gray which will fix the pencil while this fixing color is wet take out the higher lights with the dry brush and when it is quite dry scratch out the highest lights with the penknife five minutes carefully applied will do much by these means of course the paper is to be white i do not like studies on gray paper so well for you can get more gradation by the taking off your wet tint and laying it on cunningly a little darker here and there than you can with bodycolor white unless you are consummately skillful there is no objection to your making your d√ºreresque memoranda on gray or yellow paper and touching or relieving them with white only do not depend much on your white touches nor make the sketch for their sake  116 thirdly when you have neither time for careful study nor for d√ºreresque detail sketch the outline with pencil then dash in the shadows with the brush boldly trying to do as much as you possibly can at once and to get a habit of expedition and decision laying more color again and again into the tints as they dry using every expedient which your practice has suggested to you of carrying out your chiaroscuro in the manageable and moist material taking the color off here with the dry brush scratching out lights in it there with the wooden handle of the brush rubbing it in with your fingers drying it off with your sponge etc then when the color is in take your pen and mark the outline characters vigorously in the manner of the liber studiorum this kind of study is very convenient for carrying away pieces of effect which depend not so much on refinement as on complexity strange shapes of involved shadows sudden effects of sky etc and it is most useful as a safeguard against any too servile or slow habits which the minute copying may induce in you for although the endeavor to obtain velocity merely for velocitys sake and dash for displays sake is as baneful as it is despicable there are a velocity and a dash which not only are compatible with perfect drawing but obtain certain results which cannot be had otherwise and it is perfectly safe for you to study occasionally for speed and decision while your continual course of practice is such as to insure your retaining an accurate judgment and a tender touch speed under such circumstances is rather fatiguing than tempting and you will find yourself always beguiled rather into elaboration than negligence  illustration fig 21  117 fourthly you will find it of great use whatever kind of landscape scenery you are passing through to get into the habit of making memoranda of the shapes of shadows you will find that many objects of no essential interest in themselves and neither deserving a finished study nor a d√ºreresque one may yet become of singular value in consequence of the fantastic shapes of their shadows for it happens often in distant effect that the shadow is by much a more important element than the substance thus in the alpine bridge fig 21 seen within a few yards of it as in the figure the arrangement of timbers to which the shadows are owing is perceptible but at half a miles distance in bright sunlight the timbers would not be seen and a good painters expression of the bridge would be merely the large spot and the crossed bars of pure gray wholly without indication of their cause as in fig 22 a and if we saw it at still greater distances it would appear as in fig 22 b and c diminishing at last to a strange unintelligible spiderlike spot of gray on the light hillside a perfectly great painter throughout his distances continually reduces his objects to these shadow abstracts and the singular and to many persons unaccountable effect of the confused touches in turners distances is owing chiefly to this thorough accuracy and intense meaning of the shadow abstracts  illustration fig 22  118 studies of this kind are easily made when you are in haste with an f or hb pencil it requires some hardness of the point to insure your drawing delicately enough when the forms of the shadows are very subtle they are sure to be so somewhere and are generally so everywhere the pencil is indeed a very precious instrument after you are master of the pen and brush for the pencil cunningly used is both and will draw a line with the precision of the one and the gradation of the other nevertheless it is so unsatisfactory to see the sharp touches on which the best of the detail depends getting gradually deadened by time or to find the places where force was wanted look shiny and like a firegrate that i should recommend rather the steady use of the pen or brush and color whenever time admits of it keeping only a small memorandumbook in the breastpocket with its wellcut sheathed pencil ready for notes on passing opportunities but never being without this  119 thus much then respecting the manner in which you are at first to draw from nature but it may perhaps be serviceable to you if i also note one or two points respecting your choice of subjects for study and the best special methods of treating some of them for one of by no means the least difficulties which you have at first to encounter is a peculiar instinct common as far as i have noticed to all beginners to fix on exactly the most unmanageable feature in the given scene there are many things in every landscape which can be drawn if at all only by the most accomplished artists and i have noticed that it is nearly always these which a beginner will dash at or if not these it will be something which though pleasing to him in itself is unfit for a picture and in which when he has drawn it he will have little pleasure as some slight protection against this evil genius of beginners the following general warnings may be useful  120 1 do not draw things that you love on account of their associations or at least do not draw them because you love them but merely when you cannot get anything else to draw if you try to draw places that you love you are sure to be always entangled amongst neat brick walls iron railings gravel walks greenhouses and quickset hedges besides that you will be continually led into some endeavor to make your drawing pretty or complete which will be fatal to your progress you need never hope to get on if you are the least anxious that the drawing you are actually at work upon should look nice when it is done all you have to care about is to make it right and to learn as much in doing it as possible so then though when you are sitting in your friends parlor or in your own and have nothing else to do you may draw anything that is there for practice even the fireirons or the pattern on the carpet be sure that it is for practice and not because it is a beloved carpet or a friendly poker and tongs nor because you wish to please your friend by drawing her room  121 also never make presents of your drawings of course i am addressing you as a beginnera time may come when your work will be precious to everybody but be resolute not to give it away till you know that it is worth something as soon as it is worth anything you will know that it is so if any one asks you for a present of a drawing send them a couple of cakes of color and a piece of bristol board those materials are for the present of more value in that form than if you had spread the one over the other  the main reason for this rule is however that its observance will much protect you from the great danger of trying to make your drawings pretty  122 2 never by choice draw anything polished especially if complicated in form avoid all brass rods and curtain ornaments chandeliers plate glass and fine steel a shining knob of a piece of furniture does not matter if it comes in your way but do not fret yourself if it will not look right and choose only things that do not shine  3 avoid all very neat things they are exceedingly difficult to draw and very ugly when drawn choose rough worn and clumsylooking things as much as possible for instance you cannot have a more difficult or profitless study than a newly painted thames wherry nor a better study than an old empty coalbarge lying ashore at low tide in general everything that you think very ugly will be good for you to draw  4 avoid as much as possible studies in which one thing is seen through another you will constantly find a thin tree standing before your chosen cottage or between you and the turn of the river its near branches all entangled with the distance it is intensely difficult to represent this and though when the tree is there you must not imaginarily cut it down but do it as well as you can yet always look for subjects that fall into definite masses not into network that is rather for a cottage with a dark tree beside it than for one with a thin tree in front of it rather for a mass of wood soft blue and rounded than for a ragged copse or confusion of intricate stems  5 avoid as far as possible country divided by hedges perhaps nothing in the whole compass of landscape is so utterly unpicturesque and unmanageable as the ordinary english patchwork of field and hedge with trees dotted over it in independent spots gnawed straight at the cattle line  still do not be discouraged if you find you have chosen ill and that the subject overmasters you it is much better that it should than that you should think you had entirely mastered it but at first and even for some time you must be prepared for very discomfortable failure which nevertheless will not be without some wholesome result  123 as however i have told you what most definitely to avoid i may perhaps help you a little by saying what to seek in general all banks are beautiful things and will reward work better than large landscapes if you live in a lowland country you must look for places where the ground is broken to the rivers edges with decayed posts or roots of trees or if by great good luck there should be such things within your reach for remnants of stone quays or steps mossy milldams etc nearly every other mile of road in chalk country will present beautiful bits of broken bank at its sides better in form and color than high chalk cliffs in woods one or two trunks with the flowery ground below are at once the richest and easiest kind of study a not very thick trunk say nine inches or a foot in diameter with ivy running up it sparingly is an easy and always a rewarding subject  124 large nests of buildings in the middle distance are always beautiful when drawn carefully provided they are not modern rows of pattern cottages or villas with ionic and doric porticoes any old english village or cluster of farmhouses drawn with all its ins and outs and haystacks and palings is sure to be lovely much more a french one french landscape is generally as much superior to english as swiss landscape is to french in some respects the french is incomparable such scenes as that avenue on the seine which i have recommended you to buy the engraving of admit no rivalship in their expression of graceful rusticity and cheerful peace and in the beauty of component lines  in drawing villages take great pains with the gardens a rustic garden is in every way beautiful if you have time draw all the rows of cabbages and hollyhocks and broken fences and wandering eglantines and bossy roses you cannot have better practice nor be kept by anything in purer thoughts  make intimate friends with all the brooks in your neighborhood and study them ripple by ripple  village churches in england are not often good subjects there is a peculiar meanness about most of them and awkwardness of line old manorhouses are often pretty ruins are usually with us too prim and cathedrals too orderly i do not think there is a single cathedral in england from which it is possible to obtain one subject for an impressive drawing there is always some discordant civility or jarring vergerism about them  125 if you live in a mountain or hill country your only danger is redundance of subject be resolved in the first place to draw a piece of rounded rock with its variegated lichens quite rightly getting its complete roundings and all the patterns of the lichen in true local color till you can do this it is of no use your thinking of sketching among hills but when once you have done this the forms of distant hills will be comparatively easy  126 when you have practiced for a little time from such of these subjects as may be accessible to you you will certainly find difficulties arising which will make you wish more than ever for a masters help these difficulties will vary according to the character of your own mind one question occurring to one person and one to another so that it is impossible to anticipate them all and it would make this too large a book if i answered all that i can anticipate you must be content to work on in good hope that nature will in her own time interpret to you much for herself that farther experience on your own part will make some difficulties disappear and that others will be removed by the occasional observation of such artists work as may come in your way nevertheless i will not close this letter without a few general remarks such as may be useful to you after you are somewhat advanced in power and these remarks may i think be conveniently arranged under three heads having reference to the drawing of vegetation water and skies  127 and first of vegetation you may think perhaps we have said enough about trees already yet if you have done as you were bid and tried to draw them frequently enough and carefully enough you will be ready by this time to hear a little more of them you will also recollect that we left our question respecting the mode of expressing intricacy of leafage partly unsettled in the first letter i left it so because i wanted you to learn the real structure of leaves by drawing them for yourself before i troubled you with the most subtle considerations as to method in drawing them and by this time i imagine you must have found out two principal things universal facts about leaves namely that they always in the main tendencies of their lines indicate a beautiful divergence of growth according to the law of radiation already referred to29 and the second that this divergence is never formal but carried out with endless variety of individual line i must now press both these facts on your attention a little farther  128 you may perhaps have been surprised that i have not yet spoken of the works of j d harding especially if you happen to have met with the passages referring to them in modern painters in which they are highly praised they are deservedly praised for they are the only works by a modern30 draughtsman which express in any wise the energy of trees and the laws of growth of which we have been speaking there are no lithographic sketches which for truth of general character obtained with little cost of time at all rival hardings calame robert and the other lithographic landscape sketchers are altogether inferior in power though sometimes a little deeper in meaning but you must not take even harding for a model though you may use his works for occasional reference and if you can afford to buy his lessons on trees31 it will be serviceable to you in various ways and will at present help me to explain the point under consideration and it is well that i should illustrate this point by reference to hardings works because their great influence on young students renders it desirable that their real character should be thoroughly understood  129 you will find first in the titlepage of the lessons on trees a pretty woodcut in which the tree stems are drawn with great truth and in a very interesting arrangement of lines plate 1 is not quite worthy of mr harding tending too much to make his pupil at starting think everything depends on black dots still the main lines are good and very characteristic of tree growth then in plate 2 we come to the point at issue the first examples in that plate are given to the pupil that he may practice from them till his hand gets into the habit of arranging lines freely in a similar manner and they are stated by mr harding to be universal in application all outlines expressive of foliage he says are but modifications of them they consist of groups of lines more or less resembling our fig 23 below and the characters especially insisted upon are that they tend at their inner ends to a common center that their ends terminate in are inclosed by ovoid curves and that the outer ends are most emphatic  illustration fig 23  130 now as thus expressive of the great laws of radiation and inclosure the main principle of this method of execution confirms in a very interesting way our conclusions respecting foliage composition the reason of the last rule that the outer end of the line is to be most emphatic does not indeed at first appear for the line at one end of a natural leaf is not more emphatic than the line at the other but ultimately in hardings method this darker part of the touch stands more or less for the shade at the outer extremity of the leaf mass and as harding uses these touches they express as much of tree character as any mere habit of touch can express but unfortunately there is another law of tree growth quite as fixed as the law of radiation which this and all other conventional modes of execution wholly lose sight of this second law is that the radiating tendency shall be carried out only as a ruling spirit in reconcilement with perpetual individual caprice on the part of the separate leaves so that the moment a touch is monotonous it must be also false the liberty of the leaf individually being just as essential a truth as its unity of growth with its companions in the radiating group  131 it does not matter how small or apparently symmetrical the cluster may be nor how large or vague you can hardly have a more formal one than b in fig 9 p 47 nor a less formal one than this shoot of spanish chestnut shedding its leaves fig 24 but in either of them even the general reader unpracticed in any of the previously recommended exercises must see that there are wandering lines mixed with the radiating ones and radiating lines with the wild ones and if he takes the pen and tries to copy either of these examples he will find that neither play of hand to left nor to right neither a free touch nor a firm touch nor any learnable or describable touch whatsoever will enable him to produce currently a resemblance of it but that he must either draw it slowly or give it up and which makes the matter worse still though gathering the bough and putting it close to you or seeing a piece of near foliage against the sky you may draw the entire outline of the leaves yet if the spray has light upon it and is ever so little a way off you will miss as we have seen a point of a leaf here and an edge there some of the surfaces will be confused by glitter and some spotted with shade and if you look carefully through this confusion for the edges or dark stems which you really can see and put only those down the result will be neither like fig 9 nor fig 24 but such an interrupted and puzzling piece of work as fig 2532  illustration fig 25  illustration fig 24  132 now it is in the perfect acknowledgment and expression of these three laws that all good drawing of landscape consists there is first the organic unity the law whether of radiation or parallelism or concurrent action which rules the masses of herbs and trees of rocks and clouds and waves secondly the individual liberty of the members subjected to these laws of unity and lastly the mystery under which the separate character of each is more or less concealed  i say first there must be observance of the ruling organic law this is the first distinction between good artists and bad artists your common sketcher or bad painter puts his leaves on the trees as if they were moss tied to sticks he cannot see the lines of action or growth he scatters the shapeless clouds over his sky not perceiving the sweeps of associated curves which the real clouds are following as they fly and he breaks his mountain side into rugged fragments wholly unconscious of the lines of force with which the real rocks have risen or of the lines of couch in which they repose on the contrary it is the main delight of the great draughtsman to trace these laws of government and his tendency to error is always in the exaggeration of their authority rather than in its denial  133 secondly i say we have to show the individual character and liberty of the separate leaves clouds or rocks and herein the great masters separate themselves finally from the inferior ones for if the men of inferior genius ever express law at all it is by the sacrifice of individuality thus salvator rosa has great perception of the sweep of foliage and rolling of clouds but never draws a single leaflet or mist wreath accurately similarly gainsborough in his landscape has great feeling for masses of form and harmony of color but in the detail gives nothing but meaningless touches not even so much as the species of tree much less the variety of its leafage being ever discernible now although both these expressions of government and individuality are essential to masterly work the individuality is the more essential and the more difficult of attainment and therefore that attainment separates the great masters finally from the inferior ones it is the more essential because in these matters of beautiful arrangement in visible things the same rules hold that hold in moral things it is a lamentable and unnatural thing to see a number of men subject to no government actuated by no ruling principle and associated by no common affection but it would be a more lamentable thing still were it possible to see a number of men so oppressed into assimilation as to have no more any individual hope or character no differences in aim no dissimilarities of passion no irregularities of judgment a society in which no man could help another since none would be feebler than himself no man admire another since none would be stronger than himself no man be grateful to another since by none he could be relieved no man reverence another since by none he could be instructed a society in which every soul would be as the syllable of a stammerer instead of the word of a speaker in which every man would walk as in a frightful dream seeing specters of himself in everlasting multiplication gliding helplessly around him in a speechless darkness therefore it is that perpetual difference play and change in groups of form are more essential to them even than their being subdued by some great gathering law the law is needful to them for their perfection and their power but the difference is needful to them for their life  134 and here it may be noted in passing that if you enjoy the pursuit of analogies and types and have any ingenuity of judgment in discerning them you may always accurately ascertain what are the noble characters in a piece of painting by merely considering what are the noble characters of man in his association with his fellows what grace of manner and refinement of habit are in society grace of line and refinement of form are in the association of visible objects what advantage or harm there may be in sharpness ruggedness or quaintness in the dealings or conversations of men precisely that relative degree of advantage or harm there is in them as elements of pictorial composition what power is in liberty or relaxation to strengthen or relieve human souls that power precisely in the same relative degree play and laxity of line have to strengthen or refresh the expression of a picture and what goodness or greatness we can conceive to arise in companies of men from chastity of thought regularity of life simplicity of custom and balance of authority precisely that kind of goodness and greatness may be given to a picture by the purity of its color the severity of its forms and the symmetry of its masses  135 you need not be in the least afraid of pushing these analogies too far they cannot be pushed too far they are so precise and complete that the farther you pursue them the clearer the more certain the more useful you will find them they will not fail you in one particular or in any direction of inquiry there is no moral vice no moral virtue which has not its precise prototype in the art of painting so that you may at your will illustrate the moral habit by the art or the art by the moral habit affection and discord fretfulness and quietness feebleness and firmness luxury and purity pride and modesty and all other such habits and every conceivable modification and mingling of them may be illustrated with mathematical exactness by conditions of line and color and not merely these definable vices and virtues but also every conceivable shade of human character and passion from the righteous or unrighteous majesty of the king to the innocent or faultful simplicity of the shepherd boy  136 the pursuit of this subject belongs properly however to the investigation of the higher branches of composition matters which it would be quite useless to treat of in this book and i only allude to them here in order that you may understand how the utmost noblenesses of art are concerned in this minute work to which i have set you in your beginning of it for it is only by the closest attention and the most noble execution that it is possible to express these varieties of individual character on which all excellence of portraiture depends whether of masses of mankind or of groups of leaves  137 now you will be able to understand among other matters wherein consists the excellence and wherein the shortcoming of the treedrawing of harding it is excellent in so far as it fondly observes with more truth than any other work of the kind the great laws of growth and action in trees it failsand observe not in a minor but in the principal pointbecause it cannot rightly render any one individual detail or incident of foliage and in this it fails not from mere carelessness or incompletion but of necessity the true drawing of detail being for evermore impossible to a hand which has contracted a habit of execution the noble draughtsman draws a leaf and stops and says calmlythat leaf is of such and such a character i will give him a friend who will entirely suit him then he considers what his friend ought to be and having determined he draws his friend this process may be as quick as lightning when the master is greatone of the sons of the giants or it may be slow and timid but the process is always gone through no touch or form is ever added to another by a good painter without a mental determination and affirmation but when the hand has got into a habit leaf no 1 necessitates leaf no 2 you cannot stop your hand is as a horse with the bit in its teeth or rather is for the time a machine throwing out leaves to order and pattern all alike you must stop that hand of yours however painfully make it understand that it is not to have its own way any more that it shall never more slip from one touch to another without orders otherwise it is not you who are the master but your fingers you may therefore study hardings drawing and take pleasure in it33 and you may properly admire the dexterity which applies the habit of the hand so well and produces results on the whole so satisfactory but you must never copy it otherwise your progress will be at once arrested the utmost you can ever hope to do would be a sketch in hardings manner but of far inferior dexterity for he has given his lifes toil to gain his dexterity and you i suppose have other things to work at besides drawing you would also incapacitate yourself from ever understanding what truly great work was or what nature was but by the earnest and complete study of facts you will gradually come to understand the one and love the other more and more whether you can draw well yourself or not  138 i have yet to say a few words respecting the third law above stated that of mystery the law namely that nothing is ever seen perfectly but only by fragments and under various conditions of obscurity34 this last fact renders the visible objects of nature complete as a type of the human nature we have observe first subordination secondly individuality lastly and this not the least essential character incomprehensibility a perpetual lesson in every serrated point and shining vein which escapes or deceives our sight among the forest leaves how little we may hope to discern clearly or judge justly the rents and veins of the human heart how much of all that is round us in mens actions or spirits which we at first think we understand a closer and more loving watchfulness would show to be full of mystery never to be either fathomed or withdrawn  illustration fig 26  139 the expression of this final character in landscape has never been completely reached by any except turner nor can you hope to reach it at all until you have given much time to the practice of art only try always when you are sketching any object with a view to completion in light and shade to draw only those parts of it which you really see definitely preparing for the after development of the forms by chiaroscuro it is this preparation by isolated touches for a future arrangement of superimposed light and shade which renders the etchings of the liber studiorum so inestimable as examples and so peculiar the character exists more or less in them exactly in proportion to the pains that turner has taken thus the √Üsacus and hesperie was wrought out with the greatest possible care and the principal branch on the near tree is etched as in fig 26 the work looks at first like a scholars instead of a masters but when the light and shade are added every touch falls into its place and a perfect expression of grace and complexity results nay even before the light and shade are added you ought to be able to see that these irregular and broken lines especially where the expression is given of the way the stem loses itself in the leaves are more true than the monotonous though graceful leafdrawing which before turners time had been employed even by the best masters in their distant masses fig 27 is sufficiently characteristic of the manner of the old woodcuts after titian in which you see the leaves are too much of one shape like bunches of fruit and the boughs too completely seen besides being somewhat soft and leathery in aspect owing to the want of angles in their outline by great men like titian this somewhat conventional structure was only given in haste to distant masses and their exquisite delineation of the foreground kept their conventionalism from degeneracy but in the drawings of the carracci and other derivative masters the conventionalism prevails everywhere and sinks gradually into scrawled work like fig 28 about the worst which it is possible to get into the habit of using though an ignorant person might perhaps suppose it more free and therefore better than fig 26 note also that in noble outline drawing it does not follow that a bough is wrongly drawn because it looks contracted unnaturally somewhere as in fig 26 just above the foliage very often the muscular action which is to be expressed by the line runs into the middle of the branch and the actual outline of the branch at that place may be dimly seen or not at all and it is then only by the future shade that its actual shape or the cause of its disappearance will be indicated  illustration fig 27  140 one point more remains to be noted about trees and i have done in the minds of our ordinary watercolor artists a distant tree seems only to be conceived as a flat green blot grouping pleasantly with other masses and giving cool color to the landscape but differing no wise in texture from the blots of other shapes which these painters use to express stones or water or figures but as soon as you have drawn trees carefully a little while you will be impressed and impressed more strongly the better you draw them with the idea of their softness of surface a distant tree is not a flat and even piece of color but a more or less globular mass of a downy or bloomy texture partly passing into a misty vagueness i find practically this lovely softness of faraway trees the most difficult of all characters to reach because it cannot be got by mere scratching or roughening the surface but is always associated with such delicate expressions of form and growth as are only imitable by very careful drawing the penknife passed lightly over this careful drawing will do a good deal but you must accustom yourself from the beginning to aim much at this softness in the lines of the drawing itself by crossing them delicately and more or less effacing and confusing the edges you must invent according to the character of tree various modes of execution adapted to express its texture but always keep this character of softness in your mind and in your scope of aim for in most landscapes it is the intention of nature that the tenderness and transparent infinitude of her foliage should be felt even at the far distance in the most distinct opposition to the solid masses and flat surfaces of rocks or buildings  illustration fig 28  141 ii we were in the second place to consider a little the modes of representing water of which important feature of landscape i have hardly said anything yet  water is expressed in common drawings by conventional lines whose horizontality is supposed to convey the idea of its surface in paintings white dashes or bars of light are used for the same purpose  but these and all other such expedients are vain and absurd a piece of calm water always contains a picture in itself an exquisite reflection of the objects above it if you give the time necessary to draw these reflections disturbing them here and there as you see the breeze or current disturb them you will get the effect of the water but if you have not patience to draw the reflections no expedient will give you a true effect the picture in the pool needs nearly as much delicate drawing as the picture above the pool except only that if there be the least motion on the water the horizontal lines of the images will be diffused and broken while the vertical ones will remain decisive and the oblique ones decisive in proportion to their steepness  142 a few close studies will soon teach you this the only thing you need to be told is to watch carefully the lines of disturbance on the surface as when a bird swims across it or a fish rises or the current plays round a stone reed or other obstacle take the greatest pains to get the curves of these lines true the whole value of your careful drawing of the reflections may be lost by your admitting a single false curve of ripple from a wild ducks breast and as in other subjects if you are dissatisfied with your result always try for more unity and delicacy if your reflections are only soft and gradated enough they are nearly sure to give you a pleasant effect35 when you are taking pains work the softer reflections where they are drawn out by motion in the water with touches as nearly horizontal as may be but when you are in a hurry indicate the place and play of the images with vertical lines the actual construction of a calm elongated reflection is with horizontal lines but it is often impossible to draw the descending shades delicately enough with a horizontal touch and it is best always when you are in a hurry and sometimes when you are not to use the vertical touch when the ripples are large the reflections become shaken and must be drawn with bold undulatory descending lines  143 i need not i should think tell you that it is of the greatest possible importance to draw the curves of the shore rightly their perspective is if not more subtle at least more stringent than that of any other lines in nature it will not be detected by the general observer if you miss the curve of a branch or the sweep of a cloud or the perspective of a building36 but every intelligent spectator will feel the difference between a rightlydrawn bend of shore or shingle and a false one absolutely right in difficult river perspectives seen from heights i believe no one but turner ever has been yet and observe there is no rule for them to develop the curve mathematically would require a knowledge of the exact quantity of water in the river the shape of its bed and the hardness of the rock or shore and even with these data the problem would be one which no mathematician could solve but approximatively the instinct of the eye can do it nothing else  144 if after a little study from nature you get puzzled by the great differences between the aspect of the reflected image and that of the object casting it and if you wish to know the law of reflection it is simply this suppose all the objects above the water actually reversed not in appearance but in fact beneath the water and precisely the same in form and in relative position only all topsyturvy then whatever you could see from the place in which you stand of the solid objects so reversed under the water you will see in the reflection always in the true perspective of the solid objects so reversed  if you cannot quite understand this in looking at water take a mirror lay it horizontally on the table put some books and papers upon it and draw them and their reflections moving them about and watching how their reflections alter and chiefly how their reflected colors and shades differ from their own colors and shades by being brought into other oppositions this difference in chiaroscuro is a more important character in waterpainting than mere difference in form  145 when you are drawing shallow or muddy water you will see shadows on the bottom or on the surface continually modifying the reflections and in a clear mountain stream the most wonderful complications of effect resulting from the shadows and reflections of the stones in it mingling with the aspect of the stones themselves seen through the water do not be frightened at the complexity but on the other hand do not hope to render it hastily look at it well making out everything that you see and distinguishing each component part of the effect there will be first the stones seen through the water distorted always by refraction so that if the general structure of the stone shows straight parallel lines above the water you may be sure they will be bent where they enter it then the reflection of the part of the stone above the water crosses and interferes with the part that is seen through it so that you can hardly tell which is which and wherever the reflection is darkest you will see through the water best37 and vice vers√¢ then the real shadow of the stone crosses both these images and where that shadow falls it makes the water more reflective and where the sunshine falls you will see more of the surface of the water and of any dust or motes that may be floating on it but whether you are to see at the same spot most of the bottom of the water or of the reflection of the objects above depends on the position of the eye the more you look down into the water the better you see objects through it the more you look along it the eye being low the more you see the reflection of objects above it hence the color of a given space of surface in a stream will entirely change while you stand still in the same spot merely as you stoop or raise your head and thus the colors with which water is painted are an indication of the position of the spectator and connected inseparably with the perspective of the shores the most beautiful of all results that i know in mountain streams is when the water is shallow and the stones at the bottom are rich reddishorange and black and the water is seen at an angle which exactly divides the visible colors between those of the stones and that of the sky and the sky is of clear full blue the resulting purple obtained by the blending of the blue and the orangered broken by the play of innumerable gradations in the stones is indescribably lovely  146 all this seems complicated enough already but if there be a strong color in the clear water itself as of green or blue in the swiss lakes all these phenomena are doubly involved for the darker reflections now become of the color of the water the reflection of a black gondola for instance at venice is never black but pure dark green and farther the color of the water itself is of three kinds one seen on the surface is a kind of milky bloom the next is seen where the waves let light through them at their edges and the third shown as a change of color on the objects seen through the water thus the same wave that makes a white object look of a clear blue when seen through it will take a red or violetcolored bloom on its surface and will be made pure emerald green by transmitted sunshine through its edges with all this however you are not much concerned at present but i tell it you partly as a preparation for what we have afterwards to say about color and partly that you may approach lakes and streams with reverence38 and study them as carefully as other things not hoping to express them by a few horizontal dashes of white or a few tremulous blots39 not but that much may be done by tremulous blots when you know precisely what you mean by them as you will see by many of the turner sketches which are now framed at the national gallery but you must have painted water many and many a dayyes and all day longbefore you can hope to do anything like those  147 iii lastly you may perhaps wonder why before passing to the clouds i say nothing special about ground40 but there is too much to be said about that to admit of my saying it here you will find the principal laws of its structure examined at length in the fourth volume of modern painters and if you can get that volume and copy carefully plate 21 which i have etched after turner with great pains it will give you as much help as you need in the linear expression of groundsurface strive to get the retirement and succession of masses in irregular ground much may be done in this way by careful watching of the perspective diminutions of its herbage as well as by contour and much also by shadows if you draw the shadows of leaves and tree trunks on any undulating ground with entire carefulness you will be surprised to find how much they explain of the form and distance of the earth on which they fall  148 passing then to skies note that there is this great peculiarity about sky subject as distinguished from earth subjectthat the clouds not being much liable to mans interference are always beautifully arranged you cannot be sure of this in any other features of landscape the rock on which the effect of a mountain scene especially depends is always precisely that which the roadmaker blasts or the landlord quarries and the spot of green which nature left with a special purpose by her dark forest sides and finished with her most delicate grasses is always that which the farmer plows or builds upon but the clouds though we can hide them with smoke and mix them with poison cannot be quarried nor built over and they are always therefore gloriously arranged so gloriously that unless you have notable powers of memory you need not hope to approach the effect of any sky that interests you for both its grace and its glow depend upon the united influence of every cloud within its compass they all move and burn together in a marvelous harmony not a cloud of them is out of its appointed place or fails of its part in the choir and if you are not able to recollect which in the case of a complicated sky it is impossible you should precisely the form and position of all the clouds at a given moment you cannot draw the sky at all for the clouds will not fit if you draw one part of them three or four minutes before another  149 you must try therefore to help what memory you have by sketching at the utmost possible speed the whole range of the clouds marking by any shorthand or symbolic work you can hit upon the peculiar character of each as transparent or fleecy or linear or undulatory giving afterwards such completion to the parts as your recollection will enable you to do this however only when the sky is interesting from its general aspect at other times do not try to draw all the sky but a single cloud sometimes a round cumulus will stay five or six minutes quite steady enough to let you mark out his principal masses and one or two white or crimson lines which cross the sunrise will often stay without serious change for as long and in order to be the readier in drawing them practice occasionally drawing lumps of cotton which will teach you better than any other stable thing the kind of softness there is in clouds for you will find when you have made a few genuine studies of sky and then look at any ancient or modern painting that ordinary artists have always fallen into one of two faults either in rounding the clouds they make them as solid and hardedged as a heap of stones tied up in a sack or they represent them not as rounded at all but as vague wreaths of mist or flat lights in the sky and think they have done enough in leaving a little white paper between dashes of blue or in taking an irregular space out with the sponge now clouds are not as solid as floursacks but on the other hand they are neither spongy nor flat they are definite and very beautiful forms of sculptured mist sculptured is a perfectly accurate word they are not more drifted into form than they are carved into form the warm air around them cutting them into shape by absorbing the visible vapor beyond certain limits hence their angular and fantastic outlines as different from a swollen spherical or globular formation on the one hand as from that of flat films or shapeless mists on the other and the worst of all is that while these forms are difficult enough to draw on any terms especially considering that they never stay quiet they must be drawn also at greater disadvantage of light and shade than any others the force of light in clouds being wholly unattainable by art so that if we put shade enough to express their form as positively as it is expressed in reality we must make them painfully too dark on the dark sides nevertheless they are so beautiful if you in the least succeed with them that you will hardly i think lose courage  150 outline them often with the pen as you can catch them here and there one of the chief uses of doing this will be not so much the memorandum so obtained as the lesson you will get respecting the softness of the cloudoutlines you will always find yourself at a loss to see where the outline really is and when drawn it will always look hard and false and will assuredly be either too round or too square however often you alter it merely passing from the one fault to the other and back again the real cloud striking an inexpressible mean between roundness and squareness in all its coils or battlements i speak at present of course only of the cumulus cloud the lighter wreaths and flakes of the upper sky cannot be outlinedthey can only be sketched like locks of hair by many lines of the pen firmly developed bars of cloud on the horizon are in general easy enough and may be drawn with decision when you have thus accustomed yourself a little to the placing and action of clouds try to work out their light and shade just as carefully as you do that of other things looking exclusively for examples of treatment to the vignettes in rogerss italy and poems and to the liber studiorum unless you have access to some examples of turners own work no other artist ever yet drew the sky even titians clouds and tintorets are conventional the clouds in the ben arthur source of arveron and calais pier are among the best of turners storm studies and of the upper clouds the vignettes to rogerss poems furnish as many examples as you need  151 and now as our first lesson was taken from the sky so for the present let our last be i do not advise you to be in any haste to master the contents of my next letter if you have any real talent for drawing you will take delight in the discoveries of natural loveliness which the studies i have already proposed will lead you into among the fields and hills and be assured that the more quietly and singleheartedly you take each step in the art the quicker on the whole will your progress be i would rather indeed have discussed the subjects of the following letter at greater length and in a separate work addressed to more advanced students but as there are one or two things to be said on composition which may set the young artists mind somewhat more at rest or furnish him with defense from the urgency of illadvisers i will glance over the main heads of the matter here trusting that my doing so may not beguile you my dear reader from your serious work or lead you to think me in occupying part of this book with talk not altogether relevant to it less entirely or                                             faithfully yours                                                           j ruskin   footnotes    23 it is meant i believe for salt

drawingmaster in itself     alone for it is not only equivalent to a penandink drawing by     turner but to a very careful one only observe the source of     arveron raglan and dumblane were not etched by turner and the     etchings of those three are not good for separate study though it     is deeply interesting to see how turner apparently provoked at the     failure of the beginnings in the arveron and raglan took the plates     up himself and either conquered or brought into use the bad etching     by his marvelous engraving the dumblane was however well etched     by mr lupton and beautifully engraved by him the finest turner     etching is of an aqueduct with a stork standing in a mountain     stream not in the published series and next to it are the     unpublished etchings of the via mala and crowhurst turner seems to     have been so fond of these plates that he kept retouching and     finishing them and never made up his mind to let them go the via     mala is certainly in the state in which turner left it the finest     of the whole series its etching is as i said the best after that     of the aqueduct figure 20 above is part of another fine     unpublished etching windsor from salt hill of the published     etchings the finest are the ben arthur √Üsacus cephalus and stone     pines with the girl washing at a cistern the three latter are the

on    27 the impressions vary so much in color that no brown can be     specified    28 you had better get such a photograph even though you have a     liber print as well    29 see the closing letter in this volume    30 in 1857    31 if you are not acquainted with hardings works an unlikely     supposition considering their popularity and cannot meet with the     one in question the diagrams given here will enable you to     understand all that is needful for our purposes    32 i draw this figure a young shoot of oak in outline only it     being impossible to express the refinements of shade in distant     foliage in a woodcut    33 his lithographic sketches those for instance in the park and     the forest and his various lessons on foliage possess greater     merit than the more ambitious engravings in his principles and     practice of art there are many useful remarks however dispersed     through this latter work    34 on this law you do well if you can get access to it to look     at the fourth chapter of the fourth volume of modern painters    35 see note 3 in appendix i    36 the student may hardly at first believe that the perspective of     buildings is of little consequence but he will find it so     ultimately see the remarks on this point in the preface    37 see note 4 in appendix i    38 see note 5 in appendix i    39 it is a useful piece of study to dissolve some prussian blue in     water so as to make the liquid definitely blue fill a large white     basin with the solution and put anything you like to float on it     or lie in it walnut shells bits of wood leaves of flowers etc     then study the effects of the reflections and of the stems of the     flowers or submerged portions of the floating objects as they     appear through the blue liquid noting especially how as you lower     your head and look along the surface you see the reflections     clearly and how as you raise your head you lose the reflections     and see the submerged stems clearly    40 respecting architectural drawing see the notice of the works     of prout in the appendix     letter iii  on color and composition   152 my dear readerif you have been obedient and have hitherto done all that i have told you i trust it has not been without much subdued remonstrance and some serious vexation for i should be sorry if when you were led by the course of your study to observe closely such things as are beautiful in color you had not longed to paint them and felt considerable difficulty in complying with your restriction to the use of black or blue or gray you ought to love color and to think nothing quite beautiful or perfect without it and if you really do love it for its own sake and are not merely desirous to color because you think painting a finer thing than drawing there is some chance you may color well nevertheless you need not hope ever to produce anything more than pleasant helps to memory or useful and suggestive sketches in color unless you mean to be wholly an artist you may in the time which other vocations leave at your disposal produce finished beautiful and masterly drawings in light and shade but to color well requires your life it cannot be done cheaper the difficulty of doing right is increasednot twofold nor threefold but a thousandfold and moreby the addition of color to your work for the chances are more than a thousand to one against your being right both in form and color with a given touch it is difficult enough to be right in form if you attend to that only but when you have to attend at the same moment to a much more subtle thing than the form the difficulty is strangely increasedand multiplied almost to infinity by this great fact that while form is absolute so that you can say at the moment you draw any line that it is either right or wrong color is wholly relative every hue throughout your work is altered by every touch that you add in other places so that what was warm a minute ago becomes cold when you have put a hotter color in another place and what was in harmony when you left it becomes discordant as you set other colors beside it so that every touch must be laid not with a view to its effect at the time but with a view to its effect in futurity the result upon it of all that is afterwards to be done being previously considered you may easily understand that this being so nothing but the devotion of life and great genius besides can make a colorist  153 but though you cannot produce finished colored drawings of any value you may give yourself much pleasure and be of great use to other people by occasionally sketching with a view to color only and preserving distinct statements of certain color factsas that the harvest moon at rising was of such and such a red and surrounded by clouds of such and such a rosy gray that the mountains at evening were in truth so deep in purple and the waves by the boats side were indeed of that incredible green this only observe if you have an eye for color but you may presume that you have this if you enjoy color  154 and though of course you should always give as much form to your subject as your attention to its color will admit of remember that the whole value of what you are about depends in a colored sketch on the color merely if the color is wrong everything is wrong just as if you are singing and sing false notes it does not matter how true the words are if you sing at all you must sing sweetly and if you color at all you must color rightly give up all the form rather than the slightest part of the color just as if you felt yourself in danger of a false note you would give up the word and sing a meaningless sound if you felt that so you could save the note never mind though your houses are all tumbling downthough your clouds are mere blots and your trees mere knobs and your sun and moon like crooked sixpencesso only that trees clouds houses and sun or moon are of the right colors of course the discipline you have gone through will enable you to hint something of form even in the fastest sweep of the brush but do not let the thought of form hamper you in the least when you begin to make colored memoranda if you want the form of the subject draw it in black and white if you want its color take its color and be sure you have it and not a spurious treacherous halfmeasured piece of mutual concession with the colors all wrong and the forms still anything but right it is best to get into the habit of considering the colored work merely as supplementary to your other studies making your careful drawings of the subject first and then a colored memorandum separately as shapeless as you like but faithful in hue and entirely minding its own business this principle however bears chiefly on large and distant subjects in foregrounds and near studies the color cannot be had without a good deal of definition of form for if you do not map the mosses on the stones accurately you will not have the right quantity of color in each bit of moss pattern and then none of the colors will look right but it always simplifies the work much if you are clear as to your point of aim and satisfied when necessary to fail of all but that  155 now of course if i were to enter into detail respecting coloring which is the beginning and end of a painters craft i should need to make this a work in three volumes instead of three letters and to illustrate it in the costliest way i only hope at present to set you pleasantly and profitably to work leaving you within the tethering of certain leadingstrings to gather what advantages you can from the works of art of which every year brings a greater number within your reachand from the instruction which every year our rising artists will be more ready to give kindly and better able to give wisely  156 and first of materials use hard cake colors not moist colors grind a sufficient quantity of each on your palette every morning keeping a separate plate large and deep for colors to be used in broad washes and wash both plate and palette every evening so as to be able always to get good and pure color when you need it and force yourself into cleanly and orderly habits about your colors the two best colorists of modern times turner and rossetti41 afford us i am sorry to say no confirmation of this precept by their practice turner was and rossetti is as slovenly in all their procedures as men can well be but the result of this was with turner that the colors have altered in all his pictures and in many of his drawings and the result of it with rossetti is that though his colors are safe he has sometimes to throw aside work that was half done and begin over again william hunt of the old watercolor is very neat in his practice so i believe is mulready so is john lewis and so are the leading preraphaelites rossetti only excepted and there can be no doubt about the goodness of the advice if it were only for this reason that the more particular you are about your colors the more you will get into a deliberate and methodical habit in using them and all true speed in coloring comes of this deliberation  157 use chinese white well ground to mix with your colors in order to pale them instead of a quantity of water you will thus be able to shape your masses more quietly and play the colors about with more ease they will not damp your paper so much and you will be able to go on continually and lay forms of passing cloud and other fugitive or delicately shaped lights otherwise unattainable except by time  158 this mixing of white with the pigments so as to render them opaque constitutes bodycolor drawing as opposed to transparentcolor drawing and you will perhaps have it often said to you that this bodycolor is illegitimate it is just as legitimate as oilpainting being so far as handling is concerned the same process only without its uncleanliness its unwholesomeness or its inconvenience for oil will not dry quickly nor carry safely nor give the same effects of atmosphere without tenfold labor and if you hear it said that the bodycolor looks chalky or opaque and as is very likely think so yourself be yet assured of this that though certain effects of glow and transparencies of gloom are not to be reached without transparent color those glows and glooms are not the noblest aim of art after many years study of the various results of fresco and oil painting in italy and of bodycolor and transparent color in england i am now entirely convinced that the greatest things that are to be done in art must be done in dead color the habit of depending on varnish or on lucid tints for transparency makes the painter comparatively lose sight of the nobler translucence which is obtained by breaking various colors amidst each other and even when as by correggio exquisite play of hue is joined with exquisite transparency the delight in the depth almost always leads the painter into mean and false chiaroscuro it leads him to like dark backgrounds instead of luminous ones42 and to enjoy in general quality of color more than grandeur of composition and confined light rather than open sunshine so that the really greatest thoughts of the greatest men have always so far as i remember been reached in dead color and the noblest oil pictures of tintoret and veronese are those which are likest frescoes  159 besides all this the fact is that though sometimes a little chalky and coarselooking bodycolor is in a sketch infinitely liker nature than transparent color the bloom and mist of distance are accurately and instantly represented by the film of opaque blue quite accurately i think by nothing else and for ground rocks and buildings the earthy and solid surface is of course always truer than the most finished and carefully wrought work in transparent tints can ever be  160 against one thing however i must steadily caution you all kinds of color are equally illegitimate if you think they will allow you to alter at your pleasure or blunder at your ease there is no vehicle or method of color which admits of alteration or repentance you must be right at once or never and you might as well hope to catch a rifle bullet in your hand and put it straight when it was going wrong as to recover a tint once spoiled the secret of all good color in oil water or anything else lies primarily in that sentence spoken to me by mulready know what you have to do the process may be a long one perhaps you may have to ground with one color to touch it with fragments of a second to crumble a third into the interstices a fourth into the interstices of the third to glaze the whole with a fifth and to reenforce in points with a sixth but whether you have one or ten or twenty processes to go through you must go straight through them knowingly and foreseeingly all the way and if you get the thing once wrong there is no hope for you but in washing or scraping boldly down to the white ground and beginning again  161 the drawing in bodycolor will tend to teach you all this more than any other method and above all it will prevent you from falling into the pestilent habit of sponging to get texture a trick which has nearly ruined our modern watercolor school of art there are sometimes places in which a skillful artist will roughen his paper a little to get certain conditions of dusty color with more ease than he could otherwise and sometimes a skillfully rased piece of paper will in the midst of transparent tints answer nearly the purpose of chalky bodycolor in representing the surfaces of rocks or building but artifices of this kind are always treacherous in a tyros hands tempting him to trust in them and you had better always work on white or gray paper as smooth as silk43 and never disturb the surface of your color or paper except finally to scratch out the very highest lights if you are using transparent colors  162 i have said above that bodycolor drawing will teach you the use of color better than working with merely transparent tints but this is not because the process is an easier one but because it is a more complete one and also because it involves some working with transparent tints in the best way you are not to think that because you use bodycolor you may make any kind of mess that you like and yet get out of it but you are to avail yourself of the characters of your material which enable you most nearly to imitate the processes of nature thus suppose you have a red rocky cliff to sketch with blue clouds floating over it you paint your cliff first firmly then take your blue mixing it to such a tint and here is a great part of the skill needed that when it is laid over the red in the thickness required for the effect of the mist the warm rockcolor showing through the blue cloudcolor may bring it to exactly the hue you want your upper tint therefore must be mixed colder than you want it then you lay it on varying it as you strike it getting the forms of the mist at once and if it be rightly done with exquisite quality of color from the warm tints showing through and between the particles of the other when it is dry you may add a little color to retouch the edges where they want shape or heighten the lights where they want roundness or put another tone over the whole but you can take none away if you touch or disturb the surface or by any untoward accident mix the under and upper colors together all is lost irrecoverably begin your drawing from the ground again if you like or throw it into the fire if you like but do not waste time in trying to mend it44  163 this discussion of the relative merits of transparent and opaque color has however led us a little beyond the point where we should have begun we must go back to our palette if you please get a cake of each of the hard colors named in the note below45 and try experiments on their simple combinations by mixing each color with every other if you like to do it in an orderly way you may prepare a squared piece of pasteboard and put the pure colors in columns at the top and side the mixed tints being given at the intersections thus the letters standing for colors        b       c      d      e      f     etc     a a b    a c    a d    a e    a f     b      b c    b d    b e    b f     c           c d    c e    c f     d                d e    d f     e                     e f     etc  this will give you some general notion of the characters of mixed tints of two colors only and it is better in practice to confine yourself as much as possible to these and to get more complicated colors either by putting the third over the first blended tint or by putting the third into its interstices nothing but watchful practice will teach you the effects that colors have on each other when thus put over or beside each other  164 when you have got a little used to the principal combinations place yourself at a window which the sun does not shine in at commanding some simple piece of landscape outline this landscape roughly then take a piece of white cardboard cut out a hole in it about the size of a large pea and supposing r is the room a d the window and you are sitting at a fig 29 hold this cardboard a little outside of the window upright and in the direction b d parallel to the side of the window or a little turned so as to catch more light as at a d never turned as at c d or the paper will be dark then you will see the landscape bit by bit through the circular hole match the colors of each important bit as nearly as you can mixing your tints with white beside the aperture when matched put a touch of the same tint at the top of your paper writing under it dark tree color hill color field color as the case may be then wash the tint away from beside the opening and the cardboard will be ready to match another piece of the landscape46 when you have got the colors of the principal masses thus indicated lay on a piece of each in your sketch in its right place and then proceed to complete the sketch in harmony with them by your eye  illustration fig 29  165 in the course of your early experiments you will be much struck by two things the first the inimitable brilliancy of light in sky and in sunlighted things and the second that among the tints which you can imitate those which you thought the darkest will continually turn out to be in reality the lightest darkness of objects is estimated by us under ordinary circumstances much more by knowledge than by sight thus a cedar or scotch fir at 200 yards off will be thought of darker green than an elm or oak near us because we know by experience that the peculiar color they exhibit at that distance is the sign of darkness of foliage but when we try them through the cardboard the near oak will be found indeed rather dark green and the distant cedar perhaps pale graypurple the quantity of purple and gray in nature is by the way another somewhat surprising subject of discovery  166 well having ascertained thus your principal tints you may proceed to fill up your sketch in doing which observe these following particulars  1 many portions of your subject appeared through the aperture in the paper brighter than the paper as sky sunlighted grass etc leave these portions for the present white and proceed with the parts of which you can match the tints  2 as you tried your subject with the cardboard you must have observed how many changes of hue took place over small spaces in filling up your work try to educate your eye to perceive these differences of hue without the help of the cardboard and lay them deliberately like a mosaicworker as separate colors preparing each carefully on your palette and laying it as if it were a patch of colored cloth cut out to be fitted neatly by its edge to the next patch so that the fault of your work may be not a slurred or misty look but a patched bedcover look as if it had all been cut out with scissors for instance in drawing the trunk of a birch tree there will be probably white high lights then a pale rosy gray round them on the light side then a probably greenish deeper gray on the dark side varied by reflected colors and over all rich black strips of bark and brown spots of moss lay first the rosy gray leaving white for the high lights and for the spots of moss and not touching the dark side then lay the gray for the dark side fitting it well up to the rosy gray of the light leaving also in this darker gray the white paper in the places for the black and brown moss then prepare the moss colors separately for each spot and lay each in the white place left for it not one grain of white except that purposely left for the high lights must be visible when the work is done even through a magnifyingglass so cunningly must you fit the edges to each other finally take your background colors and put them on each side of the tree trunk fitting them carefully to its edge  167 fine work you would make of this wouldnt you if you had not learned to draw first and could not now draw a good outline for the stem much less terminate a color mass in the outline you wanted  your work will look very odd for some time when you first begin to paint in this way and before you can modify it as i shall tell you presently how but never mind it is of the greatest possible importance that you should practice this separate laying on of the hues for all good coloring finally depends on it it is indeed often necessary and sometimes desirable to lay one color and form boldly over another thus in laying leaves on blue sky it is impossible always in large pictures or when pressed for time to fill in the blue through the interstices of the leaves and the great venetians constantly lay their blue ground first and then having let it dry strike the golden brown over it in the form of the leaf leaving the under blue to shine through the gold and subdue it to the olivegreen they want but in the most precious and perfect work each leaf is inlaid and the blue worked round it and whether you use one or other mode of getting your result it is equally necessary to be absolute and decisive in your laying the color either your ground must be laid firmly first and then your upper color struck upon it in perfect form forever thenceforward unalterable or else the two colors must be individually put in their places and led up to each other till they meet at their appointed border equally thenceforward unchangeable either process you see involves absolute decision if you once begin to slur or change or sketch or try this way and that with your color it is all over with it and with you you will continually see bad copyists trying to imitate the venetians by daubing their colors about and retouching and finishing and softening when every touch and every added hue only lead them farther into chaos there is a dog between two children in a veronese in the louvre which gives the copyists much employment he has a dark ground behind him which veronese has painted first and then when it was dry or nearly so struck the locks of the dogs white hair over it with some halfdozen curling sweeps of his brush right at once and forever had one line or hair of them gone wrong it would have been wrong forever no retouching could have mended it the poor copyists daub in first some background and then some dogs hair then retouch the background then the hair work for hours at it expecting it always to come right tomorrowwhen it is finished they may work for centuries at it and they will never do it if they can do it with veroneses allowance of work half a dozen sweeps of the hand over the dark background well if not they may ask the dog himself whether it will ever come right and get true answer from himon launces conditions if he say ay it will if he say no it will if he shake his tail and say nothing it will  168 3 whenever you lay on a mass of color be sure that however large it may be or however small it shall be gradated no color exists in nature under ordinary circumstances without gradation if you do not see this it is the fault of your inexperience you will see it in due time if you practice enough but in general you may see it at once in the birch trunk for instance the rosy gray must be gradated by the roundness of the stem till it meets the shaded side similarly the shaded side is gradated by reflected light accordingly whether by adding water or white paint or by unequal force of touch this you will do at pleasure according to the texture you wish to produce you must in every tint you lay on make it a little paler at one part than another and get an even gradation between the two depths this is very like laying down a formal law or recipe for you but you will find it is merely the assertion of a natural fact it is not indeed physically impossible to meet with an ungradated piece of color but it is so supremely improbable that you had better get into the habit of asking yourself invariably when you are going to copy a tintnot is that gradated but which way is that gradated and at least in ninetynine out of a hundred instances you will be able to answer decisively after a careful glance though the gradation may have been so subtle that you did not see it at first and it does not matter how small the touch of color may be though not larger than the smallest pins head if one part of it is not darker than the rest it is a bad touch for it is not merely because the natural fact is so that your color should be gradated the preciousness and pleasantness of the color itself depends more on this than on any other of its qualities for gradation is to colors just what curvature is to lines both being felt to be beautiful by the pure instinct of every human mind and both considered as types expressing the law of gradual change and progress in the human soul itself what the difference is in mere beauty between a gradated and ungradated color may be seen easily by laying an even tint of rosecolor on paper and putting a rose leaf beside it the victorious beauty of the rose as compared with other flowers depends wholly on the delicacy and quantity of its color gradations all other flowers being either less rich in gradation not having so many folds of leaf or less tender being patched and veined instead of flushed  169 4 but observe it is not enough in general that color should be gradated by being made merely paler or darker at one place than another generally color changes as it diminishes and is not merely darker at one spot but also purer at one spot than anywhere else it does not in the least follow that the darkest spots should be the purest still less so that the lightest should be the purest very often the two gradations more or less cross each other one passing in one direction from paleness to darkness another in another direction from purity to dullness but there will almost always be both of them however reconciled and you must never be satisfied with a piece of color until you have got both that is to say every piece of blue that you lay on must be quite blue only at some given spot nor that a large spot and must be gradated from that into less pure bluegrayish blue or greenish blue or purplish blueover all the rest of the space it occupies and this you must do in one of three ways either while the color is wet mix with it the color which is to subdue it adding gradually a little more and a little more or else when the color is quite dry strike a gradated touch of another color over it leaving only a point of the first tint visible or else lay the subduing tints on in small touches as in the exercise of tinting the chessboard of each of these methods i have something to tell you separately but that is distinct from the subject of gradation which i must not quit without once more pressing upon you the pre√´minent necessity of introducing it everywhere i have profound dislike of anything like habit of hand and yet in this one instance i feel almost tempted to encourage you to get into a habit of never touching paper with color without securing a gradation you will not in turners largest oil pictures perhaps six or seven feet long by four or five high find one spot of color as large as a grain of wheat ungradated and you will find in practice that brilliancy of hue and vigor of light and even the aspect of transparency in shade are essentially dependent on this character alone hardness coldness and opacity resulting far more from equality of color than from nature of color give me some mud off a city crossing some ocher out of a gravel pit a little whitening and some coaldust and i will paint you a luminous picture if you give me time to gradate my mud and subdue my dust but though you had the red of the ruby the blue of the gentian snow for the light and amber for the gold you cannot paint a luminous picture if you keep the masses of those colors unbroken in purity and unvarying in depth  170 5 next note the three processes by which gradation and other characters are to be obtained  a mixing while the color is wet  you may be confused by my first telling you to lay on the hues in separate patches and then telling you to mix hues together as you lay them on but the separate masses are to be laid when colors distinctly oppose each other at a given limit the hues to be mixed when they palpitate one through the other or fade one into the other it is better to err a little on the distinct side thus i told you to paint the dark and light sides of the birch trunk separately though in reality the two tints change as the trunk turns away from the light gradually one into the other and after being laid separately on will need some farther touching to harmonize them but they do so in a very narrow space marked distinctly all the way up the trunk and it is easier and safer therefore to keep them separate at first whereas it often happens that the whole beauty of two colors will depend on the one being continued well through the other and playing in the midst of it blue and green often do so in water blue and gray or purple and scarlet in sky in hundreds of such instances the most beautiful and truthful results may be obtained by laying one color into the other while wet judging wisely how far it will spread or blending it with the brush in somewhat thicker consistence of wet bodycolor only observe never mix in this way two mixtures let the color you lay into the other be always a simple not a compound tint  171 b laying one color over another  if you lay on a solid touch of vermilion and after it is quite dry strike a little very wet carmine quickly over it you will obtain a much more brilliant red than by mixing the carmine and vermilion similarly if you lay a dark color first and strike a little blue or white bodycolor lightly over it you will get a more beautiful gray than by mixing the color and the blue or white in very perfect painting artifices of this kind are continually used but i would not have you trust much to them they are apt to make you think too much of quality of color i should like you to depend on little more than the dead colors simply laid on only observe always this that the less color you do the work with the better it will always be47 so that if you had laid a red color and you want a purple one above do not mix the purple on your palette and lay it on so thick as to overpower the red but take a little thin blue from your palette and lay it lightly over the red so as to let the red be seen through and thus produce the required purple and if you want a green hue over a blue one do not lay a quantity of green on the blue but a little yellow and so on always bringing the under color into service as far as you possibly can if however the color beneath is wholly opposed to the one you have to lay on as suppose if green is to be laid over scarlet you must either remove the required parts of the under color daintily first with your knife or with water or else lay solid white over it massively and leave that to dry and then glaze the white with the upper color this is better in general than laying the upper color itself so thick as to conquer the ground which in fact if it be a transparent color you cannot do thus if you have to strike warm boughs and leaves of trees over blue sky and they are too intricate to have their places left for them in laying the blue it is better to lay them first in solid white and then glaze with sienna and ocher than to mix the sienna and white though of course the process is longer and more troublesome nevertheless if the forms of touches required are very delicate the after glazing is impossible you must then mix the warm color thick at once and so use it and this is often necessary for delicate grasses and such other fine threads of light in foreground work  172 c breaking one color in small points through or over another  this is the most important of all processes in good modern48 oil and watercolor painting but you need not hope to attain very great skill in it to do it well is very laborious and requires such skill and delicacy of hand as can only be acquired by unceasing practice but you will find advantage in noting the following points  173 a in distant effects of rich subject wood or rippled water or broken clouds much may be done by touches or crumbling dashes of rather dry color with other colors afterwards put cunningly into the interstices the more you practice this when the subject evidently calls for it the more your eye will enjoy the higher qualities of color the process is in fact the carrying out of the principle of separate colors to the utmost possible refinement using atoms of color in juxtaposition instead of large spaces and note in filling up minute interstices of this kind that if you want the color you fill them with to show brightly it is better to put a rather positive point of it with a little white left beside or round it in the interstice than to put a pale tint of the color over the whole interstice yellow or orange will hardly show if pale in small spaces but they show brightly in firm touches however small with white beside them  174 b if a color is to be darkened by superimposed portions of another it is in many cases better to lay the uppermost color in rather vigorous small touches like finely chopped straw over the under one than to lay it on as a tint for two reasons the first that the play of the two colors together is pleasant to the eye the second that much expression of form may be got by wise administration of the upper dark touches in distant mountains they may be made pines of or broken crags or villages or stones or whatever you choose in clouds they may indicate the direction of the rain the roll and outline of the cloud masses and in water the minor waves all noble effects of dark atmosphere are got in good watercolor drawing by these two expedients interlacing the colors or retouching the lower one with fine darker drawing in an upper sponging and washing for dark atmospheric effect is barbarous and mere tyros work though it is often useful for passages of delicate atmospheric light  175 c when you have time practice the production of mixed tints by interlaced touches of the pure colors out of which they are formed and use the process at the parts of your sketches where you wish to get rich and luscious effects study the works of william hunt of the old watercolor society in this respect continually and make frequent memoranda of the variegations in flowers not painting the flower completely but laying the ground color of one petal and painting the spots on it with studious precision a series of single petals of lilies geraniums tulips etc numbered with proper reference to their position in the flower will be interesting to you on many grounds besides those of art be careful to get the gradated distribution of the spots well followed in the calceolarias foxgloves and the like and work out the odd indefinite hues of the spots themselves with minute grains of pure interlaced color otherwise you will never get their richness or bloom you will be surprised to find as you do this first the universality of the law of gradation we have so much insisted upon secondly that nature is just as economical of her fine colors as i have told you to be of yours you would think by the way she paints that her colors cost her something enormous she will only give you a single pure touch just where the petal turns into light but down in the bell all is subdued and under the petal all is subdued even in the showiest flower what you thought was bright blue is when you look close only dusty gray or green or purple or every color in the world at once only a single gleam or streak of pure blue in the center of it and so with all her colors sometimes i have really thought her miserliness intolerable in a gentian for instance the way she economizes her ultramarine down in the bell is a little too bad49  176 next respecting general tone i said just now that for the sake of students my tax should not be laid on black or on white pigments but if you mean to be a colorist you must lay a tax on them yourself when you begin to use true color that is to say you must use them little and make of them much there is no better test of your color tones being good than your having made the white in your picture precious and the black conspicuous  177 i say first the white precious i do not mean merely glittering or brilliant it is easy to scratch white seagulls out of black clouds and dot clumsy foliage with chalky dew but when white is well managed it ought to be strangely delicioustender as well as brightlike inlaid mother of pearl or white roses washed in milk the eye ought to seek it for rest brilliant though it may be and to feel it as a space of strange heavenly paleness in the midst of the flushing of the colors this effect you can only reach by general depth of middle tint by absolutely refusing to allow any white to exist except where you need it and by keeping the white itself subdued by gray except at a few points of chief luster  178 secondly you must make the black conspicuous however small a point of black may be it ought to catch the eye otherwise your work is too heavy in the shadow all the ordinary shadows should be of some colornever black nor approaching black they should be evidently and always of a luminous nature and the black should look strange among them never occurring except in a black object or in small points indicative of intense shade in the very center of masses of shadow shadows of absolutely negative gray however may be beautifully used with white or with gold but still though the black thus in subdued strength becomes spacious it should always be conspicuous the spectator should notice this gray neutrality with some wonder and enjoy all the more intensely on account of it the gold color and the white which it relieves of all the great colorists velasquez is the greatest master of the black chords his black is more precious than most other peoples crimson  179 it is not however only white and black which you must make valuable you must give rare worth to every color you use but the white and black ought to separate themselves quaintly from the rest while the other colors should be continually passing one into the other being all evidently companions in the same gay world while the white black and neutral gray should stand monkishly aloof in the midst of them you may melt your crimson into purple your purple into blue and your blue into green but you must not melt any of them into black you should however try as i said to give preciousness to all your colors and this especially by never using a grain more than will just do the work and giving each hue the highest value by opposition all fine coloring like fine drawing is delicate and so delicate that if at last you see the color you are putting on you are putting on too much you ought to feel a change wrought in the general tone by touches of color which individually are too pale to be seen and if there is one atom of any color in the whole picture which is unnecessary to it that atom hurts it  180 notice also that nearly all good compound colors are odd colors you shall look at a hue in a good painters work ten minutes before you know what to call it you thought it was brown presently you feel that it is red next that there is somehow yellow in it presently afterwards that there is blue in it if you try to copy it you will always find your color too warm or too coldno color in the box will seem to have an affinity with it and yet it will be as pure as if it were laid at a single touch with a single color  181 as to the choice and harmony of colors in general if you cannot choose and harmonize them by instinct you will never do it at all if you need examples of utterly harsh and horrible color you may find plenty given in treatises upon coloring to illustrate the laws of harmony and if you want to color beautifully color as best pleases yourself at quiet times not so as to catch the eye nor look as if it were clever or difficult to color in that way but so that the color may be pleasant to you when you are happy or thoughtful look much at the morning and evening sky and much at simple flowersdogroses woodhyacinths violets poppies thistles heather and such likeas nature arranges them in the woods and fields if ever any scientific person tells you that two colors are discordant make a note of the two colors and put them together whenever you can i have actually heard people say that blue and green were discordant the two colors which nature seems to intend never to be separated and never to be felt either of them in its full beauty without the othera peacocks neck or a blue sky through green leaves or a blue wave with green lights through it being precisely the loveliest things next to clouds at sunrise in this colored world of ours if you have a good eye for colors you will soon find out how constantly nature puts purple and green together purple and scarlet green and blue yellow and neutral gray and the like and how she strikes these colorconcords for general tones and then works into them with innumerable subordinate ones and you will gradually come to like what she does and find out new and beautiful chords of color in her work every day if you enjoy them depend upon it you will paint them to a certain point right or at least if you do not enjoy them you are certain to paint them wrong if color does not give you intense pleasure let it alone depend upon it you are only tormenting the eyes and senses of people who feel color whenever you touch it and that is unkind and improper  182 you will find also your power of coloring depend much on your state of health and right balance of mind when you are fatigued or ill you will not see colors well and when you are illtempered you will not choose them well thus though not infallibly a test of character in individuals color power is a great sign of mental health in nations when they are in a state of intellectual decline their coloring always gets dull50 you must also take great care not to be misled by affected talk about colors from people who have not the gift of it numbers are eager and voluble about it who probably never in all their lives received one genuine colorsensation the modern religionists of the school of overbeck are just like people who eat slatepencil and chalk and assure everybody that they are nicer and purer than strawberries and plums  183 take care also never to be misled into any idea that color can help or display form color51 always disguises form and is meant to do so  184 it is a favorite dogma among modern writers on color that warm colors reds and yellows approach or express nearness and cold colors blue and gray retire or express distance so far is this from being the case that no expression of distance in the world is so great as that of the gold and orange in twilight sky colors as such are absolutely inexpressive respecting distance it is their quality as depth delicacy etc which expresses distance not their tint a blue bandbox set on the same shelf with a yellow one will not look an inch farther off but a red or orange cloud in the upper sky will always appear to be beyond a blue cloud close to us as it is in reality it is quite true that in certain objects blue is a sign of distance but that is not because blue is a retiring color but because the mist in the air is blue and therefore any warm color which has not strength of light enough to pierce the mist is lost or subdued in its blue but blue is no more on this account a retiring color than brown is a retiring color because when stones are seen through brown water the deeper they lie the browner they look or than yellow is a retiring color because when objects are seen through a london fog the farther off they are the yellower they look neither blue nor yellow nor red can have as such the smallest power of expressing either nearness or distance they express them only under the peculiar circumstances which render them at the moment or in that place signs of nearness or distance thus vivid orange in an orange is a sign of nearness for if you put the orange a great way off its color will not look so bright but vivid orange in sky is a sign of distance because you cannot get the color of orange in a cloud near you so purple in a violet or a hyacinth is a sign of nearness because the closer you look at them the more purple you see but purple in a mountain is a sign of distance because a mountain close to you is not purple but green or gray it may indeed be generally assumed that a tender or pale color will more or less express distance and a powerful or dark color nearness but even this is not always so heathery hills will usually give a pale and tender purple near and an intense and dark purple far away the rose color of sunset on snow is pale on the snow at your feet deep and full on the snow in the distance and the green of a swiss lake is pale in the clear waves on the beach but intense as an emerald in the sunstreak six miles from shore and in any case when the foreground is in strong light with much water about it or white surface casting intense reflections all its colors may be perfectly delicate pale and faint while the distance when it is in shadow may relieve the whole foreground with intense darks of purple blue green or ultramarine blue so that on the whole it is quite hopeless and absurd to expect any help from laws of a√´rial perspective look for the natural effects and set them down as fully as you can and as faithfully and never alter a color because it wont look in its right place put the color strong if it be strong though far off faint if it be faint though close to you why should you suppose that nature always means you to know exactly how far one thing is from another she certainly intends you always to enjoy her coloring but she does not wish you always to measure her space you would be hard put to it every time you painted the sun setting if you had to express his 95000000 miles of distance in a√´rial perspective  185 there is however i think one law about distance which has some claims to be considered a constant one namely that dullness and heaviness of color are more or less indicative of nearness all distant color is pure color it may not be bright but it is clear and lovely not opaque nor soiled for the air and light coming between us and any earthy or imperfect color purify or harmonize it hence a bad colorist is peculiarly incapable of expressing distance i do not of course mean that you are to use bad colors in your foreground by way of making it come forward but only that a failure in color there will not put it out of its place while a failure in color in the distance will at once do away with its remoteness your dullcolored foreground will still be a foreground though illpainted but your illpainted distance will not be merely a dull distanceit will be no distance at all  186 i have only one thing more to advise you namely never to color petulantly or hurriedly you will not indeed be able if you attend properly to your coloring to get anything like the quantity of form you could in a chiaroscuro sketch nevertheless if you do not dash or rush at your work nor do it lazily you may always get enough form to be satisfactory an extra quarter of an hour distributed in quietness over the course of the whole study may just make the difference between a quite intelligible drawing and a slovenly and obscure one if you determine well beforehand what outline each piece of color is to have and when it is on the paper guide it without nervousness as far as you can into the form required and then after it is dry consider thoroughly what touches are needed to complete it before laying one of them on you will be surprised to find how masterly the work will soon look as compared with a hurried or illconsidered sketch in no process that i know ofleast of all in sketchingcan time be really gained by precipitation it is gained only by caution and gained in all sorts of ways for not only truth of form but force of light is always added by an intelligent and shapely laying of the shadow colors you may often make a simple flat tint rightly gradated and edged express a complicated piece of subject without a single retouch the two swiss cottages for instance with their balconies and glittering windows and general character of shingly eaves are expressed in fig 30 with one tint of gray and a few dispersed spots and lines of it all of which you ought to be able to lay on without more than thrice dipping your brush and without a single touch after the tint is dry  illustration fig 30  187 here then for i cannot without colored illustrations tell you more i must leave you to follow out the subject for yourself with such help as you may receive from the watercolor drawings accessible to you or from any of the little treatises on their art which have been published lately by our watercolor painters52 but do not trust much to works of this kind you may get valuable hints from them as to mixture of colors and here and there you will find a useful artifice or process explained but nearly all such books are written only to help idle amateurs to a meretricious skill and they are full of precepts and principles which may for the most part be interpreted by their precise negatives and then acted upon with advantage most of them praise boldness when the only safe attendant spirit of a beginner is cautionadvise velocity when the first condition of success is deliberationand plead for generalization when all the foundations of power must be laid in knowledge of speciality                                      188 and now in the last place i have a few things to tell you respecting that dangerous nobleness of consummate artcomposition for though it is quite unnecessary for you yet awhile to attempt it and it may be inexpedient for you to attempt it at all you ought to know what it means and to look for and enjoy it in the art of others  composition means literally and simply putting several things together so as to make one thing out of them the nature and goodness of which they all have a share in producing thus a musician composes an air by putting notes together in certain relations a poet composes a poem by putting thoughts and words in pleasant order and a painter a picture by putting thoughts forms and colors in pleasant order  in all these cases observe an intended unity must be the result of composition a pavior cannot be said to compose the heap of stones which he empties from his cart nor the sower the handful of seed which he scatters from his hand it is the essence of composition that everything should be in a determined place perform an intended part and act in that part advantageously for everything that is connected with it  189 composition understood in this pure sense is the type in the arts of mankind of the providential government of the world53 it is an exhibition in the order given to notes or colors or forms of the advantage of perfect fellowship discipline and contentment in a wellcomposed air no note however short or low can be spared but the least is as necessary as the greatest no note however prolonged is tedious but the others prepare for and are benefited by its duration no note however high is tyrannous the others prepare for and are benefited by its exaltation no note however low is overpowered the others prepare for and sympathize with its humility and the result is that each and every note has a value in the position assigned to it which by itself it never possessed and of which by separation from the others it would instantly be deprived  190 similarly in a good poem each word and thought enhances the value of those which precede and follow it and every syllable has a loveliness which depends not so much on its abstract sound as on its position look at the same word in a dictionary and you will hardly recognize it  much more in a great picture every line and color is so arranged as to advantage the rest none are inessential however slight and none are independent however forcible it is not enough that they truly represent natural objects but they must fit into certain places and gather into certain harmonious groups so that for instance the red chimney of a cottage is not merely set in its place as a chimney but that it may affect in a certain way pleasurable to the eye the pieces of green or blue in other parts of the picture and we ought to see that the work is masterly merely by the positions and quantities of these patches of green red and blue even at a distance which renders it perfectly impossible to determine what the colors represent or to see whether the red is a chimney or an old womans cloak and whether the blue is smoke sky or water  191 it seems to be appointed in order to remind us in all we do of the great laws of divine government and human polity that composition in the arts should strongly affect every order of mind however unlearned or thoughtless hence the popular delight in rhythm and meter and in simple musical melodies but it is also appointed that power of composition in the fine arts should be an exclusive attribute of great intellect all men can more or less copy what they see and more or less remember it powers of reflection and investigation are also common to us all so that the decision of inferiority in these rests only on questions of degree a has a better memory than b and c reflects more profoundly than d but the gift of composition is not given at all to more than one man in a thousand in its highest range it does not occur above three or four times in a century  192 it follows from these general truths that it is impossible to give rules which will enable you to compose you might much more easily receive rules to enable you to be witty if it were possible to be witty by rule wit would cease to be either admirable or amusing if it were possible to compose melody by rule mozart and cimarosa need not have been born if it were possible to compose pictures by rule titian and veronese would be ordinary men the essence of composition lies precisely in the fact of its being unteachable in its being the operation of an individual mind of range and power exalted above others  but though no one can invent by rule there are some simple laws of arrangement which it is well for you to know because though they will not enable you to produce a good picture they will often assist you to set forth what goodness may be in your work in a more telling way than you could have done otherwise and by tracing them in the work of good composers you may better understand the grasp of their imagination and the power it possesses over their materials i shall briefly state the chief of these laws   1 the law of principality  193 the great object of composition being always to secure unity that is to make out of many things one whole the first mode in which this can be effected is by determining that one feature shall be more important than all the rest and that the others shall group with it in subordinate positions  illustration fig 31  this is the simplest law of ordinary ornamentation thus the group of two leaves a fig 31 is unsatisfactory because it has no leading leaf but that at b is prettier because it has a head or master leaf and c more satisfactory still because the subordination of the other members to this head leaf is made more manifest by their gradual loss of size as they fall back from it hence part of the pleasure we have in the greek honeysuckle ornament and such others  194 thus also good pictures have always one light larger and brighter than the other lights or one figure more prominent than the other figures or one mass of color dominant over all the other masses and in general you will find it much benefit your sketch if you manage that there shall be one light on the cottage wall or one blue cloud in the sky which may attract the eye as leading light or leading gloom above all others but the observance of the rule is often so cunningly concealed by the great composers that its force is hardly at first traceable and you will generally find they are vulgar pictures in which the law is strikingly manifest  195 this may be simply illustrated by musical melody for instance in such phrases as this  illustration  one note here the upper g rules the whole passage and has the full energy of it concentrated in itself such passages corresponding to completely subordinated compositions in painting are apt to be wearisome if often repeated but in such a phrase as this  illustration  it is very difficult to say which is the principal note the a in the last bar is slightly dominant but there is a very equal current of power running through the whole and such passages rarely weary and this principle holds through vast scales of arrangement so that in the grandest compositions such as paul veroneses marriage in cana or raphaels disputa it is not easy to fix at once on the principal figure and very commonly the figure which is really chief does not catch the eye at first but is gradually felt to be more and more conspicuous as we gaze thus in titians grand composition of the cornaro family the figure meant to be principal is a youth of fifteen or sixteen whose portrait it was evidently the painters object to make as interesting as possible but a grand madonna and a st george with a drifting banner and many figures more occupy the center of the picture and first catch the eye little by little we are led away from them to a gleam of pearly light in the lower corner and find that from the head which it shines upon we can turn our eyes no more  196 as in every good picture nearly all laws of design are more or less exemplified it will on the whole be an easier way of explaining them to analyze one composition thoroughly than to give instances from various works i shall therefore take one of turners simplest which will allow us so to speak easily to decompose it and illustrate each law by it as we proceed  illustration fig 32  fig 32 is a rude sketch of the arrangement of the whole subject the old bridge over the moselle at coblentz the town of coblentz on the right ehrenbreitstein on the left the leading or master feature is of course the tower on the bridge it is kept from being too principal by an important group on each side of it the boats on the right and ehrenbreitstein beyond the boats are large in mass and more forcible in color but they are broken into small divisions while the tower is simple and therefore it still leads ehrenbreitstein is noble in its mass but so reduced by a√´rial perspective of color that it cannot contend with the tower which therefore holds the eye and becomes the key of the picture we shall see presently how the very objects which seem at first to contend with it for the mastery are made occultly to increase its pre√´minence   2 the law of repetition  197 another important means of expressing unity is to mark some kind of sympathy among the different objects and perhaps the pleasantest because most surprising kind of sympathy is when one group imitates or repeats another not in the way of balance or symmetry but subordinately like a faraway and broken echo of it prout has insisted much on this law in all his writings on composition and i think it is even more authoritatively present in the minds of most great composers than the law of principality54 it is quite curious to see the pains that turner sometimes takes to echo an important passage of color in the pembroke castle for instance there are two fishingboats one with a red and another with a white sail in a line with them on the beach are two fish in precisely the same relative positions one red and one white it is observable that he uses the artifice chiefly in pictures where he wishes to obtain an expression of repose in my notice of the plate of scarborough in the series of the harbors of england i have already had occasion to dwell on this point and i extract in the note55 one or two sentences which explain the principle in the composition i have chosen for our illustration this reduplication is employed to a singular extent the tower or leading feature is first repeated by the low echo of it to the left put your finger over this lower tower and see how the picture is spoiled then the spires of coblentz are all arranged in couples how they are arranged in reality does not matter when we are composing a great picture we must play the towers about till they come right as fearlessly as if they were chessmen instead of cathedrals the dual arrangement of these towers would have been too easily seen were it not for the little one which pretends to make a triad of the last group on the right but is so faint as hardly to be discernible it just takes off the attention from the artifice helped in doing so by the mast at the head of the boat which however has instantly its own duplicate put at the stern56 then there is the large boat near and its echo beyond it that echo is divided into two again and each of those two smaller boats has two figures in it while two figures are also sitting together on the great rudder that lies half in the water and half aground then finally the great mass of ehrenbreitstein which appears at first to have no answering form has almost its facsimile in the bank on which the girl is sitting this bank is as absolutely essential to the completion of the picture as any object in the whole series all this is done to deepen the effect of repose  198 symmetry or the balance of parts or masses in nearly equal opposition is one of the conditions of treatment under the law of repetition for the opposition in a symmetrical object is of like things reflecting each other it is not the balance of contrary natures like that of day and night but of like natures or like forms one side of a leaf being set like the reflection of the other in water  symmetry in nature is however never formal nor accurate she takes the greatest care to secure some difference between the corresponding things or parts of things and an approximation to accurate symmetry is only permitted in animals because their motions secure perpetual difference between the balancing parts stand before a mirror hold your arms in precisely the same position at each side your head upright your body straight divide your hair exactly in the middle and get it as nearly as you can into exactly the same shape over each ear and you will see the effect of accurate symmetry you will see no less how all grace and power in the human form result from the interference of motion and life with symmetry and from the reconciliation of its balance with its changefulness your position as seen in the mirror is the highest type of symmetry as understood by modern architects  199 in many sacred compositions living symmetry the balance of harmonious opposites is one of the profoundest sources of their power almost any works of the early painters angelico perugino giotto etc will furnish you with notable instances of it the madonna of perugino in the national gallery with the angel michael on one side and raphael on the other is as beautiful an example as you can have  in landscape the principle of balance is more or less carried out in proportion to the wish of the painter to express disciplined calmness in bad compositions as in bad architecture it is formal a tree on one side answering a tree on the other but in good compositions as in graceful statues it is always easy and sometimes hardly traceable in the coblentz however you cannot have much difficulty in seeing how the boats on one side of the tower and the figures on the other are set in nearly equal balance the tower as a central mass uniting both   3 the law of continuity  200 another important and pleasurable way of expressing unity is by giving some orderly succession to a number of objects more or less similar and this succession is most interesting when it is connected with some gradual change in the aspect or character of the objects thus the succession of the pillars of a cathedral aisle is most interesting when they retire in perspective becoming more and more obscure in distance so the succession of mountain promontories one behind another on the flanks of a valley so the succession of clouds fading farther and farther towards the horizon each promontory and each cloud being of different shape yet all evidently following in a calm and appointed order if there be no change at all in the shape or size of the objects there is no continuity there is only repetitionmonotony it is the change in shape which suggests the idea of their being individually free and able to escape if they like from the law that rules them and yet submitting to it  illustration fig 33  201 i will leave our chosen illustrative composition for a moment to take up another still more expressive of this law it is one of turners most tender studies a sketch on calais sands at sunset so delicate in the expression of wave and cloud that it is of no use for me to try to reach it with any kind of outline in a woodcut but the rough sketch fig 33 is enough to give an idea of its arrangement the aim of the painter has been to give the intensest expression of repose together with the enchanted lulling monotonous motion of cloud and wave all the clouds are moving in innumerable ranks after the sun meeting towards that point in the horizon where he has set and the tidal waves gain in winding currents upon the sand with that stealthy haste in which they cross each other so quietly at their edges just folding one over another as they meet like a little piece of ruffled silk and leaping up a little as two children kiss and clap their hands and then going on again each in its silent hurry drawing pointed arches on the sand as their thin edges intersect in parting but all this would not have been enough expressed without the line of the old piertimbers black with weeds strained and bent by the storm waves and now seeming to stoop in following one another like dark ghosts escaping slowly from the cruelty of the pursuing sea  202 i need not i hope point out to the reader the illustration of this law of continuance in the subject chosen for our general illustration it was simply that gradual succession of the retiring arches of the bridge which induced turner to paint the subject at all and it was this same principle which led him always to seize on subjects including long bridges wherever he could find them but especially observe unequal bridges having the highest arch at one side rather than at the center there is a reason for this irrespective of general laws of composition and connected with the nature of rivers which i may as well stop a minute to tell you about and let you rest from the study of composition  203 all rivers small or large agree in one character they like to lean a little on one side they cannot bear to have their channels deepest in the middle but will always if they can have one bank to sun themselves upon and another to get cool under one shingly shore to play over where they may be shallow and foolish and childlike and another steep shore under which they can pause and purify themselves and get their strength of waves fully together for due occasion rivers in this way are just like wise men who keep one side of their life for play and another for work and can be brilliant and chattering and transparent when they are at ease and yet take deep counsel on the other side when they set themselves to their main purpose and rivers are just in this divided also like wicked and good men the good rivers have serviceable deep places all along their banks that ships can sail in but the wicked rivers go scooping irregularly under their banks until they get full of strangling eddies which no boat can row over without being twisted against the rocks and pools like wells which no one can get out of but the waterkelpie that lives at the bottom but wicked or good the rivers all agree in having two kinds of sides now the natural way in which a village stonemason therefore throws a bridge over a strong stream is of course to build a great door to let the cat through and little doors to let the kittens through a great arch for the great current to give it room in flood time and little arches for the little currents along the shallow shore this even without any prudential respect for the floods of the great current he would do in simple economy of work and stone for the smaller your arches are the less material you want on their flanks two arches over the same span of river supposing the butments are at the same depth are cheaper than one and that by a great deal so that where the current is shallow the village mason makes his arches many and low as the water gets deeper and it becomes troublesome to build his piers up from the bottom he throws his arches wider at last he comes to the deep stream and as he cannot build at the bottom of that he throws his largest arch over it with a leap and with another little one or so gains the opposite shore of course as arches are wider they must be higher or they will not stand so the roadway must rise as the arches widen and thus we have the general type of bridge with its highest and widest arch towards one side and a train of minor arches running over the flat shore on the other usually a steep bank at the riverside next the large arch always of course a flat shore on the side of the small ones and the bend of the river assuredly concave towards this flat cutting round with a sweep into the steep bank or if there is no steep bank still assuredly cutting into the shore at the steep end of the bridge  now this kind of bridge sympathizing as it does with the spirit of the river and marking the nature of the thing it has to deal with and conquer is the ideal of a bridge and all endeavors to do the thing in a grand engineers manner with a level roadway and equal arches are barbarous not only because all monotonous forms are ugly in themselves but because the mind perceives at once that there has been cost uselessly thrown away for the sake of formality57  illustration fig 34  204 well to return to our continuity we see that the turnerian bridge in fig 32 is of the absolutely perfect type and is still farther interesting by having its main arch crowned by a watchtower but as i want you to note especially what perhaps was not the case in the real bridge but is entirely turners doing you will find that though the arches diminish gradually not one is regularly diminishedthey are all of different shapes and sizes you cannot see this clearly in fig 32 but in the larger diagram fig 34 over leaf you will with ease this is indeed also part of the ideal of a bridge because the lateral currents near the shore are of course irregular in size and a simple builder would naturally vary his arches accordingly and also if the bottom was rocky build his piers where the rocks came but it is not as a part of bridge ideal but as a necessity of all noble composition that this irregularity is introduced by turner it at once raises the object thus treated from the lower or vulgar unity of rigid law to the greater unity of clouds and waves and trees and human souls each different each obedient and each in harmonious service   4 the law of curvature  205 there is however another point to be noticed in this bridge of turners not only does it slope away unequally at its sides but it slopes in a gradual though very subtle curve and if you substitute a straight line for this curve drawing one with a rule from the base of the tower on each side to the ends of the bridge in fig 34 and effacing the curve you will instantly see that the design has suffered grievously you may ascertain by experiment that all beautiful objects whatsoever are thus terminated by delicately curved lines except where the straight line is indispensable to their use or stability and that when a complete system of straight lines throughout the form is necessary to that stability as in crystals the beauty if any exists is in color and transparency not in form cut out the shape of any crystal you like in white wax or wood and put it beside a white lily and you will feel the force of the curvature in its purity irrespective of added color or other interfering elements of beauty  illustration fig 35  206 well as curves are more beautiful than straight lines it is necessary to a good composition that its continuities of object mass or color should be if possible in curves rather than straight lines or angular ones perhaps one of the simplest and prettiest examples of a graceful continuity of this kind is in the line traced at any moment by the corks of a net as it is being drawn nearly every person is more or less attracted by the beauty of the dotted line now it is almost always possible not only to secure such a continuity in the arrangement or boundaries of objects which like these bridge arches or the corks of the net are actually connected with each other butand this is a still more noble and interesting kind of continuityamong features which appear at first entirely separate thus the towers of ehrenbreitstein on the left in fig 32 appear at first independent of each other but when i give their profile on a larger scale fig 35 the reader may easily perceive that there is a subtle cadence and harmony among them the reason of this is that they are all bounded by one grand curve traced by the dotted line out of the seven towers four precisely touch this curve the others only falling hack from it here and there to keep the eye from discovering it too easily  illustration fig 36  207 and it is not only always possible to obtain continuities of this kind it is in drawing large forests or mountain forms essential to truth the towers of ehrenbreitstein might or might not in reality fall into such a curve but assuredly the basalt rock on which they stand did for all mountain forms not cloven into absolute precipice nor covered by straight slopes of shales are more or less governed by these great curves it being one of the aims of nature in all her work to produce them the reader must already know this if he has been able to sketch at all among mountains if not let him merely draw for himself carefully the outlines of any low hills accessible to him where they are tolerably steep or of the woods which grow on them the steeper shore of the thames at maidenhead or any of the downs at brighton or dover or even nearer about croydon as addington hills is easily accessible to a londoner and he will soon find not only how constant but how graceful the curvature is graceful curvature is distinguished from ungraceful by two characters first in its moderation that is to say its close approach to straightness in some part of its course58 and secondly by its variation that is to say its never remaining equal in degree at different parts of its course  208 this variation is itself twofold in all good curves  illustration fig 37  a there is first a steady change through the whole line from less to more curvature or more to less so that no part of the line is a segment of a circle or can be drawn by compasses in any way whatever thus in fig 36 a is a bad curve because it is part of a circle and is therefore monotonous throughout but b is a good curve because it continually changes its direction as it proceeds  illustration fig 38  the first difference between good and bad drawing of tree boughs consists in observance of this fact thus when i put leaves on the line b as in fig 37 you can immediately feel the springiness of character dependent on the changefulness of the curve you may put leaves on the other line for yourself but you will find you cannot make a right tree spray of it for all tree boughs large or small as well as all noble natural lines whatsoever agree in this character and it is a point of primal necessity that your eye should always seize and your hand trace it here are two more portions of good curves with leaves put on them at the extremities instead of the flanks fig 38 and two showing the arrangement of masses of foliage seen a little farther off fig 39 which you may in like manner amuse yourself by turning into segments of circlesyou will see with what result i hope however you have beside you by this time many good studies of tree boughs carefully made in which you may study variations of curvature in their most complicated and lovely forms59  illustration fig 39  illustration fig 40  209 b not only does every good curve vary in general tendency but it is modulated as it proceeds by myriads of subordinate curves thus the outlines of a tree trunk are never as at a fig 40 but as at b so also in waves clouds and all other nobly formed masses thus another essential difference between good and bad drawing or good and bad sculpture depends on the quantity and refinement of minor curvatures carried by good work into the great lines strictly speaking however this is not variation in large curves but composition of large curves out of small ones it is an increase in the quantity of the beautiful element but not a change in its nature   5 the law of radiation  210 we have hitherto been concerned only with the binding of our various objects into beautiful lines or processions the next point we have to consider is how we may unite these lines or processions themselves so as to make groups of them  illustration fig 41  illustration fig 42  now there are two kinds of harmonies of lines one in which moving more or less side by side they variously but evidently with consent retire from or approach each other intersect or oppose each other currents of melody in music for different voices thus approach and cross fall and rise in harmony so the waves of the sea as they approach the shore flow into one another or cross but with a great unity through all and so various lines of composition often flow harmoniously through and across each other in a picture but the most simple and perfect connection of lines is by radiation that is by their all springing from one point or closing towards it and this harmony is often in nature almost always united with the other as the boughs of trees though they intersect and play amongst each other irregularly indicate by their general tendency their origin from one root an essential part of the beauty of all vegetable form is in this radiation it is seen most simply in a single flower or leaf as in a convolvulus bell or chestnut leaf but more beautifully in the complicated arrangements of the large boughs and sprays for a leaf is only a flat piece of radiation but the tree throws its branches on all sides and even in every profile view of it which presents a radiation more or less correspondent to that of its leaves it is more beautiful because varied by the freedom of the separate branches i believe it has been ascertained that in all trees the angle at which in their leaves the lateral ribs are set on their central rib is approximately the same at which the branches leave the great stem and thus each section of the tree would present a kind of magnified view of its own leaf were it not for the interfering force of gravity on the masses of foliage this force in proportion to their age and the lateral leverage upon them bears them downwards at the extremities so that as before noticed the lower the bough grows on the stem the more it droops fig 17 p 67 besides this nearly all beautiful trees have a tendency to divide into two or more principal masses which give a prettier and more complicated symmetry than if one stem ran all the way up the center fig 41 may thus be considered the simplest type of tree radiation as opposed to leaf radiation in this figure however all secondary ramification is unrepresented for the sake of simplicity but if we take one half of such a tree and merely give two secondary branches to each main branch as represented in the general branch structure shown at b fig 18 p 68 we shall have the form fig 42 this i consider the perfect general type of tree structure and it is curiously connected with certain forms of greek byzantine and gothic ornamentation into the discussion of which however we must not enter here it will be observed that both in figs 41 and 42 all the branches so spring from the main stem as very nearly to suggest their united radiation from the root r this is by no means universally the case but if the branches do not bend towards a point in the root they at least converge to some point or other in the examples in fig 43 the mathematical center of curvature a is thus in one case on the ground at some distance from the root and in the other near the top of the tree half only of each tree is given for the sake of clearness fig 44 gives both sides of another example in which the origins of curvature are below the root as the positions of such points may be varied without end and as the arrangement of the lines is also farther complicated by the fact of the boughs springing for the most part in a spiral order round the tree and at proportionate distances the systems of curvature which regulate the form of vegetation are quite infinite infinite is a word easily said and easily written and people do not always mean it when they say it in this case i do mean it the number of systems is incalculable and even to furnish anything like a representative number of types i should have to give several hundreds of figures such as fig 4460  illustration fig 43  illustration fig 44  illustration fig 45  211 thus far however we have only been speaking of the great relations of stem and branches the forms of the branches themselves are regulated by still more subtle laws for they occupy an intermediate position between the form of the tree and of the leaf the leaf has a flat ramification the tree a completely rounded one the bough is neither rounded nor flat but has a structure exactly balanced between the two in a halfflattened halfrounded flake closely resembling in shape one of the thick leaves of an artichoke or the flake of a fir cone by combination forming the solid mass of the tree as the leaves compose the artichoke head i have before pointed out to you the general resemblance of these branch flakes to an extended hand but they may be more accurately represented by the ribs of a boat if you can imagine a very broadheaded and flattened boat applied by its keel to the end of a main branch61 as in fig 45 the lines which its ribs will take supposing them outside of its timbers instead of inside and the general contour of it as seen in different directions from above and below will give you the closest approximation to the perspectives and foreshortenings of a wellgrown branchflake fig 25 above p 89 is an unharmed and unrestrained shoot of healthy young oak and if you compare it with fig 45 you will understand at once the action of the lines of leafage the boat only failing as a type in that its ribs are too nearly parallel to each other at the sides while the bough sends all its ramification well forwards rounding to the head that it may accomplish its part in the outer form of the whole tree yet always securing the compliance with the great universal law that the branches nearest the root bend most back and of course throwing some always back as well as forwards the appearance of reversed action being much increased and rendered more striking and beautiful by perspective fig 25 shows the perspective of such a bough as it is seen from below fig 46 gives rudely the look it would have from above  illustration fig 46  212 you may suppose if you have not already discovered what subtleties of perspective and light and shade are involved in the drawing of these branchflakes as you see them in different directions and actions now raised now depressed touched on the edges by the wind or lifted up and bent back so as to show all the white under surfaces of the leaves shivering in light as the bottom of a boat rises white with spray at the surgecrest or drooping in quietness towards the dew of the grass beneath them in windless mornings or bowed down under oppressive grace of deepcharged snow snow time by the way is one of the best for practice in the placing of tree masses but you will only be able to understand them thoroughly by beginning with a single bough and a few leaves placed tolerably even as in fig 38 p 149 first one with three leaves a central and two lateral ones as at a then with five as at b and so on directing your whole attention to the expression both by contour and light and shade of the boatlike arrangements which in your earlier studies will have been a good deal confused partly owing to your inexperience and partly to the depth of shade or absolute blackness of mass required in those studies  213 one thing more remains to be noted and i will let you out of the wood you see that in every generally representative figure i have surrounded the radiating branches with a dotted line such lines do indeed terminate every vegetable form and you see that they are themselves beautiful curves which according to their flow and the width or narrowness of the spaces they inclose characterize the species of tree or leaf and express its free or formal action its grace of youth or weight of age so that throughout all the freedom of her wildest foliage nature is resolved on expressing an encompassing limit and marking a unity in the whole tree caused not only by the rising of its branches from a common root but by their joining in one work and being bound by a common law and having ascertained this let us turn back for a moment to a point in leaf structure which i doubt not you must already have observed in your earlier studies but which it is well to state here as connected with the unity of the branches in the great trees you must have noticed i should think that whenever a leaf is compoundthat is to say divided into other leaflets which in any way repeat or imitate the form of the whole leafthose leaflets are not symmetrical as the whole leaf is but always smaller on the side towards the point of the great leaf so as to express their subordination to it and show even when they are pulled off that they are not small independent leaves but members of one large leaf  214 fig 47 which is a blockplan of a leaf of columbine without its minor divisions on the edges will illustrate the principle clearly it is composed of a central large mass a and two lateral ones of which the one on the right only is lettered b each of these masses is again composed of three others a central and two lateral ones but observe the minor one a of a is balanced equally by its opposite but the minor b 1 of b is larger than its opposite b 2 again each of these minor masses is divided into three but while the central mass a of a is symmetrically divided the b of b is unsymmetrical its largest sidelobe being lowest again in b 2 the lobe c 1 its lowest lobe in relation to b is larger than c 2 and so also in b 1 so that universally one lobe of a lateral leaf is always larger than the other and the smaller lobe is that which is nearer the central mass the lower leaf as it were by courtesy subduing some of its own dignity or power in the immediate presence of the greater or captain leaf and always expressing therefore its own subordination and secondary character this law is carried out even in single leaves as far as i know the upper half towards the point of the spray is always the smaller and a slightly different curve more convex at the springing is used for the lower side giving an exquisite variety to the form of the whole leaf so that one of the chief elements in the beauty of every subordinate leaf throughout the tree is made to depend on its confession of its own lowliness and subjection  illustration fig 47  215 and now if we bring together in one view the principles we have ascertained in trees we shall find they may be summed under four great laws and that all perfect62 vegetable form is appointed to express these four laws in noble balance of authority  1 support from one living root  2 radiation or tendency of force from some one given point either in the root or in some stated connection with it  3 liberty of each bough to seek its own livelihood and happiness according to its needs by irregularities of action both in its play and its work either stretching out to get its required nourishment from light and rain by finding some sufficient breathingplace among the other branches or knotting and gathering itself up to get strength for any load which its fruitful blossoms may lay upon it and for any stress of its stormtossed luxuriance of leaves or playing hither and thither as the fitful sunshine may tempt its young shoots in their undecided states of mind about their future life  4 imperative requirement of each bough to stop within certain limits expressive of its kindly fellowship and fraternity with the boughs in its neighborhood and to work with them according to its power magnitude and state of health to bring out the general perfectness of the great curve and circumferent stateliness of the whole tree  216 i think i may leave you unhelped to work out the moral analogies of these laws you may perhaps however be a little puzzled to see the meaning of the second one it typically expresses that healthy human actions should spring radiantly like rays from some single heart motive the most beautiful systems of action taking place when this motive lies at the root of the whole life and the action is clearly seen to proceed from it while also many beautiful secondary systems of action taking place from motives not so deep or central but in some beautiful subordinate connection with the central or life motive  the other laws if you think over them you will find equally significative and as you draw trees more and more in their various states of health and hardship you will be every day more struck by the beauty of the types they present of the truths most essential for mankind to know63 and you will see what this vegetation of the earth which is necessary to our life first as purifying the air for us and then as food and just as necessary to our joy in all places of the earthwhat these trees and leaves i say are meant to teach us as we contemplate them and read or hear their lovely language written or spoken for us not in frightful black letters nor in dull sentences but in fair green and shadowy shapes of waving words and blossomed brightness of odoriferous wit and sweet whispers of unintrusive wisdom and playful morality  217 well i am sorry myself to leave the wood whatever my reader may be but leave it we must or we shall compose no more pictures today  this law of radiation then enforcing unison of action in arising from or proceeding to some given point is perhaps of all principles of composition the most influential in producing the beauty of groups of form other laws make them forcible or interesting but this generally is chief in rendering them beautiful in the arrangement of masses in pictures it is constantly obeyed by the great composers but like the law of principality with careful concealment of its imperativeness the point to which the lines of main curvature are directed being very often far away out of the picture sometimes however a system of curves will be employed definitely to exalt by their concurrence the value of some leading object and then the law becomes traceable enough  218 in the instance before us the principal object being as we have seen the tower on the bridge turner has determined that his system of curvature should have its origin in the top of this tower the diagram fig 34 p 145 compared with fig 32 p 137 will show how this is done one curve joins the two towers and is continued by the back of the figure sitting on the bank into the piece of bent timber this is a limiting curve of great importance and turner has drawn a considerable part of it with the edge of the timber very carefully and then led the eye up to the sitting girl by some white spots and indications of a ledge in the bank then the passage to the tops of the towers cannot be missed  219 the next curve is begun and drawn carefully for half an inch of its course by the rudder it is then taken up by the basket and the heads of the figures and leads accurately to the tower angle the gunwales of both the boats begin the next two curves which meet in the same point and all are centralized by the long reflection which continues the vertical lines  220 subordinated to this first system of curves there is another begun by the small crossing bar of wood inserted in the angle behind the rudder continued by the bottom of the bank on which the figure sits interrupted forcibly beyond it64 but taken up again by the waterline leading to the bridge foot and passing on in delicate shadows under the arches not easily shown in so rude a diagram towards the other extremity of the bridge this is a most important curve indicating that the force and sweep of the river have indeed been in old times under the large arches while the antiquity of the bridge is told us by a long tongue of land either of carted rubbish or washed down by some minor stream which has interrupted this curve and is now used as a landingplace for the boats and for embarkation of merchandise of which some bales and bundles are laid in a heap immediately beneath the great tower a common composer would have put these bales to one side or the other but turner knows better he uses them as a foundation for his tower adding to its importance precisely as the sculptured base adorns a pillar and he farther increases the aspect of its height by throwing the reflection of it far down in the nearer water all the great composers have this same feeling about sustaining their vertical masses you will constantly find prout using the artifice most dexterously see for instance the figure with the wheelbarrow under the great tower in the sketch of st nicholas at prague and the white group of figures under the tower in the sketch of augsburg65 and veronese titian and tintoret continually put their principal figures at bases of pillars turner found out their secret very early the most prominent instance of his composition on this principle being the drawing of turin from the superga in hakewells italy i chose fig 20 already given to illustrate foliage drawing chiefly because being another instance of precisely the same arrangement it will serve to convince you of its being intentional there the vertical formed by the larger tree is continued by the figure of the farmer and that of one of the smaller trees by his stick the lines of the interior mass of the bushes radiate under the law of radiation from a point behind the farmers head but their outline curves are carried on and repeated under the law of continuity by the curves of the dog and boyby the way note the remarkable instance in these of the use of darkest lines towards the lightall more or less guiding the eye up to the right in order to bring it finally to the keep of windsor which is the central object of the picture as the bridge tower is in the coblentz the wall on which the boy climbs answers the purpose of contrasting both in direction and character with these greater curves thus corresponding as nearly as possible to the minor tongue of land in the coblentz this however introduces us to another law which we must consider separately   6 the law of contrast  221 of course the character of everything is best manifested by contrast rest can only be enjoyed after labor sound to be heard clearly must rise out of silence light is exhibited by darkness darkness by light and so on in all things now in art every color has an opponent color which if brought near it will relieve it more completely than any other so also every form and line may be made more striking to the eye by an opponent form or line near them a curved line is set off by a straight one a massy form by a slight one and so on and in all good work nearly double the value which any given color or form would have uncombined is given to each by contrast66  in this case again however a too manifest use of the artifice vulgarizes a picture great painters do not commonly or very visibly admit violent contrast they introduce it by stealth and with intermediate links of tender change allowing indeed the opposition to tell upon the mind as a surprise but not as a shock67  222 thus in the rock of ehrenbreitstein fig 35 the main current of the lines being downwards in a convex swell they are suddenly stopped at the lowest tower by a counter series of beds directed nearly straight across them this adverse force sets off and relieves the great curvature but it is reconciled to it by a series of radiating lines below which at first sympathize with the oblique bar then gradually get steeper till they meet and join in the fall of the great curve no passage however intentionally monotonous is ever introduced by a good artist without some slight counter current of this kind so much indeed do the great composers feel the necessity of it that they will even do things purposely ill or unsatisfactorily in order to give greater value to their welldoing in other places in a skillful poets versification the socalled bad or inferior lines are not inferior because he could not do them better but because he feels that if all were equally weighty there would be no real sense of weight anywhere if all were equally melodious the melody itself would be fatiguing and he purposely introduces the laboring or discordant verse that the full ring may be felt in his main sentence and the finished sweetness in his chosen rhythm68 and continually in painting inferior artists destroy their work by giving too much of all that they think is good while the great painter gives just enough to be enjoyed and passes to an opposite kind of enjoyment or to an inferior state of enjoyment he gives a passage of rich involved exquisitely wrought color then passes away into slight and pale and simple color he paints for a minute or two with intense decision then suddenly becomes as the spectator thinks slovenly but he is not slovenly you could not have taken any more decision from him just then you have had as much as is good for you he paints over a great space of his picture forms of the most rounded and melting tenderness and suddenly as you think by a freak gives you a bit as jagged and sharp as a leafless blackthorn perhaps the most exquisite piece of subtle contrast in the world of painting is the arrow point laid sharp against the white side and among the flowing hair of correggios antiope it is quite singular how very little contrast will sometimes serve to make an entire group of forms interesting which would otherwise have been valueless there is a good deal of picturesque material for instance in this top of an old tower fig 48 tiles and stones and sloping roof not disagreeably mingled but all would have been unsatisfactory if there had not happened to be that iron ring on the inner wall which by its vigorous black circular line precisely opposes all the square and angular characters of the battlements and roof draw the tower without the ring and see what a difference it will make  illustration fig 48  223 one of the most important applications of the law of contrast is in association with the law of continuity causing an unexpected but gentle break in a continuous series this artifice is perpetual in music and perpetual also in good illumination the way in which little surprises of change are prepared in any current borders or chains of ornamental design being one of the most subtle characteristics of the work of the good periods we take for instance a bar of ornament between two written columns of an early fourteenth century ms and at the first glance we suppose it to be quite monotonous all the way up composed of a winding tendril with alternately a blue leaf and a scarlet bud presently however we see that in order to observe the law of principality there is one large scarlet leaf instead of a bud nearly halfway up which forms a center to the whole rod and when we begin to examine the order of the leaves we find it varied carefully let a stand for scarlet bud b for blue leaf c for two blue leaves on one stalk s for a stalk without a leaf and r for the large red leaf then counting from the ground the order begins as follows  b b a b s b a b b a b b a and we think we shall have two bs and an a all the way when suddenly it becomes b a b r b a b a b a and we think we are going to have b a continued but no here it becomes b s b s b a b s b s c s b s b s and we think we are surely going to have b s continued but behold it runs away to the end with a quick b b a b b b b69 very often however the designer is satisfied with one surprise but i never saw a good illuminated border without one at least and no series of any kind was ever introduced by a great composer in a painting without a snap somewhere there is a pretty one in turners drawing of rome with the large balustrade for a foreground in the hakewells italy series the single baluster struck out of the line and showing the street below through the gap simply makes the whole composition right when otherwise it would have been stiff and absurd  224 if you look back to fig 48 you will see in the arrangement of the battlements a simple instance of the use of such variation the whole top of the tower though actually three sides of a square strikes the eye as a continuous series of five masses the first two on the left somewhat square and blank then the next two higher and richer the tiles being seen on their slopes both these groups being couples there is enough monotony in the series to make a change pleasant and the last battlement therefore is a little higher than the first twoa little lower than the second twoand different in shape from either hide it with your finger and see how ugly and formal the other four battlements look  225 there are in this figure several other simple illustrations of the laws we have been tracing thus the whole shape of the walls mass being square it is well still for the sake of contrast to oppose it not only by the element of curvature in the ring and lines of the roof below but by that of sharpness hence the pleasure which the eye takes in the projecting point of the roof also because the walls are thick and sturdy it is well to contrast their strength with weakness therefore we enjoy the evident decrepitude of this roof as it sinks between them the whole mass being nearly white we want a contrasting shadow somewhere and get it under our piece of decrepitude this shade with the tiles of the wall below forms another pointed mass necessary to the first by the law of repetition hide this inferior angle with your finger and see how ugly the other looks a sense of the law of symmetry though you might hardly suppose it has some share in the feeling with which you look at the battlements there is a certain pleasure in the opposed slopes of their top on one side down to the left on the other to the right still less would you think the law of radiation had anything to do with the matter but if you take the extreme point of the black shadow on the left for a center and follow first the low curve of the eaves of the wall it will lead you if you continue it to the point of the tower cornice follow the second curve the top of the tiles of the wall and it will strike the top of the righthand battlement then draw a curve from the highest point of the angled battlement on the left through the points of the roof and its dark echo and you will see how the whole top of the tower radiates from this lowest dark point there are other curvatures crossing these main ones to keep them from being too conspicuous follow the curve of the upper roof it will take you to the top of the highest battlement and the stones indicated at the righthand side of the tower are more extended at the bottom in order to get some less direct expression of sympathy such as irregular stones may be capable of with the general flow of the curves from left to right  226 you may not readily believe at first that all these laws are indeed involved in so trifling a piece of composition but as you study longer you will discover that these laws and many more are obeyed by the powerful composers in every touch that literally there is never a dash of their pencil which is not carrying out appointed purposes of this kind in twenty various ways at once and that there is as much difference in way of intention and authority between one of the great composers ruling his colors and a common painter confused by them as there is between a general directing the march of an army and an old lady carried off her feet by a mob   7 the law of interchange  227 closely connected with the law of contrast is a law which enforces the unity of opposite things by giving to each a portion of the character of the other if for instance you divide a shield into two masses of color all the way downsuppose blue and white and put a bar or figure of an animal partly on one division partly on the other you will find it pleasant to the eye if you make the part of the animal blue which comes upon the white half and white which comes upon the blue half this is done in heraldry partly for the sake of perfect intelligibility but yet more for the sake of delight in interchange of color since in all ornamentation whatever the practice is continual in the ages of good design  228 sometimes this alternation is merely a reversal of contrasts as that after red has been for some time on one side and blue on the other red shall pass to blues side and blue to reds this kind of alternation takes place simply in fourquartered shields in more subtle pieces of treatment a little bit only of each color is carried into the other and they are as it were dovetailed together one of the most curious facts which will impress itself upon you when you have drawn some time carefully from nature in light and shade is the appearance of intentional artifice with which contrasts of this alternate kind are produced by her the artistry with which she will darken a tree trunk as long as it comes against light sky and throw sunlight on it precisely at the spot where it comes against a dark hill and similarly treat all her masses of shade and color is so great that if you only follow her closely every one who looks at your drawing with attention will think that you have been inventing the most artificially and unnaturally delightful interchanges of shadow that could possibly be devised by human wit  229 you will find this law of interchange insisted upon at length by prout in his lessons on light and shade it seems of all his principles of composition to be the one he is most conscious of many others he obeys by instinct but this he formally accepts and forcibly declares  the typical purpose of the law of interchange is of course to teach us how opposite natures may be helped and strengthened by receiving each as far as they can some impress or reflection or imparted power from the other   8 the law of consistency  230 it is to be remembered in the next place that while contrast exhibits the characters of things it very often neutralizes or paralyzes their power a number of white things may be shown to be clearly white by opposition of a black thing but if we want the full power of their gathered light the black thing may be seriously in our way thus while contrast displays things it is unity and sympathy which employ them concentrating the power of several into a mass and not in art merely but in all the affairs of life the wisdom of man is continually called upon to reconcile these opposite methods of exhibiting or using the materials in his power by change he gives them pleasantness and by consistency value by change he is refreshed and by perseverance strengthened  231 hence many compositions address themselves to the spectator by aggregate force of color or line more than by contrasts of either many noble pictures are painted almost exclusively in various tones of red or gray or gold so as to be instantly striking by their breadth of flush or glow or tender coldness these qualities being exhibited only by slight and subtle use of contrast similarly as to form some compositions associate massive and rugged forms others slight and graceful ones each with few interruptions by lines of contrary character and in general such compositions possess higher sublimity than those which are more mingled in their elements they tell a special tale and summon a definite state of feeling while the grand compositions merely please the eye  232 this unity or breadth of character generally attaches most to the works of the greatest men their separate pictures have all separate aims we have not in each gray color set against somber and sharp forms against soft and loud passages against low but we have the bright picture with its delicate sadness the somber picture with its single ray of relief the stern picture with only one tender group of lines the soft and calm picture with only one rock angle at its flank and so on hence the variety of their work as well as its impressiveness the principal bearing of this law however is on the separate masses or divisions of a picture the character of the whole composition may be broken or various if we please but there must certainly be a tendency to consistent assemblage in its divisions as an army may act on several points at once but can only act effectually by having somewhere formed and regular masses and not wholly by skirmishers so a picture may be various in its tendencies but must be somewhere united and coherent in its masses good composers are always associating their colors in great groups binding their forms together by encompassing lines and securing by various dexterities of expedient what they themselves call breadth that is to say a large gathering of each kind of thing into one place light being gathered to light darkness to darkness and color to color if however this be done by introducing false lights or false colors it is absurd and monstrous the skill of a painter consists in obtaining breadth by rational arrangement of his objects not by forced or wanton treatment of them it is an easy matter to paint one thing all white and another all black or brown but not an easy matter to assemble all the circumstances which will naturally produce white in one place and brown in another generally speaking however breadth will result in sufficient degree from fidelity of study nature is always broad and if you paint her colors in true relations you will paint them in majestic masses if you find your work look broken and scattered it is in all probability not only ill composed but untrue  233 the opposite quality to breadth that of division or scattering of light and color has a certain contrasting charm and is occasionally introduced with exquisite effect by good composers70 still it is never the mere scattering but the order discernible through this scattering which is the real source of pleasure not the mere multitude but the constellation of multitude the broken lights in the work of a good painter wander like flocks upon the hills not unshepherded speaking of life and peace the broken lights of a bad painter fall like hailstones and are capable only of mischief leaving it to be wished they were also of dissolution   9 the law of harmony  234 this last law is not strictly speaking so much one of composition as of truth but it must guide composition and is properly therefore to be stated in this place  good drawing is as we have seen an abstract of natural facts you cannot represent all that you would but must continually be falling short whether you will or no of the force or quantity of nature now suppose that your means and time do not admit of your giving the depth of color in the scene and that you are obliged to paint it paler if you paint all the colors proportionately paler as if an equal quantity of tint had been washed away from each of them you still obtain a harmonious though not an equally forcible statement of natural fact but if you take away the colors unequally and leave some tints nearly as deep as they are in nature while others are much subdued you have no longer a true statement you cannot say to the observer fancy all those colors a little deeper and you will have the actual fact however he adds in imagination or takes away something is sure to be still wrong the picture is out of harmony  235 it will happen however much more frequently that you have to darken the whole system of colors than to make them paler you remember in your first studies of color from nature you were to leave the passages of light which were too bright to be imitated as white paper but in completing the picture it becomes necessary to put color into them and then the other colors must be made darker in some fixed relation to them if you deepen all proportionately though the whole scene is darker than reality it is only as if you were looking at the reality in a lower light but if while you darken some of the tints you leave others undarkened the picture is out of harmony and will not give the impression of truth  236 it is not indeed possible to deepen all the colors so much as to relieve the lights in their natural degree you would merely sink most of your colors if you tried to do so into a broad mass of blackness but it is quite possible to lower them harmoniously and yet more in some parts of the picture than in others so as to allow you to show the light you want in a visible relief in wellharmonized pictures this is done by gradually deepening the tone of the picture towards the lighter parts of it without materially lowering it in the very dark parts the tendency in such pictures being of course to include large masses of middle tints but the principal point to be observed in doing this is to deepen the individual tints without dirtying or obscuring them it is easy to lower the tone of the picture by washing it over with gray or brown and easy to see the effect of the landscape when its colors are thus universally polluted with black by using the black convex mirror one of the most pestilent inventions for falsifying nature and degrading art which ever was put into an artists hand71 for the thing required is not to darken pale yellow by mixing gray with it but to deepen the pure yellow not to darken crimson by mixing black with it but by making it deeper and richer crimson and thus the required effect could only be seen in nature if you had pieces of glass of the color of every object in your landscape and of every minor hue that made up those colors and then could see the real landscape through this deep gorgeousness of the varied glass you cannot do this with glass but you can do it for yourself as you work that is to say you can put deep blue for pale blue deep gold for pale gold and so on in the proportion you need and then you may paint as forcibly as you choose but your work will still be in the manner of titian not of caravaggio or spagnoletto or any other of the black slaves of painting72  237 supposing those scales of color which i told you to prepare in order to show you the relations of color to gray were quite accurately made and numerous enough you would have nothing more to do in order to obtain a deeper tone in any given mass of color than to substitute for each of its hues the hue as many degrees deeper in the scale as you wanted that is to say if you wanted to deepen the whole two degrees substituting for the yellow no 5 the yellow no 7 and for the red no 9 the red no 11 and so on but the hues of any object in nature are far too numerous and their degrees too subtle to admit of so mechanical a process still you may see the principle of the whole matter clearly by taking a group of colors out of your scale arranging them prettily and then washing them all over with gray that represents the treatment of nature by the black mirror then arrange the same group of colors with the tints five or six degrees deeper in the scale and that will represent the treatment of nature by titian  238 you can only however feel your way fully to the right of the thing by working from nature  the best subject on which to begin a piece of study of this kind is a good thick tree trunk seen against blue sky with some white clouds in it paint the clouds in true and tenderly gradated white then give the sky a bold full blue bringing them well out then paint the trunk and leaves grandly dark against all but in such glowing dark green and brown as you see they will bear afterwards proceed to more complicated studies matching the colors carefully first by your old method then deepening each color with its own tint and being careful above all things to keep truth of equal change when the colors are connected with each other as in dark and light sides of the same object much more aspect and sense of harmony are gained by the precision with which you observe the relation of colors in dark sides and light sides and the influence of modifying reflections than by mere accuracy of added depth in independent colors  239 this harmony of tone as it is generally called is the most important of those which the artist has to regard but there are all kinds of harmonies in a picture according to its mode of production there is even a harmony of touch if you paint one part of it very rapidly and forcibly and another part slowly and delicately each division of the picture may be right separately but they will not agree together the whole will be effectless and valueless out of harmony similarly if you paint one part of it by a yellow light in a warm day and another by a gray light in a cold day though both may have been sunlight and both may be well toned and have their relative shadows truly cast neither will look like light they will destroy each others power by being out of harmony these are only broad and definable instances of discordance but there is an extent of harmony in all good work much too subtle for definition depending on the draughtsmans carrying everything he draws up to just the balancing and harmonious point in finish and color and depth of tone and intensity of moral feeling and style of touch all considered at once and never allowing himself to lean too emphatically on detached parts or exalt one thing at the expense of another or feel acutely in one place and coldly in another if you have got some of cruikshanks etchings you will be able i think to feel the nature of harmonious treatment in a simple kind by comparing them with any of richters illustrations to the numerous german storybooks lately published at christmas with all the german stories spoiled cruikshanks work is often incomplete in character and poor in incident but as drawing it is perfect in harmony the pure and simple effects of daylight which he gets by his thorough mastery of treatment in this respect are quite unrivaled as far as i know by any other work executed with so few touches his vignettes to grimms german stories already recommended are the most remarkable in this quality richters illustrations on the contrary are of a very high stamp as respects understanding of human character with infinite playfulness and tenderness of fancy but as drawings they are almost unendurably out of harmony violent blacks in one place being continually opposed to trenchant white in another and as is almost sure to be the case with bad harmonists the local color hardly felt anywhere all german work is apt to be out of harmony in consequence of its too frequent conditions of affectation and its willful refusals of fact as well as by reason of a feverish kind of excitement which dwells violently on particular points and makes all the lines of thought in the picture to stand on end as it were like a cats fur electrified while good work is always as quiet as a couchant leopard and as strong                                       240 i have now stated to you all the laws of composition which occur to me as capable of being illustrated or defined but there are multitudes of others which in the present state of my knowledge i cannot define and others which i never hope to define and these the most important and connected with the deepest powers of the art i hope when i have thought of them more to be able to explain some of the laws which relate to nobleness and ignobleness that ignobleness especially which we commonly call vulgarity and which in its essence is one of the most curious subjects of inquiry connected with human feeling others i never hope to explain laws of expression bearing simply on simple matters but for that very reason more influential than any others these are from the first as inexplicable as our bodily sensations are it being just as impossible i think to show finally why one succession of musical notes73 shall be lofty and pathetic and such as might have been sung by casella to dante and why another succession is base and ridiculous and would be fit only for the reasonably good ear of bottom as to explain why we like sweetness and dislike bitterness the best part of every great work is always inexplicable it is good because it is good and innocently gracious opening as the green of the earth or falling as the dew of heaven  241 but though you cannot explain them you may always render yourself more and more sensitive to these higher qualities by the discipline which you generally give to your character and this especially with regard to the choice of incidents a kind of composition in some sort easier than the artistical arrangements of lines and colors but in every sort nobler because addressed to deeper feelings  242 for instance in the datur hora quieti the last vignette to rogerss poems the plow in the foreground has three purposes the first purpose is to meet the stream of sunlight on the river and make it brighter by opposition but any dark object whatever would have done this its second purpose is by its two arms to repeat the cadence of the group of the two ships and thus give a greater expression of repose but two sitting figures would have done this its third and chief or pathetic purpose is as it lies abandoned in the furrow the vessels also being moored and having their sails down to be a type of human labor closed with the close of day the parts of it on which the hand leans are brought most clearly into sight and they are the chief dark of the picture because the tillage of the ground is required of man as a punishment but they make the soft light of the setting sun brighter because rest is sweetest after toil these thoughts may never occur to us as we glance carelessly at the design and yet their under current assuredly affects the feelings and increases as the painter meant it should the impression of melancholy and of peace  243 again in the lancaster sands which is one of the plates i have marked as most desirable for your possession the stream of light which falls from the setting sun on the advancing tide stands similarly in need of some force of near object to relieve its brightness but the incident which turner has here adopted is the swoop of an angry seagull at a dog who yelps at it drawing back as the wave rises over his feet and the bird shrieks within a foot of his face its unexpected boldness is a type of the anger of its ocean element and warns us of the seas advance just as surely as the abandoned plow told us of the ceased labor of the day  244 it is not however so much in the selection of single incidents of this kind as in the feeling which regulates the arrangement of the whole subject that the mind of a great composer is known a single incident may be suggested by a felicitous chance as a pretty motto might be for the heading of a chapter but the great composers so arrange all their designs that one incident illustrates another just as one color relieves another perhaps the heysham of the yorkshire series which as to its locality may be considered a companion to the last drawing we have spoken of the lancaster sands presents as interesting an example as we could find of turners feeling in this respect the subject is a simple northcountry village on the shore of morecambe bay not in the common sense a picturesque village there are no pretty bowwindows or red roofs or rocky steps of entrance to the rustic doors or quaint gables nothing but a single street of thatched and chiefly claybuilt cottages ranged in a somewhat monotonous line the roofs so green with moss that at first we hardly discern the houses from the fields and trees the village street is closed at the end by a wooden gate indicating the little traffic there is on the road through it and giving it something the look of a large farmstead in which a right of way lies through the yard the road which leads to this gate is full of ruts and winds down a bad bit of hill between two broken banks of moor ground succeeding immediately to the few inclosures which surround the village they can hardly be called gardens but a decayed fragment or two of fencing fill the gaps in the bank a clothesline with some clothes on it striped blue and red and a smockfrock is stretched between the trunks of some stunted willows a very small haystack and pigsty being seen at the back of the cottage beyond an empty twowheeled lumbering cart drawn by a pair of horses with huge wooden collars the driver sitting lazily in the sun sideways on the leader is going slowly home along the rough road it being about country dinnertime at the end of the village there is a better house with three chimneys and a dormer window in its roof and the roof is of stone shingle instead of thatch but very rough this house is no doubt the clergymans there is some smoke from one of its chimneys none from any other in the village this smoke is from the lowest chimney at the back evidently that of the kitchen and it is rather thick the fire not having been long lighted a few hundred yards from the clergymans house nearer the shore is the church discernible from the cottages only by its low twoarched belfry a little neater than one would expect in such a village perhaps lately built by the puseyite incumbent74 and beyond the church close to the sea are two fragments of a border wartower standing on their circular mound worn on its brow deep into edges and furrows by the feet of the village children on the bank of moor which forms the foreground are a few cows the carters dog barking at a vixenish one the milkmaid is feeding another a gentle white one which turns its head to her expectant of a handful of fresh hay which she has brought for it in her blue apron fastened up round her waist she stands with her pail on her head evidently the village coquette for she has a neat bodice and pretty striped petticoat under the blue apron and red stockings nearer us the cowherd barefooted stands on a piece of the limestone rock for the ground is thistly and not pleasurable to bare feetwhether boy or girl we are not sure it may be a boy with a girls wornout bonnet on or a girl with a pair of ragged trousers on probably the first as the old bonnet is evidently useful to keep the sun out of our eyes when we are looking for strayed cows among the moorland hollows and helps us at present to watch holding the bonnets edge down the quarrel of the vixenish cow with the dog which leaning on our long stick we allow to proceed without any interference a little to the right the hay is being got in of which the milkmaid has just taken her apronful to the white cow but the hay is very thin and cannot well be raked up because of the rocks we must glean it like corn hence the smallness of our stack behind the willows and a woman is pressing a bundle of it hard together kneeling against the rocks edge to carry it safely to the haycart without dropping any beyond the village is a rocky hill deep set with brushwood a square crag or two of limestone emerging here and there with pleasant turf on their brows heaved in russet and mossy mounds against the sky which clear and calm and as golden as the moss stretches down behind it towards the sea a single cottage just shows its roof over the edge of the hill looking seawards perhaps one of the village shepherds is a sea captain now and may have built it there that his mother may first see the sails of his ship whenever it runs into the bay then under the hill and beyond the border tower is the blue sea itself the waves flowing in over the sand in long curved lines slowly shadows of cloud and gleams of shallow water on white sand alternatingmiles away but no sail is visible not one fisherboat on the beach not one dark speck on the quiet horizon beyond all are the cumberland mountains clear in the sun with rosy light on all their crags  245 i should think the reader cannot but feel the kind of harmony there is in this composition the entire purpose of the painter to give us the impression of wild yet gentle country life monotonous as the succession of the noiseless waves patient and enduring as the rocks but peaceful and full of health and quiet hope and sanctified by the pure mountain air and baptismal dew of heaven falling softly between days of toil and nights of innocence  246 all noble composition of this kind can be reached only by instinct you cannot set yourself to arrange such a subject you may see it and seize it at all times but never laboriously invent it and your power of discerning what is best in expression among natural subjects depends wholly on the temper in which you keep your own mind above all on your living so much alone as to allow it to become acutely sensitive in its own stillness the noisy life of modern days is wholly incompatible with any true perception of natural beauty if you go down into cumberland by the railroad live in some frequented hotel and explore the hills with merry companions however much you may enjoy your tour or their conversation depend upon it you will never choose so much as one pictorial subject rightly you will not see into the depth of any but take knapsack and stick walk towards the hills by short days journeysten or twelve miles a daytaking a week from some startingplace sixty or seventy miles away sleep at the pretty little wayside inns or the rough village ones then take the hills as they tempt you following glen or shore as your eye glances or your heart guides wholly scornful of local fame or fashion and of everything which it is the ordinary travelers duty to see or pride to do never force yourself to admire anything when you are not in the humor but never force yourself away from what you feel to be lovely in search of anything better and gradually the deeper scenes of the natural world will unfold themselves to you in still increasing fullness of passionate power and your difficulty will be no more to seek or to compose subjects but only to choose one from among the multitude of melodious thoughts with which you will be haunted thoughts which will of course be noble or original in proportion to your own depth of character and general power of mind for it is not so much by the consideration you give to any single drawing as by the previous discipline of your powers of thought that the character of your composition will be determined simplicity of life will make you sensitive to the refinement and modesty of scenery just as inordinate excitement and pomp of daily life will make you enjoy coarse colors and affected forms habits of patient comparison and accurate judgment will make your art precious as they will make your actions wise and every increase of noble enthusiasm in your living spirit will be measured by the reflection of its light upon the works of your handsfaithfully yours                                                            j ruskin   footnotes    41 i give rossetti this preeminence because though the leading     preraphaelites have all about equal power over color in the     abstract rossetti and holman hunt are distinguished above the rest     for rendering color under effects of light and of these two     rossetti composes with richer fancy and with a deeper sense of     beauty hunts stern realism leading him continually into harshness     rossettis carelessness to do him justice is only in watercolor     never in oil    42 all the degradation of art which was brought about after the     rise of the dutch school by asphaltum yellow varnish and brown     trees would have been prevented if only painters had been forced to     work in dead color any color will do for some people if it is     browned and shining but fallacy in dead color is detected on the     instant i even believe that whenever a painter begins to wish     that he could touch any portion of his work with gum he is going     wrong      it is necessary however in this matter carefully to distinguish     between translucency and luster translucency though as i have     said above a dangerous temptation is in its place beautiful but     luster or shininess is always in painting a defect nay one of     my best painterfriends the best being understood to attach to     both divisions of that awkward compound word tried the other day     to persuade me that luster was an ignobleness in anything and it     was only the fear of treason to ladies eyes and to mountain     streams and to morning dew which kept me from yielding the point     to him one is apt always to generalize too quickly in such matters     but there can be no question that luster is destructive of     loveliness in color as it is of intelligibility in form whatever     may be the pride of a young beauty in the knowledge that her eyes     shine though perhaps even eyes are most beautiful in dimness she     would be sorry if her cheeks did and which of us would wish to     polish a rose    43 but not shiny or greasy bristol board or hotpressed     imperial or gray paper that feels slightly adhesive to the hand is     best coarse gritty and sandy papers are fit only for blotters and     blunderers no good draughtsman would lay a line on them turner     worked much on a thin tough paper dead in surface rolling up his     sketches in tight bundles that would go deep into his pockets    44 i insist upon this unalterability of color the more because i     address you as a beginner or an amateur a great artist can     sometimes get out of a difficulty with credit or repent without     confession yet even titians alterations usually show as stains on     his work    45 it is i think a piece of affectation to try to work with few     colors it saves time to have enough tints prepared without mixing     and you may at once allow yourself these twentyfour if you arrange     them in your colorbox in the order i have set them down you will     always easily put your finger on the one you want      cobalt         smalt                  antwerb blue     prussian blue     black

but     you need not care much about permanence in your work as yet and     they are both beautiful while indigo is marked by field as more     fugitive still and is very ugly hookers green is a mixed color     put in the box merely to save you loss of time in mixing gamboge and     prussian blue no 1 is the best tint of it violet carmine is a     noble color for laying broken shadows with to be worked into     afterwards with other colors      if you wish to take up coloring seriously you had better get fields     chromatography at once only do not attend to anything it says     about principles or harmonies of color but only to its statements     of practical serviceableness in pigments and of their operations on     each other when mixed etc    46 a more methodical though under general circumstances uselessly     prolix way is to cut a square hole some half an inch wide in the     sheet of cardboard and a series of small circular holes in a slip     of cardboard an inch wide pass the slip over the square opening     and match each color beside one of the circular openings you will     thus have no occasion to wash any of the colors away but the first     rough method is generally all you want as after a little practice     you only need to look at the hue through the opening in order to     be able to transfer it to your drawing at once    47 if colors were twenty times as costly as they are we should     have many more good painters if i were chancellor of the exchequer     i would lay a tax of twenty shillings a cake on all colors except     black prussian blue vandyke brown and chinese white which i     would leave for students i dont say this jestingly i believe such     a tax would do more to advance real art than a great many schools of     design    48 i say modern because titians quiet way of blending colors     which is the perfectly right one is not understood now by any     artist the best color we reach is got by stippling but this is not     quite right    49 see note 6 in appendix i    50 the worst general character that color can possibly have is a     prevalent tendency to a dirty yellowish green like that of a     decaying heap of vegetables this color is accurately indicative     of decline or paralysis in missalpainting    51 that is to say local color inherent in the object the     gradations of color in the various shadows belonging to various     lights exhibit form and therefore no one but a colorist can ever     draw forms perfectly see modern painters vol iv chap iii at     the end but all notions of explaining form by superimposed color     as in architectural moldings are absurd color adorns form but     does not interpret it an apple is prettier because it is striped     but it does not look a bit rounder and a cheek is prettier because     it is flushed but you would see the form of the cheek bone better     if it were not color may indeed detach one shape from another as     in grounding a basrelief but it always diminishes the appearance     of projection and whether you put blue purple red yellow or     green for your ground the basrelief will be just as clearly or     just as imperfectly relieved as long as the colors are of equal     depth the blue ground will not retire the hundredth part of an inch     more than the red one    52 see however at the close of this letter the notice of one     more point connected with the management of color under the head     law of harmony    53 see farther on this subject modern painters vol iv chap     viii ¬ß 6    54 see note 7 in appendix i    55 in general throughout nature reflection and repetition are     peaceful things associated with the idea of quiet succession in     events that one day should be like another day or one history the     repetition of another history being more or less results of     quietness while dissimilarity and nonsuccession are results of     interference and disquietude thus though an echo actually     increases the quantity of sound heard its repetition of the note or     syllable gives an idea of calmness attainable in no other way hence     also the feeling of calm given to a landscape by the voice of a     cuckoo    56 this is obscure in the rude woodcut the masts being so     delicate that they are confused among the lines of reflection in     the original they have orange light upon them relieved against     purple behind    57 the cost of art in getting a bridge level is always lost for     you must get up to the height of the central arch at any rate and     you only can make the whole bridge level by putting the hill farther     back and pretending to have got rid of it when you have not but     have only wasted money in building an unnecessary embankment of     course the bridge should not be difficultly or dangerously steep     but the necessary slope whatever it may be should be in the bridge     itself as far as the bridge can take it and not pushed aside into     the approach as in our waterloo road the only rational excuse for     doing which is that when the slope must be long it is inconvenient     to put on a drag at the top of the bridge and that any restiveness     of the horse is more dangerous on the bridge than on the embankment     to this i answer first it is not more dangerous in reality though     it looks so for the bridge is always guarded by an effective     parapet but the embankment is sure to have no parapet or only a     useless rail and secondly that it is better to have the slope on     the bridge and make the roadway wide in proportion so as to be     quite safe because a little waste of space on the river is no loss     but your wide embankment at the side loses good ground and so my     picturesque bridges are right as well as beautiful and i hope to     see them built again some day instead of the frightful     straightbacked things which we fancy are fine and accept from the     pontifical rigidities of the engineering mind    58 i cannot waste space here by reprinting what i have said in     other books but the reader ought if possible to refer to the     notices of this part of our subject in modern painters vol iv     chap xvii and stones of venice vol iii chap i ¬ß 8    59 if you happen to be reading at this part of the book without     having gone through any previous practice turn back to the sketch     of the ramification of stone pine fig 4 p 17 and examine the     curves of its boughs one by one trying them by the conditions here     stated under the heads a and b    60 the reader i hope observes always that every line in these     figures is itself one of varying curvature and cannot be drawn by     compasses    61 i hope the reader understands that these woodcuts are merely     facsimiles of the sketches i make at the side of my paper to     illustrate my meaning as i writeoften sadly scrawled if i want to     get on to something else this one is really a little too careless     but it would take more time and trouble to make a proper drawing of     so odd a boat than the matter is worth it will answer the purpose     well enough as it is    62 imperfect vegetable form i consider that which is in its nature     dependent as in runners and climbers or which is susceptible of     continual injury without materially losing the power of giving     pleasure by its aspect as in the case of the smaller grasses i     have not of course space here to explain these minor distinctions     but the laws above stated apply to all the more important trees and     shrubs likely to be familiar to the student    63 there is a very tender lesson of this kind in the shadows of     leaves upon the ground shadows which are the most likely of all to     attract attention by their pretty play and change if you examine     them you will find that the shadows do not take the forms of the     leaves but that through each interstice the light falls at a     little distance in the form of a round or oval spot that is to     say it produces the image of the sun itself cast either vertically     or obliquely in circle or ellipse according to the slope of the     ground of course the suns rays produce the same effect when they     fall through any small aperture but the openings between leaves are     the only ones likely to show it to an ordinary observer or to     attract his attention to it by its frequency and lead him to think     what this type may signify respecting the greater sun and how it     may show us that even when the opening through which the earth     receives light is too small to let us see the sun himself the ray     of light that enters if it comes straight from him will still bear     with it his image    64 in the smaller figure 32 it will be seen that this     interruption is caused by a cart coming down to the waters edge     and this object is serviceable as beginning another system of curves     leading out of the picture on the right but so obscurely drawn as     not to be easily represented in outline as it is unnecessary to the     explanation of our point here it has been omitted in the larger     diagram the direction of the curve it begins being indicated by the     dashes only    65 both in the sketches in flanders and germany    66 if you happen to meet with the plate of d√ºrers representing a     coatofarms with a skull in the shield note the value given to the     concave curves and sharp point of the helmet by the convex leafage     carried round it in front and the use of the blank white part of     the shield in opposing the rich folds of the dress    67 turner hardly ever as far as i remember allows a strong light     to oppose a full dark without some intervening tint his suns never     set behind dark mountains without a film of cloud above the     mountains edge    68       a prudent chief not always must display               his powers in equal ranks and fair array               but with the occasion and the place comply               conceal his force nay seem sometimes to fly               those oft are stratagems which errors seem               nor is it homer nods but we that dream                                                    essay on criticism    69 i am describing from an ms circa 1300 of gregorys     decretalia in my own possession    70 one of the most wonderful compositions of tintoret in venice     is little more than a field of subdued crimson spotted with flakes     of scattered gold the upper clouds in the most beautiful skies owe     great part of their power to infinitude of divisions order being     marked through this division    71 i fully believe that the strange gray gloom accompanied by     considerable power of effect which prevails in modern french art     must be owing to the use of this mischievous instrument the french     landscape always gives me the idea of nature seen carelessly in the     dark mirror and painted coarsely but scientifically through the     veil of its perversion    72 various other parts of this subject are entered into     especially in their bearing on the ideal of painting in modern     painters vol iv chap iii    73 in all the best arrangements of color the delight occasioned     by their mode of succession is entirely inexplicable nor can it be     reasoned about we like it just as we like an air in music but     cannot reason any refractory person into liking it if they do not     and yet there is distinctly a right and a wrong in it and a good     taste and bad taste respecting it as also in music    74 puseyism was unknown in the days when this drawing was made     but the kindly and helpful influences of what may be called     ecclesiastical sentiment which in a morbidly exaggerated     condition forms one of the principal elements of puseyismi use     this word regretfully no other existing which will serve for     ithad been known and felt in our wild northern districts long     before     appendix   i  illustrative notes    note 1 p 42principle of the stereoscope  247 i am sorry to find a notion current among artists that they can in some degree imitate in a picture the effect of the stereoscope by confusion of lines there are indeed one or two artifices by which as stated in the text an appearance of retirement or projection may be obtained so that they partly supply the place of the stereoscopic effect but they do not imitate that effect the principle of the human sight is simply thisby means of our two eyes we literally see everything from two places at once and by calculated combination in the brain of the facts of form so seen we arrive at conclusions respecting the distance and shape of the object which we could not otherwise have reached but it is just as vain to hope to paint at once the two views of the object as seen from these two places though only an inch and a half distant from each other as it would be if they were a mile and a half distant from each other with the right eye you see one view of a given object relieved against one part of the distance with the left eye you see another view of it relieved against another part of the distance you may paint whichever of those views you please you cannot paint both hold your finger upright between you and this page of the book about six inches from your eyes and three from the book shut the right eye and hide the words inches from in the second line above this with your finger you will then see six on one side of it and your on the other now shut the left eye and open the right without moving your finger and you will see inches but not six you may paint the finger with inches beyond it or with six beyond it but not with both and this principle holds for any object and any distance you might just as well try to paint st pauls at once from both ends of london bridge as to realize any stereoscopic effect in a picture     note 2 p 59dark lines turned to the light  248 it ought to have been farther observed that the inclosure of the light by future shadow is by no means the only reason for the dark lines which great masters often thus introduce it constantly happens that a local color will show its own darkness most on the light side by projecting into and against masses of light in that direction and then the painter will indicate this future force of the mass by his dark touch both the monks head in fig 11 and dog in fig 20 are dark towards the light for this reason     note 3 p 98softness of reflections  249 i have not quite insisted enough on the extreme care which is necessary in giving the tender evanescence of the edges of the reflections when the water is in the least agitated nor on the decision with which you may reverse the object when the water is quite calm most drawing of reflections is at once confused and hard but natures is at once intelligible and tender generally at the edge of the water you ought not to see where reality ceases and reflection begins as the image loses itself you ought to keep all its subtle and varied veracities with the most exquisite softening of its edge practice as much as you can from the reflections of ships in calm water following out all the reversed rigging and taking if anything more pains with the reflection than with the ship     note 4 p 100where the reflection is darkest you will see      through the water best  250 for this reason it often happens that if the water be shallow and you are looking steeply down into it the reflection of objects on the bank will consist simply of pieces of the bottom seen clearly through the water and relieved by flashes of light which are the reflection of the sky thus you may have to draw the reflected dark shape of a bush but inside of that shape you must not draw the leaves of the bush but the stones under the water and outside of this dark reflection the blue or white of the sky with no stones visible     note 5 p 101approach streams with reverence  251 i have hardly said anything about waves of torrents or waterfalls as i do not consider them subjects for beginners to practice upon but as many of our younger artists are almost breaking their hearts over them it may be well to state at once that it is physically impossible to draw a running torrent quite rightly the luster of its currents and whiteness of its foam being dependent on intensities of light which art has not at its command this also is to be observed that most young painters make their defeat certain by attempting to draw running water which is a lustrous object in rapid motion without ever trying their strength on a lustrous object standing still let them break a coarse greenglass bottle into a great many bits and try to paint those with all their undulations and edges of fracture as they lie still on the table if they cannot of course they need not try the rushing crystal and foaming fracture of the stream if they can manage the glass bottle let them next buy a fragment or two of yellow fireopal it is quite a common and cheap mineral and presents as closely as anything can the milky bloom and color of a torrent wave and if they can conquer the opal they may at last have some chance with the stream as far as the stream is in any wise possible but as i have just said the bright parts of it are not possible and ought as much as may be to be avoided in choosing subjects a great deal more may however be done than any artist has done yet in painting the gradual disappearance and lovely coloring of stones seen through clear and calm water  students living in towns may make great progress in rockdrawing by frequently and faithfully drawing broken edges of common roofing slates of their real size     note 6 p 125natures economy of color  252 i heard it wisely objected to this statement the other day by a young lady that it was not through economy that nature did not color deep down in the flower bells but because she had not light enough there to see to paint with this may be true but it is certainly not for want of light that when she is laying the dark spots on a foxglove she will not use any more purple than she has got already on the bell but takes out the color all round the spot and concentrates it in the middle     note 7 p 138the law of repetition  253 the reader may perhaps recollect a very beautiful picture of vandycks in the manchester exhibition representing three children in court dresses of rich black and red the law in question was amusingly illustrated in the lower corner of that picture by the introduction of two crows in a similar color of court dress having jet black feathers and bright red beaks  254 since the first edition of this work was published i have ascertained that there are two series of engravings from the bible drawings mentioned in the list at p 50 one of these is inferior to the other and in many respects false to the drawing the jericho for instance in the false series has common bushes instead of palm trees in the middle distance the original plates may be had at almost any respectable printsellers and ordinary impressions whether of these or any other plates mentioned in the list at p 50 will be quite as useful as proofs but in buying liber studiorum it is always well to get the best impressions that can be had and if possible impressions of the original plates published by turner in case these are not to be had the copies which are in course of publication by mr lupton 4 keppel street russell square are good and serviceable but no others are of any usenote of 1857  i have placed in the hands of mr ward working mens college some photographs from the etchings made by turner for the liber the original etchings being now unobtainable except by fortunate accident i have selected the subjects carefully from my own collection of the etchings and though some of the more subtle qualities of line are lost in the photographs the student will find these proofs the best lessons in pendrawing accessible to himnote of 1859   ii  things to be studied  255 the worst danger by far to which a solitary student is exposed is that of liking things that he should not it is not so much his difficulties as his tastes which he must set himself to conquer and although under the guidance of a master many works of art may be made instructive which are only of partial excellence the good and bad of them being duly distinguished his safeguard as long as he studies alone will be in allowing himself to possess only things in their way so free from faults that nothing he copies in them can seriously mislead him and to contemplate only those works of art which he knows to be either perfect or noble in their errors i will therefore set down in clear order the names of the masters whom you may safely admire and a few of the books which you may safely possess in these days of cheap illustration the danger is always rather of your possessing too much than too little it may admit of some question how far the looking at bad art may set off and illustrate the characters of the good but on the whole i believe it is best to live always on quite wholesome food and that our enjoyment of it will never be made more acute by feeding on ashes though it may be well sometimes to taste the ashes in order to know the bitterness of them of course the works of the great masters can only be serviceable to the student after he has made considerable progress himself it only wastes the time and dulls the feelings of young persons to drag them through picture galleries at least unless they themselves wish to look at particular pictures generally young people only care to enter a picture gallery when there is a chance of getting leave to run a race to the other end of it and they had better do that in the garden below if however they have any real enjoyment of pictures and want to look at this one or that the principal point is never to disturb them in looking at what interests them and never to make them look at what does not nothing is of the least use to young people nor by the way of much use to old ones but what interests them and therefore though it is of great importance to put nothing but good art into their possession yet when they are passing through great houses or galleries they should be allowed to look precisely at what pleases them if it is not useful to them as art it will be in some other way and the healthiest way in which art can interest them is when they look at it not as art but because it represents something they like in nature if a boy has had his heart filled by the life of some great man and goes up thirstily to a vandyck portrait of him to see what he was like that is the wholesomest way in which he can begin the study of portraiture if he loves mountains and dwells on a turner drawing because he sees in it a likeness to a yorkshire scar or an alpine pass that is the wholesomest way in which he can begin the study of landscape and if a girls mind is filled with dreams of angels and saints and she pauses before an angelico because she thinks it must surely be like heaven that is the right way for her to begin the study of religious art  256 when however the student has made some definite progress and every picture becomes really a guide to him false or true in his own work it is of great importance that he should never look with even partial admiration at bad art and then if the reader is willing to trust me in the matter the following advice will be useful to him in which with his permission i will quit the indirect and return to the epistolary address as being the more convenient     first in galleries of pictures  1 you may look with trust in their being always right at titian veronese tintoret giorgione john bellini and velasquez the authenticity of the picture being of course established for you by proper authority  2 you may look with admiration admitting however question of right and wrong75 at van eyck holbein perugino francia angelico leonardo da vinci correggio vandyck rembrandt reynolds gainsborough turner and the modern preraphaelites76 you had better look at no other painters than these for you run a chance otherwise of being led far off the road or into grievous faults by some of the other great ones as michael angelo raphael and rubens and of being besides corrupted in taste by the base ones as murillo salvator claude gaspar poussin teniers and such others you may look however for examples of evil with safe universality of reprobation being sure that everything you see is bad at domenichino the carracci bronzino and the figure pieces of salvator  among those named for study under question you cannot look too much at nor grow too enthusiastically fond of angelico correggio reynolds turner and the preraphaelites but if you find yourself getting especially fond of any of the others leave off looking at them for you must be going wrong some way or other if for instance you begin to like rembrandt or leonardo especially you are losing your feeling for color if you like van eyck or perugino especially you must be getting too fond of rigid detail and if you like vandyck or gainsborough especially you must be too much attracted by gentlemanly flimsiness  257 secondly of published or otherwise multiplied art such as you may be able to get yourself or to see at private houses or in shops the works of the following masters are the most desirable after the turners rembrandts and d√ºrers which i have asked you to get first     1 samuel prout77  all his published lithographic sketches are of the greatest value wholly unrivaled in power of composition and in love and feeling of architectural subject his somewhat mannered linear execution though not to be imitated in your own sketches from nature may be occasionally copied for disciplines sake with great advantage it will give you a peculiar steadiness of hand not quickly attainable in any other way and there is no fear of your getting into any faultful mannerism as long as you carry out the different modes of more delicate study above recommended  if you are interested in architecture and wish to make it your chief study you should draw much from photographs of it and then from the architecture itself with the same completion of detail and gradation only keeping the shadows of due palenessin photographs they are always about four times as dark as they ought to beand treat buildings with as much care and love as artists do their rock foregrounds drawing all the moss and weeds and stains upon them but if without caring to understand architecture you merely want the picturesque character of it and to be able to sketch it fast you cannot do better than take prout for your exclusive master only do not think that you are copying prout by drawing straight lines with dots at the end of them get first his rhine and draw the subjects that have most hills and least architecture in them with chalk on smooth paper till you can lay on his broad flat tints and get his gradations of light which are very wonderful then take up the architectural subjects in the rhine and draw again and again the groups of figures etc in his microcosm and lessons on light and shadow after that proceed to copy the grand subjects in the sketches in flanders and germany or in switzerland and italy if you cannot get the flanders but the switzerland is very far inferior then work from nature not trying to proutize nature by breaking smooth buildings into rough ones but only drawing what you see with prouts simple method and firm lines dont copy his colored works they are good but not at all equal to his chalk and pencil drawings and you will become a mere imitator and a very feeble imitator if you use color at all in prouts method i have not space to explain why this is so it would take a long piece of reasoning trust me for the statement     2 john lewis  his sketches in spain lithographed by himself are very valuable get them if you can and also some engravings about eight or ten i think altogether of wild beasts executed by his own hand a long time ago they are very precious in every way the series of the alhambra is rather slight and few of the subjects are lithographed by himself still it is well worth having  but let no lithographic work come into the house if you can help it nor even look at any except prouts and those sketches of lewiss     3 george cruikshank  if you ever happen to meet with the two volumes of grimms german stories which were illustrated by him long ago pounce upon them instantly the etchings in them are the finest things next to rembrandts that as far as i know have been done since etching was invented you cannot look at them too much nor copy them too often  all his works are very valuable though disagreeable when they touch on the worst vulgarities of modern life and often much spoiled by a curiously mistaken type of face divided so as to give too much to the mouth and eyes and leave too little for forehead the eyes being set about two thirds up instead of at half the height of the head but his manner of work is always right and his tragic power though rarely developed and warped by habits of caricature is in reality as great as his grotesque power  there is no fear of his hurting your taste as long as your principal work lies among art of so totally different a character as most of that which i have recommended to you and you may therefore get great good by copying almost anything of his that may come in your way except only his illustrations lately published to cinderella and jack and the beanstalk and tom thumb which are much overlabored and confused in line you should get them but do not copy them     4 alfred rethel  i only know two publications by him one the dance of death with text by reinick published in leipsic but to be had now of any london bookseller for the sum i believe of eighteen pence and containing six plates full of instructive character the other of two plates only death the avenger and death the friend these two are far superior to the todtentanz and if you can get them will be enough in themselves to show all that rethel can teach you if you dislike ghastly subjects get death the friend only     5 bewick  the execution of the plumage in bewicks birds is the most masterly thing ever yet done in woodcutting it is worked just as paul veronese would have worked in wood had he taken to it his vignettes though too coarse in execution and vulgar in types of form to be good copies show nevertheless intellectual power of the highest order and there are pieces of sentiment in them either pathetic or satirical which have never since been equaled in illustrations of this simple kind the bitter intensity of the feeling being just like that which characterizes some of the leading preraphaelites bewick is the burns of painting     6 blake  the book of job engraved by himself is of the highest rank in certain characters of imagination and expression in the mode of obtaining certain effects of light it will also be a very useful example to you in expressing conditions of glaring and flickering light blake is greater than rembrandt     7 richter  i have already told you what to guard against in looking at his works i am a little doubtful whether i have done well in including them in this catalogue at all but the imaginations in them are so lovely and numberless that i must risk for their sake the chance of hurting you a little in judgment of style if you want to make presents of storybooks to children his are the best you can now get but his most beautiful work as far as i know is his series of illustrations to the lords prayer     8 rossetti  an edition of tennyson lately published contains woodcuts from drawings by rossetti and other chief preraphaelite masters they are terribly spoiled in the cutting and generally the best part the expression of feature entirely lost78 still they are full of instruction and cannot be studied too closely but observe respecting these woodcuts that if you have been in the habit of looking at much spurious work in which sentiment action and style are borrowed or artificial you will assuredly be offended at first by all genuine work which is intense in feeling genuine art which is merely art such as veroneses or titians may not offend you though the chances are that you will not care about it but genuine works of feeling such as maud or aurora leigh in poetry or the grand preraphaelite designs in painting are sure to offend you and if you cease to work hard and persist in looking at vicious and false art they will continue to offend you it will be well therefore to have one type of entirely false art in order to know what to guard against flaxmans outlines to dante contain i think examples of almost every kind of falsehood and feebleness which it is possible for a trained artist not base in thought to commit or admit both in design and execution base or degraded choice of subject such as you will constantly find in teniers and others of the dutch painters i need not i hope warn you against you will simply turn away from it in disgust while mere bad or feeble drawing which makes mistakes in every direction at once cannot teach you the particular sort of educated fallacy in question but in these designs of flaxmans you have gentlemanly feeling and fair knowledge of anatomy and firm setting down of lines all applied in the foolishest and worst possible way you cannot have a more finished example of learned error amiable want of meaning and bad drawing with a steady hand79 retzschs outlines have more real material in them than flaxmans occasionally showing true fancy and power in artistic principle they are nearly as bad and in taste worse all outlines from statuary as given in works on classical art will be very hurtful to you if you in the least like them and nearly all finished line engravings some particular prints i could name which possess instructive qualities but it would take too long to distinguish them and the best way is to avoid line engravings of figures altogether80 if you happen to be a rich person possessing quantities of them and if you are fond of the large finished prints from raphael correggio etc it is wholly impossible that you can make any progress in knowledge of real art till you have sold them allor burnt them which would be a greater benefit to the world i hope that some day true and noble engravings will be made from the few pictures of the great schools which the restorations undertaken by the modern managers of foreign galleries may leave us but the existing engravings have nothing whatever in common with the good in the works they profess to represent and if you like them you like in the originals of them hardly anything but their errors  258 finally your judgment will be of course much affected by your taste in literature indeed i know many persons who have the purest taste in literature and yet false taste in art and it is a phenomenon which puzzles me not a little but i have never known any one with false taste in books and true taste in pictures it is also of the greatest importance to you not only for arts sake but for all kinds of sake in these days of book deluge to keep out of the salt swamps of literature and live on a little rocky island of your own with a spring and a lake in it pure and good i cannot of course suggest the choice of your library to you every several mind needs different books but there are some books which we all need and assuredly if you read homer81 plato √Üschylus herodotus dante82 shakspeare and spenser as much as you ought you will not require wide enlargement of shelves to right and left of them for purposes of perpetual study among modern books avoid generally magazine and review literature sometimes it may contain a useful abridgment or a wholesome piece of criticism but the chances are ten to one it will either waste your time or mislead you if you want to understand any subject whatever read the best book upon it you can hear of not a review of the book if you dont like the first book you try seek for another but do not hope ever to understand the subject without pains by a reviewers help avoid especially that class of literature which has a knowing tone it is the most poisonous of all every good book or piece of book is full of admiration and awe it may contain firm assertion or stern satire but it never sneers coldly nor asserts haughtily and it always leads you to reverence or love something with your whole heart it is not always easy to distinguish the satire of the venomous race of books from the satire of the noble and pure ones but in general you may notice that the coldblooded crustacean and batrachian books will sneer at sentiment and the warmblooded human books at sin then in general the more you can restrain your serious reading to reflective or lyric poetry history and natural history avoiding fiction and the drama the healthier your mind will become of modern poetry keep to scott wordsworth keats crabbe tennyson the two brownings thomas hood lowell longfellow and coventry patmore whose angel in the house is a most finished piece of writing and the sweetest analysis we possess of quiet modern domestic feeling while mrs brownings aurora leigh is as far as i know the greatest poem which the century has produced in any language cast coleridge at once aside as sickly and useless and shelley as shallow and verbose byron until your taste is fully formed and you are able to discern the magnificence in him from the wrong never read bad or common poetry nor write any poetry yourself there is perhaps rather too much than too little in the world already  259 of reflective prose read chiefly bacon johnson and helps carlyle is hardly to be named as a writer for beginners because his teaching though to some of us vitally necessary may to others be hurtful if you understand and like him read him if he offends you you are not yet ready for him and perhaps may never be so at all events give him up as you would seabathing if you found it hurt you till you are stronger of fiction read sir charles grandison scotts novels miss edgeworths and if you are a young lady madame de genlis the french miss edgeworth making these i mean your constant companions of course you must or will read other books for amusement once or twice but you will find that these have an element of perpetuity in them existing in nothing else of their kind while their peculiar quietness and repose of manner will also be of the greatest value in teaching you to feel the same characters in art read little at a time trying to feel interest in little things and reading not so much for the sake of the story as to get acquainted with the pleasant people into whose company these writers bring you a common book will often give you much amusement but it is only a noble book which will give you dear friends remember also that it is of less importance to you in your earlier years that the books you read should be clever than that they should be right i do not mean oppressively or repulsively instructive but that the thoughts they express should be just and the feelings they excite generous it is not necessary for you to read the wittiest or the most suggestive books it is better in general to hear what is already known and may be simply said much of the literature of the present day though good to be read by persons of ripe age has a tendency to agitate rather than confirm and leaves its readers too frequently in a helpless or hopeless indignation the worst possible state into which the mind of youth can be thrown it may indeed become necessary for you as you advance in life to set your hand to things that need to be altered in the world or apply your heart chiefly to what must be pitied in it or condemned but for a young person the safest temper is one of reverence and the safest place one of obscurity certainly at present and perhaps through all your life your teachers are wisest when they make you content in quiet virtue and that literature and art are best for you which point out in common life and in familiar things the objects for hopeful labor and for humble love   footnotes    75 i do not mean necessarily to imply inferiority of rank in     saying that this second class of painters have questionable     qualities the greatest men have often many faults and sometimes     their faults are a part of their greatness but such men are not of     course to be looked upon by the student with absolute implicitness     of faith    76 including under this term john lewis and william hunt of the     old watercolor who take him all in all is the best painter of     still life i believe that ever existed    77 the order in which i place these masters does not in the least     imply superiority or inferiority i wrote their names down as they     occurred to me putting rossettis last because what i had to say of     him was connected with other subjects and one or another will     appear to you great or be found by you useful according to the     kind of subjects you are studying    78 this is especially the case in the st cecily rossettis first     illustration to the palace of art which would have been the best     in the book had it been well engraved the whole work should be     taken up again and done by line engraving perfectly and wholly     from preraphaelite designs with which no other modern work can     bear the least comparison    79 the praise i have given incidentally to flaxmans sculpture in     the seven lamps and elsewhere refers wholly to his studies from     nature and simple groups in marble which were always good and     interesting still i have overrated him even in this respect and     it is generally to be remembered that in speaking of artists whose     works i cannot be supposed to have specially studied the errors i     fall into will always be on the side of praise for of course     praise is most likely to be given when the thing praised is above     ones knowledge and therefore as our knowledge increases such     things may be found less praiseworthy than we thought but blame can     only be justly given when the thing blamed is below ones level of     sight and practically i never do blame anything until i have got     well past it and am certain that there is demonstrable falsehood in     it i believe therefore all my blame to be wholly trustworthy     having never yet had occasion to repent of one depreciatory word     that i have ever written while i have often found that with     respect to things i had not time to study closely i was led too far     by sudden admiration helped perhaps by peculiar associations or     other deceptive accidents and this the more because i never care     to check an expression of delight thinking the chances are that     even if mistaken it will do more good than harm but i weigh every     word of blame with scrupulous caution i have sometimes erased a     strong passage of blame from second editions of my books but this     was only when i found it offended the reader without convincing him     never because i repented of it myself    80 large line engravings i mean in which the lines as such are     conspicuous small vignettes in line are often beautiful in figures     no less than landscape as for instance those from stothards     drawings in rogerss italy and therefore i have just recommended     the vignettes to tennyson to be done by line engraving    81 chapmans if not the original    82 garys or cayleys if not the original i do not know which     are the best translations of plato herodotus and √Üschylus can only     be read in the original it may seem strange that i name books like     these for beginners but all the greatest books contain food for     all ages and an intelligent and rightly bred youth or girl ought to     enjoy much even in plato by the time they are fifteen or sixteen
