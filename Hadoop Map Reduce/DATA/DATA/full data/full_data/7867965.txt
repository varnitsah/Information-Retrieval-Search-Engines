7867965	the hermits     introduction    st paphnutius used to tell a story which may serve as a fit introduction to this book  it contains a miniature sketch not only of the social state of egypt but of the whole roman empire and of the causes which led to the famous monastic movement in the beginning of the fifth century after christ  now paphnutius was a wise and holy hermit the father abba or abbot of many monks and after he had trained himself in the desert with all severity for many years he besought god to show him which of his saints he was like  and it was said to him thou art like a certain fluteplayer in the city  then paphnutius took his staff and went into the city and found that fluteplayer  but he confessed that he was a drunkard and a profligate and had till lately got his living by robbery and recollected not having ever done one good deed  nevertheless when paphnutius questioned him more closely he said that he recollected once having found a holy maiden beset by robbers and having delivered her and brought her safe to town  and when paphnutius questioned him more closely still he said he recollected having done another deed  when he was a robber he met once in the desert a beautiful woman and she prayed him to do her no harm but to take her away with him as a slave whither he would for said she i am fleeing from the apparitors and the governors curials for the last two years  my husband has been imprisoned for 300 pieces of gold which he owes as arrears of taxes and has been often hung up and often scourged and my three dear boys have been taken from me and i am wandering from place to place and have been often caught myself and continually scourged and now i have been in the desert three days without food  and when the robber heard that he took pity on her and took her to his cave and gave her 300 pieces of gold and went with her to the city and set her husband and her boys free  then paphnutius said i never did a deed like that  and yet i have not passed my life in ease and idleness  but now my son since god hath had such care of thee have a care for thine own self  and when the musician heard that he threw away the flutes which he held in his hand and went with paphnutius into the desert and passed his life in hymns and prayer changing his earthly music into heavenly and after three years he went to heaven and was at rest among the choirs of angels and the ranks of the just  this story as i said is a miniature sketch of the state of the whole roman empire and of the causes why men fled from it into the desert  christianity had reformed the morals of individuals it had not reformed the empire itself  that had sunk into a state only to be compared with the worst despotisms of the east  the emperors whether or not they called themselves christian like constantine knew no law save the basest maxims of the heathen world  several of them were barbarians who had risen from the lowest rank merely by military prowess and who half maddened by their sudden elevation added to their native ignorance and brutality the pride cunning and cruelty of an eastern sultan  rival emperors or generals who aspired to be emperors devastated the world from egypt to britain by sanguinary civil wars  the government of the provinces had become altogether military  torture was employed not merely as of old against slaves but against all ranks without distinction the people were exhausted by compulsory taxes to be spent in wars which did not concern them or in court luxury in which they had no share  in the municipal towns liberty and justice were dead  the curials who answered somewhat to our aldermen and who were responsible for the payment of the public moneys tried their best to escape the unpopular office and when compelled to serve wrung the money in selfdefence out of the poorer inhabitants by every kind of tyranny  the land was tilled either by oppressed and miserable peasants or by gangs of slaves in comparison with whose lot that even of the american negro was light  the great were served in their own households by crowds of slaves better fed doubtless but even more miserable and degraded than those who tilled the estates  private profligacy among all ranks was such as cannot be described in these or in any modern pages  the regular clergy of the cities though not of profligate lives and for the most part in accordance with public opinion unmarried were able to make no stand against the general corruption of the age because at least if we are to trust such writers as jerome and chrysostom they were giving themselves up to ambition and avarice vanity and luxury intrigue and party spirit and had become the flatterers of fine ladies silly women laden with sins ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of the truth  such a state of things not only drove poor creatures into the desert like that fair woman whom the robber met but it raised up bands of robbers over the whole of europe africa and the eastmen who like robin hood and the outlaws of the middle age getting no justice from man broke loose from society and while they plundered their oppressors kept up some sort of rude justice and humanity among themselves  many too fled and became robbers to escape the merciless conscription which carried off from every province the flower of the young men to shed their blood on foreign battlefields  in time too many of these conscripts became monks and the great monasteries of scetis and nitria were hunted over again and again by officers and soldiers from the neighbouring city of alexandria in search of young men who had entered the spiritual warfare to escape the earthly one  and as a background to all this seething heap of decay misrule and misery hung the black cloud of the barbarians the teutonic tribes from whom we derive the best part of our blood ever coming nearer and nearer waxing stronger and stronger learning discipline and civilization by serving in the roman armies alternately the allies and the enemies of the emperors rising some of them to the highest offices of state and destined so the wisest romans saw all the more clearly as the years rolled on to be soon the conquerors of the caesars and the masters of the western world  no wonder if that in such a state of things there arose such violent contrasts to the general weakness such eccentric protests against the general wickedness as may be seen in the figure of abbot paphnutius when compared either with the poor man tortured in prison for his arrears of taxes or with the governor and the officials who tortured him  no wonder if in such a state of things the minds of men were stirred by a passion akin to despair which ended in a new and grand form of suicide  it would have ended often but for christianity in such an actual despair as that which had led in past ages more than one noble roman to slay himself when he lost all hope for the republic  christianity taught those who despaired of society of the worldin one word of the roman empire and all that it had done for mento hope at least for a kingdom of god after death  it taught those who had they been heathens and brave enough would have slain themselves to escape out of a world which was no place for honest men that the body must be kept alive if for no other reason at least for the sake of the immortal soul doomed according to its works to endless bliss or endless torment  but that the worldsuch at least as they saw it thenwas doomed scripture and their own reason taught them  they did not merely believe but see in the misery and confusion the desolation and degradation around them that all that was in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life was not of the father but of the world that the world was passing away and the lust thereof and that only he who did the will of god could abide for ever  they did not merely believe but saw that the wrath of god was revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness of men and that the world in generalabove all its kings and rulers the rich and luxuriouswere treasuring up for themselves wrath tribulation and anguish against a day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god who would render to every man according to his works  that they were correct in their judgment of the world about them contemporary history proves abundantly  that they were correct likewise in believing that some fearful judgment was about to fall on man is proved by the fact that it did fall that the first half of the fifth century saw not only the sack of rome but the conquest and desolation of the greater part of the civilized world amid bloodshed misery and misrule which seemed to turn europe into a chaoswhich would have turned it into a chaos had there not been a few men left who still felt it possible and necessary to believe in god and to work righteousness  under these terrible forebodings men began to flee from a doomed world and try to be alone with god if by any means they might save each man his own soul in that dread day  others not christians had done the same before them  among all the eastern nations men had appeared from time to time to whom the things seen were but a passing phantom the things unseen the only true and eternal realities who tormented alike by the awfulness of the infinite unknown and by the petty cares and low passions of the finite mortal life which they knew but too well had determined to renounce the latter that they might give themselves up to solving the riddle of the former and be at peace and free at least from the tyranny of their own selves  eight hundred years before st antony fled into the desert that young hindoo rajah whom men call buddha now had fled into the forest leaving wives and kingdom to find rest for his soul  he denounced caste he preached poverty asceticism selfannihilation  he founded a religion like that of the old hermits democratic and ascetic with its convents saint worships pilgrimages miraculous relics rosaries and much more which strangely anticipates the monastic religion and his followers to this day are more numerous than those of any other creed  brahmins too had given themselves up to penance and mortification till they believed themselves able like kehama to have gained by selftorture the right to command not nature merely but the gods themselves  among the jews the essenes by the dead sea and the therapeutae in egypt had formed ascetic communities the former more practical the latter more contemplative but both alike agreed in the purpose of escaping from the world into a life of poverty and simplicity piety and virtue and among the countless philosophic sects of asia known to ecclesiastical writers as heretics more than one had professed and doubtless often practised the same abstraction from the world the same contempt of the flesh  the very neoplatonists of alexandria while they derided the christian asceticism found themselves forced to affect like the hapless hypatia a sentimental and pharisaic asceticism of their own  this phase of sight and feeling so strange to us now was common nay primaeval among the easterns  the day was come when it should pass from the east into the west  and egypt the mother of wonders the parent of so much civilization and philosophy both greek and roman the halfway restingplace through which not merely the merchandise but the wisdom of the east had for centuries passed into the roman empire a land more illgoverned too and more miserable in spite of its fertility because more defenceless and effeminate than most other roman possessionswas the country in which naturally and as it were of hereditary right such a movement would first appear  accordingly it was discovered about the end of the fourth century that the mountains and deserts of egypt were full of christian men who had fled out of the dying world in the hope of attaining everlasting life  wonderful things were told of their courage their abstinence their miracles  and of their virtues also of their purity their humility their helpfulness and charity to each other and to all  they called each other it was said brothers and they lived up to that sacred name forgotten if ever known by the rest of the roman empire  like the apostolic christians in the first fervour of their conversion they had all things in common they lived at peace with each other under a mild and charitable rule and kept literally those commands of christ which all the rest of the world explained away to nothing  the news spread  it chimed in with all that was best as well as with much that was questionable in the public mind  that men could be brothers that they could live without the tawdry luxury the tasteless and often brutal amusements the low sensuality the base intrigue the bloody warfare which was the accepted lot of the many that they could find time to look stedfastly at heaven and hell as awful realities which must be faced some day which had best be faced at once this just as much as curiosity about their alleged miracles and the selfish longing to rival them in superhuman powers led many of the most virtuous and the most learned men of the time to visit them and ascertain the truth jerome ruffinus evagrius sulpicius severus went to see them undergoing on the way the severest toils and dangers and brought back reports of mingled truth and falsehood specimens of which will be seen in these pages  travelling in those days was a labour if not of necessity then surely of love  palladius for instance found it impossible to visit the upper thebaid and syene and that infinite multitude of monks whose fashions of life no one would believe for they surpass human life who to this day raise the dead and walk upon the waters like peter and whatsoever the saviour did by the holy apostles he does now by them  but because it would be very dangerous if we went beyond lyco lycopolis on account of the inroad of robbers he could not see those saints  the holy men and women of whom he wrote he says he did not see without extreme toil and seven times he and his companions were nearly lost  once they walked through the desert five days and nights and were almost worn out by hunger and thirst  again they fell on rough marshes where the sedge pierced their feet and caused intolerable pain while they were almost killed with the cold  another time they stuck in the mud up to their waists and cried with david i am come into deep mire where no ground is another time they waded for four days through the flood of the nile by paths almost swept away  another time they met robbers on the seashore coming to diolcos and were chased by them for ten miles another time they were all but upset and drowned in crossing the nile  another time in the marshes of mareotis where paper grows they were cast on a little desert island and remained three days and nights in the open air amid great cold and showers for it was the season of epiphany  the eighth peril he says is hardly worth mentioningbut once when they went to nitria they came on a great hollow in which many crocodiles had remained when the waters retired from the fields  three of them lay along the bank and the monks went up to them thinking them dead whereon the crocodiles rushed at them  but when they called loudly on the lord the monsters as if turned away by an angel shot themselves into the water while they ran on to nitria meditating on the words of job seven times shall he deliver thee from trouble and in the eighth there shall no evil touch thee  the great st athanasius fleeing from persecution had taken refuge among these monks  he carried the report of their virtues to treves in gaul and wrote a life of st antony the perusal of which was a main agent in the conversion of st augustine  hilarion a remarkable personage whose history will be told hereafter carried their report and their example likewise into palestine and from that time judaea desolate and seemingly accursed by the sin of the jewish people became once more the holy land the place of pilgrimage whose ruins whose very soil were kept sacred by hermits the guardians of the footsteps of christ  in rome itself the news produced an effect which to the thoughtful mind is altogether tragical in its nobleness  the roman aristocracy was deprived of all political power it had been decimated too with horrible cruelty only one generation before 12 by valentinian and his satellites on the charges of profligacy treason and magic  mere rich men they still lingered on in idleness and luxury without art science true civilization of any kind followed by long trains of slaves punishing a servant with three hundred stripes if he were too long in bringing hot water weighing the fish or birds or dormice put on their tables while secretaries stood by with tablets to record all hating learning as they hated poison indulging at the baths in conduct which had best be left undescribed and complaining that they were not born among the cimmerians if amid their golden fans a fly should perch upon the silken fringes or a slender ray of the sun should pierce through the awning while if they go any distance to see their estates in the country or to hunt at a meeting collected for their amusement by others they think that they have equalled the marches of alexander or of caesar  on the wives widows and daughters of men of this stampand not half their effeminacy and baseness as the honest rough old soldier ammianus marcellinus describes it has been told herethe news brought from egypt worked with wondrous potency  women of the highest rank awoke suddenly to the discovery that life was given them for nobler purposes than that of frivolous enjoyment and tawdry vanity  despising themselves despising the husbands to whom they had been wedded in loveless marriages de convenance whose infidelities they had too often to endure  they too fled from a world which had sated and sickened them  they freed their slaves they gave away their wealth to found hospitals and to feed the poor and in voluntary poverty and mean garments they followed such men as jerome and ruffinus across the seas to visit the new found saints of the egyptian desert and to end their days in some cases in doleful monasteries in palestine  the lives of such women as those of the anician house the lives of marcella and furia of paula of the melanias and the rest it is not my task to write  they must be told by a woman not by a man  we may blame those ladies if we will for neglecting their duties  we may sneer if we will at the weaknessesthe aristocratic pride the spiritual vanitywhich we fancy that we discover  we may lamentand in that we shall not be wrongthe influence which such men as jerome obtained over them the example and precursor of so much which has since then been ruinous to family and social life  but we must confess that the fault lay not with the themselves but with their fathers husbands and brothers we must confess that in these women the spirit of the old roman matrons which seemed to have been so long dead flashed up for one splendid moment ere it sunk into the darkness of the middle age that in them woman asserted however strangely and fantastically her moral equality with man and that at the very moment when monasticism was consigning her to contempt almost to abhorrence as the noxious animal the fragile vessel the cause of mans fall at first and of his sin and misery ever since woman showed the monk to his naivelyconfessed surprise that she could dare and suffer and adore as well as he  but the movement having once seized the roman empire grew and spread irresistibly  it was accepted supported preached practised by every great man of the time  athanasius basil chrysostom gregory of nazianzen in the east jerome augustine ruffinus evagrius fulgentius sulpicius severus vincent of lerins john cassian martin of tours salvian caesarius of arles were all monks or as much of monks as their duties would allow them to be  ambrose of milan though no monk himself was the fervent preacher of the careful legislator for monasticism male and female  throughout the whole roman empire in the course of a century had spread hermits or dwellers in the desert anchorites retired from the world or monks dwellers alone  the three names grew afterwards to designate three different orders of ascetics  the hermits remained through the middle ages those who dwelt in deserts the anchorites or ankers of the english middle age seem generally to have inhabited cells built in or near the church walls the name of monks was transferred from those who dwelt alone to those who dwelt in regular communities under a fixed government  but the three names at first were interchangeable the three modes of life alternated often in the same man  the life of all three was the samecelibacy poverty good deeds towards their fellowmen selfrestraint and sometimes selftorture of every kind to atone as far as might be for the sins committed after baptism  and the mental food of all three was the same likewise continued meditation upon the vanity of the world the sinfulness of the flesh the glories of heaven and the horrors of hell  but with these the old hermits combinedto do them justicea personal faith in god and a personal love for christ which those who sneer at them would do well to copy  over all europe even to ireland 15 the same pattern of christian excellence repeated itself with strange regularity till it became the only received pattern and to enter religion or be converted meant simply to become a monk  of the authentic biographies of certain of these men a few specimens are given in this volume  if they shall seem to any reader uncouth or even absurd he must remember that they are the only existing and the generally contemporaneous histories of men who exercised for 1300 years an enormous influence over the whole of christendom who exercise a vast influence over the greater part of it to this day  they are the biographies of men who were regarded during their lives and after their deaths as divine and inspired prophets and who were worshipped with boundless trust and admiration by millions of human beings  their fame and power were not created by the priesthood  the priesthood rather leant on them than they on it  they occupied a post analogous to that of the old jewish prophets always independent of sometimes opposed to the regular clergy and dependent altogether on public opinion and the suffrage of the multitude  when christianity after three centuries of repression and persecution emerged triumphant as the creed of the whole civilized world it had become what their lives describe the model of religious life for the fifth century it remained a model for succeeding centuries on the lives of st antony and his compeers were founded the whole literature of saintly biographies the whole popular conception of the universe and of mans relation to it the whole science of daemonology with its peculiar literature its peculiar system of criminal jurisprudence  and their influence did not cease at the reformation among protestant divines  the influence of these lives of the hermit fathers is as much traceable even to style and language in the pilgrims progress as in the last papal allocution  the great hermits of egypt were not merely the founders of that vast monastic system which influenced the whole politics and wars and social life as well as the whole religion of the middle age they were a school of philosophers as they rightly called themselves who altered the whole current of human thought  those who wish for a general notion of the men and of their time will find all that they require set forth from different points of view though with the same honesty and learning in gibbon in m de montalemberts moines doccident in dean milmans history of christianity and latin christianity and in ozanams etudes germaniques 17a  but the truest notion of the men is to be got after all from the original documents and especially from that curious collection of them by the jesuit rosweyde commonly known as the lives of the hermit fathers 17b  after an acquaintance of now fiveandtwenty years with this wonderful treasury of early christian mythology to which all fairy tales are dull and meagre i am almost inclined to sympathise with m de montalemberts questionswho is so ignorant or so unfortunate as not to have devoured these tales of the heroic age of monachism  who has not contemplated if not with the eyes of faith at least with the admiration inspired by an incontrollable greatness of soul the struggles of these athletes of penitence      everything is to be found therevariety pathos the sublime and simple epic of a race of men naifs as children and strong as giants  in whatever else one may differ from m de montalembert and it is always painful to differ from one whose pen has been always the faithful servant of virtue and piety purity and chivalry loyalty and liberty and whose generous appreciation of england and the english is the more honourable to him by reason of an utter divergence in opinion which in less wide and noble spirits produces only antipathyone must at least agree with him in his estimate of the importance of these lives of the fathers not only to the ecclesiologist but to the psychologist and the historian their influence subtle often transformed and modified again and again but still potent from its very subtleness is being felt around us in many a puzzleeducational social political and promises to be felt still more during the coming generation and to have studied thoroughly one of themsay the life of st antony by st athanasiusis to have had in our hands whether we knew it or not the key to many a lock which just now refuses either to be tampered with or burst open  i have determined therefore to give a few of these lives translated as literally as possible  thus the reader will then have no reason to fear a garbled or partial account of personages so difficult to conceive or understand  he will be able to see the men as wholes to judge according to his light of their merits and their defects  the very style of their biographers which is copied as literally as is compatible with the english tongue will teach him if he be wise somewhat of the temper and habits of thought of the age in which they lived and one of these original documents with its honesty its vivid touches of contemporary manners its intense earnestness will give perhaps a more true picture of the whole hermit movement than with all respect be it said the most brilliant general panorama  it is impossible to give in this series all the lives of the early hermitseven of those contained in rosweyde  this volume will contain therefore only the most important and most famous lives of the egyptian syrian and persian hermits followed perhaps by a few later biographies from western europe as proofs that the hermittype as it spread toward the atlantic remained still the same as in the egyptian desert  against one modern mistake the reader must be warned the theory namely that these biographies were written as religious romances edifying but not historical to be admired but not believed there is not the slightest evidence that such was the case  the lives of these and most other saints certainly those in this volume were written by men who believed the stories themselves after such inquiry into the facts as they deemed necessary who knew that others would believe them and who intended that they should do so and the stones were believed accordingly and taken as matter of fact for the most practical purposes by the whole of christendom the forging of miracles like the forging of charters for the honour of a particular shrine or the advantage of a particular monastery belongs to a much later and much worse age and whatsoever we may think of the taste of the authors of these lives or of their faculty for judging of evidence we must at least give them credit for being earnest men incapable of what would have been in their eyes and ought to be in ours not merely falsehood but impiety  let the reader be sure of thisthat these documents would not have exercised their enormous influence on the human mind had there not been in them under whatever accidents of credulity and even absurdity an element of sincerity virtue and nobility    saint antony    the life of antony by athanasius is perhaps the most important of all these biographies because first antony was generally held to be the first great example and preacher of the hermit life because next athanasius his biographer having by his controversial writings established the orthodox faith as it is now held alike by romanists greeks and protestants did by his publication of the life of antony establish the hermit life as the ideal in his opinion of christian excellence and lastly because that biography exercised a most potent influence on the conversion of st augustine the greatest thinker always excepting st paul whom the world had seen since plato whom the world was to see again till lord bacon the theologian and philosopher for he was the latter as well as the former in the strictest sense to whom the world owes not only the formulizing of the whole scheme of the universe for a thousand years after his death but calvinism wrongly so called in all its forms whether held by the augustinian party in the church of rome or the reformed churches of geneva france and scotland  whether we have the exact text of the document as athanasius wrote it to the foreign brethrenprobably the religious folk of treves in the greek version published by heschelius in 1611 and in certain earlier greek texts whether the latin translation attributed to evagrius which has been well known for centuries past in the latin church be actually his whether it be exactly that of which st jerome speaks and whether it be exactly that which st augustine saw are questions which it is now impossible to decide but of the genuineness of the life in its entirety we have no right to doubt contrary to the verdicts of the most distinguished scholars whether protestant or catholic and there is fair reason to suppose that the document allowing for errors and variations of transcribers which i have tried to translate is that of which the great st augustine speaks in the eighth book of his confessions  he tells us that he was reclaimed at last from a profligate life the thought of honourable marriage seems never to have entered his mind by meeting while practising as a rhetorician at treves an old african acquaintance named potitanius an officer of rank what followed no words can express so well as those of the great genius himself  when i told him that i was giving much attention to those writings the epistles of paul we began to talk and he to tell of antony the monk of egypt whose name was then very famous among thy servants  23 but was unknown to us till that moment  when he discovered that he spent some time over the subject detailing his virtues and wondering at our ignorance  we were astounded at hearing such wellattested marvels of him so recent and almost contemporaneous wrought in the right faith of the catholic church we all wondered  we that they were so great and he that we had not heard of them  thence his discourse ran on to those flocks of hermitcells and the morals of thy sweetness and the fruitful deserts of the wilderness of which we knew nought  there was a monastery too at milan full of good brethren outside the city walls under the tutelage of ambrosius and we knew nothing of it he went on still speaking and we listened intently and it befell that he told us how i know not when he and three of his mess companions at treves while the emperor was engaged in an afternoon spectacle in the circus went out for a walk in the gardens round the walls and as they walked there in pairs one with him alone and the two others by themselves they parted  and those two straying about burst into a cottage where dwelt certain servants of thine poor in spirit of such as is the kingdom of heaven and there found a book in which was written the life of antony  one of them began to read it and to wonder and to be warned and as he read to think of taking up such a life and leaving the warfare of this world to serve thee  now he was one of those whom they call managers of affairs 24  then suddenly filled with holy love and sober shame angered at himself he cast his eyes on his friend and said tell me prithee with all these labours of ours whither are we trying to get  what are we seeking  for what are we soldiering can we have a higher hope in the palace than to become friends of the emperor  and when there what is not frail and full of dangers and through how many dangers we do not arrive at a greater danger still  and how long will that last  but if i choose to become a friend of god i can do it here and now  he spoke thus and swelling in the labourpangs of a new life he fixed his eyes again on the pages and read and was changed inwardly as thou lookedst on him and his mind was stripped of the world as soon appeared  for while he read and rolled over the billows of his soul he shuddered and hesitated from time to time and resolved better things and already thine he said to his friend i have already torn myself from that hope of ours and have settled to serve god and this i begin from this hour in this very place  if you do not like to imitate me do not oppose me  he replied that he would cling to his companion in such a great service and so great a warfare  and both now thine began building at their own cost the tower of leaving all things and following thee  then potitianus and the man who was talking with him elsewhere in the garden seeking them came to the same place and warned them to return as the sun was getting low  they however told their resolution and how it had sprung up and taken strong hold in them and entreated the others not to give them pain  they not altered from their former mode of life yet wept as he told us for themselves and congratulated them piously and commended themselves to their prayers and then dragging their hearts along the earth went back to the palace  but the others fixing their hearts on heaven remained in the cottage  and both of them had affianced brides who when they heard this dedicated their virginity to thee  the part which this incident played in st augustines own conversion must be told hereafter in his life  but the scene which his masterhand has drawn is not merely the drama of his own soul or of these two young officers but of a whole empire  it is as i said at first the tragedy and suicide of the old empire and the birthagony of which he speaks was not that of an individual soul here or there but of a whole new world for good and evil  the old roman soul was dead within the body of it dead without patriotism duty purpose of life save pleasure money and intrigue had perished  the young roman officer had nothing left for which to fight the young roman gentleman nothing left for which to be a citizen and an owner of lands  even the old roman longing which was also a sacred duty of leaving an heir to perpetuate his name and serve the state as his fathers had before himeven that was gone  nothing was left with the many but selfishness which could rise at best into the desire of saving every man his own soul and so transform worldliness into otherworldliness  the old empire could do nothing more for man and knew that it could do nothing and lay down in the hermits cell to die  treves was then the second metropolis of the empire boasting perhaps even then as it boasts still that it was standing thirteen hundred years before rome was built  amid the low hills pierced by rocky dells and on a strath of richest soil it had grown from the mudhut town of the treviri into a noble city of palaces theatres baths triumphalarches on either side the broad and clear moselle  the bridge which augustus had thrown across the river four hundred years before the times of hermits and of saints stood like a cliff through all barbarian invasions through all the battles and sieges of the middle age till it was blown up by the french in the wars of louis xiv and nought remains save the huge piers of black lava stemming the blue stream while up and down the dwindled city the colossal fragments of roman workthe black gate the heidenthurm the baths the basilica or hall of justice now a lutheran churchstand out half ruined like the fossil bones of giants amid the works of weaker though of happier times while the amphitheatre was till late years planted thick with vines fattening in soil drenched with the blood of thousands  treves had been the haunt of emperor after emperor men wise and strong cruel and terribleof constantius constantine the great julian valentinian valens and lastly when potitianuss friends found those poor monks in the garden 27 of gratian the gentle hunter who thought day and night on sport till his arrows were said to be instinct with life was holding his military court within the walls of treves or at that hunting palace on the northern downs where still on the bathfloors lie the mosaics of hare and deer and boar and hound on which the feet of emperors trod full fifteen hundred years ago  still glorious outwardly like the roman empire itself was that great city of treves but inwardly it was full of rottenness and weakness  the roman empire had been in spite of all its crimes for four hundred years the salt of the earth  but now the salt had lost its savour and in one generation more it would be trodden under foot and cast upon the dunghill and another empire would take its placethe empire not of brute strength and selfindulgence but of sympathy and selfdenialan empire not of caesars but of hermits  already was gratian the friend and pupil of st ambrose of milan already too was he persecuting though not to the death heretics and heathens  nay some fifty years before if the legend can be in the least trusted had st helena the mother of constantine the great returned from palestine bearing with herso men believednot only the miraculously discovered cross of christ but the seamless coat which he had worn and turning her palace into a church deposited the holy coat therein  whereso some believeit remains until this day  men felt that a change was coming but whence it would come or how terrible it would be they could not tell  it was to be as the prophet says like the bulging out of a great wall which bursteth suddenly in an instant in the very amphitheatre where gratian sat that afternoon with all the folk of treves about him watching it may be lions and antelopes from africa slaughteredit may be criminals tortured to deathanother and an uglier sight had been twice seen some seventy years before  constantine socalled the great had there exhibited his frankish sports the magnificent spectacle the famous punishments as his flattering courthistorians called them thousands of frank prisoners many of them of noble and even of royal blood torn to pieces by wild beasts while they stood fearless smiling with folded arms and when the wild beasts were gorged and slew no more weapons were put into the hands of the survivors and they were bidden to fight to the death for the amusement of their roman lords  but fight they would not against their own flesh and blood  and as for life all chance of that was long gone by  so every man fell joyfully upon his brothers sword and dying like a german man spoilt the sport of the good folk of treves  and it seemed for a while as if there were no god in heaven who cared to avenge such deeds of blood  for the kinsmen it may be the very sons of those franks were now in gratians pay and the frank merobaudes was his count of the domestics and one of his most successful and trusted generals and all seemed to go well and brute force and craft to triumph on the earth  and yet those two young staff officers when they left the imperial court for the hermits cell judged on the whole prudently and well and chose the better part when they fled from the world to escape the dangers of ambition and the greater danger still of success  for they escaped not merely from vice and worldliness but as the event proved from imminent danger of death if they kept the loyalty which they had sworn to their emperor or the worse evil of baseness if they turned traitors to him to save their lives  for little thought gratian as he sat in that amphitheatre that the day was coming when he the hunter of gameand of hereticswould be hunted in his turn when deserted by his army betrayed by merobaudeswhose elder kinsfolk were not likely to have kept him ignorant of the frankish sports he should flee pitiably towards italy and die by a german hand some say near lyons some say near belgrade calling on ambrose with his latest breath 29  little thought too the good folk of treves as they sat beneath the vast awning that afternoon that within the next half century a day of vengeance was coming for them which should teach them that there was a god who maketh inquisition for blood a day when treves should be sacked in blood and flame by those very barbarian germans whom they fancied their alliesor their slaves  and least of all did they fancy that when that great destruction fell upon their city the only element in it which would pass safely through the fire and rise again and raise their city to new glory and power was that which was represented by those poor hermits in the gardenhut outside  little thought they that above the awful arches of the black gateas if in mockery of the roman powera lean anchorite would take his stand simeon of syracuse by name a monk of mount sinai and there imitate in the far west the austerities of st simeon stylites in the east and be enrolled in the new pantheon not of caesars but of saints  under the supposed patronage of those saints treves rose again out of its ruins  it gained its four great abbeys of st maximus on the site of constantines palace st matthias in the crypt whereof the bodies of the monks never decay 30 st martin and st mary of the four martyrs where four soldiers of the famous theban legion are said to have suffered martyrdom by the house of the roman prefect  it had its cathedral of st peter and st helena supposed to be built out of st helenas palace its exquisite liebfrauenkirche its palace of the old archbishops mighty potentates of this world as well as of the kingdom of heaven  for they were princes archchancellors electors of the empire owning many a league of fertile land governing and that kindly and justly towns and villages of christian men and now and then going out to war at the head of their own knights and yeomen in defence of their lands and of the saints whose servants and trustees they were and so became according to their light and their means the salt of that land for many generations  and after a while that salt too lost its savour and was in its turn trodden under foot  the french republican wars swept away the ecclesiastical constitution and the wealth of the ancient city  the cathedral and churches were stripped of relics of jewels of treasures of early art  the princebishops palace is a barrack so was lately st maximuss shrine st martins a china manufactory and st matthiass a school  treves belongs to prussia and not to holy church and all the old splendours of the empire of the saints are almost as much ruinate as those of the empire of the romans  so goes the world because there is a living god   the old order changeth giving place to the new and god fulfils himself in many ways lest one good custom should corrupt the world   but though palaces and amphitheatres be gone the gardens outside still bloom on as when potitianus his friends wandered through them perpetual as natures self and perpetual as nature too endures whatever is good and true of that afternoons work and of that finding of the legend of st antony in the monks cabin which fixed the destiny of the great genius of the latin church  the story of st antony as it has been handed down to us 32 runs thus   the life and conversation of our holy father antony written and sent to the monks in foreign parts by our father among the saints athanasius archbishop of alexandria  you have begun a noble rivalry with the monks of egypt having determined either to equal or even to surpass them in your training towards virtue for there are monasteries already among you and the monastic life is practised  this purpose of yours one may justly praise and if you pray god will bring it to perfection  but since you have also asked me about the conversation of the holy antony wishing to learn how he began his training and who he was before it and what sort of an end he made to his life and whether what is said of him is true in order that you may bring yourselves to emulate him with great readiness i received your command  for to me too it is a great gain and benefit only to remember antony and i know that you when you hear of him after you have wondered at the man will wish also to emulate his purpose  for the life of antony is for monks a perfect pattern of ascetic training  what then you have heard about him from other informants do not disbelieve but rather think that you have heard from them a small part of the facts  for in any case they could hardly relate fully such great matters when even i at your request howsoever much i may tell you in my letter can only send you a little which i remember about him  but do not cease to inquire of those who sail from hence for perhaps if each tells what he knows at last his history may be worthily compiled  i had wished indeed when i received your letter to send for some of the monks who were wont to be most frequently in his company that i might learn something more and send you a fuller account  but since both the season of navigation limited me and the lettercarrier was in haste i hastened to write to your piety what i myself know for i have often seen him and what i was able to learn from one who followed him for no short time and poured water upon his hands always taking care of the truth in order that no one when he hears too much may disbelieve nor again if he learns less than is needful despise the man  antony was an egyptian by race born of noble parents 33 who had a sufficient property of their own  and as they were christians he too was christianly brought up and when a boy was nourished in the house of his parents besides whom and his home he knew nought  but when he grew older he would not be taught letters 34 not wishing to mix with other boys but all his longing was according to what is written of jacob to dwell simply in his own house  but when his parents took him into the lords house he was not saucy like a boy nor inattentive as he grew older but was subject to his parents and attentive to what was read turning it to his own account  nor again as a boy who was moderately well off did he trouble his parents for various and expensive dainties nor did he run after the pleasures of this life but was content with what he found and asked for nothing more  when his parents died he was left alone with a little sister when he was about eighteen or twenty years of age and took care both of his house and of her but not six months after their death as he was going as usual to the lords house and collecting his thoughts he meditated as he walked how the apostles had left all and followed the saviour and how those in the acts brought the price of what they had sold and laid it at the apostles feet to be given away to the poor and what and how great a hope was laid up for them in heaven  with this in his mind he entered the church  and it befell then that the gospel was being read and he heard how the lord had said to the rich man if thou wilt be perfect go sell all thou hast and give to the poor and come follow me and thou shalt have treasure in heaven  antony therefore as if the remembrance of the saints had come to him from god and as if the lesson had been read on his account went forth at once from the lords house and gave away to those of his own village the possessions he had inherited from his ancestors three hundred ploughlands fertile and very fair that they might give no trouble either to him or his sister  all his moveables he sold and a considerable sum which he received for them he gave to the poor  but having kept back a little for his sister when he went again into the lords house he heard the lord saying in the gospel take no thought for the morrow and unable to endure any more delay he went out and distributed that too to the needy and having committed his sister to known and faithful virgins and given to her wherewith to be educated in a nunnery he himself thenceforth devoted himself outside his house to training 35 taking heed to himself and using himself severely  for monasteries were not then common in egypt nor did any monks at all know the wide desert but each who wished to take heed to himself exercised himself alone not far from his own village  there was then in the next village an old man who had trained himself in a solitary life from his youth  when antony saw him he emulated him in that which is noble  and first he began to stay outside the village and then if he heard of any earnest man he went to seek him like a wise bee and did not return till he had seen him and having got from him as it were provision for his journey toward virtue went his way  so dwelling there at first he settled his mind neither to look back towards his parents wealth nor to recollect his relations but he put all his longing and all his earnestness on training himself more intensely  for the rest he worked with his hands because he had heard if any man will not work neither let him eat and of his earnings he spent some on himself and some on the needy  he prayed continually because he knew that one ought to pray secretly without ceasing  he attended also so much to what was read that with him none of the scriptures fell to the ground but he retained them all and for the future his memory served him instead of books  behaving thus antony was beloved by all and submitted truly to the earnest men to whom he used to go  and from each of them he learnt some improvement in his earnestness and his training  he contemplated the courtesy of one and anothers assiduity in prayer anothers freedom from anger anothers love of mankind  he took heed to one as he watched to another as he studied  one he admired for his endurance another for his fasting and sleeping on the ground he laid to heart the meekness of one and the longsuffering of another and stamped upon his memory the devotion to christ and the mutual love which all in common possessed  and thus filled full he returned to his own place of training gathering to himself what he had got from each and striving to show all their qualities in himself  he never emulated those of his own age save in what is best and did that so as to pain no one but make all rejoice over him  and all in the village who loved good seeing him thus called him the friend of god and some embraced him as a son some as a brother  but the devil who hates and envies what is noble would not endure such a purpose in a youth  but attempted against him all that he is wont to do suggesting to him the remembrance of his wealth care for his sister relation to his kindred love of money love of glory the various pleasures of luxury and the other solaces of life and then the harshness of virtue and its great toil and the weakness of his body and the length of time and altogether raised a great dustcloud of arguments in his mind trying to turn him back from his righteous choice  but when the enemy saw himself to be too weak for antonys determination but rather baffled by his stoutness and overthrown by his great faith and falling before his continual prayers then he attacked him with the temptations which he is wont to use against young men     but he protected his body with faith prayers and fastings    setting his thoughts on christ and on his own nobility through christ and on the rational faculties of his soul    and again on the terrors of the fire and the torment of the worm    and thus escaped unhurt  and thus was the enemy brought to shame  for he who thought himself to be equal with god was now mocked by a youth and he who boasted against flesh and blood was defeated by a man clothed in flesh  for the lord worked with him who bore flesh on our account and gave to the body victory over the devil that each man in his battle may say not i but the grace of god which is with me  at last when the dragon could not overthrow antony even thus but saw himself thrust out of his heart then gnashing his teeth as is written and as if beside himself he appeared to the sight as he is to the reason as a black child and as it were falling down before him no longer attempted to argue for the deceiver was cast out but using a human voice said i have deceived many i have cast down many  but now as in the case of many so in thine i have been worsted in the battle  then when antony asked him who art thou who speakest thus to me he forthwith replied in a pitiable voice i am the spirit of impurity    then antony gave thanks to god and gaining courage said thou art utterly despicable for thou art black of soul and weak as a child nor shall i henceforth cast one thought on thee  for the lord is my helper and i shall despise my enemies  that black being hearing this fled forthwith cowering at his words and afraid thenceforth of coming near the man  this was antonys first struggle against the devil  or rather this mighty deed in him was the saviours who condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the lord should be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit  but neither did antony because the daemon had fallen grow careless and despise him neither did the enemy when worsted by him cease from lying in ambush against him  for he came round again as a lion seeking a pretence against him  but antony had learnt from scripture that many are the devices of the enemy and continually kept up his training considering that though he had not deceived his heart by pleasure he would try some other snares  for the daemon delights in sin  therefore he chastised his body more and more and brought it into slavery lest having conquered in one case he should be tripped up in others  he determined therefore to accustom himself to a still more severe life and many wondered at him  but the labour was to him easy to bear  for the readiness of the spirit through long usage had created a good habit in him so that taking a very slight hint from others he showed great earnestness in it for he watched so much that he often passed the whole night without sleep and that not once but often to the astonishment of men  he ate once a day after the setting of the sun and sometimes only once in two days often even in four his food was bread with salt his drink nothing but water  to speak of flesh and wine there is no need for such a thing is not found among other earnest men  when he slept he was content with a rushmat  but mostly he lay on the bare ground  he would not anoint himself with oil saying that it was more fit for young men to be earnest in training than to seek things which softened the body and that they must accustom themselves to labour according to the apostles saying when i am weak then i am strong for that the mind was strengthened as bodily pleasure was weakened  and this argument of his was truly wonderful  for he did not measure the path of virtue nor his going away into retirement on account of it by time but by his own desire and will  so forgetting the past he daily as if beginning afresh took more pains to improve saying over to himself continually the apostles words forgetting what is behind stretching forward to what is before and mindful too of elias speech the lord liveth before whom i stand this day  for he held that by mentioning today he took no account of past time but as if he were laying down a beginning he tried earnestly to make himself day by day fit to appear before god pure in heart and ready to obey his will and no other  and he said in himself that the ascetic ought for ever to be learning his own life from the manners of the great elias as from a mirror  antony having thus as it were bound himself went to the tombs which happened to be some way from the village and having bidden one of his acquaintances to bring him bread at intervals of many days he entered one of the tombs and shutting the door upon himself remained there alone  but the enemy not enduring that but rather terrified lest in a little while he should fill the desert with his training coming one night with a multitude of daemons beat him so much with stripes that he lay speechless from the torture  for he asserted that the pain was so great that no blows given by men could cause such agony  but by the providence of god for the lord does not overlook those who hope in him the next day his acquaintance came bringing him the loaves  and having opened the door and seeing him lying on the ground for dead he carried him to the lords house in the village and laid him on the ground and many of his kinsfolk and the villagers sat round him as round a corpse but about midnight antony coming to himself and waking up saw them all sleeping and only his acquaintance awake and nodding to him to approach begged him to carry him back to the tombs without waking any one  when that was done the doors were shut and he remained as before alone inside  and because he could not stand on account of the daemons blows he prayed prostrate  and after his prayer he said with a shout here am i antony  i do not fly from your stripes yea if you do yet more nothing shall separate me from the love of christ  and then he sang if an host be laid against me yet shall not my heart be afraid  thus thought and spoke the man who was training himself  but the enemy hater of what is noble and envious wondering that he dared to return after the stripes called together his dogs and bursting with rageye see he said that we have not stopped this man by the spirit of impurity nor by blows  but he is even growing bolder against us let us attack him some other way 41  for it is easy for the devil to invent schemes of mischief  so then in the night they made such a crash that the whole place seemed shaken and the daemons as if breaking in the four walls of the room seemed to enter through them changing themselves into the shapes of beasts and creeping things 42 and the place was forthwith filled with shapes of lions bears leopards bulls and snakes asps scorpions and wolves and each of them moved according to his own fashion  the lion roared longing to attack the bull seemed to toss the serpent did not cease creeping and the wolf rushed upon him and altogether the noises of all the apparitions were dreadful and their tempers cruel  but antony scourged and pierced by them felt a more dreadful bodily pain than before  but he lay unshaken and awake in spirit  he groaned at the pain of his body  but clear in intellect and as it were mocking he said if there were any power in you it were enough that one of you should come on but since the lord has made you weak therefore you try to frighten me by mere numbers  and a proof of your weakness is that you imitate the shapes of brute animals  and taking courage he said again if ye can and have received power against me delay not but attack but if ye cannot why do ye disturb me in vain  for a seal to us and a wall of safety is our faith in the lord  the daemons having made many efforts gnashed their teeth at him because he rather mocked at them than they at him  but neither then did the lord forget antonys wrestling but appeared to help him  for looking up he saw the roof as it were opened and a ray of light coming down towards him  the daemons suddenly became invisible and the pain of his body forthwith ceased and the building became quite whole  but antony feeling the succour and getting his breath again and freed from pain questioned the vision which appeared saying where wert thou  why didst thou not appear to me from the first to stop my pangs  and a voice came to him antony i was here but i waited to see thy fight  therefore since thou hast withstood and not been worsted i will be to thee always a succour and will make thee become famous everywhere  hearing this he rose and prayed and was so strong that he felt that he had more power in his body than he had before  he was then about thirtyandfive years old  and on the morrow he went out and was yet more eager for devotion to god and going to that old man aforesaid he asked him to dwell with him in the desert  but when he declined because of his age and because no such custom had yet arisen he himself straightway set off to the mountain  but the enemy again seeing his earnestness and wishing to hinder it cast in his way the phantom of a great silver plate  but antony perceiving the trick of him who hates what is noble stopped  and he judged the plate worthless seeing the devil in it and said whence comes a plate in the desert this is no beaten way nor is there here the footstep of any traveller  had it fallen it could not have been unperceived from its great size and besides he who lost it would have turned back and found it because the place is desert  this is a trick of the devil  thou shalt not hinder devil my determination by this  let it go with thee into perdition  and as antony said that it vanished as smoke from before the face of the fire  then again he saw not this time a phantom but real gold lying in the way as he came up  but whether the enemy showed it him or whether some better power which was trying the athlete and showing the devil that he did not care for real wealth neither did he tell nor do we know save that it was real gold  antony wondering at the abundance of it so stepped over it as over fire and so passed it by that he never turned but ran on in haste until he had lost sight of the place  and growing even more and more intense in his determination he rushed up the mountain and finding an empty inclosure full of creeping things on account of its age he betook himself across the river and dwelt in it  the creeping things as if pursued by some one straightway left the place  but he blocked up the entry having taken with him loaves for six months for the thebans do this and they often remain a whole year fresh and having water with him entering as into a sanctuary into that monastery 44 he remained alone never going forth and never looking at any one who came  thus he passed a long time there training himself and only twice a year received loaves let down from above through the roof  but those of his acquaintance who came to him as they often remained days and nights outside for he did not allow any one to enter used to hear as it were crowds inside clamouring thundering lamenting cryingdepart from our ground what dost thou even in the desert  thou canst not abide our onset at first those without thought that there were some men fighting with him and that they had got in by ladders  but when peeping in through a crack they saw no one then they took for granted that they were daemons and being terrified called themselves on antony but he rather listened to them than cared for the others  for his acquaintances came up continually expecting to find him dead and heard him singing let the lord arise and his enemies shall be scattered and let them who hate him flee before him  as wax melts from before the face of the fire so shall sinners perish from before the face of god  and again all nations compassed me round about and in the name of the lord i repelled them  he endured then for twenty years thus training himself alone neither going forth nor seen by any one for long periods of time  but after this when many longed for him and wished to imitate his training and others who knew him came and were bursting in the door by force antony came forth as from some inner shrine initiated into the mysteries and bearing the god 45  and then first he appeared out of the inclosure to those who were coming to him  and when they saw him they wondered for his body had kept the same habit and had neither grown fat nor lean from fasting nor worn by fighting with the daemons  for he was just such as they had known him before his retirement  they wondered again at the purity of his soul because it was neither contracted as if by grief nor relaxed by pleasure nor possessed by laughter or by depression for he was neither troubled at beholding the crowd nor overjoyful at being saluted by too many but was altogether equal as being governed by reason and standing on that which is according to nature  many sufferers in body who were present did the lord heal by him and others he purged from daemons  and he gave to antony grace in speaking so that he comforted many who grieved and reconciled others who were at variance exhorting all to prefer nothing in the world to the love of christ and persuading and exhorting them to be mindful of the good things to come and of the love of god towards us who spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all  he persuaded many to choose the solitary life and so thenceforth cells sprang up in the mountains and the desert was colonized by monks who went forth from their own and registered themselves in the city which is in heaven  and when he had need to cross the arsenoite canal and the need was the superintendence of the brethren the canal was full of crocodiles  and having only prayed he entered it and both he and all who were with him went through it unharmed  but when he returned to the cell he persisted in the noble labours of his youth and by continued exhortations he increased the willingness of those who were already monks and stirred to love of training the greater number of the rest and quickly as his speech drew men on the cells became more numerous and he governed them all as a father  and when he had gone forth one day and all the monks had come to him desiring to hear some word from him he spake to them in the egyptian tongue thusthat the scriptures were sufficient for instruction but that it was good for us to exhort each other in the faith     here follows a long sermon historically important as being the earliest christian attempt to reduce to a science daemonology and the temptation of daemons  but its involved and rhetorical form proves sufficiently that it could not have been delivered by an unlettered man like antony  neither is it probably even composed by st athanasius it seems rather like several other passages in this biography the interpolation of some later scribe  it has been therefore omitted  and when antony had spoken thus all rejoiced and in one the love of virtue was increased in another negligence stirred up and in others conceit stopped while all were persuaded to despise the plots of the devil wondering at the grace which had been given to antony by the lord for the discernment of spirits  so the cells in the mountains were like tents filled with divine choirs singing discoursing fasting praying rejoicing over the hope of the future working that they might give alms thereof and having love and concord with each other  and there was really to be seen as it were a land by itself of piety and justice for there was none there who did wrong or suffered wrong  no blame from any talebearer  but a multitude of men training themselves and in all of them a mind set on virtue  so that any one seeing the cells and such an array of monks would have cried out and said how fair are thy dwellings o jacob and thy tents o israel like shady groves and like parks beside a river and like tents which the lord hath pitched and like cedars by the waters  he himself meanwhile withdrawing according to his custom alone to his own cell increased the severity of his training  and he groaned daily considering the mansions in heaven and setting his longing on them and looking at the ephemeral life of man  for even when he was going to eat or sleep he was ashamed when he considered the rational element of his soul so that often when he was about to eat with many other monks he remembered the spiritual food and declined and went far away from them thinking that he should blush if he was seen by others eating  he ate nevertheless by himself on account of the necessities of the body and often too with the brethren being bashful with regard to them but plucking up heart for the sake of saying something that might be useful and used to tell them that they ought to give all their leisure rather to the soul than to the body and that they should grant a very little time to the body for mere necessitys sake  but that their whole leisure should be rather given to the soul and should seek her profit that she may not be drawn down by the pleasures of the body but rather the body be led captive by her  for this he said was what was spoken by the saviour be not anxious for your soul what ye shall eat nor for your body what ye shall put on  and seek not what ye shall eat nor what ye shall drink neither let your minds be in suspense  for after all these things the nations of the world seek  but your father knoweth that ye need all these things rather seek first his kingdom and all these things shall be added unto you  after these things the persecution which happened under the maximinus of that time 49 laid hold of the church and when the holy martyrs were brought to alexandria antony too followed leaving his cell and saying let us depart too that we may wrestle if we be called or see them wrestling  and he longed to be a martyr himself but not choosing to give himself up he ministered to the confessors in the mines and in the prisons  and he was very earnest in the judgmenthall to excite the readiness of those who were called upon to wrestle and to receive and bring on their way till they were perfected those of them who went to martyrdom  at last the judge seeing the fearlessness and earnestness of him and those who were with him commanded that none of the monks should appear in the judgmenthall or haunt at all in the city  so all the rest thought good to hide themselves that day but antony cared so much for the order that he all the rather washed his cloak and stood next day upon a high place and appeared to the general in shining white  therefore when all the rest wondered and the general saw him and passed by with his array he stood fearless showing forth the readiness of us christians  for he himself prayed to be a martyr as i have said and was like one grieved because he had not borne his witness  but the lord was preserving him for our benefit and that of the rest that he might become a teacher to many in the training which he had learnt from scripture  for many when they only saw his manner of life were eager to emulate it  so he again ministered continually to the confessors and as if bound with them wearied himself in his services  and when at last the persecution ceased and the blessed bishop peter had been martyred he left the city and went back to his cell  and he was there day by day a martyr in his conscience and wrestling in the conflict of faith for he imposed on himself a much more severe training than before and his garment was within of hair without of skin which he kept till his end  he neither washed his body with water nor ever cleansed his feet nor actually endured putting them into water unless it were necessary  and no one ever saw him unclothed till he was dead and about to be buried  when then he retired and had resolved neither to go forth himself nor to receive any one one martinianus a captain of soldiers came and gave trouble to antony  for he had with him his daughter who was tormented by a daemon  and while he remained a long time knocking at the door and expecting him to come to pray to god for the child antony could not bear to open but leaning from above said man why criest thou to me  i too am a man as thou art  but if thou believest pray to god and it comes to pass forthwith therefore he believed and called on christ and went away with his daughter cleansed from the daemon  and many other things the lord did by him saying ask and it shall be given you  for most of the sufferers when he did not open the door only sat down outside the cell and believing and praying honestly were cleansed  but when he saw himself troubled by many and not being permitted to retire as he wished being afraid lest he himself should be puffed up by what the lord was doing by him or lest others should count of him above what he was he resolved to go to the upper thebaid to those who knew him not  and in fact having taken loaves from the brethren he sat down on the bank of the river watching for a boat to pass that he might embark and go up in it  and as he watched a voice came to him  antony whither art thou going and why  and he not terrified but as one accustomed to be often called thus answered when he heard it because the crowds will not let me be at rest therefore am i minded to go up to the upper thebaid on account of the many annoyances which befall me and above all because they ask of me things beyond my strength  and the voice said to him even if thou goest up to the thebaid even if as thou art minded to do thou goest down the cattle pastures 52a thou wilt have to endure more and double trouble but if thou wilt really be at rest go now into the inner desert  and when antony said who will show me the way for i have not tried it forthwith it showed him saracens who were going to journey that road  so going to them and drawing near them antony asked leave to depart with them into the desert but they as if by an ordinance of providence willingly received him and journeying three days and three nights with them he came to a very high mountain 52b and there was water under the mountain clear sweet and very cold and a plain outside and a few neglected datepalms  then antony as if stirred by god loved the spot for this it was what he had pointed out who spoke to him beside the river bank  at first then having received bread from those who journeyed with him he remained alone in the mount no one else being with him  for he recognised that place as his own home and kept it thenceforth  and the saracens themselves seeing antonys readiness came that way on purpose and joyfully brought him loaves and he had too the solace of the dates which was then little and paltry  but after this the brethren having found out the spot like children remembering their father were anxious to send things to him but antony saw that in bringing him bread some there were put to trouble and fatigue and sparing the monks even in that took counsel with himself and asked some who came to him to bring him a hoe and a hatchet and a little corn and when these were brought having gone over the land round the mountain he found a very narrow place which was suitable and tilled it and having plenty of water to irrigate it he sowed and doing this year by year he got his bread from thence rejoicing that he should be troublesome to no one on that account and that he was keeping himself free from obligation in all things  but after this seeing again some people coming he planted also a very few potherbs that he who came might have some small solace after the labour of that hard journey  at first however the wild beasts in the desert coming on account of the water often hurt his crops and his tillage but he gently laying hold of one of them said to them all why do you hurt me who have not hurt you  depart and in the name of the lord never come near this place  and from that time forward as if they were afraid of his command they never came near the place  so he was there alone in the inner mountain having leisure for prayer and for training  but the brethren who ministered to him asked him that coming every month they might bring him olives and pulse and oil for after all he was old and while he had his conversation there what great wrestlings he endured according to that which is written not against flesh and blood but against the daemons who are our adversaries we have known from those who went in to him  for there also they heard tumults and many voices and clashing as of arms and they beheld the mount by night full of wild beasts and they looked on him too fighting as it were with beings whom he saw and praying against them  and those who came to him he bade be of good courage but he himself wrestled bending his knees and praying to the lord  and it was truly worthy of wonder that alone in such a desert he was neither cowed by the daemons who beset him nor while there were there so many fourfooted and creeping beasts was at all afraid of their fierceness  but as is written trusted in the lord like the mount zion having his reason unshaken and untost so that the daemons rather fled and the wild beasts as is written were at peace with him  nevertheless the devil as david sings watched antony and gnashed upon him with his teeth  but antony was comforted by the saviour remaining unhurt by his craft and manifold artifices  for on him when he was awake at night he let loose wild beasts and almost all the hyaenas in that desert coming out of their burrows beset him round and he was in the midst  and when each gaped on him and threatened to bite him perceiving the art of the enemy he said to them all if ye have received power against me i am ready to be devoured by you  but if ye have been set on by daemons delay not but withdraw for i am a servant of christ  when antony said this they fled pursued by his words as by a whip  next after a few days as he was workingfor he took care too to laboursome one standing at the door pulled the plait that he was working  for he was weaving baskets which he used to give to those who came in return for what they brought him  and rising up he saw a beast like a man down to his thighs but having legs and feet like an ass and antony only crossed himself and said i am a servant of christ if thou hast been sent against me behold here i am  and the beast with its daemons fled away so that in its haste it fell and died  now the death of the beast was the fall of the daemons  for they were eager to do everything to bring him back out of the desert but could not prevail  and being once asked by the monks to come down to them and to visit awhile them and their places he journeyed with the monks who came to meet him  and a camel carried their loaves and their water for that desert is all dry and there is no drinkable water unless in that mountain alone whence they drew their water and where his cell is  but when the water failed on the journey and the heat was most intense they all began to be in danger for going round to various places and finding no water they could walk no more but lay down on the ground and they let the camel go and gave themselves up but the old man seeing them all in danger was utterly grieved and groaned and departing a little way from them and bending his knees and stretching out his hands he prayed and forthwith the lord caused water to come out where he had stopped and prayed  and thus all of them drinking took breath again and having filled their skins they sought the camel and found her for it befell that the halter had been twisted round a stone and thus she had been stopped  so having brought her back and given her to drink they put the skins on her and went through their journey unharmed  and when they came to the outer cells all embraced him looking on him as a father  and he as if he brought them guestgifts from the mountain gave them away to them in his words and shared his benefits among them  and there was joy again in the mountains and zeal for improvement and comfort through their faith in each other and he too rejoiced seeing the willingness of the monks and his sister grown old in maidenhood and herself the leader of other virgins  and so after certain days he went back again to the mountain  and after that many came to him and others who suffered dared also to come  now to all the monks who came to him he gave continually this command  to trust in the lord and love him and to keep themselves from foul thoughts and fleshly pleasures and as is written in the parables not to be deceived by fulness of bread and to avoid vainglory and to pray continually and to sing before sleep and after sleep and to lay by in their hearts the commandment of scripture and to remember the works of the saints in order to have their souls attuned to emulate them  but especially he counselled them to meditate continually on the apostles saying let not the sun go down upon your wrath and this he said was spoken of all commandments in common in order that not on wrath alone but on every other sin the sun should never go down for it was noble and necessary that the sun should never condemn us for a baseness by day nor the moon for a sin or even a thought by night therefore in order that that which is noble may be preserved in us it was good to hear and to keep what the apostle commanded  for he said  judge yourselves and prove yourselves  let each then take account with himself day by day of his daily and nightly deeds and if he has not sinned let him not boast but let him endure in what is good and not be negligent neither condemn his neighbour neither justify himself as said the blessed apostle paul until the lord comes who searches secret things  for we often deceive ourselves in what we do and we indeed know not  but the lord comprehends all  giving therefore the judgment to him let us sympathise with each other and let us bear each others burdens and examine ourselves and what we are behind in let us be eager to fill up  and let this too be my counsel for safety against sinning  let us each note and write down the deeds and motions of the soul as if he were about to relate them to each other and be confident that as we shall be utterly ashamed that they should be known we shall cease from sinning and even from desiring anything mean  for who when he sins wishes to be harmed thereby  or who having sinned does not rather lie wishing to hide it  as therefore when in each others sight we dare not commit a crime so if we write down our thoughts and tell them to each other we shall keep ourselves the more from foul thoughts for shame lest they should be known     and thus forming ourselves we shall be able to bring the body into slavery and please the lord on the one hand and on the other trample on the snares of the enemy  this was his exhortation to those who met him  but with those who suffered he suffered and prayed with them  and often and in many things the lord heard him and neither when he was heard did he boast nor when he was not heard did he murmur  but remaining always the same gave thanks to the lord  and those who suffered he exhorted to keep up heart and to know that the power of cure was none of his nor of any mans but only belonged to god who works when and whatsoever he chooses  so the sufferers received this as a remedy learning not to despise the old mans words but rather to keep up heart and those who were cured learned not to bless antony but god alone  for instance one called fronto who belonged to the palace and had a grievous disease for he gnawed his own tongue and tried to injure his eyes came to the mountain and asked antony to pray for him  and when he had prayed he said to fronto depart and be healed  and when he resisted and remained within some days antony continued saying thou canst not be healed if thou remainest here go forth and as soon as thou enterest egypt thou shalt see the sign which shall befall thee  he believing went forth and as soon as he only saw egypt he was freed from his disease and became sound according to the word of antony which he had learnt by prayer from the saviour     here follows a story of a girl cured of a painful complaint  which need not be translated  but when two brethren were coming to him and water failed them on the journey one of them died and the other was about to die  in fact being no longer able to walk he too lay upon the ground expecting death  but antony as he sat on the mountain called two monks who happened to be there and hastened them saying take a pitcher of water and run on the road towards egypt for of two who are coming hither one has just expired and the other will do so if you do not hasten  for this has been showed to me as i prayed  so the monks going found the one lying dead and buried him and the other they recovered with the water and brought him to the old man now the distance was a days journey  but if any one should ask why he did not speak before one of them expired he does not question rightly for the judgment of that death did not belong to antony but to god who both judged concerning the one and revealed concerning the other  but this alone in antony was wonderful that sitting on the mountain he kept his heart watchful and the lord showed him things afar off  for once again as he sat on the mountain and looked up he saw some one carried aloft and a great rejoicing among some who met him then wondering and blessing such a choir he prayed to be taught what that might be and straightway a voice came to him that this was the soul of ammon the monk in nitria 60 who had persevered as an ascetic to his old age and the distance from nitria to the mountain where antony was is thirteen days journey  those then who were with antony seeing the old man wondering asked the reason and heard that ammon had just expired for he was known to them on account of his having frequently come thither and many signs having been worked by him of which this is one     here follows the story probably an interpolation of ammons being miraculously carried across the river lycus because he was ashamed to undress himself  but the monks to whom antony spoke about ammons death noted down the day and when brethren came from nitria after thirty days they inquired and learnt that ammon had fallen asleep at the day and hour in which the old man saw his soul carried aloft  and all on both sides wondered at the purity of antonys soul how he had learnt and seen instantly what had happened thirteen days journey off  moreover archeleas the count finding him once in the outer mountain praying alone asked him concerning polycratia that wonderful and christbearing maiden in laodicea for she suffered dreadful internal pain from her extreme training and was altogether weak in body  antony therefore prayed and the count noted down the day on which the prayer was offered  and going back to laodicea he found the maiden cured and asking when and on what day her malady had ceased he brought out the paper on which he had written down the date of the prayer  and when she told him he showed at once the writing on the paper  and all found that the lord had stopped her sufferings while antony was still praying and calling for her on the goodness of the saviour  and concerning those who came to him he often predicted some days or even a month beforehand and the cause why they were coming for some came only to see him and others on account of sickness and others because they suffered from daemons and all thought the labour of the journey no trouble nor harm for each went back aware that he had been benefited  and when he spoke and looked thus he asked no one to marvel at him on that account but to marvel rather at the lord because he had given us who are but men grace to know him according to our powers  and as he was going down again to the outer cells and was minded to enter a boat and pray with the monks he alone perceived a dreadfully evil odour and when those in the boat told him that they had fish and brine on board and that it was they which smelt he said that it was a different smell and while he was yet speaking a youth who had an evil spirit had gone before them and hidden in the boat suddenly cried out  but the daemon being rebuked in the name of our lord jesus christ went out of him and the man became whole and all knew that the smell had come from the evil spirit  and there was another man of high rank who came to him having a daemon and one so terrible that the possessed man did not know that he was going to antony but showed the common symptoms of mania  those who brought him entreated antony to pray over him which he did feeling for the young man and he watched beside him all night  but about dawn the young man suddenly rushing on antony assaulted him  when those who came with him were indignant antony said be not hard upon the youth for it is not he but the daemon in him and because he has been rebuked and commanded to go forth into dry places he has become furious and done this  glorify therefore the lord for his having thus rushed upon me as a sign to you that the daemon is going out  and as antony said this the youth suddenly became sound and recovering his reason knew where he was and embraced the old man giving thanks to god  and most of the monks agree unanimously that many like things were done by him  yet are they not so wonderful as what follows  for once when he was going to eat and rose up to pray about the ninth hour he felt himself rapt in spirit and wonderful to relate as he stood he saw himself as it were taken out of himself and led into the air by some persons and then others bitter and terrible standing in the air and trying to prevent his passing upwards  and when those who led him fought against them they demanded whether he was not accountable to them and when they began to take account of his deeds from his birth his guides stopped them saying what happened from his birth upwards the lord hath wiped out  but of what has happened since he became a monk and made a promise to god of that you may demand an account then when they brought accusations against him and could not prove them the road was opened freely to him  and straightway he saw himself as if coming back and standing before himself and was antony once more  then forgetting that he had not eaten he remained the rest of the day and all night groaning and praying for he wondered when he saw against how many enemies we must wrestle and through how many labours a man must traverse the air and he remembered that it is this which the apostle means with regard to the prince of the power of the air for it is in the air that the enemy has his power fighting against those who pass through it and trying to hinder them  wherefore also he especially exhorts us take the whole armour of god that the enemy having no evil to say about us may be ashamed  but when we heard this we remembered the apostles saying whether in the body i cannot tell or out of the body i cannot tell  god knoweth  but paul was caught up into the third heaven and having heard unspeakable words descended again but antony saw himself rapt in the air and wrestling till he seemed to be free  again he had this grace that as he was sitting alone in the mountain if at any time he was puzzled in himself the thing was revealed to him by providence as he prayed and the blessed man was as scripture says taught of god  after this at all events when he had been talking with some who came to him concerning the departure of the soul and what would be its place after this life the next night some one called him from without and said rise up antony come out and see  so coming out for he knew whom he ought to obey he beheld a tall being shapeless and terrible standing and reaching to the clouds and as it were winged beings ascending and him stretching out his hands and some of them hindered by him and others flying above him and when they had once passed him borne upwards without trouble  but against them that tall being gnashed his teeth while over those who fell he rejoiced  and there came a voice to antony consider what thou seest  and when his understanding was opened he perceived that it was the enemy who envies the faithful and that those who were in his power he mastered and hindered from passing but that those who had not obeyed him over them as over conquerors he had no power  having seen this and as it were made mindful by it he struggled more and more daily to improve  now these things he did not tell of his own accord but when he was long in prayer and astonished in himself those who were with him questioned him and urged him and he was forced to tell unable as a father to hide anything from his children and considering too that his own conscience was clear and the story would be profitable for them when they learned that the life of training bore good fruit and that visions often came as a solace of their toils  but how tolerant was his temper and how humble his spirit for though he was so great he both honoured exceedingly the canon of the church and wished to put every ecclesiastic before himself in honour  for to the bishops and presbyters he was not ashamed to bow his head and if a deacon ever came to him for the sake of profit he discoursed with him on what was profitable but in prayer he gave place to him not being ashamed even himself to learn from him 65 for he often asked questions and deigned to listen to all present confessing that he was profited if any one said aught that was useful  moreover his countenance had great and wonderful grace and this gift too he had from the saviour  for if he was present among the multitude of monks and any one who did not previously know him wished to see him as soon as he came he passed by all the rest and ran to antony himself as if attracted by his eyes  he did not differ from the rest in stature or in stoutness but in the steadiness of his temper and purity of his soul for as his soul was undisturbed his outward senses were undisturbed likewise so that the cheerfulness of his soul made his face cheerful and from the movements of his body the stedfastness of his soul could be perceived according to the scripture when the heart is cheerful the countenance is glad but when sorrow comes it scowleth    and he was altogether wonderful in faith and pious for he never communicated with the meletian 66a schismatics knowing their malice and apostasy from the beginning nor did he converse amicably with manichaeans or any other heretics save only to exhort them to be converted to piety  for he held that their friendship and converse was injury and ruin to the soul  so also he detested the heresy of the arians and exhorted all not to approach them nor hold their misbelief 66b  in fact when certain of the ariomanites came to him having discerned them and found them impious he chased them out of the mountain saying that their words were worse than serpents poison and when the arians once pretended that he was of the same opinion as they he was indignant and fierce against them  then being sent for by the bishops and all the brethren he went down from the mountain and entering alexandria he denounced the arians saying that that was the last heresy and the forerunner of antichrist and he taught the people that the son of god was not a created thing neither made from nought but that he is the eternal word and wisdom of the essence of the father wherefore also it is impious to say there was a time when he was not for he was always the word coexistent with the father wherefore he said do not have any communication with these most impious arians for there is no communion between light and darkness  for you are pious christians  but they when they say that the son of god and the word who is from the father is a created being differ nought from the heathen because they worship the creature instead of god the creator 67  believe rather that the whole creation itself is indignant against them because they number the creator and lord of all in whom all things are made among created things  all the people therefore rejoiced at hearing that christopposing heresy anathematized by such a man and all those in the city ran together to see antony and the greeks 68a and those who are called their priests 68b came into the church wishing to see the man of god for all called him by that name because there the lord cleansed many by him from daemons and healed those who were out of their mind  and many heathens wished only to touch the old man believing that it would be of use to them and in fact as many became christians in those few days as would have been usually converted in a year  and when some thought that the crowd troubled him and therefore turned all away from him he quietly said that they were not more numerous than the fiends with whom he wrestled on the mountain  but when he left the city and we were setting him on his journey when we came to the gate a certain woman called to him  wait man of god my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil wait i beseech thee lest i too harm myself with running after thee  the old man hearing it and being asked by us waited willingly  but when the woman drew near the child dashed itself on the ground and when antony prayed and called on the name of christ it rose up sound the unclean spirit having gone out and the mother blessed god and we all gave thanks  and he himself rejoiced at leaving the city for the mountain as for his own home  now he was very prudent and what was wonderful though he had never learnt letters he was a shrewd and understanding man  once for example two greek philosophers came to him thinking that they could tempt antony  and he was in the outer mountain and when he went out to them understanding the men from their countenances he said through an interpreter why have you troubled yourselves so much philosophers to come to a foolish man  and when they answered that he was not foolish but rather very wise he said if you have come to a fool your labour is superfluous but if ye think me to be wise become as i am for we ought to copy what is good and if i had come to you i should have copied you but if you come to me copy me for i am a christian  and they wondering went their way for they saw that even daemons were afraid of antony  and again when others of the same class met him in the outer mountain and thought to mock him because he had not learnt letters antony answered but what do you say which is first the sense or the letters  and which is the cause of the other the sense of the letters or the letters of the sense  and when they said that the sense came first and invented the letters antony replied if then the sense be sound the letters are not needed which struck them and those present with astonishment  so they went away wondering when they saw so much understanding in an unlearned man  for though he had lived and grown old in the mountain his manners were not rustic but graceful and urbane and his speech was seasoned with the divine salt so that no man grudged at him but rather rejoiced over him as many as came     here follows a long sermon against the heathen worship attributed to st antony but of very questionable authenticity  the only point about it which is worthy of note is that antony confutes the philosophers by challenging them to cure some possessed persons and when they are unable to do so casts out the daemons himself by the sign of the cross  the fame of antony reached even the kings for constantinus the augustus and his sons constantius and constans the augusti hearing of these things wrote to him as to a father and begged to receive an answer from him  but he did not make much of the letters nor was puffed up by their messages and he was just the same as he was before the kings wrote to him  and he called his monks and said wonder not if a king writes to us for he is but a man  but wonder rather that god has written his law to man and spoken to us by his own son  so he declined to receive their letters saying he did not know how to write an answer to such things but being admonished by the monks that the kings were christians and that they must not be scandalized by being despised he permitted the letters to be read and wrote an answer accepting them because they worshipped christ and counselling them for their salvation not to think the present life great but rather to remember judgment to come and to know that christ was the only true and eternal king and he begged them to be merciful to men and to think of justice and the poor  and they when they received the answer rejoiced  thus was he kindly towards all and all looked on him as their father  he then betook himself again into the inner mountain and continued his accustomed training  but often when he was sitting and walking with those who came unto him he was astounded as is written in daniel  and after the space of an hour he told what had befallen to the brethren who were with him and they perceived that he had seen some vision  often he saw in the mountain what was happening in egypt and told it to serapion the bishop who saw him occupied with a vision  once for instance as he sat he fell as it were into an ecstasy and groaned much at what he saw  then after an hour turning to those who were with him he groaned and fell into a trembling and rose up and prayed and bending his knees remained so a long while and then the old man rose up and wept  the bystanders therefore trembling and altogether terrified asked him to tell them what had happened and tormented him much that he was forced to speak  and he groaning greatlyah my children he said it were better to be dead before what i have seen shall come to pass  and when they asked him again he said with tears that wrath will seize on the church and she will be given over to men like unto brutes which have no understanding for i saw the table of the lords house and mules standing all around it in a ring and kicking inwards as a herd does when it leaps in confusion and ye all perceived how i groaned for i heard a voice saying my sanctuary shall be defiled  this the old man saw and after two years there befell the present inroad of the arians 72a and the plunder of the churches when they carried off the holy vessels by violence and made the heathen carry them  and when too they forced the heathens from the prisons to join them and in their presence did on the holy table what they would 72b  then we all perceived that the kicks of those mules presignified to antony what the arians are now doing without understanding like the brutes  but when antony saw this sight he exhorted those about him saying lose not heart children for as the lord has been angry so will he again be appeased and the church shall soon receive again her own order and shine forth as she is wont and ye shall see the persecuted restored to their place and impiety retreating again into its own dens and the pious faith speaking boldly everywhere with all freedom  only defile not yourselves with the arians for this teaching is not of the apostle but of the daemons and of their father the devil  barren and irrational and of an unsound mind like the irrational deeds of those mules  thus spoke antony  but we must not doubt whether so great wonders have been done by a man for the saviours promise is if ye have faith as a grain of mustardseed ye shall say to this mountain pass over from hence it shall pass over and nothing shall be impossible to you and again verily verily i say unto you if ye shall ask my father in my name he shall give it you  ask and ye shall receive  and he himself it is who said to his disciples and to all who believe in him heal the sick cast out devils freely ye have received freely give  and certainly antony did not heal by his own authority but by praying and calling on christ so that it was plain to all that it was not he who did it but the lord who through antony showed love to men and healed the sufferers  but antonys part was only the prayer and the training for the sake whereof sitting in the mountain he rejoiced in the sight of divine things and grieved when he was tormented by many and dragged to the outer mountain  for all the magistrates asked him to come down from the mountain because it was impossible for them to go in thither to him on account of the litigants who followed him so they begged him to come that they might only behold him  and when he declined they insisted and even sent in to him prisoners under the charge of soldiers that at least on their account he might come down  so being forced by necessity and seeing them lamenting he came to the outer mountain  and his labour this time too was profitable to many and his coming for their good  to the magistrates too he was of use counselling them to prefer justice to all things and to fear god and to know that with what judgment they judged they should be judged in turn  but he loved best of all his life in the mountain  once again when he was compelled in the same way to leave it by those who were in want and by the general of the soldiers who entreated him earnestly he came down and having spoken to them somewhat of the things which conduced to salvation he was pressed also by those who were in need  but being asked by the general to lengthen his stay he refused and persuaded him by a graceful parable saying fishes if they lie long on the dry land die so monks who stay with you lose their strength  as the fishes then hasten to the sea so must we to the mountain lest if we delay we should forget what is within  the general hearing this and much more from him said with surprise that he was truly a servant of god for whence could an unlearned man have so great sense if he were not loved by god  another general named balacius bitterly persecuted us christians on account of his affection for those abominable arians  his cruelty was so great that he even beat nuns and stripped and scourged monks  antony sent him a letter to this effecti see wrath coming upon thee  cease therefore to persecute the christians lest the wrath lay hold upon thee for it is near at hand  but balacius laughing threw the letter on the ground and spat on it and insulted those who brought it bidding them tell antony since thou carest for monks i will soon come after thee likewise  and not five days had passed when the wrath laid hold on him  for balacius himself and nestorius the eparch of egypt went out to the first station from alexandria which is called chaereass  both of them were riding on horses belonging to balacius and the most gentle in all his stud  but before they had got to the place the horses began playing with each other as is their wont and suddenly the more gentle of the two on which nestorius was riding attacked balacius and pulled him off with his teeth and so tore his thigh that he was carried back to the city and died in three days  and all wondered that what antony had so wonderfully foretold was so quickly fulfilled  these were his warnings to the more cruel  but the rest who came to him he so instructed that they gave up at once their lawsuits and blessed those who had retired from this life  and those who had been unjustly used he so protected that you would think he and not they was the sufferer  and he was so able to be of use to all so that many who were serving in the army and many wealthy men laid aside the burdens of life and became thenceforth monks and altogether he was like a physician given by god to egypt  for who met him grieving and did not go away rejoicing  who came mourning over his dead and did not forthwith lay aside his grief  who came wrathful and was not converted to friendship  what poor man came wearied out and when he saw and heard him did not despise wealth and comfort himself in his poverty  what monk who had grown remiss was not strengthened by coming to him  what young man coming to the mountain and looking upon antony did not forthwith renounce pleasure and love temperance  who came to him tempted by devils and did not get rest  who came troubled by doubts and did not get peace of mind  for this was the great thing in antonys asceticism that as i have said before having the gift of discerning spirits he understood their movements and knew in what direction each of them turned his endeavours and his attacks  and not only he was not deceived by them himself but he taught those who were troubled in mind how they might turn aside the plots of daemons teaching them the weakness and the craft of their enemies  how many maidens too who had been already betrothed and only saw antony from afar remained unmarried for christs sake  some too came from foreign parts to him and all having gained some benefit went back from him as from a father  and now he has fallen asleep all are as orphans who have lost a parent consoling themselves with his memory alone keeping his instructions and exhortations  but what the end of his life was like it is fit that i should relate and you hear eagerly  for it too is worthy of emulation  he was visiting according to his wont the monks in the outer mountain and having learned from providence concerning his own end he said to the brethren this visit to you is my last and i wonder if we shall see each other again in this life  it is time for me to set sail for i am near a hundred and five years old  and when they heard that they wept and embraced and kissed the old man  and he as if he was setting out from a foreign city to his own spoke joyfully and exhorted them not to grow idle in their labours or cowardly in their training but to live as those who died daily and as i said before to be earnest in keeping their souls from foul thoughts and to emulate the saints and not to draw near the meletian schismatics for ye know their evil and profane determinations nor to have any communion with the arians for their impiety also is manifest to all  neither if ye shall see the magistrates patronising them be troubled for their phantasy shall have an end and is mortal and only for a little while  keep yourselves therefore rather clean from them and hold that which has been handed down to you by the fathers and especially the faith in our lord jesus christ which ye have learned from scripture and of which ye have often been reminded by me  and when the brethren tried to force him to stay with them and make his end there he would not endure it on many accounts as he showed by his silence and especially on thisthe egyptians are wont to wrap in linen the corpses of good persons and especially of the holy martyrs but not to bury them underground but to lay them upon benches and keep them in their houses 77 thinking that by this they honour the departed  now antony had often asked the bishops to exhort the people about this and in like manner he himself rebuked the laity and terrified the women saying that it was a thing neither lawful nor in any way holy for that the bodies of the patriarchs and prophets are to this day preserved in sepulchres and that the very body of our lord was laid in a sepulchre and a stone placed over it to hide it till he rose the third day  and thus saying he showed that those broke the law who did not bury the corpses of the dead even if they were holy for what is greater or more holy than the lords body  many then when they heard him buried thenceforth underground and blessed the lord that they had been taught rightly being then aware of this and afraid lest they should do the same by his body he hurried himself and bade farewell to the monks in the outer mountain and coming to the inner mountain where he was wont to abide after a few months he grew sick and calling those who were byand there were two of them who had remained there within fifteen years exercising themselves and ministering to him on account of his old agehe said to them i indeed go the way of the fathers as it is written for i perceive that i am called by the lord     then follows a general exhortation to the monk almost identical with much that has gone before and ending by a command that his body should be buried in the ground  and let this word of mine be kept by you so that no one shall know the place save you alone for i shall receive it my body incorruptible from my saviour in the resurrection of the dead  and distribute my garments thus  to athanasius the bishop give one of my sheepskins and the cloak under me which was new when he gave it me and has grown old by me and to serapion the bishop give the other sheepskin and do you have the haircloth garment  and for the rest children farewell for antony is going and is with you no more  saying thus when they had embraced him he stretched out his feet and as if he saw friends coming to him and grew joyful on their account for as he lay his countenance was bright he departed and was gathered to his fathers  and they forthwith as he had commanded them preparing the body and wrapping it up hid it under ground  and no one knows to this day where it is hidden save those two servants only  and each ie  athanasius and serapion having received the sheepskin of the blessed antony and the cloak which he had worn out keeps them as a great possession  for he who looks on them as it were sees antony and he who puts them on wears them with joy as he does antonys counsels  such was the end of antony in the body and such the beginning of his training  and if these things are small in comparison with his virtue yet reckon up from these things how great was antony the man of god who kept unchanged from his youth up to so great an age the earnestness of his training and was neither worsted in his old age by the desire of more delicate food nor on account of the weakness of his body altered the quality of his garment nor even washed his feet with water and yet remained uninjured in all his limbs  for his eyes were undimmed and whole so that he saw well and not one of his teeth had fallen out but they were only worn down to his gums on account of his great age and he remained sound in hand and foot and in a word appeared ruddier and more ready for exertion than all who use various meats and baths and different dresses  but that this man should be celebrated everywhere and wondered at by all and regretted even by those who never saw him is a proof of his virtue and that his soul was dear to god  for antony became known not by writings not from the wisdom that is from without not by any art but by piety alone and that this was the gift of god none can deny  for how as far as spain as gaul as rome as africa could he have been heard hidden as he was in a mountain if it had not been for god who makes known his own men everywhere and who had promised antony this from the beginning for even if they do their deeds in secret and wish to be concealed yet the lord shows them as lights to all that so those who hear of them may know that the commandments suffice to put men in the right way and may grow zealous of the path of virtue  read then these things to the other brethren that they may learn what the life of monks should be and may believe that the lord jesus christ our saviour will glorify those who glorify him and that those who serve him to the end he will not only bring to the kingdom of heaven but that even if on earth they hide themselves and strive to get out of the way he will make them manifest and celebrated everywhere for the sake of their own virtue and for the benefit of others  but if need be read this also to the heathens that even thus they may learn that our lord jesus christ is not only lord and the son of god but that those who truly serve him and believe piously on him not only prove that those daemons whom the greeks think are gods to be no gods but even tread them under foot and chase them out as deceivers and corrupters of men through jesus christ our lord to whom be glory and honour for ever and ever amen   thus ends this strange story  what we are to think of the miracles and wonders contained in it will be discussed at a later point in this book  meanwhile there is a stranger story still connected with the life of st antony  it professes to have been told by him himself to his monks and whatever groundwork of fact there may be in it is doubtless his  the form in which we have it was given it by the famous st jerome who sends the tale as a letter to asella one of the many noble roman ladies whom he persuaded to embrace the monastic life  the style is as well worth preserving as the matter its ruggedness and awkwardness its ambition and affectation contrasted with the graceful simplicity of athanasiuss life of antony mark well the difference between the cultivated greek and the ungraceful and halfbarbarous roman of the later empire  i have therefore given it as literally as possible that readers may judge for themselves how some of the great fathers of the fifth century wrote and what they believed    the life of saint paul the first hermit    by the divine hieronymus the priest  st  jerome   prologue   many have often doubted by which of the monks the desert was first inhabited  for some looking for the beginnings of monachism in earlier ages have deduced it from the blessed elias and john of whom elias seems to us to have been rather a prophet than a monk and john to have begun to prophesy before he was born  but others an opinion in which all the common people are agreed assert that antony was the head of this rule of life which is partly true  for he was not so much himself the first of all as the man who excited the earnestness of all  but amathas and macarius antonys disciples the former of whom buried his masters body even now affirm that a certain paul a theban was the beginner of the matter which not so much in name as in opinion we also hold to be true  some scatter about as the fancy takes them both this and other stories inventing incredible tales of a man in a subterranean cave hairy down to his heels and many other things which it is tedious to follow out  for as their lie is shameless their opinion does not seem worth refuting  therefore because careful accounts of antony both in greek and roman style have been handed down i have determined to write a little about the beginning and end of pauls life more because the matter has been omitted than trusting to my own wit  but how he lived during middle life or what stratagems of satan he endured is known to none   the life of paul   under decius and valerius the persecutors at the time when cornelius at rome and cyprian at carthage were condemned in blessed blood a cruel tempest swept over many churches in egypt and the thebaid  christian subjects in those days longed to be smitten with the sword for the name of christ  but the crafty enemy seeking out punishments which delayed death longed to slay souls not bodies and as cyprian himself who suffered by him says  when they longed to die they were not allowed to be slain  in order to make his cruelty better known we have set down two examples for remembrance  a martyr persevering in the faith and conqueror amid racks and redhot irons he commanded to be anointed with honey and laid on his back under a burning sun with his hands tied behind him in order forsooth that he who had already conquered the fiery gridiron might yield to the stings of flies      in those days in the lower thebaid was paul left at the death of both his parents in a rich inheritance with a sister already married being about fifteen years old well taught in greek and egyptian letters gentle tempered loving god much and when the storm of persecution burst he withdrew into a distant city  but   to what dost thou not urge the human breast curst hunger after gold   his sisters husband was ready to betray him whom he should have concealed  neither the tears of his wife the tie of blood or god who looks on all things from on high could call him back from his crime  he was at hand ready to seize him making piety a pretext for cruelty  the boy discovered it and fled into the desert hills once there he changed need into pleasure and going on and then stopping awhile again and again reached at last a stony cliff at the foot whereof was nigh at hand a great cave its mouth closed with a stone  having moved which away as mans longing is to know the hidden exploring more greedily he sees within a great hall open to the sky above but shaded by the spreading boughs of an ancient palm and in it a clear spring the rill from which flowing a short space forth was sucked up again by the same soil which had given it birth  there were besides in that cavernous mountain not a few dwellings in which he saw rusty anvils and hammers with which coin had been stamped of old  for this place so books say was the workshop for base coin in the days when antony lived with cleopatra  therefore in this beloved dwelling offered him as it were by god he spent all his life in prayer and solitude while the palmtree gave him food and clothes which lest it should seem impossible to some i call jesus and his holy angels to witness that i have seen monks one of whom shut up for thirty years lived on barley bread and muddy water another in an old cistern which in the country speech they call the syrians bed was kept alive on five figs each day  these things therefore will seem incredible to those who do not believe for to those who do believe all things are possible  but to return thither whence i digressed  when the blessed paul had been leading the heavenly life on earth for 113 years and antony ninety years old was dwelling in another solitude this thought so antony was wont to assert entered his mindthat no monk more perfect than he had settled in the desert  but as he lay still by night it was revealed to him that there was another monk beyond him far better than he to visit whom he must set out  so when the light broke the venerable old man supporting his weak limbs on a staff began to will to go he knew not whither  and now the mid day with the sun roasting above grew fierce and yet he was not turned from the journey he had begun saying i trust in my god that he will show his servant that which he has promised  and as he spake he sees a man half horse to whom the poets have given the name of hippocentaur  seeing whom he crosses his forehead with the salutary impression of the cross and here he says in what part here does a servant of god dwell  but he growling i know not what barbarous sound and grinding rather than uttering the words attempted a courteous speech from lips rough with bristles and stretching out his right hand pointed to the way then fleeing swiftly across the open plains vanished from the eyes of the wondering antony  but whether the devil took this form to terrify him or whether the desert fertile as is its wont in monstrous animals begets that beast likewise we hold as uncertain  so antony astonished and thinking over what he had seen goes forward  soon afterwards he sees in a stony valley a short manikin with crooked nose and brow rough with horns whose lower parts ended in goats feet  undismayed by this spectacle likewise antony seized like a good warrior the shield of faith and habergeon of hope the animal however was bringing him dates as food for his journey and a pledge of peace  when he saw that antony pushed on and asking him who he was was answered i am a mortal and one of the inhabitants of the desert whom the gentiles deluded by various errors worship by the name of fauns satyrs and incubi  i come as ambassador from our herd that thou mayest pray for us to the common god who we know has come for the salvation of the world and his sound is gone out into all lands  as he spoke thus the aged wayfarer bedewed his face plenteously with tears which the greatness of his joy had poured forth as signs of his heart  for he rejoiced at the glory of christ and the destruction of satan and wondering at the same time that he could understand the creatures speech he smote on the ground with his staff and said woe to thee alexandria who worshippest portents instead of god  woe to thee harlot city into which all the demons of the world have flowed together  what wilt thou say now  beasts talk of christ and thou worshippest portents instead of god  he had hardly finished his words when the swift beast fled away as upon wings  lest this should move a scruple in any one on account of its incredibility it was corroborated in the reign of constantine by the testimony of the whole world  for a man of that kind being led alive to alexandria afforded a great spectacle to the people and afterwards the lifeless carcase being salted lest it should decay in the summer heat was brought to antioch to be seen by the emperor  butto go on with my taleantony went on through that region seeing only the tracks of wild beasts and the wide waste of the desert  what he should do or whither turn he knew not  a second day had now run by  one thing remained to be confident that he could not be deserted by christ  all night through he spent a second darkness in prayer and while the light was still dim he sees afar a shewolf panting with heat and thirst creeping in at the foot of the mountain  following her with his eyes and drawing nigh to the cave when the beast was gone he began to look in  but in vain for the darkness stopped his view  however as the scripture saith perfect love casteth out fear with gentle step and bated breath the cunning explorer entered and going forward slowly and stopping often watched for a sound  at length he saw afar off a light through the horror of the darkness hastened on more greedily struck his foot against a stone and made a noise at which the blessed paul shut and barred his door which had stood open  then antony casting himself down before the entrance prayed there till the sixth hour and more to be let in saying who i am and whence and why i am come thou knowest  i know that i deserve not to see thy face yet unless i see thee i will not return  thou who receivest beasts why repellest thou a man  i have sought and i have found  i knock that it may be opened to me  which if i win not here will i die before thy gate  surely thou shalt at least bury my corpse   persisting thus he spoke and stood there fixed to whom the hero shortly thus replied   no one begs thus to threaten  no one does injury with tears  and dost thou wonder why i do not let thee in seeing thou art a mortal guest  then paul smiling opened the door  they mingled mutual embraces and saluted each other by their names and committed themselves in common to the grace of god  and after the holy kiss paul sitting down with antony thus began  behold him whom thou hast sought with such labour with limbs decayed by age and covered with unkempt white hair  behold thou seest but a mortal soon to become dust  but because charity bears all things tell me i pray thee how fares the human race whether new houses are rising in the ancient cities by what emperor is the world governed whether there are any left who are led captive by the deceits of the devil  as they spoke thus they saw a raven settle on a bough who flying gently down laid to their wonder a whole loaf before them  when he was gone ah said paul the lord truly loving truly merciful hath sent us a meal  for sixty years past i have received daily half a loaf but at thy coming christ hath doubled his soldiers allowance  then having thanked god they sat down on the brink of the glassy spring  but here a contention arising as to which of them should break the loaf occupied the day till wellnigh evening  paul insisted as the host antony declined as the younger man  at last it was agreed that they should take hold of the loaf at opposite ends and each pull towards himself and keep what was left in his hand  next they stooped down and drank a little water from the spring then immolating to god the sacrifice of praise passed the night watching  and when day dawned again the blessed paul said to antony i knew long since brother that thou wert dwelling in these lands long since god had promised thee to me as a fellow servant  but because the time of my falling asleep is now come and because i always longed to depart and to be with christ there is laid up for me when i have finished my course a crown of righteousness therefore thou art sent from the lord to cover my corpse with mould and give back dust to dust  antony hearing this prayed him with tears and groans not to desert him but take him as his companion on such a journey  but he said thou must not seek the things which are thine own but the things of others  it is expedient for thee indeed to cast off the burden of the flesh and to follow the lamb  but it is expedient for the rest of the brethren that they should be still trained by thine example  wherefore go unless it displease thee and bring the cloak which athanasius the bishop gave thee to wrap up my corpse but this the blessed paul asked not because he cared greatly whether his body decayed covered or bare as one who for so long a time was used to clothe himself with woven palm leaves but that antonys grief at his death might be lightened when he left him antony astounded that he had heard of athanasius and his own cloak seeing as it were christ in paul and venerating the god within his breast dared answer nothing  but keeping in silence and kissing his eyes and hands returned to the monastery which afterwards was occupied by the saracens  his steps could not follow his spirit but although his body was empty with fastings and broken with old age yet his courage conquered his years  at last tired and breathless he arrived at home  there two disciples met him who had been long sent to minister to him and asked him where hast thou tarried so long father  he answered woe to me a sinner who falsely bear the name of a monk  i have seen elias i have seen john in the desert i have truly seen paul in paradise and so closing his lips and beating his breast he took the cloak from his cell and when his disciples asked him to explain more fully what had befallen he said there is a time to be silent and a time to speak  then going out and not taking even a morsel of food he returned by the way he had come  for he fearedwhat actually happenedlest paul in his absence should render up the soul he owed to christ  and when the second day had shone and he had retraced his steps for three hours he saw amid hosts of angels amid the choirs of prophets and apostles paul shining white as snow ascending up on high and forthwith falling on his face he cast sand on his head and weeping and wailing said why dost thou dismiss me paul  why dost thou depart without a farewell  so late known dost thou vanish so soon  the blessed antony used to tell afterwards how he ran the rest of the way so swiftly that he flew like a bird  nor without cause  for entering the cave he saw with bended knees erect neck and hands spread out on high a lifeless corpse  and at first thinking that it still lived he prayed in like wise  but when he heard no sighs as usual come from the worshippers breast he fell to a tearful kiss understanding how the very corpse of the saint was praying in seemly attitude to that god to whom all live  so having wrapped up and carried forth the corpse and chanting hymns of the christian tradition antony grew sad because he had no spade wherewith to dig the ground and thinking over many plans in his mind said if i go back to the monastery it is a three days journey  if i stay here i shall be of no more use  i will die then as it is fit and falling beside thy warrior christ breathe my last breath  as he was thinking thus to himself lo two lions came running from the inner part of the desert their manes tossing on their necks seeing whom he shuddered at first and then turning his mind to god remained fearless as though he were looking upon doves  they came straight to the corpse of the blessed old man and crouched at his feet wagging their tails and roaring with mighty growls so that antony understood them to lament as best they could  then not far off they began to claw the ground with their paws and carrying out the sand eagerly dug a place large enough to hold a man  then at once as if begging a reward for their work they came to antony drooping their necks and licking his hands and feet  but he perceived that they prayed a blessing from him and at once bursting into praise of christ because even dumb animals felt that he was god he saith lord without whose word not a leaf of the tree drops nor one sparrow falls to the ground give to them as thou knowest how to give  and signing to them with his hand he bade them go  and when they had departed he bent his aged shoulders to the weight of the holy corpse and laying it in the grave heaped earth on it and raised a mound as is the wont  and when another dawn shone lest the pious heir should not possess aught of the goods of the intestate dead he kept for himself the tunic which paul had woven as baskets are made out of the leaves of the palm and returning to the monastery told his disciples all throughout and on the solemn days of easter and pentecost always clothed himself in pauls tunic  i am inclined at the end of my treatise to ask those who know not the extent of their patrimonies who cover their houses with marbles who sew the price of whole farms into their garments with a single threadwhat was ever wanting to this naked old man  ye drink from a gem he satisfied nature from the hollow of his hands ye weave gold into your tunics he had not even the vilest garment of your bondslave  but on the other hand to that poor man paradise is open you gilded as you are gehenna will receive  he though naked kept the garment of christ you clothed in silk have lost christs robe  paul lies covered with the meanest dust to rise in glory you are crushed by wrought sepulchres of stone to burn with all your works  spare i beseech you yourselves spare at least the riches which you love  why do you wrap even your dead in golden vestments  why does not ambition stop amid grief and tears  cannot the corpses of the rich decay save in silk  i beseech thee whosoever thou art that readest this to remember hieronymus the sinner who if the lord gave him choice would much sooner choose pauls tunic with his merits than the purple of kings with their punishments   this is the story of paul and antony as told by jerome  but in justice to antony himself it must be said that the sayings recorded of him seem to show that he was not the mere visionary ascetic which his biographers have made him  some twenty sermons are attributed to him seven of which only are considered to be genuine  a rule for monks too is called his  but as it is almost certain that he could neither read nor write we have no proof that any of these documents convey his actual language  if the seven sermons attributed to him be really his it must be said for them that they are full of sound doctrine and vital religion and worthy as wholes to be preached in any english church if we only substitute for the word monk the word man  but there are records of antony which represent him as a far more genial and human personage full of a knowledge of human nature and of a tenderness and sympathy which account for his undoubted power over the minds of men and showing too at times a certain covert and pawky humour which puts us in mind as does the humour of many of the egyptian hermits of the oldfashioned scotch  these reminiscences are contained in the words of the elders a series of anecdotes of the desert fathers collected by various hands which are after all the most interesting and probably the most trustworthy accounts of them and their ways  i shall have occasion to quote them later  i insert here some among them which relate to antony   sayings of antony from the words of the elders   a monk gave away his wealth to the poor but kept back some for himself  antony said to him go to the village and buy meat and bring it to me on thy bare back  he did so  and the dogs and birds attacked him and tore him as well as the meat  quoth antony so are those who renounce the world and yet must needs have money torn by daemons  antony heard high praise of a certain brother but when he tested him he found that he was impatient under injury  quoth antony thou art like a house which has a gay porch but is broken into by thieves through the back door  antony as he sat in the desert was weary in heart and said lord i long to be saved but my wandering thoughts will not let me  show me what i shall do  and looking up he saw one like himself twisting ropes and rising up to pray  and the angel for it was one said to him work like me antony and you shall be saved  one asked him how he could please god  quoth antony have god always before thine eyes whatever work thou doest take example for it out of holy scripture  wherever thou stoppest do not move thence in a hurry but abide there in patience  if thou keepest these three things thou shalt be saved  quoth antony if the baker did not cover the millhorses eyes he would eat the corn and take his own wages  so god covers our eyes by leaving us to sordid thoughts lest we should think of our own good works and be puffed up in spirit  quoth antony i saw all the snares of the enemy spread over the whole earth  and i sighed and said who can pass through these and a voice came to me saying humility alone can pass through antony where the proud can in no wise go  antony was sitting in his cell and a voice said to him thou hast not yet come to the stature of a currier who lives in alexandria then he took his staff and went down to alexandria and the currier when he found him was astonished at seeing so great a man said antony tell me thy works for on thy account have i come out of the desert  and he answered i know not that i ever did any good and therefore when i rise in the morning i say that this whole city from the greatest to the least will enter into the kingdom of god for their righteousness  while i for my sins shall go to eternal pain  and this i say over again from the bottom of my heart when i lie down at night  when antony heard that he said like a good goldsmith thou hast gained the kingdom of god sitting still in thy house while i as one without discretion have been haunting the desert all my time and yet not arrived at the measure of thy saying  quoth antony if a monk could tell his elders how many steps he walks or how many cups of water he drinks in his cell he ought to tell them for fear of going wrong therein  at alexandria antony met one didymus most learned in the scriptures witty and wise  but he was blind  antony asked him art thou not grieved at thy blindness  he was silent  but being pressed by antony he confessed that he was sad thereat  quoth antony i wonder that a prudent man grieves over the loss of a thing which ants and flies and gnats have instead of rejoicing in that possession which the holy apostles earned  for it is better to see with the spirit than with the flesh  a father asked antony what shall i do  quoth the old man trust not in thine own righteousness regret not the thing which is past bridle thy tongue and thy stomach  quoth antony he who sits still in the desert is safe from three enemies  from hearing from speech from sight  and has to fight against only one his own heart  a young monk came and told antony how he had seen some old men weary on their journey and had bidden the wild asses to come and carry him and they came  quoth antony that monk looks to me like a ship laden with a precious cargo but whether it will get into port is uncertain  and after some days he began to tear his hair and weep and when they asked him why he said a great pillar of the church has just fallen and he sent brothers to see the young man and found him sitting on his mat weeping over a great sin which he had done and he said tell antony to give me ten days truce and i hope i shall satisfy him and in five days he was dead  abbot elias fell into temptation and the brethren drove him out then he went to the mountain to antony  after awhile antony sent him home to his brethren but they would not receive him  then the old man sent to them and saying a ship has been wrecked at sea and lost all its cargo and with much toil the ship is come empty to land  will you sink it again in the sea  so they took elias back  quoth antony there are some who keep their bodies in abstinence but because they have no discretion they are far from god  a hunter came by and saw antony rejoicing with the brethren and it displeased him  quoth antony put an arrow in thy bow and draw and he did  quoth antony draw higher and again draw higher still  and he said if i overdraw i shall break my bow  quoth antony so it is in the work of god  if we stretch the brethren beyond measure they fail  a brother said to antony pray for me  quoth he i cannot pity thee nor god either unless thou pitiest thyself and prayest to god  quoth antony the lord does not permit wars to arise in this generation because he knows that men are weak and cannot bear them  antony as he considered the depths of the judgments of god failed and said lord why do some die so early and some live on to a decrepit age  why are some needy and others rich  why are the unjust wealthy and the just poor  and a voice came to him antony look to thyself  these are the judgments of god which are not fit for thee to know  quoth antony to abbot pastor this is a mans great businessto lay each man his own fault on himself before the lord and to expect temptation to the last day of his life  quoth antony if a man works a few days and then is idle and works again and is idle again he does nothing and will not possess the perseverance of patience  quoth antony to his disciples if you try to keep silence do not think that you are exercising a virtue but that you are unworthy to speak  certain old men came once to antony and he wished to prove them and began to talk of holy scripture and to ask them beginning at the youngest what this and that text meant  and each answered as best they could  but he kept on saying you have not yet found it out  and at last he asked abbot joseph and what dost thou think this text means  quoth abbot joseph i do not know  quoth antony abbot joseph alone has found out the way for he says he does not know it  quoth antony i do not now fear god but love him for love drives out fear  he said again life and death are very near us for if we gain our brother we gain god  but if we cause our brother to offend we sin against christ  a philosopher asked antony how art thou content father since thou hast not the comfort of books  quoth antony my book is the nature of created things  in it when i choose i can read the words of god  brethren came to antony and asked of him a saying by which they might be saved  quoth he ye have heard the scriptures and know what christ requires of you  but they begged that he would tell them something of his own  quoth he the gospel says if a man smite you on one cheek turn to him the other  but they said that they could not do that  quoth he you cannot turn the other cheek to him  then let him smite you again on the same one  but they said they could not do that either  then said he if you cannot at least do not return evil for evil  and when they said that neither could they do that quoth antony to his disciples go get them something to eat for they are very weak  and he said to them if you cannot do the one and will not have the other what do you want  as i see what you want is prayer  that will heal your weakness  quoth antony he who would be free from his sins must be so by weeping and mourning and he who would be built up in virtue must be built up by tears  quoth antony when the stomach is full of meat forthwith the great vices bubble out according to that which the saviour says  that which entereth into the mouth defileth not a man but that which cometh out of the heart sinks a man in destruction  this may be a somewhat paradoxical application of the text  but the last anecdote of antony which i shall quote is full of wisdom and humanity  a monk came from alexandria eulogius by name bringing with him a man afflicted with elephantiasis  now eulogius had been a scholar learned and rich and had given away all he had save a very little which he kept because he could not work with his own hands  and he told antony how he had found that wretched man lying in the street fifteen years before having lost then nearly every member save his tongue and how he had taken him home to his cell nursed him bathed him physicked him fed him and how the man had returned him nothing save slanders curses and insults how he had insisted on having meat and had had it and on going out in public and had company brought to him and how he had at last demanded to be put down again whence he had been taken always cursing and slandering  and now eulogius could bear the man no longer and was minded to take him at his word  then said antony with an angry voice wilt thou cast him out eulogius  he who remembers that he made him will not cast him out if thou cast him out he will find a better friend than thee  god will choose some one who will take him up when he is cast away eulogius was terrified at these words and held his peace  then went antony to the sick man and shouted at him thou elephantiac foul with mud and dirt not worthy of the third heaven wilt thou not stop shouting blasphemies against god  dost thou not know that he who ministers to thee is christ  how darest thou say such things against christ  and he bade eulogius and the sick man go back to their cell and live in peace and never part more  both went back and after forty days eulogius died and the sick man shortly after altogether whole in spirit    hilarion    i would gladly did space allow give more biographies from among those of the egyptian hermits  but it seems best having shown the reader antony as the father of egyptian monachism to go on to his great pupil hilarion the father of monachism in palestine  his life stands written at length by st jerome who himself died a monk at bethlehem and is composed happily in a less ambitious and less rugged style than that of paul not without elements of beauty even of tragedy   prologue   remember me in thy holy prayers glory and honour of virgins nun asella  before beginning to write the life of the blessed hilarion i invoke the holy spirit which dwelt in him that as he largely bestowed virtues on hilarion he may give to me speech wherewith to relate them so that his deeds may be equalled by my language  for those who as crispus says have wrought virtues are held to have been worthily praised in proportion to the words in which famous intellects have been able to extol them  alexander the great the macedonian whom daniel calls either the brass or the leopard or the hegoat on coming to the tomb of achilles happy art thou youth he said who hast been blest with a great herald of thy worthmeaning homer  but i have to tell the conversation and life of such and so great a man that even homer were he here would either envy my matter or succumb under it  for although st epiphanius bishop of salamina in cyprus who had much intercourse with hilarion has written his praise in a short epistle which is commonly read yet it is one thing to praise the dead in general phrases another to relate his special virtues  we therefore set to work rather to his advantage than to his injury and despise those evilspeakers who lately carped at paul and will perhaps now carp at my hilarion unjustly blaming the former for his solitary life and the latter for his intercourse with men in order that the one who was never seen may be supposed not to have existed the other who was seen by many may be held cheap  this was the way of their ancestors likewise the pharisees who were neither satisfied with johns desert life and fasting nor with the lord saviours public life eating and drinking  but i shall lay my hand to the work which i have determined and pass by with stopped ears the hounds of scylla  i pray that thou mayest persevere in christ and be mindful of me in thy prayers most sacred virgin   the life   hilarion was born in the village of thabatha which lies about five miles to the south of gaza in palestine  he had parents given to the worship of idols and blossomed as the saying is a rose among the thorns  sent by them to alexandria he was entrusted to a grammarian and there as far as his years allowed gave proof of great intellect and good morals  he was soon dear to all and skilled in the art of speaking  and what is more than all he believed in the lord jesus and delighted neither in the madness of the circus in the blood of the arena or in the luxury of the theatre  but all his heart was in the congregation of the church  but hearing the then famous name of antony which was carried throughout all egypt he was fired with a longing to visit him and went to the desert  as soon as he saw him he changed his dress and stayed with him about two months watching the order of his life and the purity of his manner how frequent he was in prayers how humble in receiving brethren severe in reproving them eager in exhorting them and how no infirmity ever broke through his continence and the coarseness of his food  but unable to bear longer the crowd which assembled round antony for various diseases and attacks of devils he said that it was not consistent to endure in the desert the crowds of cities but that he must rather begin where antony had begun  antony as a valiant man was receiving the reward of victory  he had not yet begun to serve as a soldier  he returned therefore with certain monks to his own country and finding his parents dead gave away part of his substance to the brethren part to the poor and kept nothing at all for himself fearing what is told in the acts of the apostles the example or punishment of ananias and sapphira and especially mindful of the lords sayinghe that leaveth not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple  he was then fifteen years old  so naked but armed in christ he entered the desert which seven miles from maiuma the port of gaza turns away to the left of those who go along the shore towards egypt  and though the place was bloodstained by robbers and his relations and friends warned him of the imminent danger he despised death in order to escape death  all wondered at his spirit wondered at his youth  save that a certain fire of the bosom and spark of faith glittered in his eyes his cheeks were smooth his body delicate and thin unable to bear any injury and liable to be overcome by even a light chill or heat  so covering his limbs only with a sackcloth and having a cloak of skin which the blessed antony had given him at starting and a rustic cloak between the sea and the swamp he enjoyed the vast and terrible solitude feeding on only fifteen figs after the setting of the sun and because the region was as has been said above of ill repute from robberies no man had ever stayed before in that place the devil seeing what he was doing and whither he had gone was tormented  and though he who of old boasted saying i shall ascend into heaven i shall sit above the stars of heaven and shall be like unto the most high now saw that he had been conquered by a boy and trampled under foot by him ere on account of his youth he could commit sin  he therefore began to tempt his senses but he enraged with himself and beating his breast with his fist as if he could drive out thoughts by blows i will force thee mine ass said he not to kick and feed thee with straw not barley i will wear thee out with hunger and thirst i will burden thee with heavy loads i will hunt thee through heat and cold till thou thinkest more of food than of play  he therefore sustained his fainting spirit with the juice of herbs and a few figs after each three or four days praying frequently and singing psalms and digging the ground with a mattock to double the labour of fasting by that of work  at the same time by weaving baskets of rushes he imitated the discipline of the egyptian monks and the apostles sayinghe that will not work neither let him eattill he was so attenuated and his body so exhausted that it scarce clung to his bones  one night he began to hear the crying 108 of infants the bleating of sheep the wailing of women the roaring of lions the murmur of an army and utterly portentous and barbarous voices so that he shrank frightened by the sound ere he saw aught  he understood these to be the insults of devils and falling on his knees he signed the cross of christ on his forehead and armed with that helmet and girt with the breastplate of faith he fought more valiantly as he lay longing somehow to see what he shuddered to hear and looking round him with anxious eyes  when without warning by the bright moonshine he saw a chariot with fiery horses rushing upon him  but when he had called on jesus the earth opened suddenly and the whole pomp was swallowed up before his eyes  then said he the horse and his rider he hath drowned in the sea and some glory themselves in chariots and some in horses  but we in the name of the lord our god  many were his temptations and various by day and night the snares of the devils  if we were to tell them all they would make the volume too long  how often did women appear to him how often plenteous banquets when he was hungry  sometimes as he prayed a howling wolf ran past him or a barking fox or as he sang a fight of gladiators made a show for him  and one of them as if slain falling at his feet prayed for sepulture  he prayed once with his head bowed to the ground and as is the nature of manhis mind wandered from his prayer and thought of i know not what when a mocking rider leaped on his back and spurring his sides and whipping his neck come he cries come run why do you sleep and laughing loudly over him asked him if he were tired or would have a feed of barley  so from his sixteenth to his twentieth year he was sheltered from the heat and rain in a tiny cabin which he had woven of rush and sedge  afterwards he built a little cell which remains to this day four feet wide and five feet highthat is lower than his own statureand somewhat longer than his small body needed so that you would believe it to be a tomb rather than a dwelling  he cut his hair only once a year on easterday and lay till his death on the bare ground and a layer of rushes never washing the sack in which he was clothed and saying that it was superfluous to seek for cleanliness in haircloth  nor did he change his tunic till the first was utterly in rags  he knew the scriptures by heart and recited them after his prayers and psalms as if god were present and because it would take up too much time to tell his great deeds one by one i will give a short account of them  then follows a series of miracles similar to those attributed to st antony and indeed to all these great hermit fathers  but it is unnecessary to relate more wonders which the reader cannot be expected to believe  these miracles however according to st jerome were the foundations of hilarions fame and public career for he says when they were noised abroad people flowed to him eagerly from syria to egypt so that many believed in christ and professed themselves to be monksfor no one had known of a monk in syria before the holy hilarion  he was the first founder and teacher of this conversation and study in the province  the lord jesus had in egypt the old man antony he had in palestine the young hilarion     he was raised indeed by the lord to such a glory that the blessed antony hearing of his conversation wrote to him and willingly received his letters and if rich people came to him from the parts of syria he said to them why have you chosen to trouble yourselves by coming so far when you have at home my son hilarion  so by his example innumerable monasteries arose throughout all palestine and all monks came eagerly to him    but what a care he had not to pass by any brother however humble or however poor may be shown by this that once going into the desert of kadesh to visit one of his disciples he came with an infinite crowd of monks to elusa on the very day as it chanced on which a yearly solemnity had gathered all the people of the town to the temple of venus for they honour her on account of the morning star to the worship of which the nation of the saracens is devoted  the town itself too is said to be in great part semi barbarous on account of its remote situation  hearing then that the holy hilarion was passing byfor he had often cured saracens possessed with daemonsthey came out to meet him in crowds with their wives and children bowing their necks and crying in the syrian tongue barech that is bless  he received them courteously and humbly entreating them to worship god rather than stones and wept abundantly looking up to heaven and promising them that if they would believe in christ he would come oftener to them  wonderful was the grace of the lord  they would not let him depart till he had laid the foundations of a future church and their priest crowned as he was had been consecrated with the sign of christ    he was now sixtythree years old  he saw about him a great monastery a multitude of brethren and crowds who came to be healed of diseases and unclean spirits filling the solitude around but he wept daily and remembered with incredible regret his ancient life i have returned to the world he said and received my reward in this life  all palestine and the neighbouring provinces think me to be worth somewhat while i possess a farm and household goods under the pretext of the brethrens advantage  on which the brethren and especially hesychius who bore him a wondrous love watched him narrowly  when he had lived thus sadly for two years aristaeneta the prefects wife came to him wishing him to go with her to antony i would go he said weeping if i were not held in the prison of this monastery and if it were of any use  for two days since the whole world was robbed of such a father  she believed him and stopped  and antonys death was confirmed a few days after  others may wonder at the signs and portents which he did at his incredible abstinence his silence his miracles  i am astonished at nothing so much as that he was able to trample under foot that glory and honour  bishops and clergy monks and christian matrons a great temptation people of the common sort great men too and judges crowded to him to receive from him blessed bread or oil  but he was thinking of nothing but the desert till one day he determined to set out and taking an ass for he was so shrunk with fasting that he could hardly walk he tried to go his way  the news got wind the desolation and destruction of palestine would ensue ten thousand souls men and women tried to stop his way but he would not hear them  smiting on the ground with his staff he said i will not make my god a liar  i cannot bear to see churches ruined the altars of christ trampled down the blood of my sons spilt all who heard thought that some secret revelation had been made to him  but yet they would not let him go  whereon he would neither eat nor drink and for seven days he persevered fasting till he had his wish and set out for bethulia with forty monks who could march without food till sundown  on the fifth day he came to pelusium then to the camp thebatrum to see dracontius and then to babylon to see philo  these two were bishops and confessors exiled by constantius who favoured the arian heresy  then he came to aphroditon where he met barsanes the deacon who used to carry water to antony on dromedaries and heard from him that the anniversary antonys death was near and would be celebrated by a vigil at his tomb  then through a vast and horrible wilderness he went for three days to a very high mountain and found there two monks isaac and pelusianus of whom isaac had been antonys interpreter  a high and rocky hill it was with fountains gushing out at its foot  some of them the sand sucked up some formed a little rill with palms without number on its banks  there you might have seen the old man wandering to and fro with antonys disciples  here they said he used to sing here to pray here to work here to sit when tired  these vines these shrubs he planted himself that plot he laid out with his own hands  this pond to water the garden he made with heavy toil that hoe he kept for many years  hilarion lay on his bed and kissed the couch as if it were still warm antonys cell was only large enough to let a man lie down in it and on the mountain top reached by a difficult and winding stair were two other cells of the same size cut in the stony rock to which he used to retire from the visitors and disciples when they came to the garden  you see said isaac this orchard with shrubs and vegetables  three years since a troop of wild asses laid it waste he bade one of their leaders stop and beat it with his staff  why do you eat he asked it what you did not sow  and after that the asses though they came to drink the waters never touched his plants  then hilarion asked them to show him antonys grave  they led him apart but whether they showed it to him no man knows  they hid it they said by antonys command lest one pergamius who was the richest man of those parts should take the corpse to his villa and build a chapel over it  then he went back to aphroditon and with only two brothers dwelt in the desert in such abstinence and silence that so he said he then first began to serve christ  now it was then three years since the heaven had been shut and the earth dried up  so that they said commonly the very elements mourned the death of antony  but hilarions fame spread to them and a great multitude brown and shrunken with famine cried to him for rain as to the blessed antonys successor  he saw them and grieved over them and lifting up his hand to heaven obtained rain at once  but the thirsty and sandy land as soon as it was watered by showers sent forth such a crowd of serpents and venomous animals that people without number were stung and would have died had they not run together to hilarion  with oil blessed by him the husbandmen and shepherds touched their wounds and all were surely healed  but when he saw that he was marvellously honoured he went to alexandria meaning to cross the desert to the further oasis  and because since he was a monk he had never stayed in a city he turned aside to some brethren known to him in the brucheion 115 not far from alexandria  they received him with joy  but when night came on they suddenly heard him bid his disciples saddle the ass  in vain they entreated threw themselves across the threshold  his only answer was that he was hastening away lest he should bring them into trouble they would soon know that he had not departed without good reason  the next day men of gaza came with the prefects lictors burst into the monastery and when they found him notis it not true they said what we heard  he is a sorcerer and knows the future  for the citizens of gaza after hilarion was gone and julian had succeeded to the empire had destroyed his monastery and begged from the emperor the death of hilarion and hesychius  so letters had been sent forth to seek them throughout the world  so hilarion went by the pathless wilderness into the oasis 116 and after a year more or lessbecause his fame had gone before him even there and he could not lie hid in the easthe was minded to sail away to lonely islands that the sea at least might hide what the land would not  but just then hadrian his disciple came from palestine telling him that julian was slain and that a christian emperor was reigning so that he ought to return to the relics of his monastery but he abhorred the thought and hiring a camel went over the vast desert to paraetonia a sea town of libya  then the wretched hadrian wishing to go back to palestine and get himself glory under his masters name packed up all that the brethren had sent by him to his master and went secretly away  butas a terror to those who despise their mastershe shortly after died of jaundice  then with zananas alone hilarion went on board ship to sail for sicily  and when almost in the middle of adria 117a he was going to sell the gospels which he had written out with his own hand when young to pay his fare withal then the captains son was possessed with a devil and cried out hilarion servant of god why can we not be safe from thee even at sea  give me a little respite till i come to the shore lest if i be cast out here i fall headlong into the abyss  then said he if my god lets thee stay stay  but if he cast thee out why dost thou lay the blame on me a sinner and a beggar  then he made the captain and the crew promise not to betray him  and the devil was cast out  but the captain would take no fare when he saw that they had nought but those gospels and the clothes on their backs  and so hilarion came to pachynum a cape of sicily 117b and fled twenty miles inland into a deserted farm and there every day gathered a bundle of firewood and put it on zananass back who took it to the town and bought a little bread thereby  but it happened according to that which is written a city set on an hill cannot be hid one scutarius was tormented by a devil in the basilica of st peter at rome and the unclean spirit cried out in him a few days since hilarion the servant of christ landed in sicily and no man knows him and he thinks himself hid  i will go and betray him  and forthwith he took ship with his slaves and came to pachynum and by the leading of the devil threw himself down before the old mans hut and was cured  the frequency of his signs in sicily drew to him sick people and religious men in multitudes and one of the chief men was cured of dropsy the same day that he came and offered hilarion boundless gifts  but he obeyed the saviours saying freely ye have received freely give  while this was happening in sicily hesychius his disciple was seeking the old man through the world searching the shores penetrating the desert and only certain that wherever he was he could not long be hid  so after three years were past he heard at methone 118 from a jew who was selling old clothes that a prophet of the christians had appeared in sicily working such wonders that he was thought to be one of the old saints  but he could give no description of him having only heard common report he sailed for pachynum and there in a cottage on the shore heard of hilarions famethat which most surprised all being that after so many signs and miracles he had not accepted even a bit of bread from any man  so not to make the story too long as says st jerome hesychius fell at his masters knees and watered his feet with tears till at last he raised him up  but two or three days after he heard from zananas how the old man could dwell no longer in these regions but was minded to go to some barbarous nation where both his name and his speech should be unknown  so he took him to epidaurus 119a a city of dalmatia where he lay a few days in a little farm and yet could not be hid for a dragon of wondrous sizeone of those which in the country speech they call boas because they are so huge that they can swallow an oxlaid waste the province and devoured not only herds and flocks but husbandmen and shepherds which he drew to him by the force of his breath 119b  hilarion commanded a pile of wood to be prepared and having prayed to christ and called the beast forth commanded him to ascend the pile and having put fire under burnt him before all the people  then fretting over what he should do or whither he should turn he went alone over the world in imagination and mourned that when his tongue was silent his miracles still spoke  in those days at the earthquake over the whole world which befell after julians death the sea broke its bounds and as if god was threatening another flood or all was returning to the primaeval chaos ships were carried up steep rocks and hung there  but when the epidauritans saw roaring waves and mountains of water borne towards the shore fearing lest the town should be utterly overthrown they went out to the old man and as if they were leading him out to battle stationed him on the shore  and when he had marked three signs of the cross upon the sand and stretched out his hands against the waves it is past belief to what a height the sea swelled and stood up before him and then raging long as if indignant at the barrier fell back little by little into itself  all epidaurus and all that region talk of this to this day and mothers teach it their children that they may hand it down to posterity  truly that which was said to the apostles if ye believe ye shall say to this mountain be removed and cast into the sea and it shall be done can be fulfilled even to the letter if we have the faith of the apostles and such as the lord commanded them to have  for which is more strange that a mountain should descend into the sea or that mountains of water should stiffen of a sudden and firm as a rock only at an old mans feet should flow softly everywhere else  all the city wondered and the greatness of the sign was bruited abroad even at salo  when the old man discovered that he fled secretly by night in a little boat and finding a merchantman after two days sailed for cyprus  between maleae and cythera 121 they were met by pirates who had left their vessels under the shore and came up in two large galleys worked not with sails but oars  as the rowers swept the billows all on board began to tremble weep run about get handspikes ready and as if one messenger was not enough vie with each other in telling the old man that pirates were at hand  he looked out at them and smiled  then turning to his disciples o ye of little faith he said wherefore do ye doubt  are these more in number than pharaohs army  yet they were all drowned when god so willed  while he spoke the hostile keels with foaming beaks were but a short stones throw off  he then stood on the ships bow and stretching out his hand against them let it be enough he said to have come thus far  o wondrous faith  the boats instantly sprang back and made stern way although the oars impelled them in the opposite direction  the pirates were astonished having no wish to return backforemost and struggled with all their might to reach the ship but were carried to the shore again much faster than they had come  i pass over the rest lest by telling every story i make the volume too long  this only i will say that while he sailed prosperously through the cyclades he heard the voices of foul spirits calling here and there out of the towns and villages and running together on the beaches  so he came to paphos the city of cyprus famous once in poets songs which now shaken down by frequent earthquakes only shows what it has been of yore by the foundations of its ruins  there he dwelt meanly near the second milestone out of the city rejoicing much that he was living quietly for a few days  but not three weeks were past ere throughout the whole island whosoever had unclean spirits began to cry that hilarion the servant of christ was come and that they must hasten to him salonica curium lapetha and the other towns all cried this together most saying that they knew hilarion and that he was truly a servant of god but where he was they knew not  within a month nearly 200 men and women were gathered together to him  whom when he saw grieving that they would not suffer him to rest raging as it were to revenge himself he scourged them with such an instancy of prayer that some were cured at once some after two or three days and all within a week  so staying there two years and always meditating flight he sent hesychius to palestine to salute the brethren visit the ashes of the monastery and return in the spring  when he returned and hilarion was longing to sail again to egyptthat is to the cattle pastures 123a because there is no christian there but only a fierce and barbarous folkhe persuaded the old man rather to withdraw into some more secret spot in the island itself  and looking round it long till he had examined it all over he led him away twelve miles from the sea among lonely and rough mountains where they could hardly climb up creeping on hands and knees  when they were within they beheld a spot terrible and very lonely surrounded with trees which had too waters falling from the brow of a cliff and a most pleasant little garden and many fruittrees the fruit of which however hilarion never ateand near it the ruin of a very ancient temple 123b out of which so he and his disciples averred the voices of so many daemons resounded day and night that you would have fancied an army there  with which he was exceedingly delighted because he had his foes close to him and dwelt therein five years and while hesychius often visited him he was much cheered up in this last period of his life because owing to the roughness and difficulty of the ground and the multitude of ghosts as was commonly reported few or none ever dare climb up to him  but one day going out of the little garden he saw a man paralytic in all his limbs lying before the gate and having asked hesychius who he was and how he had come he was told that the man was the steward of a small estate and that to him the garden in which they were belonged  hilarion weeping over him and stretching a hand to him as he lay said i say to thee in the name of jesus christ our lord arise and walk  wonderful was the rapidity of the effect  the words were yet in his mouth when the limbs strengthened raised the man upon his feet  as soon as it was known the needs of many conquered the difficulty of the ground and the want of a path while all in the neighbourhood watched nothing so carefully as that he should not by some plan slip away from them  for the report had been spread about him that he could not remain long in the same place which nevertheless he did not do from any caprice or childishness but to escape honour and importunity for he always longed after silence and an ignoble life  so in the eightieth year of his age while hesychius was absent he wrote a short letter by way of testament with his own hand leaving to hesychius all his riches namely his gospelbook and a sackclothshirt hood and mantle  for his servant had died a few days before  many religious men came to him from paphos while he was sick especially because they had heard that he had said that now he was going to migrate to the lord and be freed from the chains of the body  there came also constantia a highborn lady whose soninlaw and daughter he had delivered from death by anointing them with oil  and he made them all swear that he should not be kept an hour after his death but covered up with earth in that same garden clothed as he was in his haircloth shirt hood and rustic cloak  and now little heat was left in his body and nothing of a living man was left except his reason  and yet with open eyes he went on saying go forth what fearest thou  go forth my soul what doubtest thou  nigh seventy years hast thou served christ and dost thou fear death  with these words he breathed out his soul  they covered him forthwith in earth and told them in the city that he was buried before it was known that he was dead  the holy man hesychius heard this in palestine reached cyprus and pretending in order to prevent suspicion on the part of the neighbours who guarded the spot diligently that he wished to dwell in that same garden he after some ten months with extreme peril of his life stole the corpse  he carried it to maiuma followed by whole crowds of monks and townsfolk and placed it in the old monastery with the shirt hood and cloak unhurt the whole body perfect as if alive and fragrant with such strong odour that it seemed to have had unguents poured over it  i think that i ought not in the end of my book to be silent about the devotion of that most holy woman constantia who hearing that the body of hilarion the servant of god was gone to palestine straightway gave up the ghost proving by her very death her true love for the servant of god  for she was wont to pass nights in watching his sepulchre and to converse with him as if he were present in order to assist her prayers  you may see even to this day a wonderful contention between the folk of palestine and the cypriots the former saying that they have the body the latter that they have the soul of hilarion  and yet in both places great signs are worked daily but most in the little garden in cyprus perhaps because he loved that place the best   such is the story of hilarion  his name still lingers in the place he loved the best  to this day i quote this fact from m de montalemberts work the cypriots confounding in their memories legends of good and of evil the victories of the soul and the triumph of the senses give to the ruins of one of those strong castles built by the lusignans which command their isle the double name of the castle of st hilarion and the castle of the god of love  but how intense must have been the longing for solitude which drove the old man to travel on foot from syria to the egyptian desert across the pathless westward waste even to the oasis and the utmost limits of the egyptian province and then to sicily to the adriatic and at last to a distant isle of greece  and shall we blame him for that longing  he seems to have done his duty earnestly according to his own light towards his fellowcreatures whenever he met them  but he seems to have found that noise and crowd display and honour were not altogether wholesome for his own soul and in order that he might be a better man he desired again and again to flee that he might collect himself and be alone with nature and with god  we here in england like the old greeks and romans dwellers in the busy mart of civilized life have got to regard mere bustle as so integral an element of human life that we consider a love of solitude a mark of eccentricity and if we meet any one who loves to be alone are afraid that he must needs be going mad  and that with too great solitude comes the danger of too great selfconsciousness and even at last of insanity none can doubt  but still we must remember on the other hand that without solitude without contemplation without habitual collection and re collection of our own selves from time to time no great purpose is carried out and no great work can be done and that it is the bustle and hurry of our modern life which causes shallow thought unstable purpose and wasted energy in too many who would be better and wiser stronger and happier if they would devote more time to silence and meditation if they would commune with their own heart in their chamber and be still  even in art and in mechanical science those who have done great work upon the earth have been men given to solitary meditation  when brindley the engineer it is said had a difficult problem to solve he used to go to bed and stay there till he had worked it out  turner the greatest nature painter of this or any other age spent hours upon hours in mere contemplation of nature without using his pencil at all  it is said of him that he was seen to spend a whole day sitting upon a rock and throwing pebbles into a lake and when at evening his fellow painters showed their days sketches and rallied him upon having done nothing he answered them i have done this at least i have learnt how a lake looks when pebbles are thrown into it and if this silent labour this steadfast thought are required even for outward arts and sciences how much more for the highest of all arts the deepest of all sciences that which involves the questionswho are we and where are we who is god and what are we to god and he to usnamely the science of being good which deals not with time merely but with eternity  no retirement no loneliness no period of earnest and solemn meditation can be misspent which helps us towards that goal  and therefore it was that hilarion longed to be alone alone with god and with nature which spoke to him of god  for these old hermits though they neither talked nor wrote concerning scenery nor painted pictures of it as we do now had many of them a clear and intense instinct of the beauty and the meaning of outward nature as antony surely had when he said that the world around was his book wherein he read the mysteries of god  hilarion seems from his story to have had a special craving for the sea  perhaps his early sojourn on the low sandhills of the philistine shore as he watched the tideless mediterranean rolling and breaking for ever upon the same beach had taught him to say with the old prophet as he thought of the wicked and still half idolatrous cities of the philistine shore fear ye not saith the lord will ye not tremble at my presence who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea for a perpetual decree that it cannot pass it  and though the waves thereof toss themselves yet can they not prevail though they roar yet can they not pass over  but this people has a revolted and rebellious heart they are revolted and gone  perhaps again looking down from the sunny sicilian cliffs of taormino or through the pineclad gulfs and gullies of the cypriote hills upon the blue mediterranean below   and watching from his mountain wall the wrinkled sea beneath him crawl   he had enjoyed and profited by all those images which that sight has called up in so many minds before and since  to him it may be as to the psalmist the stormswept sea pictured the instability of mortal things while secure upon his cliff he said with the psalmist the lord hath set my feet upon a rock and ordered my goings and again the wicked are like a troubled sea casting up mire and dirt  often again looking upon that far horizon must his soul have been drawn as many a soul has been drawn since to it and beyond it as it were into a region of boundless freedom and perfect peace while he said again with david oh that i had wings like a dove then would i flee away and be at rest and so have found in the contemplation of the wide ocean a substitute at least for the contemplation of those eastern deserts which seemed the proper home for the solitary and meditative philosopher  for indeed in no northern country can such situations be found for the monastic cell as can be found in those great deserts which stretch from syria to arabia from arabia to egypt from egypt to africa properly so called  here and there a northern hermit found as hilarion found a fitting home by the seaside on some lonely island or stormbeat rock like st cuthbert off the coast of northumberland like st rule on his rock at st andrews and st columba with his evervenerable company of missionaries on iona but inland the fens and the forests were foul unwholesome depressing the haunts of fever ague delirium as st guthlac found at crowland and st godric at finkhale 130  the vast pine woods which clothe the alpine slopes the vast forests of beech and oak which then spread over france and germany gave in time shelter to many a holy hermit  but their gloom their unwholesomeness and the severity of the climate produced in them as in most northern ascetics a temper of mind more melancholy and often more fierce more given to passionate devotion but more given also to dark superstition and cruel selftorture than the genial climate of the desert produced in old monks of the east  when we think of st antony upon his mountain we must not picture to ourselves unless we too have been in the east such a mountain as we have ever seen  we must not think of a brown northern moorland sad savage stormswept snowburied save in the brief and uncertain summer months  we must not picture to ourselves an alp with thundering avalanches roaring torrents fierce alternations of heat and cold uninhabitable by mortal man save during that short period of the year when the maidens in the sennhutt watch the cattle upon the upland pastures  we must picture to ourselves mountains blazing day after day month after month beneath the glorious sun and cloudless sky in an air so invigorating that the arabs can still support life there upon a few dates each day and where as has been saidman needs there hardly to eat drink or sleep for the act of breathing will give life enough an atmosphere of such telescopic clearness as to explain many of the strange stories which have been lately told of antonys seemingly preternatural powers of vision a colouring which when painters dare to put it on canvas seems to our eyes accustomed to the quiet greys and greens of england exaggerated and impossibledistant mountains pink and lilac quivering in pale blue hazevast sheets of yellow sand across which the lonely rock or a troop of wild asses or gazelles throw intense blueblack shadowsrocks and cliffs not shrouded as here in soil much less in grass and trees or spotted with lichens and stained with veins but keeping each stone its natural colour as it wastesif indeed it wastes at allunder the action of the all but rainless air which has left the paintings on the old egyptian temples fresh and clear for thousands of years rocks orange and purple black white and yellow and again and again beyond them 131 glimpses it may be of the black nile and of the long green garden of egypt and of the dark blue sea  the eastward view from antonys old home must be one of the most glorious in the world save for its want of verdure and of life  for antony as he looked across the blue waters of the gulf of akaba across which far above the israelites had passed in old times could see the sacred goal of their pilgrimage the red granite peaks of sinai flaming against the blue sky with that intensity of hue which is scarcely exaggerated it is said by the bright scarlet colour in which sinai is always painted in mediaeval illuminations  but the gorgeousness of colouring though it may interest us was not of course what produced the deepest effect upon the minds of those old hermits  they enjoyed nature not so much for her beauty as for her perfect peace  day by day the rocks remained the same silently out of the eastern desert day by day the rising sun threw aloft those arrows of light which the old greeks had named the rosy fingers of the dawn  silently he passed in full blaze almost above their heads throughout the day and silently he dipped behind the western desert in a glory of crimson and orange green and purple and without an interval of twilight in a moment all the land was dark and the stars leapt out not twinkling as in our damper climate here but hanging like balls of white fire in that purple southern night through which one seems to look beyond the stars into the infinite abyss and towards the throne of god himself  day after day night after night that gorgeous pageant passed over the poor hermits head without a sound and though sun and moon and planet might change their places as the year rolled round the earth beneath his feet seemed not to change  every morning he saw the same peaks in the distance the same rocks the same sandheaps around his feet  he never heard the tinkle of a running stream  for weeks together he did not even hear the rushing of the wind  now and then a storm might sweep up the pass whirling the sand in eddies and making the desert for a while literally a howling wilderness and when that was passed all was as it had been before  the very change of seasons must have been little marked to him save by the motions if he cared to watch them of the stars above for vegetation there was none to mark the difference between summer and winter  in spring of course the solitary datepalm here and there threw out its spathe of young green leaves to add to the number of those which grey or brown hung drooping down the stem withering but not decaying for many a year in that dry atmosphere or perhaps the accacia bushes looked somewhat gayer for a few weeks and the retama broom from which as well as from the palm leaves he plaited his baskets threw out its yearly crop of twigs but any greenness there might be in the vegetation of spring turned grey in a few weeks beneath that burning sun and be rest of the year was one perpetual summer of dust and glare and rest  amid such scenes they had full time for thought  nature and man alike left it in peace while the labour required for sustaining life and the monk wished for nothing more than to sustain mere life was very light  wherever water could be found the hot sun and the fertile soil would repay by abundant crops perhaps twice in the year the toil of scratching the ground and putting in the seed  moreover the labour of the husbandman so far from being adverse to the contemplative life is of all occupations it may be that which promotes most quiet and wholesome meditation in the mind which cares to meditate  the life of the desert when once the passions of youth were conquered seems to have been not only a happy but a healthy one  and when we remember that the monk clothed from head to foot in woollen and sheltered too by his sheepskin cape escaped those violent changes of temperature which produce in the east so many fatal diseases and which were so deadly to the linenclothed inhabitants of the green lowlands of the nile we need not be surprised when we read of the vast longevity of many of the old abbots and of their death not by disease but by gentle and as it were wholesome natural decay  but if their life was easy it was surely not illspent  if having few wants and those soon supplied they found too much time for the luxury of quiet thought those need not blame them who having many wants and those also easily supplied are wont to spend their superfluous leisure in any luxury save that of thought above all save that of thought concerning god  for it was upon god that these men whatever their defects or ignorances may have been had set their minds  that man was sent into the world to know and to love to obey and thereby to glorify the maker of his being was the cardinal point of their creed as it has been of every creed which ever exercised any beneficial influence on the minds of men  dean milman in his history of christianity vol iii page 294 has while justly severe upon the failings and mistakes of the eastern monks pointed out with equal justice that the great desire of knowing god was the prime motive in the mind of all their best men   in some regions of the east the sultry and oppressive heat the general relaxation of the physical system dispose constitutions of a certain temperament to a dreamy inertness  the indolence and prostration of the body produce a kind of activity in the mind if that may properly be called activity which is merely giving loose to the imagination and the emotions as they follow out the wild train of incoherent thought or are agitated by impulses of spontaneous and ungoverned feeling  ascetic christianity ministered new aliment to this common propensity  it gave an object both vague and determinate enough to stimulate yet never to satisfy or exhaust the regularity of stated hours of prayer and of a kind of idle industry weaving mats or plaiting baskets alternated with periods of morbid reflection on the moral state of the soul and of mystic communion with the deity  it cannot indeed be wondered that this new revelation as it were of the deity this profound and rational certainty of his existence this infelt consciousness of his perpetual presence these as yet unknown impressions of his infinity his power and his love should give a higher character to this eremitical enthusiasm and attract men of loftier and more vigorous minds within its sphere  it was not merely the pusillanimous dread of encountering the trials of life which urged the humbler spirits to seek a safe retirement or the natural love of peace and the weariness and satiety of life which commended this seclusion to those who were too gentle to mingle in or who were exhausted with the unprofitable turmoil of the world nor was it always the anxiety to mortify the rebellious and refractory body with more advantage  the one absorbing idea of the majesty of the godhead almost seemed to swallow up all other considerations  the transcendent nature of the triune deity the relation of the different persons of the godhead to each other seemed the only worthy object of mens contemplative faculties  and surely the contemplation of the godhead is no unworthy occupation for the immortal soul of any human being  but it would be unjust to these hermits did we fancy that their religion consisted merely even in this much less that it consisted merely in dreams and visions or in mere stated hours of prayer  that all did not fulfil the ideal of their profession is to be expected and is frankly confessed by the writers of the lives of the fathers that there were serious faults even great crimes among them is not denied  those who wrote concerning them were so sure that they were on the whole good men that they were not at all afraid of saying that some of them were badnot afraid even of recording though only in dark hints the reason why the arab tribes around once rose and laid waste six churches with their monasteries in the neighbourhood of scetis  st jerome in like manner does not hesitate to pour out bitter complaints against many of the monks in the neighbourhood of bethlehem  it is notorious too that many became monks merely to escape slavery hunger or conscription into the army  unruly and fanatical spirits too grew fond of wandering  bands of monks on the great roads and public places of the empire massalians or gyrovagi as they were called wandered from province to province and cell to cell living on the alms which they extorted from the pious and making up too often for protracted fasts by outbursts of gluttony and drunkenness  and doubtless the average monk even when wellconducted himself and in a wellconducted monastery was like average men of every creed rank or occupation a very commonplace person acting from very mixed and often very questionable motives and valuing his shaven crown and his sheepskin cloak his regular hours of prayer and his implicit obedience to his abbot more highly than he valued the fear and the love of god  it is so in every creed  with some even now the strict observance of the sabbath with others outward reverence at the holy communion with others the frequent hearing of sermons which suit heir own views with others continual reading of pious books on the lessons of which they do not act covers instead of charity a multitude of sins  but the saint abbot or father among these hermits was essentially the man who was not a commonplace person who was more than an ascetic and more than a formalist who could pierce beyond the letter to the spirit and see beyond all forms of doctrine or modes of life that virtue was the one thing needful  the historia lausiaca and the pratum spirituale have many a story and many a saying as weighty beautiful and instructive now as they were fifteen hundred years ago stories which show that graces and virtues such as the world had never seen before save in the persecuted and halfunknown christians of the first three centuries were cultivated to noble fruitfulness by the monks of the east  for their humility obedience and reverence for their superiors it is not wise to praise them just now for those are qualities which are not at present considered virtues but rather save by the soldier somewhat abject vices and indeed they often carried them as they did their abstinence to an extravagant pitch  but it must be remembered in fairness that if they obeyed their supposed superiors they had first chosen their superiors themselves that as the becoming a monk at all was an assertion of selfwill and independence whether for good or evil so their reverence for their abbots was a voluntary loyalty to one who they fancied had a right to rule them because he was wiser and better than they a feeling which some have found not degrading but ennobling and the parent not of servility but of true freedom  and as for the obsolete virtue of humility that still remains true which a voice said to antony when he saw the snares which were spread over the whole earth and asked sighing who can pass safely over these and the voice answered humility alone  for the rest if the sermon on the mount mean anything as a practical rule of life for christian men then these monks were surely justified in trying to obey it for to obey it they surely tried  the words of the elders to which i have already alluded and the lausiaca of palladius likewise are full of precious scraps of moral wisdom sayings and anecdotes full of nobleness purity pathos insight into character and often instinct with a quiet humour which seems to have been in the old world peculiar to the egyptians as it is in the new almost peculiar to the old fashioned godfearing scotsman  take these examples chosen almost at random  serapion the sindonite was so called because he wore nothing but a sindon or linen shirt  though he could not read he could say all the scriptures by heart  he could not says palladius sit quiet in his cell but wandered over the world in utter poverty so that he attained to perfect impassibility for with that nature he was born for there are differences of natures not of substances  so says palladius and goes on to tell how serapion sold himself to certain playactors for twenty gold pieces and laboured for them as a slave till he had won them to christ and made them renounce the theatre after which he made his converts give the money to the poor and went his way  on one of his journeys he came to athens and having neither money nor goods starved there for three days  but on the fourth he went up seemingly to the areopagus and cried men of athens help and when the crowd questioned him he told them that he had since he left egypt fallen into the hands of three usurers two of whom he had satisfied but the third would not leave him  on being promised assistance he told them that his three usurers were avarice sensuality and hunger  of the two first he was rid having neither money nor passions  but as he had eaten nothing for three days the third was beginning to be troublesome and demanded its usual debt without paying which he could not well live whereon certain philosophers seemly amused by his apologue gave him a gold coin  he went to a bakers shop laid down the coin took up a loaf and went out of athens for ever  then the philosophers knew that he was endowed with true virtue and when they had paid the baker the price of the loaf got back their gold  when he went into lacedaemon he heard that a great man there was a manichaean with all his family though otherwise a good man  to him serapion sold himself as a slave and within two years converted him and his wife who thenceforth treated him not as a slave but as their own brother  after awhile this spiritual adamant as palladius calls him bought his freedom of them and sailed for rome  at sundown first the sailors and then the passengers brought out each man his provisions and ate  serapion sat still  the crew fancied that he was seasick but when he had passed a second third and fourth day fasting they asked man why do you not eat  because i have nothing to eat  they thought that some one had stolen his baggage but when they found that the man had absolutely nothing they began to ask him not only how he would keep alive but how he would pay his fare  he only answered that he had nothing that they might cast him out of the ship where they had found him  but they answered not for a hundred gold pieces so favourable was the wind and fed him all the way to rome where we lose sight of him and his humour  to go on with almost chance quotations  some monks were eating at a festival and one said to the serving man i eat nothing cooked tell them to bring me salt  the serving man began to talk loudly  that brother eats no cooked meat bring him a little salt  quoth abbot theodore  it were more better for thee brother to eat meat in thy cell than to hear thyself talked about in the presence of thy brethren  again  a brother came to abbot silvanus in mount sinai and found the brethren working and said why labour you for the meat which perisheth  mary chose the good part  the abbot said give him a book to read and put him in an empty cell  about the ninth hour the brother looked out to see if he would be called to eat and at last came to the abbot and asked do not the brethren eat today abbot  yes  then why was not i called  then quoth abbot silvanus  thou art a spiritual man  and needest not their food we are carnal and must eat because we work  but thou hast chosen the better part  whereat the monk was ashamed  as was also john the dwarf who wanted to be without care like the angels doing nothing but praise god  so he threw away his cloak left his brother the abbot and went into the desert  but after seven days he came back and knocked at the door  who is there asked his brother  john  nay john is turned into an angel and is no more among men  so he left him outside all night and in the morning gave him to understand that if he was a man he must work but that if he was an angel he had no need to live in a cell  consider again the saying of the great antony when some brethren were praising another in his presence  but antony tried him and found that he could not bear an injury  then said the old man brother thou art like a house with an ornamented porch while the thieves break into it by the back door  or this of abbot isidore when the devil tempted him to despair and told him that he would be lost after all  if i do go into torment i shall still find you below me there  or this of zeno the syrian when some egyptian monks came to him and began accusing themselves  the egyptians hide the virtues which they have and confess vices which they have not  the syrians and greeks boast of virtues which they have not and hide vices which they have  or this  one old man said to another i am dead to this world do not trust yourself quoth the other till you are out of this world  if you are dead the devil is not  two old men lived in the same cell and had never disagreed  said one to the other let us have just one quarrel like other men quoth the other  i do not know what a quarrel is like  quoth the first  herei will put a brick between us and say that it is mine  and you shall say it is not mine and over that let us have a contention and a squabble  but when they put the brick between them and one said it is mine the other said i hope it is mine  and when the first said it is mine it is not yours he answered if it is yours take it  so they could not find out how to have a quarrel  anger malice revenge were accursed things in the eyes of these men  there was enough of them and too much among their monks but far less doubt not than in the world outside  for within the monastery it was preached against repressed punished and when repented of forgiven with loving warnings and wise rules against future transgression  abbot agathon used to say i never went to sleep with a quarrel against any man nor did i as far as lay in me let one who had a quarrel against me sleep till he had made peace  abbot isaac was asked why the devils feared him so much  since i was made a monk he said i settled with myself that no angry word should come out of my mouth  an old man said anger arises from these four things  from the lust of avarice in giving and receiving from loving ones own opinion from wishing to be honoured and from fancying oneself a teacher and hoping to be wiser than everybody  and anger obscures human reason by these four ways  if a man hate his neighbour or if he envy him or if he look on him as nought or if he speak evil of him  a brother being injured by another came to abbot sidonius told his story and said i wish to avenge myself father  the abbot begged him to leave vengeance to god  but when he refused said then let us pray  whereon the old man rose and said god thou art not necessary to us any longer that thou shouldest be careful of us  for we as this brother says both will and can avenge ourselves  at which that brother fell at his feet and begged pardon promising never to strive with his enemy  abbot poemen said often let malice never overcome thee  if any man do thee harm repay him with good that thou mayest conquer evil with good  in a congregation at scetis when many mens lives and conversation had been talked over abbot pior held his tongue  after it was over he went out and filled a sack with sand and put it on his back  then he took a little bag filled it likewise with sand and carried it before him  and when the brethren asked him what he meant he said the sack behind is my own sins which are very many  yet i have cast them behind my back and will not see them nor weep over them  but i have put these few sins of my brothers before my eyes and am tormenting myself over them and condemning my brother  a brother having committed a fault went to antony and his brethren followed upbraiding him and wanting to bring him back while he denied having done the wrong  abbot paphnutius was there and spoke a parable to them  i saw on the river bank a man sunk in the mud up to his knees  and men came to pull him out and thrust him in up to the neck  then said antony of paphnutius behold a man who can indeed save souls  abbot macarius was going up to the mountain of nitria and sent his disciple on before  the disciple met an idolpriest hurrying on and carrying a great beam  to whom he cried where art thou running devil  at which he was wroth and beat him so that he left him half dead and then ran on and met macarius who said salvation to thee labourer salvation  he answered wondering what good hast thou seen in me that thou salutest me  because i saw thee working and running though ignorantly  to whom the priest said touched by thy salutation i knew thee to be a great servant of god for anotheri know not whomiserable monk met me and insulted me and i gave him blows for his words  then laying hold of macariuss feet he said unless thou make me a monk i will not leave hold of thee  after all of the best of these men are told with much honesty many sayings which show that they felt in their minds and hearts that the spirit was above the letter  sayings which show that they had at least at times glimpses of a simpler and more possible virtue foretastes of a perfection more human and it may be more divine  better said abbot hyperichius to eat flesh and drink wine than to eat our brethrens flesh with bitter words  a brother asked an elder give me father one thing which i may keep and be saved thereby  the elder answered if thou canst be injured and insulted and hear and be silent that is a great thing and above all the other commandments  one of the elders used to say whatever a man shrinks from let him not do to another  dost thou shrink if any man detracts from thee speak not ill of another  dost thou shrink if any man slanders thee or if any man takes aught from thee  do not that or the like to another man  for he that shall have kept this saying will find it suffice for his salvation  the nearer said abbot muthues a man approaches god the more he will see himself to be a sinner  abbot sisois when he lay dying begged to live a little longer that he might repent and when they wondered he told them that he had not yet even begun repentance  whereby they saw that he was perfect in the fear of the lord  but the most startling confession of all must have been that wrung from the famous macarius the elder  he had been asked once by a brother to tell him a rule by which he might be saved and his answer had been thisto fly from men to sit in his cell and to lament for his sins continually and what was above all virtues to keep his tongue in order as well as his appetite  but whether before or after that answer is not said he gained a deeper insight into true virtue on the day when like antony when he was reproved by the example of the tanner in alexandria he heard a voice telling him that he was inferior to two women who dwelt in the nearest town  catching up his staff like antony he went off to see the wonder  the women when questioned by him as to their works were astonished  they had been simply good wives for years past married to two brothers and living in the same house  but when pressed by him they confessed that they had never said a foul word to each other and never quarrelled  at one time they had agreed together to retire into a nunnery but could not for all their prayers obtain the consent of their husbands  on which they had both made an oath that they would never to their deaths speak one worldly word  which when the blessed macarius had heard he said in truth there is neither virgin nor married woman nor monk nor secular but god only requires the intention and ministers the spirit of life to all    arsenius    i shall give one more figure and that a truly tragical one from these lives of the egyptian fathers namely that of the once great and famous arsenius the father as he was at one time called of the emperors  theodosius the great statesman and warrior who for some twenty years kept up by his single hand the falling empire of rome heard how arsenius was at once the most pious and the most learned of his subjects and wishinghalf barbarian as he was himselfthat his sons should be brought up not only as scholars but as christians he sent for arsenius to his court and made him tutor to his two young sons honorius and arcadius  but the two lads had neither their fathers strength nor their fathers nobleness weak and profligate they fretted arseniuss soul day by day and at last so goes the story provoked him so far that according to the fashion of a roman pedagogue he took the ferula and administered to one of the princes a caning which he no doubt deserved  the young prince in revenge plotted against his life among the parasites of the palace it was not difficult to find those who would use steel and poison readily enough in the service of an heirapparent and arsenius fled for his life  and fled as men were wont in those days to egypt and the thebaid  forty years old he was when he left the court and forty years more he spent among the cells at scetis weeping day and night  he migrated afterwards to a place called troe and there died at the age of ninetyfive having wept himself say his admirers almost blind  he avoided as far as possible beholding the face of man upon the face of woman he would never look  a noble lady whom he had known probably in the world came all the way from rome to see him but he refused himself to her sternly almost roughly  he had known too much of the fine ladies of the roman court all he cared for was peace there is a story of him that changing once his dwellingplace probably from scetis to troe he asked somewhat peevishly of the monks around him what that noise was  they told him it was only the wind among the reeds  alas he said i have fled everywhere in search of silence and yet here the very reeds speak  the simple and comparatively unlearned monks around him looked with a profound respect on the philosopher courtier scholar who had cast away the real pomps and vanities of this life such as they had never known  there is a story told plainly concerning arsenius though his name is not actually mentioned in it how a certain old monk saw him lying upon a softer mat than his fellows and indulged with a few more comforts and complained indignantly of his luxury and the abbots favouritism  then asked the abbot what didst thou eat before thou becamest a monk he confessed he had been glad enough to fill his stomach with a few beans  how wert thou dressed  he was glad enough again he confessed to have any clothes at all on his back  where didst thou sleep  often enough on the bare ground in the open air was the answer  then said the abbot thou art by thy own confession better off as a monk than thou wast as a poor labouring man  and yet thou grudgest a little comfort to one who has given up more luxury than thou hast ever beheld  this man slept beneath silken canopies he was carried in gilded litters by trains of slaves he was clothed in purple and fine linen he fed upon all the delicacies of the great city  and he has given up all for christ  and what hast thou given up that thou shouldst grudge him a softer mat or a little more food each day  and so the monk was abashed and held his peace  as for arseniuss tears it is easy to call his grief exaggerated or superstitious  but those who look on them with human eyes will pardon them and watch with sacred pity the grief of a good man who felt that his life had been an utter failure  he saw his two pupils between whom at their fathers death the roman empire was divided into eastern and western grow more and more incapable of governing  he saw a young barbarian whom he must have often met at the court in byzantium as master of the horse come down from his native forests and sack the eternal city of rome  he saw evil and woe unspeakable fall on that world which he had left behind him till the earth was filled with blood and antichrist seemed ready to appear and the day of judgment to be at hand  and he had been called to do what he could to stave off this ruin to make those young princes decree justice and rule in judgment by the fear of god  but he had failed and there was nothing left to him save selfaccusation and regret and dread lest some at least of the blood which had been shed might be required at his hands therefore sitting upon his palmmat there in troe he wept his life away happier nevertheless and more honourable in the sight of god and man than if like a mazarin or a talleyrand and many another crafty politician both in church and state he had hardened his heart against his own mistakes and by crafty intrigue and adroit changing of sides at the right moment had contrived to secure for himself out of the general ruin honour and power and wealth and delicate food and a luxurious home and so been one of those of whom the psalmist says with awful irony so long as thou doest well unto thyself men will speak good of thee  one good deed at least arsenius had seen donea deed which has lasted to all time and done too to the eternal honour of his order by a monknamely the abolition of gladiator shows  for centuries these wholesale murders had lasted through the roman republic and through the roman empire  human beings in the prime of youth and health captives or slaves condemned malefactors and even freeborn men who hired themselves out to death had been trained to destroy each other in the amphitheatre for the amusement not merely of the roman mob but of the roman ladies  thousands sometimes in a single day had been   butchered to make a roman holiday   the training of gladiators had become a science  by their weapons and their armour and their modes of fighting they had been distinguished into regular classes of which the antiquaries count up full eighteen  andabatae who wore helmets without any opening for the eyes so that they were obliged to fight blindfold and thus excited the mirth of the spectators hoplomachi who fought in a complete suit of armour mirmillones who had the image of a fish upon their helmets and fought in armour with a short sword matched usually against the retiarii who fought without armour and whose weapons were a castingnet and a trident  these and other species of fighters were drilled and fed in families by lanistae or regular trainers who let them out to persons wishing to exhibit a show  women even highborn ladies had been seized in former times with the madness of fighting and as shameless as cruel had gone down into the arena to delight with their own wounds and their own gore the eyes of the roman people  and these things were done and done too often under the auspices of the gods and at their most sacred festivals  so deliberate and organized a system of wholesale butchery has never perhaps existed on this earth before or since not even in the worship of those mexican gods whose idols cortez and his soldiers found fed with human hearts and the walls of their temples crusted with human gore  gradually the spirit of the gospel had been triumphing over this abomination  ever since the time of tertullian in the second century christian preachers and writers had lifted up their voice in the name of humanity  towards the end of the third century the emperors themselves had so far yielded to the voice of reason as to forbid by edicts the gladiatorial fights  but the public opinion of the mob in most of the great cities had been too strong both for saints and for emperors  st augustine himself tells us of the horrible joy which he in his youth had seen come over the vast ring of flushed faces at these horrid sights and in arseniuss own time his miserable pupil the weak honorius bethought himself of celebrating once more the heathen festival of the secular games and formally to allow therein an exhibition of gladiators  but in the midst of that show sprang down into the arena of the colosseum of rome an unknown monk some said from nitria some from phrygia and with his own hands parted the combatants in the name of christ and god  the mob baulked for a moment of their pleasure sprang on him and stoned him to death  but the crime was followed by a sudden revulsion of feeling  by an edict of the emperor the gladiatorial sports were forbidden for ever and the colosseum thenceforth useless crumbled slowly away into that vast ruin which remains unto this day purified as men well said from the blood of tens of thousands by the blood of one true and noble martyr    the hermits of asia    the impulse which given by antony had been propagated in asia by his great pupil hilarion spread rapidly far and wide  hermits took possession of the highest peaks of sinai and driven from thence so tradition tells by fear of those mysterious noises which still haunt its cliffs settled at that sheltered spot where now stands the convent of st catharine  massacred again and again by the wild arab tribes their places were filled up by fresh hermits and their spiritual descendants hold the convent to this day  through the rich and luxuriant region of syria and especially round the richest and most luxurious of its cities antioch hermits settled and bore by the severity of their lives a noble witness against the profligacy of its inhabitants who had half renounced the paganism of their forefathers without renouncing in the least it seems those sins which drew down of old the vengeance of a righteous god upon their forefathers whether in canaan or in syria itself  at antioch about the year 347 was born the famous chrysostom john of the golden mouth and near antioch he became a hermit and dwelt so legends say several years alone in the wilderness  till nerved by that hard training he went forth again into the world to become whether at antioch or at constantinople the bravest as well as the most eloquent preacher of righteousness and rebuker of sin which the world had seen since the times of st paul  the labours of chrysostom belong not so much to this book as to a general ecclesiastical history  but it must not be forgotten that he like all the great men of that age had been a monk and kept up his monastic severity even in the midst of the world until his dying day  at nisibis again upon the very frontier of persia appeared another very remarkable personage known as the great jacob or great st james  taking says his admiring biographer theodoret of cyra to the peaks of the loftiest mountains he passed his life on them in spring and summer haunting the woods with the sky for a roof but sheltering himself in winter in a cave  his food was wild fruits and mountain herbs  he never used a fire and clothed in a goats hair garment was perhaps the first of those boscoi or browsing hermits who lived literally like the wild animals in the flesh while they tried to live like angels in the spirit  some of the stories told of jacob savour of that vindictiveness which giraldus cambrensis in after years attributed to the saints in ireland  he was walking one day over the persian frontier to visit the plants of true religion and bestow on them due care when he passed at a fountain a troop of damsels washing clothes and treading them with their feet  they seem according to the story to have stared at the wild man instead of veiling their faces or letting down their garments  no act or word of rudeness is reported of them  but jacobs modesty or pride was so much scandalized that he cursed both the fountain and the girls  the fountain of course dried up forthwith and the damsels hair turned grey  they ran weeping into the town  the townsfolk came out and compelled jacob by their prayers to restore the water to their fountain but the grey hair he refused to restore to its original hue unless the damsels would come and beg pardon publicly themselves  the poor girls were ashamed to come and their hair remained grey ever after  a story like this may raise a smile in some of my readers in others something like indignation or contempt  but as long as such legends remain in these hermit lives told with as much gravity as any other portion of the biography and eloquently lauded as this deed is by bishop theodoret as proofs of the holiness and humanity of the saint an honest author is bound to notice some of them at least and not to give an alluring and really dishonest account of these men and their times by detailing every anecdote which can elevate them in the mind of the reader while he carefully omits all that may justly disgust him  yet after all we are not bound to believe this legend any more than we are bound to believe that when jacob saw a persian judge give an unjust sentence he forthwith cursed not him but a rock close by which instantly crumbled into innumerable fragments so terrifying that judge that he at once revoked his sentence and gave a just decision  neither again need we believe that it was by sending as men said in his own days swarms of mosquitos against the persian invaders that he put to flight their elephants and horses  and yet it may be true that in the famous siege of nisibis jacob played the patriot and the valiant man  for when sapor the persian king came against nisibis with all his forces with troops of elephants and huge machines of war and towers full of archers wheeled up to the walls and at last damming the river itself turned its current against the fortifications of unburnt brick until a vast breach was opened in the walls then jacob standing in the breach encouraged by his prayers his fellowtownsmen to stop it with stone brick timber and whatsoever came to hand and sapor the persian sultan saw that divine man and his goatshair tunic and cloak seemed transformed into a purple robe and royal diadem  and whether he was seized with superstitious fear or whether the hot sun or the marshy ground had infected his troops with disease or whether the mosquito swarms actually became intolerable the great king of persia turned and went away  so nisibis was saved for a while to be shamefully surrendered to the persians a few years afterwards by the weak young emperor jovian  old ammianus marcellinus brave soldier as he was saw with disgust the whole body of citizens ordered to quit the city within three days and men appointed to compel obedience to the order with threats of death to every one who delayed his departure and the whole city was a scene of mourning and lamentation and in every quarter nothing was heard but one universal wail matrons tearing their hair and about to be driven from the homes in which they had been born and brought up the mother who had lost her children or the wife who had lost her husband about to be torn from the place rendered sacred by their shades clinging to their doorposts embracing their thresholds and pouring forth floods of tears every road was crowded each person struggling away as he could many too loaded themselves with as much of their property as they thought they could carry while leaving behind them abundant and costly furniture which they could not remove for want of beasts of burden 159  one treasure however they did remove of which the old soldier ammianus says nothing and which had he seen it pass him on the road he would have treated with supreme contempt  and that says theodoret was the holy body of their prince and defender st james the mountain hermit round which the emigrants chanted says theodoret hymns of regret and praise for had he been alive that city would have never passed into barbarian hands  there stood with jacob in the breach during that siege of nisibis a man of gentler temperament a disciple of his who had received baptism at his hands and who was like himself a hermitephraim or ephrem of edessa as he is commonly called for though born at nisibis his usual home was at edessa the metropolis of a syrian speaking race  into the syrian tongue ephrem translated the doctrines of the christian faith and the gospel history and spread abroad among the heathen round a number of delicate and graceful hymns which remain to this day and of which some have lately been translated into english 160  soft sad and dreamy as they were they had strength and beauty enough in them to supersede the gnostic hymns of bardesanes and his son harmonius which had been long popular among the syrians and for centuries afterwards till christianity was swept away by the followers of mahomet the syrian husbandman beguiled his toil with the pious and plaintive melodies of st ephrem  but ephrem was not only a hermit and a poet  he was a preacher and a missionary  if he wept as it was said day and night for his own sins and the sins of mankind he did his best at least to cure those sins  he was a demagogue or leader of the people for good and not for evil to whom the simple syrians looked up for many a year as their spiritual father  he died in peace as he said himself like the labourer who has finished his days work like the wandering merchant who returns to his fatherland leaving nothing behind him save prayers and counsels for ephrem he added had neither wallet nor pilgrims staff  his last utterance i owe this fact to m de montalemberts book moines doccident was a protest on behalf of the dignity of man redeemed by the son of god  the young and pious daughter of the governor of edessa came weeping to receive his latest breath  he made her swear never again to be carried in a litter by slaves the neck of man he said should bear no yoke save that of christ  this anecdote is one among many which go to prove that from the time that st paul had declared the great truth that in christ jesus was neither bond nor free and had proclaimed the spiritual brotherhood of all men in christ slavery as an institution was doomed to slow but certain death  but that death was accelerated by the monastic movement wherever it took root  a class of men who came not to be ministered unto but to minister to others who prided themselves upon needing fewer luxuries than the meanest slaves who took rank among each other and among men not on the ground of race nor of official position nor of wealth nor even of intellect but simply on the ground of virtue was a perpetual protest against slavery and tyranny of every kind a perpetual witness to the world that whether all men were equal or not in the sight of god the only rank among them of which god would take note would be their rank in goodness    basil    on the south shore of the black sea eastward of sinope there dwelt in those days at the mouth of the river iris a hermit as gentle and as pure as ephrem of edessa  beside a roaring waterfall amid deep glens and dark forests with distant glimpses of the stormy sea beyond there lived on bread and water a graceful gentleman young and handsome a scholar too who had drunk deeply at the fountains of pagan philosophy and poetry and had been educated with care at constantinople and at athens as well as at his native city of caesaraea in the heart of asia minor now dwindled under turkish misrule into a wretched village  he was heir to great estates the glens and forests round him were his own  and that was the use which he made of them  on the other side of the torrent his mother and his sister a maiden of wonderful beauty lived the hermit life on a footing of perfect equality with their female slaves and the pious women who had joined them  basils austeritiesor rather the severe climate of the black sea forestsbrought him to an early grave  but his short life was spent well enough  he was a poet with an eye for the beauty of natureespecially for the beauty of the seamost rare in those times and his works are full of descriptions of scenery as healthy minded as they are vivid and graceful  in his travels through egypt palestine and syria he had seen the hermits and longed to emulate them but to do him justice his ideal of the socalled religious life was more practical than those of the solitaries of egypt who had been his teachers  it was the life says dean milman 163 of the industrious religious community not of the indolent and solitary anchorite which to basil was the perfection of christianity     the indiscriminate charity of these institutions was to receive orphans of which there were but too many in those evil days of all classes for education and maintenance  but other children only with the consent or at the request of parents certified before witnesses and vows were by no means to be enforced upon these youthful pupils  slaves who fled to the monasteries were to be admonished and sent back to their owners  there is one reservation and that one only too necessary then that slaves were not bound to obey their master if he should order what is contrary to the law of god  industry was to be the animating principle of these settlements  prayer and psalmody were to have their stated hours but by no means to intrude on those devoted to useful labour  these labours were strictly defined such as were of real use to the community not those which might contribute to vice or luxury  agriculture was especially recommended  the life was in no respect to be absorbed in a perpetual mystic communion with the deity  the ideal which basil set before him was never fulfilled in the east  transported to the west by st benedict the father of all monks it became that conventual system which did so much during the early middle age not only for the conversion and civilization but for the arts and the agriculture of europe  basil like his bosom friend gregory of nazianzen had to go forth from his hermitage into the world and be a bishop and fight the battles of the true faith  but as with gregory his hermit training had strengthened his soul while it weakened his body  the emperor valens supporting the arians against the orthodox sent to basil his prefect of the praetorium an officer of the highest rank the prefect argued threatened basil was firm  i never met said he at last such boldness  because said basil you never met a bishop  the prefect returned to his emperor  my lord we are conquered this bishop is above threats  we can do nothing but by force  the emperor shrank from that crime and basil and the orthodoxy of his diocese were saved  the rest of his life and of gregorys belongs like that of chrysostom to general history and we need pursue it no further here  i said that basils idea of what monks should be was never carried out in the east and it cannot be denied that as the years went on the hermit life took a form less and less practical and more and more repulsive also  such men as antony hilarion basil had valued the ascetic training not so much because it had as they thought a merit in itself but because it enabled the spirit to rise above the flesh because it gave them strength to conquer their passions and appetites and leave their soul free to think and act  but their disciples especially in syria seem to have attributed more and more merit to the mere act of inflicting want and suffering on themselves  their souls were darkened besides more and more by a doctrine unknown to the bible unknown to the early christians and one which does not seem to have had any strong hold of the mind of antony himselfnamely that sins committed after baptism could only be washed away by tears and expiated by penance that for them the merits of him who died for the sins of the whole world were of little or of no avail  therefore in perpetual fear of punishment hereafter they set their whole minds to punish themselves on earth always tortured by the dread that they were not punishing themselves enough till they crushed down alike body mind and soul into an abject superstition the details of which are too repulsive to be written here  some of the instances of this selfinvented misery which are recorded even as early as the time of theodoret bishop of cyra in the middle of the fifth century make us wonder at the puzzling inconsistencies of the human mind  did these poor creatures really believe that god could be propitiated by the torture of his own creatures  what sense could theodoret who was a good man himself have put upon the words god is good or god is love while he was looking with satisfaction even with admiration and awe on practices which were more fit for worshippers of moloch  those who think these words too strong may judge for themselves how far they apply to his story of marana and cyra  marana then and cyra were two young ladies of berhoea who had given up all the pleasures of life to settle themselves in a roofless cottage outside the town  they had stopped up the door with stones and clay and allowed it only to be opened at the feast of pentecost  around them lived certain female slaves who had voluntarily chosen the same life and who were taught and exhorted through a little window by their mistresses or rather it would seem by marana alone  for cyra who was bent double by her training was never to speak  theodoret as a priest was allowed to enter the sacred enclosure and found them shrouded from head to foot in long veils so that neither their faces or hands could be seen and underneath their veils burdened on every limb poor wretches with such a load of iron chains and rings that a strong man he says could not have stood under the weight  thus had they endured for twoandforty years exposed to sun and wind to frost and rain taking no food at times for many days together  i have no mind to finish the picture and still less to record any of the phrases of rapturous admiration with which bishop theodoret comments upon their pitiable superstition    simeon stylites    of all such anchorites of the far east the most remarkable perhaps was the once famous simeon stylitesa name almost forgotten save by antiquaries and ecclesiastics till mr tennyson made it once more notorious in a poem as admirable for its savage grandness as for its deep knowledge of human nature  he has comprehended thoroughly as it seems to me that struggle between selfabasement and selfconceit between the exaggerated sense of sinfulness and the exaggerated ambition of saintly honour which must have gone on in the minds of these asceticsthe temper which could cry out one moment with perfect honesty   although i be the basest of mankind from scalp to sole one slough and crust of sin   at the next   i will not cease to grasp the hope i hold of saintdom and to clamour mourn and sob battering the gates of heaven with storms of prayer have mercy lord and take away my sin let this avail just dreadful mighty god this not be all in vain that thrice ten years thrice multiplied by superhuman pangs       a sign between the meadow and the cloud patient on this tall pillar i have borne rain wind frost heat hail damp and sleet and snow and i had hoped that ere this period closed thou wouldst have caught me up into thy rest denying not these weatherbeaten limbs the meed of saints the white robe and the palm o take the meaning lord  i do not breathe not whisper any murmur of complaint pain heaped ten hundredfold to this were still less burthen by tenhundredfold to bear than were those leadlike tons of sin that crushd my spirit flat before thee   admirably also has mr tennyson conceived the hermits secret doubt of the truth of those miracles which he is so often told that he has worked that he at last begins to believe that he must have worked them and the longing at the same time to justify himself to himself by persuading himself that he has earned miraculous powers  on this whole question of hermit miracles i shall speak at length hereafter  i have given specimens enough of them already and shall give as few as possible henceforth  there is a sameness about them which may become wearisome to those who cannot be expected to believe them  but what the hermits themselves thought of them is told at least so i suspect only too truly by mr tennyson      o lord thou knowest what a man i am a sinful man conceived and born in sin tis their own doing this is none of mine lay it not to me  am i to blame for this that here come those who worship me  ha ha the silly people take me for a saint and bring me offerings of fruit and flowers and i in truth thou wilt bear witness here have all in all endured as much and more than many just and holy men whose names are registerd and calendard for saints    good people you do ill to kneel to me what is it i can have done to merit this it may be i have wrought some miracles and cured some halt and maimed  but what of that it may be no one even among the saints can match his pains with mine  but what of that yet do not rise for you may look on me and in your looking you may kneel to god speak is there any of you halt and maimed i think you know i have some power with heaven from my long penance let him speak his wish    yes i can heal him  power goes forth from me they say that they are heald  ah hark they shout st simeon stylites  why if so god reaps a harvest in me  o my soul god reaps a harvest in thee  if this be can i work miracles and not be saved this is not told of any  they were saints it cannot be but that i shall be saved yea crowned a saint      i shall not take the liberty of quoting more  but shall advise all who read these pages to study seriously mr tennysons poem if they wish to understand that darker side of the hermit life which became at last in the east the only side of it  for in the east the hermits seem to have degenerated by the time of the mahomedan conquest into mere selftorturing fakeers like those who may be seen to this day in hindostan  the salt lost its savour and in due tune it was trampled under foot and the armies of the moslem swept out of the east a superstition which had ended by enervating instead of ennobling humanity  but in justice not only to myself but to mr tennyson whose details of simeons asceticism may seem to some exaggerated and impossible i have thought fit to give his life at length omitting only many of his miracles and certain stories of his penances which can only excite horror and disgust without edifying the reader  there were then three hermits of this name often confounded and all alike famous as were julian daniel and other stylites for standing for many years on pillars  one of the simeons is said by moschus to have been struck by lightning and his death to have been miraculously revealed to julian the stylite who lived twentyfour miles off  more than one stylite belonging to the monophysite heresy of severus acephalus was to be found according to moschus in the east at the beginning of the seventh century  this biography is that of the elder simeon who died according to cedrenus about 460 after passing some forty or fifty years upon pillars of different heights  there is much discrepancy in the accounts both of his date and of his age but that such a person really existed and had his imitators there can be no doubt  he is honoured as a saint alike by the latin and by the greek churches  his life has been written by a disciple of his named antony who professes to have been with him when he died and also by theodoret who knew him well in life  both are to be found in rosweyde and there seems no reason to doubt their authenticity  i have therefore interwoven them both marking the paragraphs taken from each  theodoret who says that he was born in the village of gesa between antioch and cilicia calls him that famous simeonthat great miracle of the whole world whom all who obey the roman rule know whom the persians also know and the indians and aethiopians nay his fame has even spread to the wandering scythians and taught them his love of toil and love of wisdom and says that he might be compared with jacob the patriarch joseph the temperate moses the legislator david the king and prophet micaiah the prophet and the divine men who were like them  he tells how simeon as a boy kept his fathers sheep and being forced by heavy snow to leave them in the fold went with his parents to the church and there heard the gospel which blesses those who mourn and weep and calls those miserable who laugh and those enviable who have a pure heart  and when he asked a bystander what he would gain who did each of these things the man propounded to him the solitary life and pointed out to him the highest philosophy  this theodoret says he heard from the saints own tongue  his disciple antony gives the story of his conversion somewhat differently   st simeon says antony was chosen by god from his birth and used to study how to obey and please him  now his fathers name was susocion and he was brought up by his parents  when he was thirteen years old he was feeding his fathers sheep and seeing a church he left the sheep and went in and heard an epistle being read  and when he asked an elder master what is that which is read the old man replied for the substance or very being of the soul that a man may learn to fear god with his whole heart and his whole mind  quoth the blessed simeon what is to fear god  quoth the elder wherefore troublest thou me my son  quoth he i inquire of thee as of god  for i wish to learn what i hear from thee because i am ignorant and a fool  the elder answered if any man shall have fasted continually and offered prayers every moment and shall have humbled himself to every man and shall not have loved gold nor parents nor garments nor possessions and if he honours his father and mother and follows the priests of god he shall inherit the eternal kingdom  but he who on the contrary does not keep those things he shall inherit the outer darkness which god hath prepared for the devil and his angels  all these things my son are heaped together in a monastery  hearing this the blessed simeon fell at his feet saying thou art my father and my mother and my teacher of good works and guide to the kingdom of heaven  for thou hast gained my soul which was already being sunk in perdition  may the lord repay thee again for it  for these are the things which edify  i will now go into a monastery where god shall choose and let his will be done on me the elder said my son before thou enterest hear me  thou shalt have tribulation for thou must watch and serve in nakedness and sustain ills without ceasing and again thou shalt be comforted thou vessel precious to god  and forthwith the blessed simeon going out of the church went to the monastery of the holy timotheus a wonderworking man and falling down before the gate of the monastery he lay five days neither eating nor drinking  and on the fifth day the abbot coming out asked him whence art thou my son  and what parents hast thou that thou art so afflicted  or what is thy name lest perchance thou hast done some wrong  or perchance thou art a slave and fleest from thy master  then the blessed simeon said with tears by no means master but i long to be a servant of god if he so will because i wish to save my lost soul  bid me therefore enter the monastery and leave all and send me away no more  then the abbot taking his hand introduced him into the monastery saying to the brethren my sons behold i deliver you this brother teach him the canons of the monastery  now he was in the monastery about four months serving all without complaint in which he learnt the whole psalter by heart receiving every day divine food  but the food which he took with his brethren he gave away secretly to the poor not caring for the morrow  so the brethren ate at even but he only on the seventh day  but one day having gone to the well to draw water he took the rope from the bucket with which the brethren drew water and wound it round his body from his loins to his neck  and going in said to the brethren i went out to draw water and found no rope on the bucket  and they said hold thy peace brother lest the abbot know it till the thing has passed over  but his body was wounded by the tightness and roughness of the rope because it cut him to the bone and sank into his flesh till it was hardly seen  but one day some of the brethren going out found him giving his food to the poor and when they returned said to the abbot whence hast thou brought us that man  we cannot abstain like him for he fasts from lords day to lords day and gives away his food    then the abbot going out found as was told him and said son what is it which the brethren tell of thee  is it not enough for thee to fast as we do  hast thou not heard the gospel saying of teachers that the disciple is not above his master    the blessed simeon stood and answered nought  and the abbot being angry bade strip him and found the rope round him so that only its outside appeared and cried with a loud voice saying whence has this man come to us wanting to destroy the rule of the monastery  i pray thee depart hence and go whither thou wiliest  and with great trouble they took off the rope and his flesh with it and taking care of him healed him  but after he was healed he went out of the monastery no man knowing of it and entered a deserted tank in which was no water where unclean spirits dwelt  and that very night it was revealed to the abbot that a multitude of people surrounded the monastery with clubs and swords saying give us simeon the servant of god timotheus else we will burn thee with thy monastery because thou hast angered a just man  and when he woke he told the brethren the vision and how he was much disturbed thereby  and another night he saw a multitude of strong men standing and saying give us simeon the servant of god for he is beloved by god and the angels why hast thou vexed him  he is greater than thou before god for all the angels are sorry on his behalf  and god is minded to set him on high in the world that by him many signs may be done such as no man has done  then the abbot rising said with great fear to the brethren seek me that man and bring him hither lest perchance we all die on his account  he is truly a saint of god for i have heard and seen great wonders of him  then all the monks went out and searched but in vain and told the abbot how they had sought him everywhere save in the deserted tank     then the abbot went with five brethren to the tank  and making a prayer he went down into it with the brethren  and the blessed simeon seeing him began to entreat saying i beg you servants of god let me alone one hour that i may render up my spirit for yet a little and it will fail  but my soul is very weary because i have angered the lord  but the abbot said to him come servant of god that we may take thee to the monastery for i know concerning thee that thou art a servant of god  but when he would not they brought him by force to the monastery  and all fell at his feet weeping and saying we have sinned against thee servant of god forgive us  but the blessed simeon groaned saying wherefore do ye burden an unhappy man and a sinner  you are the servants of god and my fathers  and he stayed there about one year   after this says theodoret he came to the telanassus under the peak of the mountain on which he lived till his death and having found there a little house he remained in it shut up for three years  but eager always to increase the riches of virtue he longed in imitation of the divine moses and elias to fast forty days and tried to persuade bassus who was then set over the priests in the villages to leave nothing within by him but to close up the door with clay  he spoke to him of the difficulty and warned him not to think that a violent death was a virtue  put by me then father he said ten loaves and a cruse of water and if i find my body need sustenance i will partake of them  at the end of the days that wonderful man of god bassus removed the clay and going in found the food and water untouched and simeon lying unable to speak or move  getting a sponge he moistened and opened his lips and then gave him the symbols of the divine mysteries and strengthened by them he arose and took some food chewing little by little lettuces and succory and such like  from that time for twentyeight years says theodoret he had remained fasting continually for forty days at a time  but custom had made it more easy to him  for on the first days he used to stand and praise god after that when through emptiness he could stand no longer he used to sit and perform the divine office and on the last day even lie down  for when his strength failed slowly he was forced to lie half dead  but after he stood on the column he could not bear to lie down but invented another way by which he could stand  he fastened a beam to the column and tied himself to it by ropes and so passed the forty days  but afterwards when he had received greater grace from on high he did not want even that help  but stood for the forty days taking no food but strengthened by alacrity of soul and divine grace  when he had passed three years in that little house he took possession of the peak which has since been so famous and when he had commanded a wall to be made round him and procured an iron chain twenty cubits long he fastened one end of it to a great stone and the other to his right foot so that he could not if he wished leave those bounds  there he lived continually picturing heaven to himself and forcing himself to contemplate things which are above the heavens for the iron bond did not check the flight of his thoughts  but when the wonderful meletius to whom the care of the episcopate of antioch was then commended a man of sense and prudence and adorned with shrewdness of intellect told him that the iron was superfluous since the will is able enough to impose on the body the chains of reason he gave way and obeyed his persuasion  and having sent for a smith he bade him strike off the chain  here follow some painful details unnecessary to be translated  when therefore his fame was flying far and wide everywhere all ran together not only the neighbours but those who were many days journey off some bringing the palsied some begging health for the sick some that they might become fathers and all wishing to receive from him what they had not received from nature and when they had received and gained their request they went back joyful proclaiming the benefits they had obtained and sending many more to beg the same  so as all are coming up from every quarter and the road is like a river one may see gathered in that place an ocean of men which receives streams from every side not only of those who live in our region but ishmaelites and persians and the armenians who are subject to them and iberi and homerites and those who dwell beyond them  many have come also from the extreme west spaniards and britons and gauls who live between the two  of italy it is superfluous to speak for they say that at rome the man has become so celebrated that they have put little images of him in all the porches of the shops providing thereby for themselves a sort of safeguard and security  when therefore they came innumerable for all tried to touch him and receive some blessing from those skin garments of his thinking it in the first place absurd and unfit that such exceeding honour should be paid him and next disliking the labour of the business devised that station on the pillar bidding one be built first of six cubits then of twelve next of twentytwo and now of thirty six  for he longs to fly up to heaven and be freed from this earthly conversation  but i believe that this station was made not without divine counsel wherefore i exhort faultfinders to bridle their tongue and not let it rashly loose but rather consider that the lord has often devised such things that he might profit those who were too slothful   in proof of which theodoret quotes the examples of isaiah hosea and ezekiel and then goes on to say how god in like manner ordained this new and admirable spectacle by the novelty of it drawing all to look and exhibiting to those who came a lesson which they could trust  for the novelty of the spectacle he says is a worthy warrant for the teaching and he who came to see goes away instructed in divine things  and as those whose lot it is to rule over men after a certain period of time change the impressions on their coins sometimes stamping them with images of lions sometimes of stars sometimes of angels and trying by a new mark to make the gold more precious so the king of all adding to piety and true religion these new and manifold modes of living as certain stamps on coin excites to praise the tongues not only of the children of faith but of those who are diseased with unbelief  and that so it is not only words bear witness but facts proclaim aloud  for many myriads of ishmaelites who were enslaved in the darkness of impiety have been illuminated by that station on the column  for this most shining lamp set as it were upon a candlestick sent forth all round its rays like of the sun  and one may see as i said iberi coming and persians and armenians and accepting divine baptism  but the ishmaelites coming by tribes 200 and 300 at a time and sometimes even 1000 deny with shouts the error of their fathers and breaking in pieces before that great illuminator the images which they had worshipped and renouncing the orgies of venus for they had received from ancient times the worship of that daemon they receive the divine sacraments and take laws from that holy tongue bidding farewell to their ancestral rites and renouncing the eating of wild asses and camels  and this i have seen with my own eyes and have heard them renouncing the impiety of their fathers and assenting to the evangelic doctrine  but once i was in the greatest danger  for he himself told them to go to me and receive priestly benediction saying that they would thence obtain great advantage  but they having run together in somewhat too barbarous fashion some dragged me before some behind some sideways and those who were further off scrambling over the others and stretching out their hands plucked my beard or seized my clothes and i should have been stifled by their too warm onset had not he shouting out dispersed them all  such usefulness has that column which is mocked at by scornful men poured forth and so great a ray of the knowledge of god has it sent forth into the minds of barbarians  i know also of his having done another thing of this kindone tribe was beseeching the divine man that he would send forth some prayer and blessing for their chief  but another tribe which was present retorted that he ought not to bless that chief but theirs for the one was a most unjust man but the other averse to injustice  and when there had been a great contention and barbaric wrangling between them they attacked each other  but i using many words kept exhorting them to be quiet seeing that the divine man was able enough to give a blessing to both  but the one tribe kept saying that the first chief ought not to have it and the other tribe trying to deprive the second chief of it  then he by threatening them from above and calling them dogs hardly stilled the quarrel  this i have told wishing to show their great faith for they would not have thus gone mad against each other had they not believed that the divine mans blessing possesses some very great power  i saw another miracle which was very celebrated  one coming up he too was a chief of a saracen tribe besought the divine personage that he would help a man whose limbs had given way in paralysis on the road and he said the misfortune had fallen on him in callinicus which is a very large camp  when he was brought into the midst the saint bade him renounce the impiety of his forefathers and when he willingly obeyed he asked him if he believed in the father the onlybegotten son and the holy spirit and when he confessed that he believedbelieving said he in their names arise  and when the man had risen he bade him carry away his chief who was a very large man on his shoulders to his tent  he took him up and went away forthwith while those who were present raised their voices in praise of god  this he commanded imitating the lord who bade the paralytic carry his bed  let no man call this imitation tyranny  for his saying is he who believeth in me the works which i do he shall do also and more than these shall he do  and indeed we have seen the fulfilment of this promise  for though the shadow of the lord never worked a miracle the shadow of the great peter both loosed death and drove out diseases and put daemons to flight  but the lord it was who did also these miracles by his servants and now likewise using his name the divine simeon works his innumerable wonders  it befell also that another wonder was worked by no means inferior to the last  for among those who had believed in the saving name of the lord christ an ishmaelite of no humble rank had made a vow to god with simeon as witness  now his promise was this that he would henceforth to the end abstain from animal food  transgressing this promise once i know not how he slew a bird and dared to eat it  but god being minded to bring him by reproof to conversion and to honour his servant who was a witness to the broken vow the flesh of the bird was changed into the nature of a stone so that even if he wished he could not thenceforth eat it  for how could he when the body meant for food had turned to stone  the barbarian stupified by this unexpected sight came with great haste to the holy man bringing to the light the sin which he had hidden and proclaimed his transgression to all begging pardon from god and invoking the help of the saint that by his allpowerful prayers he might loose him from the bonds of his sin  now many saw that miracle and felt that the part of the bird about the breast consisted of bone and stone  but i was not only an earwitness of his wonders but also an ear witness of his prophecies concerning futurity  for that drought which came and the great dearth of that year and the famine and pestilence which followed together he foretold two years before saying that he saw a rod which was laid on man stripes which would be inflicted by it  moreover he at another time foretold an invasion of locusts and that it would bring no great harm because the divine clemency soon follows punishment  but when thirty days were past an innumerable multitude of them hung aloft so that they even cut off the suns rays and threw a shadow and that we all saw plainly  but it only damaged the cattle pastures and in no wise hurt the food of man  to me too who was attacked by a certain person he signified that the quarrel would end ere a fortnight was past and i learned the truth of the prediction by experience  moreover there were seen by him once two rods which came down from the skies and fell on the eastern and western lands  now the divine man said that they signified the rising of the persian and scythian nations against the romans and told the vision to those who were by and with many tears and assiduous prayers warded that disaster the threat whereof hung over the earth  certainly the persian nation when already armed and prepared to invade the romans was kept back the divine will being against them from their attempt and occupied at home with their own troubles  but while i know many other cases of this kind i shall pass them over to avoid prolixity  these are surely enough to show the spiritual contemplation of his mind  his fame was great also with the king of the persians for as the ambassadors told who came to him he diligently inquired what was his life and what his miracles  but they say that the kings wife also begged oil honoured by his blessing and accepted it as the greatest of gifts  moreover all the kings courtiers being moved by his fame and having heard many slanders against him from the magi inquired diligently and having learnt the truth called him a divine man while the rest of the crowd coming to the muleteers and servants and soldiers both offered money and begged for a share in the oil of benediction  the queen too of the ishmaelites longing to have a child sent first some of her most noble subjects to the saint beseeching him that she might become a mother  and when her prayer had been granted and she had her hearts desire she took the son who had been born and went to the divine old man and because women were not allowed to approach him sent the babe entreating his blessing on it    here theodoret puts into the queens mouth words which it is unnecessary to quote  but how long do i strive to measure the depths of the atlantic sea for as they are unfathomable by man so do the things which he does daily surpass narration  i however admire above all these things his endurance for night and day he stands so as to be seen by all for as the doors are taken away and a large part of the wall around pulled down he is set forth as a new and wondrous spectacle to all now standing long now bowing himself frequently and offering adoration to god  many of those who stand by count these adorations and once a man with me when he had counted 1244 and then missed gave up counting  but always when he bows himself he touches his feet with his forehead  for as his stomach takes food only once in the week and that very littleno more than is received in the divine sacramentshis back admits of being easily bent     but nothing which happens to him overpowers his philosophy he bears nobly both voluntary and involuntary pains and conquers both by readiness of will  there came once from arabena a certain good man and honoured with the ministry of christ  he when he had come to that mountain peaktell me he cried by the very truth which converts the human race to itselfart thou a man or an incorporeal nature but when all there were displeased with the question the saint bade them all be silent and said to him why hast thou asked me this he answered because i hear every one saying publicly that thou neither eatest nor sleepest but both are properties of man and no one who has a human nature could have lived without food and sleep then the saint bade them set a ladder to the column and him to come up and first to look at his hands and then feel inside his cloak of skins and to see not only his feet but a severe wound  but when he saw that he was a man and the size of that wound and learnt from him how he took nourishment he came down and told me all  at the public festivals he showed an endurance of another kind  for from the setting of the sun till it had come again to the eastern horizon he stood all night with hands uplift to heaven neither soothed with sleep nor conquered by fatigue  but in toils so great and so great a magnitude of deeds and multitude of miracles his selfesteem is as moderate as if he were in dignity the least of all men  beside his modesty he is easy of access of speech and gracious and answers every man who speaks to him whether he be handicraftsman beggar or rustic  and from the bounteous god he has received also the gift of teaching and making his exhortations twice a day he delights the ears of those who hear discoursing much on grace and setting forth the instructions of the divine spirit to look up and fly toward heaven and depart from the earth and imagine the kingdom which is expected and fear the threats of gehenna and despise earthly things and wait for things to come he may be seen too acting as judge and giving right and just decisions  this and the like is done after the ninth hour  for all night and through the day to the ninth hour he prays perpetually  after that he first sets forth the divine teaching to those who are present then having heard each mans petition after he has performed some cures he settles the quarrels of those between whom there is any dispute  about sunset he begins the rest of his converse with god  but though he is employed in this way and does all this he does not give up the care of the holy churches sometimes fighting with the impiety of the greeks sometimes checking the audacity of the jews sometimes putting to flight the bands of heretics and sometimes sending messages concerning these last to the emperor sometimes too stirring up rulers to zeal for god and sometimes exhorting the pastors of the churches to bestow more care upon their flocks  i have gone through these facts trying to show the shower by one drop and to give those who meet with my writing a taste on the finger of the sweetness of the honey  but there remains as is to be expected much more and if he should live longer he will probably add still greater wonders      thus far theodoret  antony gives some other details of simeons life upon the column   the devil he says in envy transformed himself into the likeness of an angel shining in splendour with fiery horses and a fiery chariot and appeared close to the column on which the blessed simeon stood and shone with glory like an angel  and the devil said with bland speeches simeon hear my words which the lord hath commanded thee  he has sent me his angel with a chariot and horses of fire that i may carry thee away as i carried elias  for thy time is come  do thou in like wise ascend now with me into the chariot because the lord of heaven and earth has sent it down let us ascend together into the heavens that the angels and archangels may see thee with mary the mother of the lord with the apostles and martyrs the confessors and prophets because they rejoice to see thee that thou mayest pray to the lord who hast made thee after his own image  verily i have spoken to thee  delay not to ascend  simeon having ended his prayer said lord wilt thou carry me a sinner into heaven  and lifting his right foot that he might step into the chariot he lifted also his right hand and made the sign of christ  when he had made the sign of the cross forthwith the devil appeared nowhere but vanished with his device as dust before the face of the wind  then understood simeon that it was an art of the devil  having recovered himself therefore he said to his foot thou shalt not return back hence but stand here until my death when the lord shall send for me a sinner  here follow more painful stories which had best be omitted  but after much time his mother hearing of his fame came to see him but was forbidden because no woman entered that place  but when the blessed simeon heard the voice of his mother he said to her bear up my mother a little while and we shall see each other if god will  but she hearing this began to weep and tearing her hair rebuked him saying son why hast thou done this  in return for the body in which i bore thee thou hast filled me full of grief  for the milk with which i nourished thee thou hast given me tears  for the kiss with which i kissed thee thou hast given me bitter pangs of heart  for the grief and labour which i have suffered thou hast laid on me cruel stripes  and she spoke so much that she made us all weep  the blessed simeon hearing the voice of her who bore him put his face in his hands and wept bitterly and commanded her saying lady mother be still a little time and we shall see each other in eternal rest  but she began to say by christ who formed thee if there is a probability of seeing thee who hast been so long a stranger to me let me see thee or if not let me only hear thy voice and die at once for thy father is dead in sorrow because of thee  and now do not destroy me for very bitterness my son  saying this for sorrow and weeping she fell asleep for during three days and three nights she had not ceased entreating him  then the blessed simeon prayed the lord for her and she forthwith gave up the ghost  but they took up her body and brought it where he could see it and he said weeping the lord receive thee in joy because thou hast endured tribulation for me and borne me and nursed and nourished me with labour  and as he said that his mothers countenance perspired and her body was stirred in the sight of us all  but he lifting up his eyes to heaven said lord god of virtues who sittest above the cherubim and searchest the foundations of the abyss who knewest adam before he was who hast promised the riches of the kingdom of heaven to those who love thee who didst speak to moses in the bush of fire who blessedst abraham our father who bringest into paradise the souls of the just and sinkest the souls of the impious to perdition who didst humble the lions and mitigate for thy servants the strong fires of the chaldees who didst nourish elisha by the ravens which brought him foodreceive her soul in peace and put her in the place of the holy fathers for thine is the power for ever and ever   antony then goes on to relate the later years of the saints life  he tells how simeon some time after this ascended the column of forty cubits how a great dragon serpent crawled towards it and coiled round it entreating so it seemed to be freed from a spike of wood which had entered its eye and how st simeon took pity on it he caused the spike which was a cubit long to come out  he tells how a woman drinking water from a jar at night swallowed a snake unawares which grew within her till she was brought to the blessed simeon who commanded some of the water of the monastery to be given her on which the serpent crawled out of her mouth three cubits long and burst immediately and was hung up there seven days as a testimony to many  he tells how when there was great want of water st simeon prayed till the earth opened on the east of the monastery and a cave full of water was discovered which had never failed them to that day  he tells how men sitting beneath a tree on their way to the saint saw a doe go by and commanded her to stop by the prayers of st simeon which when she had done they killed and ate her and came to st simeon with the skin  but they were all struck dumb and hardly cured after two years  and the skin of the doe they hung up for a testimony to many  he tells of a huge leopard which slew men and cattle all around and how st simeon bade sprinkle in his haunts soil or water from the monastery and when men went again they found the leopard dead  he tells how when st simeon cured any one he bade him go home and honour god who had healed him and not dare to say that simeon had cured him lest a worse thing should suddenly come to him and not to presume to swear by the name of the lord for it was a grave sin but to swear whether justly or unjustly by him lowly and a sinner  wherefore all the easterns and barbarous tribes in those regions swear by simeon  he tells how a robber from antioch jonathan by name fled to st simeon and embraced the column weeping bitterly and saying how he had committed every crime and had come thither to repent  and how the saint said of such is the kingdom of heaven  but do not try to tempt me lest thou be found again in the sins which thou hast cast away  then came the officials from antioch demanding that he should be given up to be cast to the wild beasts  but simeon answered my sons i brought him not hither but one greater than i for he helps such as this man and of such is the kingdom of heaven  but if you can enter carry him hence i cannot give him up for i fear him who has sent the man to me  and they struck with fear went away  then jonathan lay for seven days embracing the column and then asked the saint leave to go  the saint asked him if he were going back to sin  no lord he said but my time is fulfilled and straightway he gave up the ghost and when officials came again from antioch demanding him simeon replied he who brought him came with a multitude of the heavenly host and is able to send into tartarus your city and all who dwell in it who also has reconciled this man to himself and i was afraid lest he should slay me suddenly  therefore weary me no more a humble man and poor  but after a few years says antony it befell one day that he bowed himself in prayer and remained so three daysthat is the friday the sabbath and the lords day  then i was terrified and went up to him and stood before his face and said to him master arise bless us for the people have been waiting three days and three nights for a blessing from thee  and he answered me not and i said again to him  wherefore dost thou grieve me lord or in what have i offended  i beseech thee put out thy hand to me or perchance thou hast already departed from us  and seeing that he did not answer i thought to tell no one for i feared to touch him  and standing about half an hour i bent down and put my ear to listen and there was no breathing  but a fragrance as of many scents rose from his body  and so i understood that he rested in the lord and turning faint i wept most bitterly and bending down i kissed his eyes and clasped his beard and hair and reproaching him i said  to whom dost thou leave me lord or where shall i seek thy angelic doctrine  what answer shall i make for thee or whose soul will look at this column without thee and not grieve  what answer shall i make to the sick when they come here to seek thee and find thee not  what shall i say poor creature that i am  today i see thee tomorrow i shall look right and left and not find thee  and what covering shall i put upon thy column  woe to me when folk shall come from afar seeking thee and shall not find thee  and for much sorrow i fell asleep  and forthwith he appeared to me and said  i will not leave this column nor this place and this blessed mountain where i was illuminated  but go down satisfy the people and send word secretly to antioch lest a tumult arise  for i have gone to rest as the lord willed  but do thou not cease to minister in this place and the lord shall repay thee thy wages in heaven  but rising from sleep i said in terror master remember me in thy holy rest  and lifting up his garments i fell at his feet and kissed them and holding his hands i laid them on my eyes saying bless me i beseech thee my lord  and again i wept and said what relics shall i carry away from thee as memorials  and as i said that his body was moved therefore i was afraid to touch him  and that no one might know i came down quickly and sent a faithful brother to the bishop at antioch  he came at once with three bishops and with them ardaburius the master of the soldiers with his people and stretched curtains round the column and fastened their clothes around it  for they were cloth of gold  and when they laid him down by the altar before the column and gathered themselves together birds flew round the column crying and as it were lamenting in all mens sight and the wailing of the people and of the cattle resounded for seven miles away yea even the hills and the fields and the trees were sad around that place for everywhere a dark cloud hung about it  and i watched an angel coming to visit him and about the seventh hour seven old men talked with that angel whose face was like lightning and his garments as snow  and i watched his voice in fear and trembling as long as i could hear it but what he said i cannot tell  but when the holy simeon lay upon the bier the pope of antioch wishing to take some of his beard for a blessing stretched out his hand and forthwith it was dried up and prayers were made to god for him and so his hand was restored again  then laying the corpse on the bier they took it to antioch with psalms and hymns  but all the people round that region wept because the protection of such mighty relics was taken from them and because the bishop of antioch had sworn that no man should touch his body  but when they came to the fifth milestone from antioch to the village which is called meroe no one could move him  then a certain man deaf and dumb for forty years who had committed a very great crime suddenly fell down before the bier and began to cry thou art well come servant of god for thy coming will save me and if i shall obtain the grace to live i will serve thee all the days of my life  and rising he caught hold of one of the mules which carried the bier and forthwith moved himself from that place and so the man was made whole from that hour  then all going out of the city of antioch received the body of the holy simeon on gold and silver with psalms and hymns and with many lamps brought it into the greater church and thence to another church which is called penitence  moreover many virtues are wrought at his tomb more than in his life and the man who was made whole served there till the day of his death  but many offered treasures to the bishop of antioch for the faith begging relics from the body  but on account of his oath he never gave them  i antony lowly and a sinner have set forth briefly as far as i could this lesson  but blessed is he who has this writing in a book and reads it in the church and house of god and when he shall have brought it to his memory he shall receive a reward from the most high to whom is honour power and virtue for ever and ever amen   after such a fantastic story as this of simeon it is full time some readers may have thought that it was full time long since to give my own opinion of the miracles visions daemons and other portents which occur in the lives of these saints  i have refrained from doing so as yet because i wished to begin by saying everything on behalf of these old hermits which could honestly be said and to prejudice my readers minds in their favour rather than against them because i am certain that if we look on them merely with scorn and ridiculeif we do not acknowledge and honour all in them which was noble virtuous and honestwe shall never be able to combat their errors either in our own hearts or in those of our children and that we may have need to do so is but too probable  in this age as in every other age of materialism and practical atheism a revulsion in favour of superstition is at hand i may say is taking place round us now  doctrines are tolerated as possibly true persons are regarded with respect and admiration who would have been looked on even fifty years ago if not with horror yet with contempt as beneath the serious notice of educated english people but it is this very contempt which has brought about the change of opinion concerning them  it has been discovered that they were not altogether so absurd as they seemed that the public mind in its ignorance has been unjust to them and in hasty repentance for that injustice too many are ready to listen to those who will tell them that these things are not absurd at allthat there is no absurdity in believing that the legbone of st simon stock may possess miraculous powers or that the spirits of the departed communicate with their friends by rapping on the table  the ugly aftercrop of superstition which is growing up among us now is the just and natural punishment of our materialismi may say of our practical atheism  for those who will not believe in the real spiritual world in which each mans soul stands face to face all day long with almighty god the father the son and the holy ghost are sure at last to crave after some false spiritual world and seek like the evil and profligate generation of the jews after visible signs and material wonders  and those who will not believe that the one true and living god is above their path and about their bed and spieth out all their ways and that in him they live and move and have their being are but too likely at last to people with fancied saints and daemons that void in the imagination and in the heart which their own unbelief has made  are we then to suppose that these old hermits had lost faith in god on the contrary they were the only men in that day who had faith in god  and if they had faith in any other things or persons beside god they merely shared in the general popular ignorance and mistakes of their own age and we must not judge those who born in an age of darkness were struggling earnestly toward the light as we judge those who born in an age of scientific light are retiring of their own will back into the darkness  before i enter upon the credibility of these alleged saints miracles i must guard my readers carefully from supposing that i think miracles impossible  heaven forbid  he would be a very rash person who should do that in a world which swarms with greater wonders than those recorded in the biography of a saint  for after all which is more wonderful that god should be able to restore the dead to life or that he should be able to give life at all  again as for these miracles being contrary to our experience that is no very valid argument against them for equally contrary to our experience is every new discovery of science every strange phenomenon among plants and animals every new experiment in a chemical lecture  the more we know of science the more we must confess that nothing is too strange to be true  and therefore we must not blame or laugh at those who in old times believed in strange things which were not true  they had an honest and rational sense of the infinite and wonderful nature of the universe and of their own ignorance about it and they were ready to believe anything as the truly wise man will be ready also  only from ignorance of the laws of the universe they did not know what was likely to be true and what was not and therefore they believed many things which experience has proved to be false just as seba or any of the early naturalists were ready to believe in sixlegged dragons or in the fatal power of the basilisks eye fancies which if they had been facts would not have been nearly as wonderful as the transformation of the commonest insect or the fertilization of the meanest weed  but which are rejected now not because they are too wonderful but simply because experience has proved them to be untrue  and experience it must be remembered is the only sound test of truth as long as men will settle beforehand for themselves without experience what they ought to see so long will they be perpetually fancying that they or others have seen it and their faith as it is falsely called will delude not only their reason but their very hearing sight and touch  in this age we see no supernatural prodigies because there are none to see and when we are told that the reason why we see no prodigies is because we have no faith we answer if we be sensible just so as long as people had faith in plain english believed that they could be magically cured of a disease they thought that they or others were so cured  as long as they believed that ghosts could be seen every silly person saw them  as long as they believed that daemons transformed themselves into an animals shape they said the devil croaked at me this morning in the shape of a raven and therefore my horse fell with me  as long as they believed that witches could curse them they believed that an old woman in the next parish had overlooked them their cattle and their crops and that therefore they were poor diseased and unfortunate  these dreams which were common among the peasants in remote districts fiveandtwenty years ago have vanished simply from the spread by the grace of god as i hold of an inductive habit of mind of the habit of looking coolly boldly carefully at facts till now even among the most ignorant peasantry the woman who says that she has seen a ghost is likely not to be complimented on her assertion  but it does not follow that that womans grandmother when she said that she saw a ghost was a consciously dishonest person on the contrary so complex and contradictory is human nature she would have been probably a person of more than average intellect and earnestness and her instinct of the invisible and the infinite which is that which raises man above the brutes would have been because misinformed the honourable cause of her error  and thus we may believe of the good hermits of whom prodigies are recorded  as to the truth of the prodigies themselves there are several ways of looking at them  first we may neither believe nor disbelieve them but talk of them as devout fairy tales religious romances and allegories and so save ourselves the trouble of judging whether they were true  that is at least an easy and pleasant method very fashionable in a careless unbelieving age like this  but in following it we shall be somewhat cowardly for there is hardly any matter a clear judgment on which is more important just now than these same saints miracles  next we may believe them utterly and all and that is also an easy and pleasant method  but if we follow it we shall be forced to believe among other facts that st paphnutius was carried miraculously across a river because he was too modest to undress himself and wade that st helenus rode a savage crocodile across a river and then commanded it to die and that it died accordingly upon the spot and that st goar entering the palace of the archbishop of treves hung his cape on a sunbeam mistaking it for a peg  and many other like things we shall be forced to believe with which this book has no concern  or again we may believe as much as we can because we should like if we could to believe all  but as we have notno man has as yet any criterion by which we can judge how much of these stories we ought to believe and how much not which actually happened and which did not therefore we shall end as not only the most earnest and pious but the most clear and logical persons who have taken up this view have ended already by believing all  which is an end not to be desired  or we may believe as few as possible of them because we should like if we could to believe none  and this method for the reason aforesaid namely that there is no criterion by which we can settle what to believe and what not usually ends in believing none at all  this of believing none at all is the last method and this i confess fairly i am inclined to think is the right one and that these good hermits worked no real miracles and saw no real visions whatsoever  i confess that this is a very serious assertion  for there is as much evidence in favour of these hermits miracles and visions as there is with most men of the existence of china and much more than there with most men is of the earths going round the sun  but the truth is that evidence in most matters of importance is worth very little  very few people decide a question on its facts but on their own prejudices as to what they would like to have happened  very few people are judges of evidence not even of their own eyes and ears  very few persons when they see a thing know what they have seen and what not  they tell you quite honestly not what they saw but what they think they ought to have seen or should like to have seen  it is a fact too often conveniently forgotten that in every human crowd the majority will be more or less bad or at least foolish the slaves of anger spite conceit vanity sordid hope and sordid fear  but let them be as honest and as virtuous as they may pleasure terror and the desire of seeming to have seen or heard more than their neighbours and all about it make them exaggerate  if you take apart five honest men who all stood by and saw the same man do anything strange offensive or even exciting no two of them will give you quite the same account of it  if you leave them together while excited an hour before you question them they will have compared notes and made up one story which will contain all their mistakes combined and it will require the skill of a practised barrister to pick the grain of wheat out of the chaff  moreover when people are crowded together under any excitement there is nothing which they will not make each other believe  they will make each other believe in spiritrapping tableturning the mesmeric fluid electrobiology that they saw the lion on northumberland house wagging his tail 203 that witches have been seen riding in the air that the jews had poisoned the wells that but why go further into the sad catalogue of human absurdities and the crimes which have followed them  every one is ashamed of not seeing what every one else sees and persuades himself against his own eye sight for fear of seeming stupid or illconditioned and therefore in all evidence the fewer witnesses the more truth because the evidence of ten men is worth more than that of a hundred together and the evidence of a thousand men together is worth still less  now if people are savage and ignorant diseased and poverty stricken even if they are merely excited and credulous and quite sure that something wonderful must happen then they will be also quite certain that something wonderful has happened and their evidence will be worth nothing at all  moreover suppose that something really wonderful has happened suppose for instance that some nervous or paralytic person has been suddenly restored to strength by the command of a saint or of some other remarkable man  this is quite possible i may say common and it is owing neither to physical nor to socalled spiritual causes but simply to the power which a strong mind has over a weak one to make it exert itself and cure itself by its own will though but for a time  when this good news comes to be told and to pass from mouth to mouth it ends of quite a different shape from that in which it began  it has been added to taken from twisted in every direction according to the fancy or the carelessness of each teller till what really happened in the first case no one will be able to say 204 and this is therefore what actually happened in the case of these reported wonders  moreover and this is the most important consideration of all for men to be fair judges of what really happens they must have somewhat sound minds in somewhat sound bodies which no man can have however honest and virtuous who gives himself up as did these old hermits to fasting and vigils that continued sleeplessness produces delusions and at last actual madness every physician knows and they know also as many a poor sailor has known when starving on a wreck and many a poor soldier in such a retreat as that of napoleon from moscow that extreme hunger and thirst produce delusions also very similar to and caused much in the same way as those produced by ardent spirits so that many a wretched creature ere now has been taken up for drunkenness who has been simply starving to death  whence it follows that these good hermits by continual fasts and vigils must have put themselves and their histories prove that they did put themselves into a state of mental disease in which their evidence was worth nothing a state in which the mind cannot distinguish between facts and dreams in which life itself is one dream in which as in the case of madness or of a feverish child the brain cannot distinguish between the objects which are outside it and the imaginations which are inside it  and it is plain that the more earnest and pious and therefore the more ascetic one of these good men was the more utterly would his brain be in a state of chronic disease  god forbid that we should scorn them therefore or think the worse of them in any way  they were animated by a truly noble purpose the resolution to be good according to their light they carried out that purpose with heroical endurance and they have their reward  but this we must say if we be rational people that on their method of holiness the more holy any one of them was the less trustworthy was his account of any matter whatsoever and that the hermits peculiar temptations quite unknown to the hundreds of unmarried persons who lead quiet and virtuous because rational and healthy lives are to be attributed not as they thought to a daemon but to a more or less unhealthy nervous system  it must be remembered moreover in justice to these old hermits that they did not invent the belief that the air was full of daemons  all the eastern nations had believed in genii jinns fairies peris and devas divs or devils  the devas of the early hindus were beneficent beings  to the eyes of the old persians in their hatred of idolatry and polytheism they appeared evil beings divs or devils  and even so the genii and daemons of the roman empire became in the eyes of the early christians wicked and cruel spirits  and they had their reasons and on the whole sound ones for so regarding them  the educated classes had given up any honest and literal worship of the old gods  they were trying to excuse themselves for their lingering half belief in them by turning them into allegories powers of nature metaphysical abstractions as did porphyry and iamblichus plotinus and proclus and the rest of the neoplatonist school of aristocratic philosophers and fine ladies but the lower classes still in every region kept up their own local beliefs and worships generally of the most foul and brutal kind  the animal worship of egypt among the lower classes was sufficiently detestable in the time of herodotus  it had certainly not improved in that of juvenal and persius and was still less likely to have improved afterwards  this is a subject so shocking that it can be only hinted at  but as a single instancewhat wonder if the early hermits of egypt looked on the crocodile as something diabolic after seeing it for generations untold petted and worshipped in many a city simply because it was the incarnate symbol of brute strength cruelty and cunning  we must remember also that earlier generations the old norsemen and germans just as much as the old egyptians were wont to look on animals as more miraculous than we do as more akin in many cases to human beings as guided not by a mere blind instinct but by an intellect which was allied to and often surpassed mans intellect  the bear said the old norsemen had ten mens strength and eleven mens wit and in some such light must the old hermits have looked on the hyaena bellua the monster par excellence or on the crocodile the hippopotamus and the poisonous snakes which have been objects of terror and adoration in every country where they have been formidable  whether the hyaenas were daemons or were merely sent by the daemons st antony and st athanasius do not clearly define for they did not know  it was enough for them that the beasts prowled at night in those desert cities which were according to the opinions not only of the easterns but of the romans the special haunt of ghouls witches and all uncanny things  their fiendish laughterwhich when heard even in a modern menagerie excites and shakes most persons nervesrang through hearts and brains which had no help or comfort save in god alone  the beast tore up the dead from their graves devoured alike the belated child and the foulest offal and was in all things a type and incarnation of that which man ought not to be  why should not he so like the worst of men have some bond or kindred with the evil beings who were not men  why should not the graceful and deadly cobra the horrid cerastes the huge throttling python and even more the loathly puffadder undistinguishable from the gravel among which he lay coiled till he leaped furiously and unswerving as if shot from a bow upon his preywhy should not they too be kindred to that evil power who had been in the holiest and most ancient books personified by the name of the serpent  before we have a right to say that the hermits view of these deadly animals was not the most rational as well as the most natural which they could possibly have taken up we must put ourselves in their places and look at nature as they had learnt to look at it not from scripture and christianity so much as from the immemorial traditions of their heathen ancestors  if it be argued that they ought to have been well enough acquainted with these beasts to be aware of their merely animal nature the answer isthat they were probably not well acquainted with the beasts of the desert  they had never perhaps before their conversion left the narrow valley well tilled and well inhabited which holds the nile  a climb from it into the barren mountains and deserts east and west was a journey out of the world into chaos and the region of the unknown and the horrible which demanded high courage from the unarmed and effeminate egyptian who knew not what monster he might meet ere sundown  moreover it is very probable that during these centuries of decadence in egypt as in other parts of the roman empire the wild beasts of the field had increased on the population and were reappearing in the more cultivated grounds  but these old hermits appear perpetually in another and a more humane if not more human aspect as the miraculous tamers of savage beasts  those who wish to know all which can be alleged in favour of their having possessed such a power should read m de montalemberts chapter les moines et la nature 209  all that learning and eloquence can say in favour of the theory is said there and with a candour which demands from no man full belief of many beautiful but impossible stories travesties of historic verity which have probably grown up from evervarying tradition in the course of ages  m de montalembert himself points out a probable explanation of many of theman ingenious scholar of our times210 he says has pointed out their true and legitimate originat least in ancient gaul  according to him after the gradual disappearance of the galloroman population the oxen the horses the dogs had returned to the wild state and it was in the forest that the breton missionaries had to seek these animals to employ them anew for domestic use  the miracle was to restore to man the command and the enjoyment of those creatures which god had given him as instruments  this theory is probable enough and will explain doubtless many stories  it may even explain those of tamed wolves who may have been only feral dogs ie dogs run wild  but it will not explain those in which in ireland as well as in gaul the stag appears as obeying the hermits commands  the twelve huge stags who come out of the forest to draw the ploughs for st leonor and his monks or those who drew to his grave the corpse of the irish hermit kellac or those who came out of the forest to supply the place of st colodocs cattle which the seigneur had carried off in revenge for his having given sanctuary to a hunted deer must have been wild from the beginning and many another tale must remain without any explanation whatsoeversave the simplest of all  neither can any such theory apply to the marvels vouched for by st athanasius st jerome and other contemporaries which show us to quote m de montalembert the most ferocious animals at the feet of such men as antony pachomius macarius and hilarion and those who copied them  at every page one sees wild asses crocodiles hippopotami hyaenas and above all lions transformed into respectful companions and docile servants of these prodigies of sanctity and one concludes thence not that these beasts had reasonable souls but that god knew how to glorify those who devoted themselves to his glory and thus show how all nature obeyed man before he was excluded from paradise by his disobedience  this is on the whole the cause which the contemporary biographers assign for these wonders  the hermits were believed to have returned by celibacy and penitence to the life of angels to that state of perfect innocence which was attributed to our first parents in eden  and therefore of them our lords words were true he that believeth in me greater things than these which i do shall he do  but those who are of a different opinion will seek for different causes  they will the more they know of these stories admire often their gracefulness often their pathos often their deep moral significance they will feel the general truth of m de montalemberts words  there is not one of them which does not honour and profit human nature and which does not express a victory of weakness over force and of good over evil  but if they look on physical facts as sacred things as the voice of god revealed in the phenomena of matter their first question will be are they true  some of them must be denied utterly like that of st helenus riding and then slaying the crocodile  it did not happen  abbot ammon 212a did not make two dragons guard his cell against robbers  st gerasimus 212b did not set the lion out of whose foot he had taken a thorn to guard his ass and when the ass was stolen by an arabian cameldriver he did not fancying that the lion had eaten the ass make him carry water in the asss stead neither did the lion when next he met the thief and the ass bring them up in his own justification 212c to st gerasimus  st costinian did not put a packsaddle on a bear and make him carry a great stone  a lioness did not bring her five blind whelps to a hermit that he might give them sight 212d  and though sulpicius severus says that he saw it with his own eyes 212e it is hard to believe the latter part of the graceful story which he tellsof an old hermit whom he found dwelling alone twelve miles from the nile by a well of vast depth  one ox he had whose whole work was to raise the water by a wheel  around him was a garden of herbs kept rich and green amid the burning sand where neither seed nor root could live  the old man and the ox fed together on the produce of their common toil but two miles off there was a single palmtree to which after supper the hermit takes his guests  beneath the palm they find a lioness but instead of attacking them she moves modestly away at the old mans command and sits down to wait for her share of dates  she feeds out of his hand like a household animal and goes her way leaving her guests trembling and confessing how great was the virtue of the hermits faith and how great their own infirmity  this last story which one would gladly believe were it possible i have inserted as one of those which hang on the verge of credibility  in the very next page sulpicius severus tells a story quite credible of a shewolf which he saw with his own eyes as tame as any dog  there can be no more reason to doubt that fact than to ascribe it to a miracle  we may even believe that the wolf having gnawed to pieces the palm basket which the good old man was weaving went off knowing that she had done wrong and after a week came back begged pardon like a rational soul and was caressed and given a double share of bread  many of these stories which tell of the taming of wild beasts may be true and yet contain no miracle they are very few in number after all in proportion to the number of monks they are to be counted at most by tens while the monks are counted by tens of thousands  and among many great companies of monks there may have been one individual as there is for instance in many a country parish a beetaker or a horsetamer of quiet temper and strong nerve and quick and sympathetic intellect whose power over animals is so extraordinary as to be attributed by the superstitious and uneducated to some hereditary secret or some fairy gift  very powerful to attract wild animals must have been the good hermits habit of sitting motionless for hours till as with st guthlac the swallows sat and sang upon his knee and of moving slowly and gently at his work till as with st karilef while he pruned his vines the robin came and built in his hood as it hung upon a tree  very powerful his freedom from anger and yet more important from fear which always calls out rage in wild beasts while a calm and bold front awes them  and most powerful of all the kindliness of heart the love of companionship which brought the wild bison to feed by st karilefs side as he prayed upon the lawn and the hind to nourish st giles with her milk in the jungles of the bouches du rhone  there was no miracle save the moral miracle that in ages of cruelty and slaughter these men had learned surely by the inspiration of god how   he prayeth well who loveth well both man and bird and beast he prayeth best who loveth best all things both great and small for the dear god who loveth us he made and loveth all   after all let these old lives of the fathers tell their own tale by their own merits let them stand or fall and stand they will in one sense  for whatsoever else they are not this they arethe histories of good men  their physical science and their daemonology may have been on a par with those of the world around them  but they possessed what the world did not possess faith in the utterly good and selfsacrificing god and an ideal of virtue and purity such as had never been seen since the first whitsuntide  and they set themselves to realize that ideal with a simplicity an energy an endurance which were altogether heroic  how far they were right in giving up the world depends entirely on what the world was then like and whether there was any hope of reforming it  it was their opinion that there was no such hope and those who know best the facts which surrounded them its utter frivolity its utter viciousness the deadness which had fallen on art science philosophy human life whether family social or political the prevalence of slavery in forms altogether hideous and unmentionable the insecurity of life and property whether from military and fiscal tyranny or from perpetual inroads of the so called barbarians those i say who know these facts best will be most inclined to believe that the old hermits were wise in their generation that the world was past salvation that it was not a wise or humane thing to marry and bring children into the world that in such a state of society an honest and virtuous man could not exist and that those who wished to remain honest and virtuous must flee into the desert and be alone with god and their fellows  the question which had to be settled then and there at that particular crisis of the human race was notare certain wonders true or false butis man a mere mortal animal or an immortal soul  is his flesh meant to serve his spirit or his spirit his flesh  is pleasure or virtue the end and aim of his existence  the hermits set themselves to answer that question not by arguing or writing about it but by the only way in which any question can be settledby experiment  they resolved to try whether their immortal souls could not grow better and better while their mortal bodies were utterly neglected to make their flesh serve their spirit to make virtue their only end and aim and utterly to relinquish the very notion of pleasure  to do this one thing and nothing else they devoted their lives and they succeeded  from their time it has been a received opinion not merely among a few philosophers or a few pharisees but among the lowest the poorest the most ignorant who have known aught of christianity that man is an immortal soul that the spirit and not the flesh ought to be master and guide that virtue is the highest good and that purity is a virtue impurity a sin  these men were it has been well said the very fathers of purity  and if in that and in other matters they pushed their purpose to an extremeif by devoting themselves utterly to it alone they suffered not merely in wideness of mind or in power of judging evidence but even in brain till they became some of them at times insane from overwrought nervesit is not for us to blame the soldier for the wounds which have crippled him or the physician for the disease which he has caught himself while trying to heal others  let us not speak ill of the bridge which carries us over nor mock at those who did the work for us as seemed to them best and perhaps in the only way in which it could be done in those evil days  as a matter of fact through these mens teaching and example we have learnt what morality purity and christianity we possess and if any answer that we have learnt them from the scriptures who but these men preserved the scriptures to us  who taught us to look on them as sacred and inspired  who taught us to apply them to our own daily lives and find comfort and teaching in every age in words written ages ago by another race in a foreign land  the scriptures were the book generally the only book which they read and meditated not merely from morn till night but as far as fainting nature would allow from night to morn again  and their method of interpreting them as far as i can discover differed in nothing from that common to all christians now save that they interpreted literally certain precepts of our lord and of st paul which we consider to have applied only to the temporary necessity of a decayed dying and hopeless age such as that in which they lived  and therefore because they knew the scripture well and learned in it lessons of true virtue and true philosophy though unable to save civilization in the east they were able at least to save it in the west  the european hermits and the monastic communities which they originated were indeed a seed of life not merely to the conquered roman population of gaul or spain or britain but to the heathen and arian barbarians who conquered them  among those fierce and armed savages the unarmed hermits stood strong only by justice purity and faith in god defying the oppressor succouring the oppressed and awing and softening the new aristocracy of the middle age which was founded on mere brute force and pride of race because the monk took his stand upon mere humanity because he told the wild conqueror goth or sueve frank or burgund saxon or norseman that all men were equal in the sight of god because he told them to quote athanasiuss own words concerning antony that virtue is not beyond human nature that the highest moral excellence was possible to the most lowborn and unlettered peasant whom they trampled under their horses hoofs if he were only renewed and sanctified by the spirit of god  they accepted the lowest and commonest facts of that peasants wretched life they outdid him in helplessness loneliness hunger dirt and slavery and then said among all these i can yet be a man of god wise virtuous pure free and noble in the sight of god though not in the sight of caesars counts and knights  they went on it is true to glorify the means above the end to consecrate childlessness selftorture dirt ignorance as if they were things pleasing to god and holy in themselves  but in spite of those errors they wrought throughout europe a work which as far as we can judge could have been done in no other way done only by men who gave up all that makes life worth having for the sake of being good themselves and making others good    the hermits of europe    most readers will recollect what an important part in the old ballads and romances is played by the hermit  he stands in strongest contrast to the knight  he fills up as it were by his gentleness and selfsacrifice what is wanting in the manhood of the knight the slave too often of his own fierceness and selfassertion  the hermit rebukes him when he sins heals him when he is wounded stays his hand in some mad murderous duel such as was too common in days when any two armed horsemen meeting on road or lawn ran blindly at each other in the mere lust of fighting as boars or stags might run  sometimes he interferes to protect the oppressed serf sometimes to rescue the hunted deer which has taken sanctuary at his feet  sometimes again his influence is that of intellectual superiority of worldly experience of the travelled man who has seen many lands and many nations  sometimes again that of sympathy for he has been a knight himself and fought and sinned and drank of the cup of vanity and vexation of spirit like the fierce warrior who kneels at his feet  all who have read and all ought to have read spensers fairy queen must recollect his charming description of the hermit with whom prince arthur leaves serena and the squire after they have been wounded by the blatant beast of slander when      toward night they came unto a plain by which a little hermitage there lay far from all neighbourhood the which annoy it may  and nigh thereto a little chapel stood which being all with ivy overspread decked all the roof and shadowing the rood seemed like a grove fair branched overhead therein the hermit which his here led in straight observance of religious vow was wont his hours and holy things to bed and therein he likewise was praying now when as these knights arrived they wist not where nor how  they stayed not there but straightway in did pass who when the hermit present saw in place from his devotions straight he troubled was which breaking off he toward them did pace with staid steps and grave beseeming grace for well it seemed that whilom he had been some goodly person and of gentle race that could his good to all and well did ween how each to entertain with courtesy beseen        he thence them led into his hermitage letting their steeds to graze upon the green small was his house and like a little cage for his own term yet inly neat and clean decked with green boughs and flowers gay beseen therein he them full fair did entertain not with such forged shews as fitter been for courting fools that courtesies would feign but with entire affection and appearance plain        how be that careful hermit did his best with many kinds of medicines meet to tame the poisonous humour that did most infest their reakling wounds and every day them duly dressed  for he right well in leechs craft was seen and through the long experience of his days which had in many fortunes tossed been and passed through many perilous assays he knew the divers want of mortal ways and in the minds of men had great insight which with sage counsel when they went astray he could inform and them reduce aright and all the passions heal which wound the weaker sprite  for whilome he had been a doughty knight as any one that lived in his days and proved oft in many a perilous fight in which he grace and glory won always and in all battles bore away the bays but being now attached with timely age and weary of this worlds unquiet ways he took himself unto this hermitage in which he lived alone like careless bird in cage   this picture is not poetry alone  it is history  such men actually lived and such work they actually did from the southernmost point of italy to the northernmost point of scotland during centuries in which there was no one else to do the work  the regular clergy could not have done it  bishops and priests were entangled in the affairs of this world striving to be statesmen striving to be landowners striving to pass church lands on from father to son and to establish themselves as an hereditary caste of priests  the chaplain or housepriest who was to be found in every noblemans almost every knights castle was apt to become a mere upper servant who said mass every morning in return for the good cheer which he got every evening and fetched and carried at the bidding of his master and mistress  but the hermit who dwelt alone in the forest glen occupied like an old hebrew prophet a superior and an independent position  he needed nought from any man save the scrap of land which the lord was only too glad to allow him in return for his counsels and his prayers  and to him as to a mysterious and supernatural personage the lord went privately for advice in his quarrels with the neighbouring barons or with his own kin  to him the lady took her children when they were sick to be healed as she fancied by his prayers and blessings or poured into his ears a hundred secret sorrows and anxieties which she dare not tell to her fierce lord who hunted and fought the livelong day and drank too much liquor every night  this class of men sprang up rapidly by natural causes and yet by a divine necessity as soon as the western empire was conquered by the german tribes and those two young officers whom we saw turning monks at treves in the time of st augustine may if they lived to be old men have given sage counsel again and again to fierce german knights and kinglets who had dispossessed the rich and effeminate landowners of their estates and sold them their wives and children in gangs by the side of their own slaves  only the roman who had turned monk would probably escape that fearful ruin and he would remain behind while the rest of his race was enslaved or swept away as a seed of christianity and of civilization destined to grow and spread and bring the wild conquerors in due time into the kingdom of god  for the first century or two after the invasion of the barbarians the names of the hermits and saints are almost exclusively latin their biographies represent them in almost every case as born of noble roman parents  as time goes on german names appear and at last entirely supersede the latin ones showing that the conquering race had learned from the conquered to become hermits and monks like them    st severinus the apostle of noricum    of all these saintly civilizers st severinus of vienna is perhaps the most interesting and his story the most historically instructive 224  a common time the middle of the fifth century the province of noricum austria as we should now call it was the very highway of invading barbarians the centre of the human maelstrom in which huns alemanni rugi and a dozen wild tribes more wrestled up and down and round the starving and beleaguered towns of what had once been a happy and fertile province each tribe striving to trample the other under foot and to march southward over their corpses to plunder what was still left of the already plundered wealth of italy and rome  the difference of race in tongue and in manners between the conquered and their conquerors was made more painful by difference in creed  the conquering germans and huns were either arians or heathens  the conquered race though probably of very mixed blood who called themselves romans because they spoke latin and lived under the roman law were orthodox catholics and the miseries of religious persecution were too often added to the usual miseries of invasion  it was about the year 45560  attila the great king of the huns who called himselfand who wasthe scourge of god was just dead  his empire had broken up  the whole centre of europe was in a state of anarchy and war and the hapless romans along the danube were in the last extremity of terror not knowing by what fresh invader their crops would be swept off up to the very gates of the walled towers which were their only defence  when there appeared among them coming out of the east a man of god  who he was he would not tell  his speech showed him to be an african romana fellowcountryman of st augustineprobably from the neighbourhood of carthage  he had certainly at one time gone to some desert in the east zealous to learn the more perfect life severinus he said was his name a name which indicated high rank as did the manners and the scholarship of him who bore it  but more than his name he would not tell  if you take me for a runaway slave he said smiling get ready money to redeem me with when my master demands me back  for he believed that they would have need of him that god had sent him into that land that he might be of use to its wretched people  and certainly he could have come into the neighbourhood of vienna at that moment for no other purpose than to do good unless he came to deal in slaves  he settled first at a town called by his biographer casturis and lodging with the warden of the church lived quietly the hermit life  meanwhile the german tribes were prowling round the town and severinus going one day into the church began to warn the priests and clergy and all the people that a destruction was coming on them which they could only avert by prayer and fasting and the works of mercy  they laughed him to scorn confiding in their lofty roman walls which the invaderswild horsemen who had no military engineswere unable either to scale or batter down  severinus left the town at once prophesying it was said the very day and hour of its fall  he went on to the next town which was then closely garrisoned by a barbarian force and repeated his warning there but while the people were listening to him there came an old man to the gate and told them how casturis had been already sacked as the man of god had foretold and going into the church threw himself at the feet of st severinus and said that he had been saved by his merits from being destroyed with his fellowtownsmen  then the dwellers in the town hearkened to the man of god and gave themselves up to fasting and almsgiving and prayer for three whole days  and on the third day when the solemnity of the evening sacrifice was fulfilled a sudden earthquake happened and the barbarians seized with panic fear and probably hating and dreadinglike all those wild tribesconfinement between four stone walls instead of the free open life of the tent and the stockade forced the romans to open their gates to them rushed out into the night and in their madness slew each other  in those days a famine fell upon the people of vienna and they as their sole remedy thought good to send for the man of god from the neighbouring town  he went and preached to them too repentance and almsgiving  the rich it seems had hidden up their stores of corn and left the poor to starve  at least st severinus discovered by divine revelation it was supposed that a widow named procula had done as much  he called her out into the midst of the people and asked her why she a noble woman and freeborn had made herself a slave to avarice which is idolatry  if she would not give her corn to christs poor let her throw it into the danube to feed the fish for any gain from it she would not have  procula was abashed and served out her hoards thereupon willingly to the poor and a little while afterwards to the astonishment of all vessels came down the danube laden with every kind of merchandise they had been frozen up for many days near passau in the thick ice of the river enns  but the prayers of gods servant so men believed had opened the icegates and let them down the stream before the usual time  then the wild german horsemen swept around the walls and carried off human beings and cattle as many as they could find  severinus like some old hebrew prophet did not shrink from advising hard blows where hard blows could avail  mamertinus the tribune or officer in command told him that he had so few soldiers and those so illarmed that he dare not face the enemy  severinus answered that they should get weapons from the barbarians themselves the lord would fight for them and they should hold their peace  only if they took any captives they should bring them safe to him  at the second milestone from the city they came upon the plunderers who fled at once leaving their arms behind  thus was the prophecy of the man of god fulfilled  the romans brought the captives back to him unharmed  he loosed their bonds gave them food and drink and let them go  but they were to tell their comrades that if ever they came near that spot again celestial vengeance would fall on them for the god of the christians fought from heaven in his servants cause  so the barbarians trembled and went away  and the fear of st severinus fell on all the goths heretic arians though they were and on the rugii who held the north bank of the danube in those evil days  st severinus meanwhile went out of vienna and built himself a cell at a place called at the vineyards  but some benevolent impulsedivine revelation his biographer calls it prompted him to return and build himself a cell on a hill close to vienna round which other cells soon grew up tenanted by his disciples  there says his biographer he longed to escape the crowds of men who were wont to come to him and cling closer to god in continual prayer  but the more he longed to dwell in solitude the more often he was warned by revelations not to deny his presence to the afflicted people  he fasted continually he went barefoot even in the midst of winter which was so severe the story continues in those days around vienna that wagons crossed the danube on the solid ice  and yet instead of being puffedup by his own virtues he set an example of humility to all and bade them with tears to pray for him that the saviours gifts to him might not heap condemnation on his head  over the wild rugii st severinus seems to have acquired unbounded influence  their king flaccitheus used to pour out his sorrows to him and tell him how the princes of the goths would surely slay him for when he had asked leave of him to pass on into italy he would not let him go  but st severinus prophesied to him that the goths would do him no harm  only one warning he must take  let it not grieve him to ask peace even for the least of men  the friendship which had thus begun between the barbarian king and the cultivated saint was carried on by his son feva  but his deadly and noxious wife gisa who appears to have been a fierce arian always says his biographer kept him back from clemency one story of gisas misdeeds is so characteristic both of the manners of the time and of the style in which the original biography is written that i shall take leave to insert it at length  the king feletheus who is also feva the son of the aforementioned flaccitheus following his fathers devotion began at the commencement of his reign often to visit the holy man  his deadly and noxious wife named gisa always kept him back from the remedies of clemency  for she among the other plaguespots of her iniquity even tried to have certain catholics rebaptized  but when her husband did not consent on account of his reverence for st severinus she gave up immediately her sacrilegious intention burdening the romans nevertheless with hard conditions and commanding some of them to be exiled to the danube  for when one day she having come to the village next to vienna had ordered some of them to be sent over the danube and condemned to the most menial offices of slavery the man of god sent to her and begged that they might be let go  but she blazing up in a flame of fury ordered the harshest of answers to be returned  i pray thee she said servant of god hiding there within thy cell allow us to settle what we choose about our own slaves  but the man of god hearing this i trust he said in my lord jesus christ that she will be forced by necessity to fulfil that which in her wicked will she has despised  and forthwith a swift rebuke followed and brought low the soul of the arrogant woman  for she had confined in close custody certain barbarian goldsmiths that they might make regal ornaments  to them the son of the aforesaid king frederic by name still a little boy had gone in in childish levity on the very day on which the queen had despised the servant of god  the goldsmiths put a sword to the childs breast saying that if any one attempted to enter without giving them an oath that they should be protected he should die and that they would slay the kings child first and themselves afterwards seeing that they had no hope of life left being worn out with long prison  when she heard that the cruel and impious queen rending her garments for grief cried out o servant of god severinus are the injuries which i did thee thus avenged  hast thou obtained by the earnest prayer thou hast poured out this punishment for my contempt that thou shouldst avenge it on my own flesh and blood  then running up and down with manifold contrition and miserable lamentation she confessed that for the act of contempt which she had committed against the servant of god she was struck by the vengeance of the present blow and forthwith she sent knights to ask for forgiveness and sent across the river the romans his prayers for whom she had despised the goldsmiths having received immediately a promise of safety and giving up the child were in like manner let go  the most reverend severinus when he heard this gave boundless thanks to the creator who sometimes puts off the prayers of suppliants for this end that as faith hope and charity grow while lesser things are sought he may concede greater things lastly this did the mercy of the omnipotent saviour work that while it brought to slavery a woman free but cruel overmuch she was forced to restore to liberty those who were enslaved  this having been marvellously gained the queen hastened with her husband to the servant of god and showed him her son who she confessed had been freed from the verge of death by his prayers and promised that she would never go against his commands  to this period of severinuss life belongs the once famous story of his interview with odoacer the first barbarian king of italy and brother of the great onulph or wolf who was the founder of the family of the guelphs counts of altorf and the direct ancestors of victoria queen of england  their father was aedecon secretary at one time of attila and chief of the little tribe of turklings who though german had clung faithfully to attilas sons and came to ruin at the great battle of netad when the empire of the huns broke up once and for ever  then odoacer and his brother started over the alps to seek their fortunes in italy and take service after the fashion of young german adventurers with the romans and they came to st severinuss cell and went in heathens as they probably were to ask a blessing of the holy man and odoacer had to stoop and to stand stooping so huge he was  the saint saw that he was no common lad and said go to italy clothed though thou be in ragged sheepskins  thou shalt soon give greater gifts to thy friends  so odoacer went on into italy deposed the last of the caesars a paltry boy romulus augustulus by name and found himself to his own astonishment and that of all the world the first german king of italy and when he was at the height of his power he remembered the prophecy of severinus and sent to him offering him any boon he chose to ask  but all that the saint asked was that he should forgive some romans whom he had banished  st severinus meanwhile foresaw that odoacers kingdom would not last as he seems to have foreseen many things by no miraculous revelation but simply as a farsighted man of the world  for when certain german knights were boasting before him of the power and glory of odoacer he said that it would last some thirteen or at most fourteen years and the prophecy so all men said in those days came exactly true  there is no need to follow the details of st severinuss labours through some fiveandtwenty years of perpetual selfsacrificeand as far as this world was concerned perpetual disaster  eugippiuss chapters are little save a catalogue of towns sacked one after the other from passau to vienna till the miserable survivors of the war seemed to have concentrated themselves under st severinuss guardianship in the latter city  we find too tales of famine of locustswarms of little victories over the barbarians which do not arrest wholesale defeat  but we find through all st severinus labouring like a true man of god conciliating the invading chiefs redeeming captives procuring for the cities which were still standing supplies of clothes for the fugitives persuading the husbandmen seemingly through large districts to give even in time of dearth a tithe of their produce to the poora tale of noble work which one regrets to see defaced by silly little prodigies more important seemingly in the eyes of the monk eugippius than the great events which were passing round him  but this is a fault too common with monk chroniclers  the only historians of the early middle age they have left us a miserably imperfect record of it because they were looking always rather for the preternatural than for the natural  many of the saints lives as they have come down to us are mere catalogues of wonders which never happened from among which the antiquary must pick out of passing hints and obscure allusions the really important facts of the timechanges political and social geography physical history the manners speech and look of nations now extinct and even the characters and passions of the actors in the story  how much can be found among such a list of wonders by an antiquary who has not merely learning but intellectual insight is proved by the admirable notes which dr reeves has appended to adamnans life of st columba  but one feels while studying his work that had adamnan thought more of facts and less of prodigies he might have saved dr reeves the greater part of his labour and preserved to us a mass of knowledge now lost for ever  and so with eugippiuss life of st severinus  the reader finds how the man who had secretly celebrated a heathen sacrifice was discovered by st severinus because while the tapers of the rest of the congregation were lighted miraculously from heaven his taper alone would not light and passes on impatiently with regret that the biographer omits to mention what the heathen sacrifice was like he reads how the danube dared not rise above the mark of the cross which st severinus had cut upon the posts of a timber chapel how a poor man going out to drive the locusts off his little patch of corn instead of staying in the church all day to pray found the next morning that his crop alone had been eaten while all the fields around remained untouched  even the wellknown story which has a certain awfulness about it how st severinus watched all night by the bier of the dead priest silvinus and ere the morning dawned bade him in the name of god speak to his brethren and how the dead man opened his eyes and severinus asked him whether he wished to return to life and he answered complainingly keep me no longer here nor cheat me of that perpetual rest which i had already found and so closing his eyes once more was still for ever even such a story as this were it true would be of little value in comparison with the wisdom faith charity sympathy industry utter selfsacrifice which formed the true greatness of such a man as severinus  at last the noble life wore itself out  for two years severinus had foretold that his end was near and foretold too that the people for whom he had spent himself should go forth in safety as israel out of egypt and find a refuge in some other roman province leaving behind them so utter a solitude that the barbarians in their search for the hidden treasures of the civilization which they had exterminated should dig up the very graves of the dead  only when the lord willed that people to deliver them they must carry away his bones with them as the children of israel carried the bones of joseph  then severinus sent for feva the rugian king and gisa his cruel wife and when he had warned them how they must render an account to god for the people committed to their charge he stretched his hand out to the bosom of the king  gisa he asked dost thou love most the soul within that breast or gold and silver  she answered that she loved her husband above all  cease then he said to oppress the innocent  lest their affliction be the ruin of your power  severinus presage was strangely fulfilled  feva had handed over the city of vienna to his brother fredericpoor and impious says eugippius  severinus who knew him well sent for him and warned him that he himself was going to the lord and that if after his death frederic dared touch aught of the substance of the poor and the captive the wrath of god would fall on him  in vain the barbarian pretended indignant innocence severinus sent him away with fresh warnings  then on the nones of january he was smitten slightly with a pain in the side  and when that had continued for three days at midnight he bade the brethren come to him  he renewed his talk about the coming emigration and entreated again that his bones might not be left behind and having bidden all in turn come near and kiss him and having received the sacrament of communion he forbade them to weep for him and commanded them to sing a psalm  they hesitated weeping  he himself gave out the psalm praise the lord in his saints and let all that hath breath praise the lord and so went to rest in the lord  no sooner was he dead than frederic seized on the garments kept in the monastery for the use of the poor and even commanded his men to carry off the vessels of the altar  then followed a scene characteristic of the time  the steward sent to do the deed shrank from the crime of sacrilege  a knight anicianus by name went in his stead and took the vessels of the altar  but his conscience was too strong for him  trembling and delirium fell on him and he fled away to a lonely island and became a hermit there  frederic impenitent swept away all in the monastery leaving nought but the bare walls which he could not carry over the danube  but on him too vengeance fell  within a month he was slain by his own nephew then odoacer attacked the rugii and carried off feva and gisa captive to rome  and then the longpromised emigration came odoacer whether from mere policy for he was trying to establish a halfroman kingdom in italy or for love of st severinus himself sent his brother onulf to fetch away into italy the miserable remnant of the danubian provincials to be distributed among the wasted and unpeopled farms of italy  and with them went forth the corpse of st severinus undecayed though he had been six years dead and giving forth exceeding fragrance though says eugippius no embalmers hand had touched it  in a coffin which had been long prepared for it it was laid on a wagon and went over the alps into italy working according to eugippius the usual miracles on the way till it found a restingplace near naples in that very villa of lucullus at misenum to which odoacer had sent the last emperor of rome to dream his ignoble life away in helpless luxury  so ends this tragic story  of its substantial truth there can be no doubt  the miracles recorded in it are fewer and less strange than those of the average legendsas is usually the case when an eye witness writes  and that eugippius was an eyewitness of much which he tells no one accustomed to judge of the authenticity of documents can doubt if he studies the tale as it stands in pez 238  as he studies too he will perhaps wish with me that some great dramatist may hereafter take eugippiuss quaint and rough legend and shape it into immortal verse  for tragic in the very nighest sense the story is throughout  m ozanam has well said of that deathbed scene between the saint and the barbarian king and queenthe history of invasions has many a pathetic scene  but i know none more instructive than the dying agony of that old roman expiring between two barbarians and less touched with the ruin of the empire than with the peril of their souls  but even more instructive and more tragic also is the strange coincidence that the wonderworking corpse of the starved and barefooted hermit should rest beside the last emperor of rome  it is the symbol of a new era  the kings of this world have been judged and cast out the empire of the flesh is to perish and the empire of the spirit to conquer thenceforth for evermore  but if st severinuss labours in austria were in vain there were other hermits in gaul and elsewhere whose work endured and prospered and developed to a size of which they had never dreamed the stories of these good men may be read at length in the bollandists and surius  in a more accessible and more graceful form in m de montalemberts charming pages  i can only sketch in a few words the history of a few of the more famous  pushing continually northward and westward from the shores of the mediterranean fresh hermits settled in the mountains and forests collected disciples round them and founded monasteries which during the sanguinary and savage era of the merovingian kings were the only retreats for learning piety and civilization  st martin the young soldier who may be seen in old pictures cutting his cloak in two with a sword to share it with a beggar left after twenty campaigns the army into which he had been enrolled against his will a conscript of fifteen years old to become a hermit monk and missionary  in the desert isle of gallinaria near genoa he lived on roots to train himself for the monastic life and then went northwest to poitiers to found liguge said to be the most ancient monastery in france to become bishop of tours and to overthrow throughout his diocese often at the risk of his life the sacred oaks and druid stones of the gauls and the temples and idols of the romans  but helike many morelonged for the peace of the hermits cell and near tours between the river loire and lofty cliffs he hid himself in a hut of branches while his eighty disciples dwelt in caves of the rocks above clothed only in skins of camels  he died in ad 397 at the age of eightyone leaving behind him not merely that famous monastery of marmontier martini monasterium which endured till the revolution of 1793 but what is infinitely more to his glory his solemn and indignant protest against the first persecution by the catholic churchthe torture and execution of those unhappy priscillianist fanatics whom the spanish bishops the spiritual forefathers of the inquisition had condemned in the name of the god of love  martin wept over the fate of the priscillianists  happily he was no prophet or his head would have become like jeremiahs a fount of tears could he have foreseen that the isolated atrocity of those spanish bishops would have become the example and the rule legalized and formulized and commanded by pope after pope for every country in christendom  sulpicius severus again whose lives of the desert fathers i have already quoted carried the example of these fathers into his own estates in aquitaine  selling his lands he dwelt among his now manumitted slaves sleeping on straw and feeding on the coarsest bread and herbs till the hapless neophytes found that life was not so easily sustained in france as in egypt and complained to him that it was in vain to try to make them live like angels when they were only gauls  another centre of piety and civilization was the rocky isle of lerins off the port of toulon  covered with the ruins of an ancient roman city and swarming with serpents it was colonized again in ad 410 by a young man of rank named honoratus who gathered round him a crowd of disciples converted the desert isle into a garden of flowers and herbs and made the seagirt sanctuary of lerins one of the most important spots of the then world  the west says m de montalembert had thenceforth nothing to envy the east and soon that retreat destined by its founder to renew on the shores of provence the austerities of the thebaid became a celebrated school of christian theology and philosophy a citadel inaccessible to the waves of the barbarian invasion an asylum for the letters and sciences which were fleeing from italy then overrun by the goths and lastly a nursery of bishops and saints who spread through gaul the knowledge of the gospel and the glory of lerins  we shall soon see the rays of his light flash even into ireland and england by the blessed hands of patrick and augustine  in the year 425 romanus a young monk from the neighbourhood of lyons had gone up into the forests of the jura carrying with him the lives of the hermits and a few seeds and tools and had settled beneath an enormous pine shut out from mankind by precipices torrents and the tangled trunks of primaeval trees which had fallen and rotted on each other age after age  his brother lupicinus joined him then crowds of disciples then his sister and a multitude of women  the forests were cleared the slopes planted a manufacture of boxwood articleschairs among the restwas begun and within the next fifty years the abbey of condat or st claude as it was afterwards called had become not merely an agricultural colony or even merely a minster for the perpetual worship of god but the first school of that part of gaul in which the works of greek as well as latin orators were taught not only to the young monks but to young laymen likewise  meanwhile the volcanic peaks of the auvergne were hiding from their arian invaders the ruined gentry of central france  effeminate and luxurious slaveholders as they are painted by sidonius appolineris bishop of clermont in that same auvergne nothing was left for them when their wealth was gone but to become monks  and monks they became  the lava grottoes held hermits who saw visions and daemons as st antony had seen them in egypt while near treves on the moselle a young hermit named wolflaich tried to imitate st simeon stylites penance on the pillar till his bishop foreseeing that in that severe climate he would only kill himself wheedled him away from his station pulled down the pillar in his absence and bade him be a wiser man  another figure and a more interesting one is the famous st goar a gaul seemingly from the recorded names of his parents of noble roman blood who took his station on the rhine under the cliffs of that lurlei so famous in legend and ballad as haunted by some fair fiend whose treacherous song lured the boatmen into the whirlpool at their foot  to rescue the shipwrecked boatmen to lodge feed and if need be clothe the travellers along the rhine bank was st goars especial work and wandelbert the monk of prum in the eifel who wrote his life at considerable length tells us how st goar was accused to the archbishop of treves as a hypocrite and a glutton because he ate freely with his guests and how his calumniators took him through the forest to treves and how he performed divers miracles both on the road and in the palace of the archbishop notably the famous one of hanging his cape upon a sunbeam mistaking it for a peg  and other miracles of his there are some of them not altogether edifying  but no reader is bound to believe them as wandelbert is evidently writing in the interests of the abbey of prum as against those of the princebishops of treves and with a monks or regulars usual jealousy of the secular or parochial clergy and their bishops  a more important personage than any of these is the famous st benedict father of the benedictine order and father of all monks as he was afterwards called who beginning himself as a hermit caused the hermit life to fall not into disrepute but into comparative disuse while the coenobitic lifethat is life not in separate cells but in corporate bodies with common property and under one common rulewas accepted as the general form of the religious life in the west  as the author of this organization and of the benedictine order to whose learning as well as to whose piety the world has owed so much his life belongs rather to a history of the monastic orders than to that of the early hermits but it must be always remembered that it was as a hermit that his genius was trained that in solitude he conceived his vast plans in solitude he elaborated the really wise and noble rules of his which he afterwards carried out as far as he could during his lifetime in the busy world and which endured for centuries a solid piece of practical good work  for the existence of monks was an admitted fact even an admitted necessity  st benedicts work was to tell them if they chose to be monks what sort of persons they ought to be and how they ought to live in order to fulfil their own ideal in the solitude of the hills of subiaco above the ruined palace of nero above too the town of nurscia of whose lords he was the last remaining scion he fled to the mountain grotto to live the outward life of a wild beast and as he conceived the inward life of an angel  how he founded twelve monasteries how he fled with some of his younger disciples to withdraw them from the disgusting persecutions and temptations of the neighbouring secular clergy how he settled himself on the still famous monte cassino which looks down upon the gulf of gaeta and founded there the archi monasterium of europe whose abbot was in due time first premier baron of the kingdom of napleswhich counted among its dependencies 245 four bishoprics two principalities twenty earldoms two hundred and fifty castles four hundred and forty towns or villages three hundred and thirtysix manors twentythree seaports three isles two hundred mills three hundred territories sixteen hundred and sixtytwo churches and at the end of the sixteenth century an annual revenue of 1500000 ducatsare matters which hardly belong to this volume which deals merely with the lives of hermits    the celtic hermits    it is not necessary to enter into the vexed question whether any christianity ever existed in these islands of an earlier and purer type than that which was professed and practised by the saintly disciples of st antony  it is at least certain that the earliest historic figures which emerge from the haze of barbarous antiquity in both the britains and in ireland are those of hermits who in celibacy and poverty gather round them disciples found a convent convert and baptize the heathen and often like antony and hilarion escape from the bustle and toil of the world into their beloved desert  they work the same miracles see the same visions and live in the same intimacy with the wild animals as the hermits of egypt or of roman gaul  but their history owing to the wild imagination and as the legends themselves prove the gross barbarism of the tribes among whom they dwell are so involved in fable and legend that it is all but impossible to separate fact from fiction all but impossible often to fix the time at which they lived  their mode of life it must always be remembered is said to be copied from that of the roman hermits of gaul  st patrick the apostle of ireland seems to have been of roman or roman british lineage  in his famous confession which many learned antiquaries consider as genuine he calls his father calphurnius a deacon his grandfather potitus a priestboth of these names being roman  he is said to have visited at some period of his life the monastery of st martin at tours to have studied with st germanus at auxerre and to have gone to one of the islands of the tuscan sea probably lerins itself and whether or not we believe the story that he was consecrated bishop by pope celestine at rome we can hardly doubt that he was a member of that great spiritual succession of ascetics who counted st antony as their father  such another must that palladius have been who was sent says prosper of aquitaine by pope celestine to convert the irish scots and who according to another story was cast on shore on the north east coast of scotland founded the church of fordun in kincardineshire and became a great saint among the pictish folk  another primaeval figure almost as shadowy as st patrick is st ninian a monk of north wales who according to bede first attempted the conversion of the southern picts and built himself at whithorn in galloway the candida casa or white house a little church of stonea wonder in those days of creel houses and wooden stockades  he too according to bede who lived some 250 years after his time went to rome and he is said to have visited and corresponded with st martin of tours  dubricius again whom legend makes the contemporary both of st patrick and of king arthur appears in wales as bishop and abbot of llandaff  he too is ordained by a roman bishop st germanus of auxerre and he too ends his career according to tradition as a hermit while his disciples spread away into armorica brittany and ireland  we need not therefore be surprised to find ireland wales cornwall scotland and brittany during the next three centuries swarming with saints who kept up whether in company or alone the old hermitlife of the thebaid or to find them wandering whether on missionary work or in search of solitude or escaping like st cadoc the wise from the saxon invaders  their frequent journeys to rome and even to jerusalem may perhaps be set down as a fable invented in after years by monks who were anxious to prove their complete dependence on the holy see and their perfect communion with the older and more civilized christianity of the roman empire  it is probable enough also that romans from gaul as well as from britain often men of rank and education who had fled before the invading goths and franks and had devoted themselves as we have seen that they often did to the monastic life should have escaped into those parts of these islands which had not already fallen into the hands of the saxon invaders  ireland as the most remote situation would be especially inviting to the fugitives and we can thus understand the story which is found in the acts of st senanus how fifty monks romans born sailed to ireland to learn the scriptures and to lead a stricter life and were distributed between st senan st finnian st brendan st barry and st kieran  by such immigrations as this it may be ireland becameas she certainly was for a whilethe refuge of what ecclesiastical civilization learning and art the barbarian invaders had spared a sanctuary from whence in after centuries evangelists and teachers went forth once more not only to scotland and england but to france and germany  very fantastic and often very beautiful are the stories of these men and sometimes tragical enough like that of the welsh st iltut cousin of the mythic arthur and founder of the great monastery of bangor on the banks of the dee which was saidthough we are not bound to believe the factto have held more than two thousand monks at the time of the saxon invasion  the wild warrior was converted says this legend by seeing the earth open and swallow up his comrades who had extorted bread beer and a fat pig from st cadoc of llancarvan a princely hermit and abbot who had persuaded his father and mother to embrace the hermit life as the regular if not the only way of saving their souls  in a paroxysm of terror he fled from his fair young wife into the forest would not allow her to share with him even his hut of branches and devoted himself to the labour of making an immense dyke of mud and stones to keep out the inundations of a neighbouring river  his poor wife went in search of him once more and found him in the bottom of a dyke no longer a gay knight but poorly dressed and covered with mud  she went away and never saw him more fearing to displease god and one so beloved by god  iltut dwelt afterwards for four years in a cave sleeping on the bare rock and seems at last to have crossed over to brittany and died at dol  we must not forgetthough he is not strictly a hermitst david the popular saint of the welsh son of a nephew of the mythic arthur and educated by one paulinus a disciple it is said of st germanus of auxerre  he is at once monk and bishop  he gathers round him young monks in the wilderness makes them till the ground drawing the plough by their own strength for he allows them not to own even an ox  he does battle against satraps and magicians probably heathen chieftains and druids he goes to the holy land and is made archbishop by the patriarch of jerusalem  he introduces it would seem into this island the right of sanctuary for criminals in any field consecrated to himself  he restores the church of glastonbury over the tomb of his cousin king arthur and dies at 100 years of age the head of the whole british nation and honour of his fatherland  he is buried in one of his own monasteries at st davids near the headland whence st patrick had seen in a vision all ireland stretched out before him waiting to be converted to christ and the celtic people go on pilgrimage to his tomb even from brittany and ireland  and canonized in 1120 he becomes the patron saint of wales  from that same point in what year is not said an old monk of st davids monastery named modonnoc set sail for ireland after a long life of labour and virtue  a swarm of bees settled upon the bow of his boat and would not be driven away  he took them whether he would or not with him into ireland and introduced there says the legend the culture of bees and the use of honey  ireland was then the isle of saints  three orders of them were counted by later historians  the bishops who seem not to have had necessarily territorial dioceses with st patrick at their head shining like the sun the second of priests under st columba shining like the moon and the third of bishops priests and hermits under colman and aidan shining like the stars  their legends full of irish poetry and tenderness and not without touches here and there of genuine irish humour lie buried now to all save antiquaries in the folios of the bollandists and colgan but the memory of their virtue and beneficence as well as of their miracles shadowy and distorted by the lapse of centuries is rooted in the heart and brain of the irish peasantry and who shall say altogether for evil  for with the tradition of their miracles has been entwined the tradition of their virtues as an enduring heirloom for the whole irish race through the sad centuries which part the era of saints from the present time  we see the irish women kneeling beside some well whose waters were hallowed ages since by the fancied miracle of some mythic saint and hanging gaudy rags just as do the half savage buddhists of the himalayas upon the bushes round  we see them upon holy days crawling on bare and bleeding knees around st patricks cell on the top of croagh patrick the grandest mountain perhaps with the grandest outlook in these british isles where stands still i believe an ancient wooden image said to have belonged to st patrick himself and where too hung till late years it is now preserved in dublin an ancient bell such a strange little oblong bell as the irish saints carried with them to keep off daemons one of those magic bells which appear so far as i am aware in no country save ireland and scotland till we come to tartary and the buddhists  such a bell as came down from heaven to st senan  such a bell as st fursey sent flying through the air to greet st cuandy at his devotions when he could not come himself  such a bell as another saint wandering in the woods rang till a stag came out of the covert and carried it for him on his horns  on that peak so legends tell st patrick stood once in the spirit and power of eliasafter whom the mountain was long named fasting like elias forty days and forty nights and wrestling with the daemons of the storm and the snakes of the fen and the peishtamore the gigantic monster of the lakes till he smote the evil things with the golden rod of jesus and they rolled over the cliff in hideous rout and perished in the atlantic far below  we know that these tales are but the dreams of children but shall we sneer at the devotion of those poor irish  not if we remember what is an undoubted fact that the memory of these same saints has kept up in their minds an ideal of nobleness and purity devotion and beneficence which downtrodden slaves as they have been they would otherwise have inevitably lost that it has helped to preserve them from mere brutality and mere ferocity and that the thought that these men were of their own race and their own kin has given them a pride in their own race a sense of national unity and of national dignity which has enduredand surely for their benefit for reverence for ancestors and the selfrespect which springs from it is a benefit to every human beingthrough all the miseries deserved or undeserved which have fallen upon the irish since pope adrian iv the true author of all the woes of ireland in the year 1155 commissioned henry ii to conquer ireland and destroy its primaeval church on consideration of receiving his share of the booty in the shape of peters pence  among these irish saints two names stand out as especially interesting  that of st brendan and that of st columbathe former as the representative of the sailor monks of the early period the other as the great missionary who leaving his monastery at durrow in ireland for the famous island of hy iona or icolumbkill off the western point of mull became the apostle of scotland and the north of england  i shall first speak of st brendan and at some length  his name has become lately familiar to many through the medium of two very beautiful poems one by mr matthew arnold and the other by mr sebastian evans and it may interest those who have read their versions of the story to see the oldest form in which the story now exists  the celts it must be remembered are not in general a seagoing folk  they have always neglected the rich fisheries of their coasts and in ireland every seaport owes its existence not to the natives but to norse colonists  even now the irishman or western highlander who emigrates to escape the saxons sails in a ship built and manned by those very saxons to lands which the saxons have discovered and civilized  but in the seventh and eighth centuries and perhaps earlier many celts were voyagers and emigrants not to discover new worlds but to flee from the old one there were deserts in the sea as well as on land in them they hoped to escape from men and yet more from women  they went against their carnal will  they had no liking for the salt water  they were horribly frightened and often wept bitterly as they themselves confess  and they had reason for fear for their vessels were for the most part only curachs coracles of wattled twigs covered with tanned hides  they needed continual exhortation and comfort from the holy man who was their captain and needed often miracles likewise for their preservation  tempests had to be changed into calm and contrary winds into fair ones by the prayers of a saint and the spirit of prophecy was needed to predict that a whale would be met between iona and tiree who appeared accordingly to the extreme terror of st berachs crew swimming with open jaws and intent on eating not monks but herrings nearly upsetting them by the swell which he raised  and when st baithenius met the same whale on the same day it was necessary for him to rise and bless with outspread hands the sea and the whale in order to make him sink again after having risen to breathe  but they sailed forth nevertheless not knowing whither they went true to their great principle that the spirit must conquer the flesh  and so showed themselves actually braver men than the norse pirates who sailed afterwards over the same seas without fear and without the need of miracles and who found everywhere on desert islands on seawashed stacks and skerries round orkney shetland and the faroes even to iceland the cells of these papas or popes and named them after the old hermits whose memory still lingers in the names of papa strona and papa westra in the orkneys and in that of papey off the coast of iceland where the first norse settlers found irish books bells and crosiers the relics of old hermits who had long since fasted and prayed their last and migrated to the lord  adanman in his life of st columba tells of more than one such voyage  he tells how one baitanus with the saints blessing sailed forth to find a desert in the sea and how when he was gone the saint prophesied that he should be buried not in a desert isle but where a woman should drive sheep over his grave the which came true in the oakwood of calgaich now londonderry whither he came back again  he tells again of one cormac a knight of christ who three times sailed forth in a coracle to find some desert isle and three times failed of his purpose and how in his last voyage he was driven northward by the wind fourteen days sail till he came where the summer sea was full of foul little stinging creatures of the size of frogs which beat against the sides of the frail boat till all expected them to be stove in they clung moreover to the oar blades 256 and cormac was in some danger of never seeing land again had not st columba at home in iona far away seen him in a vision him and his fellows praying and watering their cheeks with floods of tears in the midst of perturbations monstrous horrific never seen before and almost unspeakable  calling together his monks he bade them pray for a north wind which came accordingly and blew cormac safe back to iona to tempt the waves no more  let the reader therefore perpend how great and what manner of man this same blessed personage was who having so great prophetic knowledge could command by invoking the name of christ the winds and ocean  even as late as the year 891 says the anglosaxon chronicle three scots came to king alfred in a boat without any oars from ireland whence they had stolen away because for the love of god they desired to be on pilgrimage they recked not where  the boat in which they came was made of two hides and a half and they took with them provisions for seven days and about the seventh day they came on shore in cornwall and soon after went to king alfred  thus they were named dubslane and macbeth and maelinmun  out of such wild feats as these out of dim reports of fairy islands in the west of the canaries and azores of that vinland with its wild corn and wild grapes which leif the son of eirek rauda had found beyond the ocean a thousand years and one after the birth of christ of icebergs and floes sailing in the far northern sea upon the edge of the sixmonths night out of edda stories of the midgard snake which is coiled round the world out of reports it may be of indian fakirs and buddhist shamans out of scraps of greek and arab myth from the odyssey or the arabian nights brought home by jorsala farar vikings who had been for pilgrimage and plunder up the straits of gibraltar into the far eastout of all these materials were made up as years rolled on the famous legend of st brendan and his seven years voyage in search of the land promised to the saints  this tale was so popular in the middle age that it appears in different shapes in almost every early european language 257  it was not only the delight of monks but it stirred up to wild voyages many a secular man in search of st brendans isle which is not found when it is sought but was said to be visible at times from palma in the canaries  the myth must have been well known to columbus and may have helped to send him forth in search of cathay  thither so the spanish peasants believed don roderic had retired from the moorish invaders  there so the portuguese fancied king sebastian was hidden from men after his reported death in the battle of alcazar  the west indies when they were first seen were surely st brendans isle  and the mississippi may have been in the eyes of such old adventurers as don ferdinando da soto when he sought for the fountain of perpetual youth the very river which st brendan found parting in two the land of promise from the year 1526 says m jubinal till as late as 1721 armaments went forth from time to time into the atlantic and went forth in vain  for the whole tale from whatever dim reports of fact they may have sprung is truly as m jubinal calls it a monkish odyssey and nothing more  it is a dream of the hermits cell  no woman no city nor nation are ever seen during the seven years voyage ideal monasteries and ideal hermits people the deserts of the ocean  all beings therein save daemons and cyclops are christians even to the very birds and keep the festivals of the church as eternal laws of nature  the voyage succeeds not by seamanship or geographic knowledge nor even by chance  but by the miraculous prescience of the saint or of those whom he meets and the wanderings of ulysses or of sinbad are rational and human in comparison with those of st brendan  yet there are in them as was to be expected elements in which the greek or the arab legends are altogether deficient perfect innocence patience and justice utter faith in a god who prospers the innocent and punishes the guilty ennobling obedience to the saint who stands out a truly heroic figure above his trembling crew and even more valuable still the belief in the craving for an ideal even though that ideal be that of a mere earthly paradise the divine discontent as it has been well called which is the root of all true progress which leaves thank god no man at peace save him who has said let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die  and therefore i have written at some length the story of st brendan because though it be but a monkideal it is an ideal still  and therefore profitable for all who are not content with this world and its paltry ways  saint brendan we read the son of finnloga and great grandson of alta son of ogaman of the race of ciar son of fergus was born at tralee and founded in 559 the abbey of clonfert 260a and was a man famous for his great abstinence and virtues and the father of nearly 3000 monks 260b  and while he was in his warfare there came to him one evening a holy hermit named barintus of the royal race of neill and when he was questioned he did nought but cast himself on the ground and weep and pray  and when st brendan asked him to make better cheer for him and his monks he told him a strange tale  how a nephew of his had fled away to be a solitary and found a delicious island and established a monastery therein and how he himself had gone to see his nephew and sailed with him to the eastward to an island which was called the land of promise of the saints wide and grassy and bearing all manner of fruits wherein was no night for the lord jesus christ was the light thereof and how they abode there for a long while without eating and drinking and when they returned to his nephews monastery the brethren knew well where they had been for the fragrance of paradise lingered on their garments for nearly forty days  so barintus told his story and went back to his cell  but st brendan called together his most loving fellowwarriors as he called them and told them how he had set his heart on seeking that promised land  and he went up to the top of the hill in kerry which is still called mount brendan with fourteen chosen monks and there at the utmost corner of the world he built him a coracle of wattle and covered it with hides tanned in oakbark and softened with butter and set up in it a mast and a sail and took forty days provision and commanded his monks to enter the boat in the name of the holy trinity  and as he stood alone praying on the shore three more monks from his monastery came up and fell at his feet and begged to go too or they would die in that place of hunger and thirst for they were determined to wander with him all the days of their life  so he gave them leave  but two of them he prophesied would come to harm and to judgment  so they sailed away toward the summer solstice with a fair wind and had no need to row  but after twelve days the wind fell to a calm and they had only light airs at night till forty days were past and all their victual spent  then they saw toward the north a lofty island walled round with cliffs and went about it three days ere they could find a harbour  and when they landed a dog came fawning on them and they followed it up to a great hall with beds and seats and water to wash their feet  but st brendan said beware lest satan bring you into temptation  for i see him busy with one of those three who followed us  now the hall was hung all round with vessels of divers metals and bits and horns overlaid with silver then st brendan told his servant to bring the meal which god had prepared and at once a table was laid with napkins and loaves wondrous white and fishes  then they blessed god and ate and took likewise drink as much as they would and lay down to sleep then st brendan saw the devils work namely a little black boy holding a silver bit and calling the brother aforementioned  so they rested three days and three nights  but when they went to the ship st brendan charged them with theft and told what was stolen and who had stolen it  then the brother cast out of his bosom a silver bit and prayed for mercy  and when he was forgiven and raised up from the ground behold a little black boy flew out of his bosom howling aloud and crying why o man of god dost thou drive me from my habitation where i have dwelt for seven years  then the brother received the holy eucharist and died straightway and was buried in that isle and the brethren saw the angels carry his soul aloft for st brendan had told him that so it should be but that the brother who came with him should have his sepulchre in hell  and as they went on board a youth met them with a basket of loaves and a bottle of water and told them that it would not fail till pentecost  then they sailed again many days till they came to an isle full of great streams and fountains swarming with fish and sheep there all white as big as oxen so many that they hid the face of the earth and they stayed there till easter eve and took one of the sheep which followed them as if it had been tame to eat for the paschal feast  then came a man with loaves baked in the ashes and other victual and fell down before st brendan and cried how have i merited this o pearl of god that thou shouldest be fed at this holy tide from the labours of my hand  and they learned from that man that the sheep grew there so big because they were never milked nor pinched with winter but they fed in those pastures all the year round  moreover he told them that they must keep easter in an isle hard by opposite a shore to the west which some called the paradise of birds  so to the nearest island they sailed  it had no harbour nor sandy shore and there was no turf on it and very little wood  now the saint knew what manner of isle it was but he would not tell the brethren lest they should be terrified  so he bade them make the boat fast stem and stern and when morning came he bade those who were priests to celebrate each a mass and then to take the lambs fleece on shore and cook it in the caldron with salt while st brendan remained in the boat  but when the fire blazed up and the pot began to boil that island began to move like water  then the brethren ran to the boat imploring st brendans aid and he helped them each in by the hand and cast off  after which the island sank in the ocean  and when they could see their fire burning more than two miles off st brendan told them how that god had revealed to him that night the mystery that this was no isle but the biggest of all fishes which swam in the ocean always it tries to make its head and its tail meet but cannot by reason of its length and its name is jasconius  then across a narrow strait they saw another isle very grassy and wooded and full of flowers  and they found a little stream and towed the boat up it for the stream was of the same width as the boat with st brendan sitting on board till they came to the fountain thereof  then said the holy father see brethren the lord has given us a place wherein to celebrate his holy resurrection  and if we had nought else this fountain i think would serve for food as well as drink  for the fountain was too admirable  over it was a huge tree of wonderful breadth but no great height covered with snowwhite birds so that its leaves and boughs could scarce be seen  and when the man of god saw that he was so desirous to know the cause of that assemblage of birds that he besought god upon his knees with tears saying god who knowest the unknown and revealest the hidden thou knowest the anxiety of my heart    deign of thy great mercy to reveal to me thy secret     but not for the merit of my own dignity but regarding thy clemency do i presume to ask  then one of those birds flew from off the tree and his wings sounded like bells over the boat  and he sat on the prow and spread his wings joyfully and looked quietly on st brendan  and when the man of god questioned that bird it told how they were of the spirits which fell in the great ruin of the old enemy not by sin or by consent but predestined by the piety of god to fall with those with whom they were created  but they suffered no punishment only they could not in part behold the presence of god  they wandered about this world like other spirits of the air and firmament and earth  but on holy days they took those shapes of birds and praised their creator in that place  then the bird told him how he and his monks had wandered one year already and should wander for six more and every year should celebrate their easter in that place and after find the land of promise and so flew back to its tree  and when the eventide was come the birds began all with one voice to sing and clap their wings crying thou o god art praised in zion and unto thee shall the vow be performed in jerusalem  and always they repeated that verse for an hour and their melody and the clapping of their wings was like music which drew tears by its sweetness  and when the man of god wakened his monks at the third watch of the night with the verse thou shalt open my lips o lord all the birds answered praise the lord all his angels praise him all his virtues  and when the dawn shone they sang again the splendour of the lord god is over us and at the third hour sing psalms to our god sing sing to our king sing with wisdom  and at the sixth the lord hath lifted up the light of his countenance upon us and had mercy on us  and at the ninth behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell in unity  so day and night those birds gave praise to god  st brendan therefore seeing these things gave thanks to god for all his marvels and the brethren were refreshed with that spiritual food till the octave of easter  after which st brendan advised to take of the water of the fountain for till then they had only used it to wash their feet and hands  but there came to him the same man who had been with them three days before easter and with his boat full of meat and drink and said my brothers here you have enough to last till pentecost but do not drink of that fountain  for its nature is that whosoever drinks will sleep for fourandtwenty hours  so they stayed till pentecost and rejoiced in the song of the birds  and after mass at pentecost the man brought them food again and bade them take of the water of the fountain and depart  then the birds came again and sat upon the prow and told them how they must every year celebrate easter in the isle of birds and easter eve upon the back of the fish jasconius and how after eight months they should come to the isle called ailbey and keep their christmas there  after which they were on the ocean for eight months out of sight of land and only eating after every two or three days till they came to an island along which they sailed for forty days and found no harbour  then they wept and prayed for they were almost worn out with weariness and after they had fasted and prayed for three days they saw a narrow harbour and two fountains one foul one clear but when the brethren hurried to draw water st brendan as he had done once before forbade them saying that they must take nought without leave from the elders who were in that isle  and of the wonders which they saw in that isle it were too long to tell  how there met them an exceeding old man with snowwhite hair who fell at st brendans feet three times and led him in silence up to a monastery of fourandtwenty silent monks who washed their feet and fed them with bread and water and roots of wonderful sweetness and then at last opening his mouth told them how that bread was sent them perpetually they knew not from whence and how they had been there eighty years since the times of st patrick and how their father ailbey and christ had nourished them and how they grew no older nor ever fell sick nor were overcome by cold or heat and how brother never spoke to brother but all things were done by signs and how he led them to a square chapel with three candles before the midaltar and two before each of the side altars and how they and the chalices and patens and all the other vessels were of crystal and how the candles were lighted always by a fiery arrow which came in through the window and returned and how st brendan kept his christmas there and then sailed away till lent and came to a fruitful island where he found fish and how when certain brethren drank too much of the charmed water they slept some three days and some one and how they sailed north and then east till they came back to the isle of sheep at easter and found on the shore their caldron which they had lost on jasconiuss back and how sailing away they were chased by a mighty fish which spouted foam but was slain by another fish which spouted fire and how they took enough of its flesh to last them three months and how they came to an island flat as the sea without trees or aught that waved in the wind and how on that island were three troops of monks as the holy man had foretold standing a stones throw from each other  the first of boys robed in snowwhite the second of young men dressed in hyacinthine the third of old men in purple dalmatics singing alternately their psalms all day and night  and how when they stopped singing a cloud of wondrous brightness overshadowed the isle and how two of the young men ere they sailed away brought baskets of grapes and asked that one of the monks as had been prophesied should remain with them in the isle of strong men and how st brendan let him go saying in a good hour did thy mother conceive thee because thou hast merited to dwell with such a congregation and how those grapes were so big that a pound of juice ran out of each of them and an ounce thereof fed each brother for a whole day and was as sweet as honey and how a magnificent bird dropped into the ship the bough of an unknown tree with a bunch of grapes thereon and how they came to a land where the trees were all bowed down with vines and their odour as the odour of a house full of pomegranates and how they fed forty days on those grapes and strange herbs and roots and how they saw flying against them the bird which is called gryphon and how that bird who had brought the bough tore out the gryphons eyes and slew him and how they looked down into the clear sea and saw all the fishes sailing round and round head to tail innumerable as flocks in the pastures and were terrified and would have had the man of god celebrate mass in silence lest the fish should hear and attack them and how the man of god laughed at their folly and how they came to a column of clear crystal in the sea with a canopy round it of the colour of silver harder than marble and sailed in through an opening and found it all light within 269 and how they found in that hall a chalice of the same stuff as the canopy and a paten of that of the column and took them that they might make many believe and how they sailed out again and past a treeless island covered with slag and forges and how a great hairy man fiery and smutty came down and shouted after them and how when they made the sign of the cross and sailed away he and his fellows brought down huge lumps of burning slag in tongs and hurled them after the ship and how they went back and blew their forges up till the whole island flared and the sea boiled and the howling and stench followed them even when they were out of sight of that evil isle and how st brendan bade them strengthen themselves in faith and spiritual arms for they were now on the confines of hell therefore they must watch and play the man  all this must needs be hastened over that we may come to the famous legend of judas iscariot  they saw a great and high mountain toward the north with smoke about its peak  and the wind blew them close under the cliffs which were of immense height so that they could hardly see their top upright as walls and black as coal 270  then he who remained of the three brethren who had followed st brendan sprang out of the ship and waded to the cliff foot groaning and crying woe to me father for i am carried away from you and cannot turn back  then the brethren backed the ship and cried to the lord for mercy  but the blessed father brendan saw how that wretch was carried off by a multitude of devils and all on fire among them then a fair wind blew them away southward and when they looked back they saw the peak of the isle uncovered and flame spouting from it up to heaven and sinking back again till the whole mountain seemed one burning pile  after that terrible vision they sailed seven days to the south till father brendan saw a dense cloud when they neared it a form as of a man sitting and before him a veil as big as a sack hanging between two iron tongs and rocking on the waves like a boat in a whirlwind  which when the brethren saw some thought was a bird and some a boat but the man of god bade them give over arguing and row thither  and when they got near the waves were still as if they had been frozen and they found a man sitting on a rough and shapeless rock and the waves beating over his head and when they fell back the bare rock appeared on which that wretch was sitting and the cloth which hung before him the wind moved and beat him with it on the eyes and brow  but when the blessed man asked him who he was and how he had earned that doom he said i am that most wretched judas who made the worst of all bargains  but i hold not this place for any merit of my own but for the ineffable mercy of christ  i expect no place of repentance  but for the indulgence and mercy of the redeemer of the world and for the honour of his holy resurrection i have this refreshment for it is the lordsday now and as i sit here i seem to myself in a paradise of delight by reason of the pains which will be mine this evening for when i am in my pains i burn day and night like lead melted in a pot  but in the midst of that mountain which you saw is leviathan with his satellites and i was there when he swallowed your brother and therefore the king of hell rejoiced and sent forth huge flames as he doth always when he devours the souls of the impious  then he told them how he had his refreshings there every lordsday from even to even and from christmas to epiphany and from easter to pentecost and from the purification of the blessed virgin to her assumption  but the rest of his time he was tormented with herod and pilate annas and caiaphas and so adjured them to intercede for him with the lord that he might be there at least till sunrise in the morn  to whom the man of god said the will of the lord be done  thou shalt not be carried off by the daemons till tomorrow then he asked him of that clothing and he told how he had given it to a leper when he was the lords chamberlain but because it was no more mine than it was the lords and the other brethrens therefore it is of no comfort to me but rather a hurt  and these forks i gave to the priests to hang their caldrons on  and this stone on which i always sit i took off the road and threw it into a ditch for a steppingstone before i was a disciple of the lord 272  but when the evening hour had covered the face of thetis behold a multitude of daemons shouting in a ring and bidding the man of god depart for else they could not approach and they dared not behold their princes face unless they brought back their prey  but the man of god bade them depart  and in the morning an infinite multitude of devils covered the face of the abyss and cursed the man of god for coming thither for their prince had scourged them cruelly that night for not bringing back the captive  but the man of god returned their curses on their own heads saying that cursed was he whom they blest and blessed he whom they cursed and when they threatened judas with double torments because he had not come back the man of god rebuked them  art thou then lord of all they asked that we should obey thee  i am the servant said he of the lord of all and whatsoever i command in his name is done and i have no ministry save what he concedes to me  so they blasphemed him till he left judas and then returned and carried off that wretched soul with great rushing and howling  after which they saw a little isle and the holy man told them that now seven years were nigh past and that in that isle they should soon see a hermit named paul the spiritual who had lived for sixty years without any corporeal food but for thirty years before that he had received food from a certain beast  the isle was very small about a furlong round a bare rock so steep that they could find no landingplace  but at last they found a creek into which they thrust the boats bow and then discovered a very difficult ascent  up that the man of god climbed bidding them wait for him for they must not enter the isle without the hermits leave and when he came to the top he saw two caves with their mouths opposite each other and a very small round well before the cave mouth whose waters as fast as they ran out were sucked in again by the rock 274  as he went to one entrance the old man came out of the other saying behold how good and pleasant it is brethren to dwell together in unity and bade him call up the brethren from the boat and when they came he kissed them and called them each by his name  whereat they marvelled not only at his spirit of prophecy but also at his attire for he was all covered with his locks and beard and with the other hair of his body down to his feet  his hair was white as snow for age and none other covering had he  when st brendan saw that he sighed again and again and said within himself woe is me sinner that i am who wear a monks habit and have many monks under me when i see a man of angelic dignity sitting in a cell still in the flesh and unhurt by the vices of the flesh  to whom the man of god answered venerable father what great and many wonders god hath showed thee which he hath manifested to none of the fathers and thou sayest in thy heart that thou art not worthy to wear a monks habit  i tell thee father that thou art greater than a monk for a monk is fed and clothed by the work of his own hands  but god has fed and clothed thee and thy family for seven years with his secret things while wretched i sit here on this rock like a bird naked save the hair of my body  then st brendan asked him how and whence he came thither and he told how he was nourished in st patricks monastery for fifty years and took care of the cemetery and how when the dean had bidden him dig a grave an old man whom he knew not appeared to him and forbade him for that grave was another mans  and how he revealed to him that he was st patrick his own abbot who had died the day before and bade him bury that brother elsewhere and go down to the sea and find a boat which would take him to the place where he should wait for the day of his death and how he landed on that rock and thrust the boat off with his foot and it went swiftly back to its own land and how on the very first day a beast came to him walking on its hind paws and between its fore paws a fish and grass to make a fire and laid them at his feet and so every third day for twenty years and every lords day a little water came out of the rock so that he could drink and wash his hands and how after thirty years he had found these caves and that fountain and had fed for the last sixty years on nought but the water thereof  for all the years of his life were 150 and henceforth he awaited the day of his judgment in that his flesh  then they took of that water and received his blessing and kissed each other in the peace of christ and sailed southward  but their food was the water from the isle of the man of god  then as paul the hermit had foretold they came back on easter eve to the isle of sheep and to him who used to give them victuals and then went on to the fish jasconius and sang praises on his back all night and mass at morn  after which the fish carried them on his back to the paradise of birds and there they stayed till pentecost  then the man who always tended them bade them fill their skins from the fountain and he would lead them to the land promised to the saints and all the birds wished them a prosperous voyage in gods name and they sailed away with forty days provision the man being their guide till after forty days they came at evening to a great darkness which lay round the promised land  but after they had sailed through it for an hour a great light shone round them and the boat stopped at a shore  and when they landed they saw a spacious land full of trees bearing fruit as in autumn time  and they walked about that land for forty days eating of the fruit and drinking of the fountains and found no end thereof  and there was no night there but the light shone like the light of the sun  at last they came to a great river which they could not cross so that they could not find out the extent of that land  and as they were pondering over this a youth with shining face and fair to look upon met them and kissed them with great joy calling them each by his name and said brethren peace be with you and with all that follow the peace of christ  and after that blessed are they who dwell in thy house o lord they shall be for ever praising thee  then he told st brendan that that was the land which he had been seeking for seven years and that he must now return to his own country taking of the fruits of that land and of its precious gems as much as his ship could carry for the days of his departure were at hand when he should sleep in peace with his holy brethren but after many days that land should be revealed to his successors and should be a refuge for christians in persecution  as for the river that they saw it parted that island and the light shone there for ever because christ was the light thereof  then st brendan asked if that land would ever be revealed to men and the youth answered that when the most high creator should have put all nations under his feet then that land should be manifested to all his elect  after which st brendan when the youth had blessed him took of the fruits and of the gems and sailed back through the darkness and returned to his monastery whom when the brethren saw they glorified god for the miracles which he had heard and seen  after which he ended his life in peace  amen  here ends says the french version concerning st brendan and the marvels which he found in the sea of ireland    st malo    intermingled fantastically and inconsistently with the story of st brendan is that of st maclovius or machutus who has given his name to the seaport of st malo in brittany  his life written by sigebert a monk of gembloux about the year 1100 tells us how he was a breton who sailed with st brendan in search of the fairest of all islands in which the citizens of heaven were said to dwell with st brendan st malo celebrated easter on the whales back and with st brendan he returned  but another old hagiographer johannes a bosco tells a different story making st malo an irishman brought up by st brendan and preserved by his prayers from a wave of the sea  he gives moreover to the isle of paradise the name of inga and says that st brendan and his companions never reached it after all but came home after sailing round the orkneys and other northern isles  the fact is that the same saints reappear so often on both sides of the british and the irish channels that we must take the existence of many of them as mere legend which has been carried from land to land by monks in their migrations and taken root upon each fresh soil which it has reached  one incident in st malos voyage is so fantastic and so grand likewise that it must not be omitted  the monks come to an island whereon they find the barrow of some giant of old time  st malo seized with pity for the lost soul of the heathen opens the mound and raises the dead to life  then follows a strange conversation between the giant and the saint  he was slain he says by his kinsmen and ever since has been tormented in the other world  in that nether pit they know he says of the holy trinity but that knowledge is rather harm than gain to them because they did not choose to know it when alive on earth  therefore he begs to be baptized and so delivered from his pain  he is therefore instructed catechised and in due time baptized and admitted to the holy communion  for fifteen days more he remains alive  and then dying once more is again placed in his sepulchre and left in peace  from fragmentary recollections of such tales as these it may be observed in passing may have sprung the strange fancy of the modern cornishmen which identifies these very celtic saints of their own race with the giants who according to geoffrey of monmouth inhabited the land before brutus and his trojans founded the arthuric dynasty  st just for instance who is one of the guardian saints of the lands end and st kevern one of the guardian saints of the lizard are both giants and cornishmen a few years since would tell how st just came from his hermitage by cape cornwall to visit st kevern in his cave on the east side of goonhilly downs and how they took the holy communion together and how st just tempted by the beauty of st keverns paten and chalice arose in the night and fled away with the holy vessels wading first the looe pool and then mounts bay itself and how st kevern pursued him and hurled after him three great boulders of porphyry two of which lie on the slates and granites to this day till st just terrified at the might of his saintly brother tossed the stolen vessels ashore opposite st michaels mount and fleeing back to his own hermitage never appeared again in the neighbourhood of st kevern  but to return  st malo coming home with st brendan craves for peace and solitude and the hermits cell and goes down to the seashore to find a vessel which may carry him out once more into the infinite unknown  then there comes by a boat with no one in it but a little boy who takes him on board and carries him to the isle of the hermit aaron near the town of aletha which men call st malo now and then the little boy vanishes away and st malo knows that he was christ himself  there he lives with aaron till the bretons of the neighbourhood make him their bishop  he converts the idolaters around and performs the usual miracles of hermit saints  he changes water into wine and restores to life not only a dead man but a dead sow likewise over whose motherless litter a wretched slave who has by accident killed the sow with a stone is weeping and wringing his hands in dread of his masters fury  while st malo is pruning vines he lays his cape upon the ground and a redbreast comes and lays an egg on it  he leaves it there for the birds sake till the young are hatched knowing says his biographer that without god the father not a sparrow falls to the ground  hailoch the prince of brittany destroys his church and is struck blind  restored to sight by the saint he bestows large lands on the church  the impious generation who with their children after them have lost their property by hailochs gift rise against st malo  they steal his horses and in mockery leave him only a mare  they beat his baker tie his feet under the horses body and leave him on the sand to be drowned by the rising tide  the sea by a miracle stops a mile off and the baker is saved  st malo weary of the wicked bretons flees to saintonge in aquitaine where he performs yet more miracles  meanwhile a dire famine falls on the bretons and a thousand horrible diseases penitent they send for st malo who delivers them and their flocks  but at the command of an angel he returns to saintonge and dies there and saintonge has his relics and the innumerable miracles which they work even to the days of sigebert of gembloux   st columba    the famous st columba cannot perhaps be numbered among the hermits but as the spiritual father of many hermits as well as many monks and as one whose influence upon the christianity of these islands is notorious and extensive he must needs have some notice in these pages  those who wish to study his life and works at length will of course read dr reevess invaluable edition of adamnan  the more general reader will find all that he need know in mr hill burtons excellent history of scotland chapters vii and viii and also in mr maclears history of christian missions during the middle agesa book which should be in every sunday library  st columba like st david and st cadoc of wales and like many great irish saints is a prince and a statesman as well as a monk he is mixed up in quarrels between rival tribes  he is concerned according to antiquaries in three great battles one of which sprang according to some from columbas own misdeeds  he copies by stealth the psalter of st finnian  st finnian demands the copy saying it was his as much as the original  the matter is referred to king dermod who pronounces in high court at tara the famous decision which has become a proverb in ireland that to every cow belongs her own calf 283  st columba who does not seem at this time to have possessed the dovelike temper which his name according to his disciples indicates threatens to avenge upon the king his unjust decision  the son of the kings steward and the son of the king of connaught a hostage at dermods court are playing hurley on the green before dermods palace  the young prince strikes the other boy kills him and flies for protection to columba  he is nevertheless dragged away and slain upon the spot columba leaves the palace in a rage goes to his native mountains of donegal and returns at the head of an army of northern and western irish to fight the great battle of cooldrevny in sligo  but after a while public opinion turns against him and at the synod of teltown in meath it is proclaimed that columba the man of blood shall quit ireland and win for christ out of heathendom as many souls as have perished in that great fight  then columba with twelve comrades sails in a coracle for the coast of argyleshire and on the eve of pentecost ad 563 lands upon that island which it may be will be famous to all times as iona hy or icolumkillhy of columb of the cells  thus had columba if the tale be true undertaken a noble penance and he performed it like a noble man  if according to the fashion of those times he bewailed his sins with tears he was no morbid or selfish recluse but a man of practical power and of wide humanity like one of homers old heroes st columba could turn his hand to every kind of work  he could turn the handmill work on the farm heal the sick and command as a practised sailor the little fleet of coracles which lay hauled up on the strand of iona ready to carry him and his monks on their missionary voyages to the mainland or the isles  tall powerful handsome with a face which as adamnan said made all who saw him glad and a voice so stentorian that it could be heard at times a full mile off and coming too of royal race it is no wonder if he was regarded as a sort of demigod not only by his own monks but by the pictish chiefs to whom he preached the cross  we hear of him at craig phadrick near inverness at skye at tiree and other islands we hear of him receiving visits from his old monks of derry and durrow returning to ireland to decide between rival chiefs and at last dying at the age of seventyseven kneeling before the altar in his little chapel of ionaa death as beautiful as had been the last thirtyfour years of his life and leaving behind him disciples destined to spread the light of christianity over the whole of scotland and the northern parts of england  st columba at one period or other of his life is said to have visited a missionary hermit whose name still lingers in scotland as st kentigern or more commonly st mungo the patron saint of glasgow  the two men it is said but the story belongs to the twelfth century and can hardly be depended on exchanged their crooked staves or crosiers in token of christian brotherhood and that which st columba is said to have given to st kentigern was preserved in ripon cathedral to the beginning of the fifteenth century  but who st kentigern was or what he really did is hard to say for all his legends like most of these early ones are as tangled as a dream  he dies in the year 601  and yet he is the disciple of the famous st servanus or st serf who lived in the times of st palladius and st patrick 180 years before  this st serf is a hermit of the true old type and even if his story be as dr reeves thinks a fabrication throughout it is at least a very early one and true to the ideal which had originated with st antony  he is brought up in a monastery at culross  he is tempted by the devil in a cave in the parish of dysart the desert in fifeshire which still retains that name  the daemon fleeing from him enters an unfortunate man who is forthwith plagued with a wolfish appetite  st serf cures him by putting his thumb into his mouth  a man is accused of stealing and eating a lamb and denies the theft  st serf however makes the lamb bleat in the robbers stomach and so substantiates the charge beyond all doubt  he works other wonders among them the slaying of a great dragon in the place called dunyne sails for the orkneys and converts the people there and vanishes thenceforth into the dreamland from which he sprung  two great disciples he has st ternan and st kentigern mystery and miracle hang round the boyhood of the latter  his father is unknown  his mother is condemned to be cast from the rock of dunpelder but is saved and absolved by a miracle  before the eyes of the astonished picts she floats gently down through the air and arrives at the cliff foot unhurt  st kentigern is thenceforth believed to be virginborn and is reverenced as a miraculous being from his infancy  he goes to school to the mythic st serf who calls him mungo or the beloved which name he bears in glasgow until this day  his fellowscholars envy his virtue and learning and try to ruin him with their master  st serf has a pet robin which is wont to sit and sing upon his shoulder  the boys pull off its head and lay the blame upon kentigern  the saint comes in wrathful tawse in hand and kentigern is for the moment in serious danger but equal to the occasion then as afterwards he puts the robins head on again sets it singing and amply vindicates his innocence  to this day the robin figures in the arms of the good city of glasgow with the tree which st kentigern when his enemies had put out his fire brought in from the frozen forest and lighted with his breath and the salmon in whose mouth a ring which had been cast into the clyde had been found again by st kentigerns prophetic spirit  the envy of his fellowscholars however is too much for st kentigerns peace of mind  he wanders away to the spot where glasgow city now stands lives in a rock hollowed out into a tomb is ordained by an irish bishop according to a celtic custom of which antiquaries have written learnedly and dubiously likewise and has ecclesiastical authority over all the picts from the frith of forth to the roman wall  but all these stories as i said before are tangled as a dream for the twelfth century monks in their loyal devotion to the see of rome are apt to introduce again and again ecclesiastical customs which belonged to their own time and try to represent these primaeval saints as regular and well disciplined servants of the pope  it may be remarked that st serf is said to have come into a dysart or desert  so did many monks of the school of st columba and his disciples who wished for a severer and a more meditative life than could be found in the busy society of a convent  there was a disert says dr reeves for such men to retire to besides the monastery of derry and another at iona itself situate near the shore in the low ground north of the cathedral as may be inferred from portandisiart the name of a little bay in this situation  a similar disert or collection of hermit cells was endowed at cashel in 1101 and a disert columkill with two townland mills and a vegetable garden was endowed at kells at a somewhat earlier period for the use of devout pilgrims as those were called who left the society of men to worship god in solitude  the venerable bede speaks of as many as three personages saxons by their names who in the isle of ireland led the pilgrim or anchoritic life to obtain a country in heaven and tells of a drycthelm of the monastery at melrose who went into a secret dwelling therein to give himself more utterly to prayer and who used to stand for hours in the cold waters of the tweed as st godric did centuries afterwards in those of the wear  solitaries recluses are met with again and again in these old records who more than once became abbots of iona itself  but there is no need to linger on over instances which are only quoted to show that some of the noblest spirits of the celtic church kept up wherever they could the hermits ideal the longing for solitude for passive contemplation for silence and perpetual prayer which they had inherited from st antony and the fathers of the egyptian desert  the same ideal was carried by them over the border into england off its extreme northern coast for instance nearly halfway between berwick and bamborough castle lies as travellers northward may have seen for themselves the holy island called in old times lindisfarne  a monks chapel on that island was the mother of all the churches between tyne and tweed as well as of many between tyne and humber  the northumbrians had been nominally converted according to bede ad 627 under their king edwin by paulinus one of the roman monks who had followed in the steps of st augustine the apostle of kent  evil times had fallen on them penda at the head of the idolatrous mercians the people of mid england and ceadwalla at the head of the western britons had ravaged the country north of tweed with savage cruelty slain king edwin at hatfield near doncaster and exterminated christianity while paulinus had fled to kent and become bishop of rochester the invaders had been driven out seemingly by oswald who knew enough of christianity to set up ere he engaged the enemy a cross of wood on the heavenfield near hexham  that cross stood till the time of bede some 150 years after and had become like moses brazen serpent an object of veneration  for if chips cut off from it were put into water that water cured men or cattle of their diseases  oswald believing that it was through the mercy of him whom that cross symbolized he had conquered the mercians and the britons would needs reconvert his people to the true faith  he had been in exile during edwins lifetime among the scots and had learned from them something of christianity  so out of iona a monk was sent to him aidan by name to be a bishop over the northumbrians and he settled himself upon the isle of lindisfarne and began to convert it into another iona  a man he was says bede of singular sweetness piety and moderation zealous in the cause of god though not altogether according to knowledge for he was wont to keep easter after the fashion of his country ie of the picts and northern scots    from that time forth many scots came daily into britain and with great devotion preached the word to these provinces of the english over whom king oswald reigned    churches were built money and lands were given of the kings bounty to build monasteries the english great and small were by their scottish masters instructed in the rules and observance of regular discipline for most of those who came to preach were monks 290  so says the venerable bede the monk of jarrow and the father as he has been well called of english history  he tells us too how aidan wishing it may be supposed for greater solitude went away and lived on the rocky isle of farne some two miles out at sea off bamborough castle and how when he saw penda and his mercians in a second invasion of northumbria trying to burn down the walls of bamboroughwhich were probably mere stockades of timberhe cried to god from off his rock to behold the mischief whereon the wind changed suddenly and blew the flames back on the besiegers discomfiting them and saving the town  bede tells us too how aidan wandered preaching from place to place haunting king oswalds court but owning nothing of his own save his church and a few fields about it and how when death came upon him they set up a tent for him close by the wall at the west end of the church so that it befell that he gave up the ghost leaning against a post which stood outside to strengthen the wall  a few years after penda came again and burned the village with the church and yet neither could that fire nor one which happened soon after destroy that post  wherefore the post was put inside the church as a holy thing and chips of it like those of the cross of heaven field healed many folk of their distempers     a tale at which we may look in two different humours  we may pass it by with a sneer and a hypothesis which will be probably true that the post was of old heartofoak which is burnt with extreme difficulty or we may pause a moment in reverence before the noble figure of the good old man ending a life of unselfish toil without a roof beneath which to lay his head penniless and comfortless in this world  but sure of his reward in the world to come  a few years after aidans death another hermit betook him to the rocks of farne who rose to far higher glory who became in fact the tutelar saint of the fierce northern men who was to them up to the time even of the tudor monarchs what pallas athene was to athens or diana to the ephesians  st cuthberts shrine in durham cathedral where his biographer bede also lay in honour was their rallying point not merely for ecclesiastical jurisdiction or for miraculous cures but for political movements  above his shrine rose the noble pile of durham  the bishop who ruled in his name was a count palatine and an almost independent prince  his sacred banner went out to battle before the northern levies or drove back again and again the flames which consumed the wooden houses of durham  his relics wrought innumerable miracles and often he himself appeared with long countenance ripened by abstinence his head sprinkled with grey hairs his casule of cloth of gold his mitre of glittering crystal his face brighter than the sun his eyes mild as the stars of heaven the gems upon his hand and robes rattling against his pastoral staff beset with pearls 292  thus glorious the demigod of the northern men appeared to his votaries and steered with his pastoral staff as with a rudder the sinking ship in safety to lindisfarne received from the hands of st brendan as from a saint of inferior powers the innocent yeoman laden with fetters whom he had delivered out of the dungeon of brancepeth and smiting asunder the massive norman walls led him into the forest and bade him flee to sanctuary in durham and be safe or visited the little timber vineclad chapel of lixtune on the cheshire shore to heal the sick who watched all night before his altar or to forgive the lad who had robbed the nest which his sacred raven had built upon the roof and falling with the decayed timber had broken his bones and maimed his sacrilegious hand  originally says bede a monk at melrose and afterward abbot of the same place he used to wander weeks together out of his monastery seemingly into ettrick and the lammermuirs and preach in such villages as being seated high up among craggy uncouth mountains were frightful to others even to look at and whose poverty and barbarity rendered them inaccessible to other teachers  so skilful an orator was he so fond of enforcing his subject and such a brightness appeared in his angelic face that no man presumed to conceal from him the most hidden secrets of their hearts but all openly confessed what they had done  so he laboured for many years till his old abbot eata who had become bishop and abbot at lindisfarne sent for him thither and made him prior of the monks for several years  but at last he longed like so many before him for solitude  he considered so he said afterwards to the brethren that the life of the disciplined and obedient monk was higher than that of the lonely and independent hermit  but yet he longed to be alone longed it may be to recall at least upon some seagirt rock thoughts which had come to him in those long wanderings on the heather moors with no sound to distract him save the hum of the bee and the wail of the curlew and so he went away to that same rock of farne where aidan had taken refuge some ten or fifteen years before and there with the deep sea rolling at his feet and the gulls wailing about his head he built himself one of those picts houses the walls of which remain still in many parts of scotlanda circular hut of turf and rough stoneand dug out the interior to a depth of some feet and thatched it with sticks and grass and made it seems two rooms within one for an oratory one for a dwellingplace  and so lived alone and worshipped god  he grew his scanty crops of barley on the rock men said of course by miracle  he had tried wheat but as was to be expected it failed  he found men said of course by miracle a spring upon the rock  now and then brethren came to visit him  and what did man need more save a clear conscience and the presence of his creator  certainly not cuthbert when he asked the brethren to bring him a beam that he might prop up his cabin where the sea had eaten out the floor and when they forgot the commission the sea itself washed one up in the very cove where it was needed  when the choughs from the cliff stole his barley and the straw from the roof of his little hospice he had only to reprove them and they never offended again on one occasion indeed they atoned for their offence by bringing him a lump of suet wherewith he greased his shoes for many a day  we are not bound to believe this story it is one of many which hang about the memory of st cuthbert and which have sprung out of that love of the wild birds which may have grown up in the good man during his long wanderings through woods and over moors  he bequeathed so it was believed as a sacred legacy to the wildfowl of the farne islands st cuthberts peace above all to the eiderducks which swarmed there in his days but are now alas growing rarer and rarer from the intrusion of vulgar sportsmen who never heard st cuthberts name or learnt from him to spare gods creatures when they need them not  on farne in reginalds time they bred under your very bed got out of your way if you made a sign to them let you take up them or their young ones and nestled silently in your bosom and croaked joyfully with fluttering wings when stroked not to nature but to grace not to hereditary tendency but only to the piety and compassion of the blessed st cuthbert says reginald is so great a miracle to be ascribed  for the lord who made all things in heaven and earth has subjected them to the nod of his saints and prostrated them under the feet of obedience insufficient induction the cause of endless mistakes and therefore of endless follies and crimes kept reginald unaware of the now notorious fact that the female eider during the breeding season is just as tame allowing for a little exaggeration as st cuthberts own ducks are while the male eider is just as wild and wary as any other seabird  a mistake altogether excusable in one who had probably never seen or heard of eiderducks in any other spot  it may be nevertheless that st cuthberts special affection for the eider may have been called out by another strange and wellknown fact about them of which reginald oddly enough takes no note namely that they line their nests with down plucked from their own bosom thus realizing the fable which has made the pelican for so many centuries the type of the church  it is a question indeed whether the pelican which is always represented in mediaeval paintings and sculptures with a short bill instead of the enormous bill and pouch which is the especial mark of the onocrotalus of the ancients now miscalled pelican be not actually the eiderduck itself confounded with the true pelecanus which was the mediaeval and is still the scientific name of the cormorant  be that as it may ill befell any one who dare touch one of st cuthberts birds as was proved in the case of liveing servant to aelric who was a hermit in farne after the time of st cuthbert  for he tired it may be of barley and dried fish killed and ate an eiderduck in his masters absence scattering the bones and feathers over the cliffs but when the hermit came back what should he find but those same bones and feathers rolled into a lump and laid inside the door of the little chapel the very sea says reginald not having dared to swallow them up  whereby the hapless liveing being betrayed was soundly flogged and put on bread and water for many a day the which story liveing himself told to reginald  not only the eider but all birds in farne were protected by st cuthberts peace  bartholomew who was a famous hermit there in after years had a tame bird says the chronicler who ate from his hand and hopped about the table among him and his guests till some thought it a miracle and some finding no doubt the rocks of farne weary enough derived continual amusement from the bird  but when he one day went off to another island and left his bird to keep the house a hawk came in and ate it up  cuthbert who could not save the bird at least could punish the murderer  the hawk flew round and round the island imprisoned so it was thought by some mysterious power till terrified and worn out it flew into the chapel and lay cowering and half dead in a corner by the altar  bartholomew came back found his birds feathers and the tired hawk  but even the hawk must profit by st cuthberts peace he took it up carried it to the harbour and there bade it depart in st cuthberts name whereon it flew off free and was no more seen  such tales as these may be explained even to their most minute details by simply natural causes  and yet in this age of wanton destruction of wild birds one is tempted at moments to wish for the return of some such graceful and humane superstition which could keep down at least in the name of mercy and humanity the needless cruelty of man  but to return  after st cuthbert says bede had served god in the solitude of farne for many years the mound which encompassed his habitation being so high that he could see nothing from thence but heaven to which he so ardently aspired he was compelled by tears and entreatiesking egfrid himself coming to the island with bishops and religious and great mento become himself bishop in holy island  there as elsewhere he did his duty  but after two years he went again to farne knowing that his end was near  for when in his episcopal labours he had gone across to lugubaliaold penrith in cumberlandthere came across to him a holy hermit herebert by name who dwelt upon an island in derwentwater and talked with him a long while on heavenly things and cuthbert bade him ask him then all the questions which he wished to have resolved for they should see each other no more in this world  herebert who seems to have been one of his old friends fell at cuthberts feet and bade him remember that whenever he had done wrong he had submitted himself to him utterly and always tried to live according to his rules and all he wished for now was that as they had served god together upon earth they might depart for ever to see his bliss in heaven  the which befell for a few months afterwards that is on the 20th of march their souls quitted their mortal bodies on the same day and they were reunited in spirit  st cuthbert wished to have been buried on his rock in farne  but the brethren had persuaded him to allow his corpse to be removed to holy island  he begged them said bede should they be forced to leave that place to carry his bones along with them and so they were forced to do at last for in the year 875 whilst the danes were struggling with alfred in wessex an army of them with halfdene at their head went up into northumbria burning towns destroying churches tossing children on their pikepoints and committing all those horrors which made the norsemen terrible and infamous for so many years  then the monks fled from the monastery bearing the shrine of st cuthbert and all their treasures and followed by their retainers men women and children and their sheep and oxen  and behold the hour of their flight was that of an exceedingly high spring tide  the danes were landing from their ships in their rear in their front was some two miles of sea escape seemed hopeless when says the legend the water retreated before the holy relics as they advanced and became as to the children of israel of old a wall on their right hand and on their left and so st cuthbert came safe to shore and wandered in the woods borne upon his servants shoulders and dwelling in tents for seven years and found rest at last in durham till at the reformation his shrine and that of the venerable bede were robbed of their gold and jewels and no trace of them as far as i know is left save that huge slab whereon is written the monkish rhyme   hic jacet in fossa bedae venerabilis ossa 299    st guthlac    hermits dwelling in the wilderness as far as i am aware were to be seen only in the northern and western parts of the island where not only did the forest afford concealment but the crags and caves shelter  the southern and eastern english seldom possess the vivid imagination of the briton the northumbrian and the scot while the rich lowlands of central southern and eastern england well peopled and well tilled offered few spots lonely enough for the hermits cell  one district only was desolate enough to attract those who wished to be free from the worldnamely the great fens north of cambridge and there accordingly as early as the seventh century hermits settled in morasses now so utterly transformed that it is difficult to restore in ones imagination the original scenery  the fens in the seventh century were probably very like the forests at the mouth of the mississippi or the swampy shores of the carolinas  their vast plain is now in summer one sea of golden corn in winter a black dreary fallow cut into squares by stagnant dykes and broken only by unsightly pumping mills and doleful lines of poplartrees  of old it was a labyrinth of black wandering streams broad lagoons morasses submerged every springtide vast beds of reed and sedge and fern vast copses of willow alder and grey poplar rooted in the floating peat which was swallowing up slowly alldevouring yet allpreserving the forests of fir and oak ash and poplar hazel and yew which had once grown on that low rank soil sinking slowly so geologists assure us beneath the sea from age to age  trees torn down by flood and storm floated and lodged in rafts damming the waters back upon the land streams bewildered in the flats changed their channels mingling silt and sand with the peat moss  nature left to herself ran into wild riot and chaos more and more till the whole fen became one dismal swamp in which at the time of the norman conquest the last of the english like dred in mrs stowes tale took refuge from their tyrants and lived like him a free and joyous life awhile  for there are islands in the sea which have escaped the destroying deluge of peatmossoutcrops of firm and fertile land which in the early middle age were so many natural parks covered with richest grass and stateliest trees swarming with deer and roe goat and boar as the streams around swarmed with otter and beaver and with fowl of every feather and fish of every scale  beautiful after their kind were those far isles in the eyes of the monks who were the first settlers in the wilderness  the author of the history of ramsey grows enthusiastic and somewhat bombastic also as he describes the lovely isle which got its name from the solitary ram who had wandered thither either in extreme drought or over the winter ice and never able to return was found feeding among the wild deer fat beyond the wont of rams  he tells of the stately ashes most of them cut in his time to furnish mighty beams for the church roof of the rich pastures painted with all gay flowers in spring of the green crown of reed and alder which encircled the isle of the fair wide mere now drained with its sandy beach along the forest side a delight he says to all who look thereon  in like humour william of malmesbury writing in the first half of the twelfth century speaks of thorney abbey and its isle  it represents says he a very paradise for that in pleasure and delight it resembles heaven itself  these marshes abound in trees whose length without a knot doth emulate the stars  the plain there is as level as the sea alluring the eye with its green grass and so smooth that there is nought to trip the foot of him who runs through it  neither is there any waste place for in some parts are apples in others vines which are either spread on the ground or raised on poles  a mutual strife there is between nature and art so that what one produces not the other supplies  what shall i say of those fair buildings which tis so wonderful to see the ground among those fens upbear  so wrote william of malmesbury after the industry and wisdom of the monks for more than four centuries had been at work to civilize and cultivate the wilderness  yet even then there was another side to the picture and thorney ramsey or crowland would have seemed for nine months every year sad places enough to us comfortable folk of the nineteenth century  but men lived hard in those days even the most highborn and luxurious nobles and ladies under dark skies in houses which we should think from darkness draught and want of space unfit for felons cells  hardly they lived and easily were they pleased and thanked god for the least gleam of sunshine the least patch of green after the terrible and long winters of the middle ages  and ugly enough those winters must have been what with snow and darkness flood and ice ague and rheumatism while through the dreary winters night the whistle of the wind and the wild cries of the waterfowl were translated into the howls of witches and daemons and as in st guthlacs case the delirious fancies of marsh fever made those fiends take hideous shapes before the inner eye and act fantastic horrors round the fenmans bed of sedge  concerning this st guthlac full details remain both in latin and anglosaxon the author of the original document professing to be one felix a monk of ramsey near by who wrote possibly as early as the eighth century 303  there we may read how the young warriornoble guthlac the battle play the sport of war tired of slaying and sinning bethought him to fulfil the prodigies seen at his birth how he wandered into the fen where one tatwin who after became a saint likewise took him in his canoe to a spot so lonely as to be almost unknown buried in reeds and alders and how he found among the trees nought but an old law as the scots still call a mound which men of old had broken into seeking for treasure and a little pond and how he built himself a hermits cell thereon and saw visions and wrought miracles and how men came to him as to a fakir or shaman of the east notably one beccel who acted as his servant and how as beccel was shaving the saint one day there fell on him a great temptation  why should he not cut st guthlacs throat and instal himself in his cell that he might have the honour and glory of sainthood  but st guthlac perceived the inward temptation which is told with the naive honesty of those halfsavage times and rebuked the offender into confession and all went well to the end  there we may read too a detailed account of the fauna now happily extinct in the fens of the creatures who used to hale st guthlac out of his hut drag him through the bogs carry him aloft through frost and firedevelen and luther gostessuch as tormented in like wise st botolph from whom botulfston  boston has its name and who were supposed to haunt the meres and fens and to have an especial fondness for old heathen barrows with their fancied treasurehoards  how they filled the house with their coming and poured in on every side from above and from beneath and everywhere  they were in countenance horrible and they had great heads and a long neck and a lean visage they were filthy and squalid in their beards and they had rough ears and crooked nebs and fierce eyes and foul mouths and their teeth were like horses tusks and their throats were filled with flame and they were grating in their voice they had crooked shanks and knees big and great behind and distorted toes and cried hoarsely with their voices and they came with immoderate noise and immense horror that he thought that all between heaven and earth resounded with their voices     and they tugged and led him out of the cot and led him to the swart fen and threw and sunk him in the muddy waters after that they brought him into the wild places of the wilderness among the thick beds of brambles that all his body was torn    after that they took him and beat him with iron whips and after that they brought him on their creaking wings between the cold regions of the air  but there are gentler and more human touches in that old legend you may read in it how all the wild birds of the fen came to st guthlac and he fed them after their kind how the ravens tormented him stealing letters gloves and what not from his visitors and then seized with compunction at his reproofs brought them back or hanged them on the reeds and how as wilfrid a holy visitant was sitting with him discoursing of the contemplative life two swallows came flying in and lifted up their song sitting now on the saints hand now on his shoulder now on his knee and how when wilfrid wondered thereat guthlac made answer know you not that he who hath led his life according to gods will to him the wild beasts and the wild birds draw the more near  after fifteen years of such a life in fever ague and starvation no wonder if st guthlac died  they buried him in a leaden coffin a grand and expensive luxury in the seventh century which had been sent to him during his life by a saxon princess and then over his sacred and wonderworking corpse as over that of a buddhist saint there arose a chapel with a community of monks companies of pilgrims who came to worship sick who came to be healed till at last founded on great piles driven into the bog arose the lofty wooden abbey of crowland in sanctuary of the four rivers with its dykes parks vineyards orchards rich ploughlands from which in time of famine the monks of crowland fed all people of the neighbouring fens with its tower with seven bells which had not their like in england its twelve altars rich with the gifts of danish vikings and princes and even with twelve white bearskins the gift of canutes self while all around were the cottages of the corrodiers or folk who for a corrody or life pittance from the abbey had given away their lands to the wrong and detriment of their heirs  but within those four rivers at least were neither tyranny nor slavery  those who took refuge in st guthlacs place from cruel lords must keep his peace toward each other and earn their living like honest men safe while they so did  for between those four rivers st guthlac and his abbot were the only lords and neither summoner nor sheriff of the king nor armed force of knight or earl could enterthe inheritance of the lord the soil of st mary and st bartholomew the most holy sanctuary of st guthlac and his monks the minister free from worldly servitude the special almshouse of most illustrious kings the sole refuge of any one in worldly tribulation the perpetual abode of the saints the possession of religious men specially set apart by the common council of the realm by reason of the frequent miracles of the holy confessor st guthlac an everfruitful mother of camphire in the vineyards of engedi and by reason of the privileges granted by the kings a city of grace and safety to all who repent  does not all this sound like a voice from another planet  it is all gone and it was good and right that it should go when it had done its work and that the civilization of the fen should be taken up and carried out by men like the good knight richard of rulos who two generations after the conquest marrying herewards grand daughter and becoming lord of deeping the deep meadow thought that he could do the same work from the hall of bourne as the monks did from their cloisters got permission from the crowland monks for twenty marks of silver to drain as much as he could of the common marshes and then shut out the welland by strong dykes built cottages marked out gardens and tilled fields till out of slough and bogs accursed he made a garden of pleasure  yet one lasting work those monks of crowland seem to have done besides those firm dykes and rich cornlands of the porsand which endure unto this day  for within two generations of the norman conquest while the old wooden abbey destroyed by fire was being replaced by that noble pile of stone whose ruins are still standing the french abbot of crowland so runs the legend sent french monks to open a school under the new french donjon in the little roman town of grantebrigge wherebyso does all earnest work however mistaken grow and spread in this world infinitely and for ever st guthlac by his canoevoyage into crowland island became the spiritual father of the university of cambridge in the old world and therefore of her noble daughter the university of cambridge in the new world which fenmen sailing from boston deeps colonized and christianized 800 years after st guthlacs death    st godric of finchale    a personage quite as interesting though not as famous as cuthbert or guthlac is st godric the hermit around whose cell rose the priory of finchale  in a loop of the river wear near durham there settled in the days of bishop flambard between 1099 and 1128 a man whose parentage and history was for many years unknown to the good folks of the neighbourhood  he had come it seems from a hermitage in eskdale in the parish of whitby whence he had been driven by the percys lords of the soil  he had gone to durham become the doorkeeper of st giless church and gradually learnt by heart he was no scholar the whole psalter  then he had gone to st marys church where as was the fashion of the times there was a childrens school and listening to the little ones at their lessons picked up such hymns and prayers as he thought would suffice his spiritual wants  and then by leave of the bishop he had gone away into the woods and devoted himself to the solitary life in finchale  buried in the woods and crags of the royal park as it was then called which swarmed with every kind of game there was a little flat meadow rough with sweetgale and bramble and willow beside a teeming salmonpool  great wolves haunted the woods but godric cared nought for them and the shingles swarmed with snakesprobably only the harmless collared snakes of wet meadows but reputed as all snakes are by the vulgar venomous but he did not object to become the companion of serpents and poisonous asps  he handled them caressed them let them lie by the fire in swarms on winter nights in the little cave which he had hollowed in the ground and thatched with turf  men told soon how the snakes obeyed him how two especially huge ones used to lie twined about his legs till after many years annoyed by their importunity he turned them all gently out of doors with solemn adjurations never to return and they of course obeyed  his austerities knew no bounds  he lived on roots and berries flowers and leaves and when the good folk found him out and put gifts of food near his cell he carried them up to the crags above and offering them solemnly up to the god who feeds the ravens when they call on him left them there for the wild birds  he watched fasted and scourged himself and wore always a hair shirt and an iron cuirass  he sat night after night even in midwinter in the cold wear the waters of which had hollowed out a rock near by into a natural bath and afterwards in a barrel sunk in the floor of a little chapel of wattle which he built and dedicated to the blessed virgin mary  he tilled a scrap of ground and ate the grain from it mingled with ashes  he kept his food till it was decayed before he tasted it and led a life the records of which fill the reader with astonishment not only at the mans iron strength of will but at the iron strength of the constitution which could support such hardships in such a climate for a single year  a strong and healthy man must godric have been to judge from the accounts there are two both written by eyewitnesses of his personal appearancea man of great breadth of chest and strength of arm blackhaired hooknosed deepbrowed with flashing grey eyes altogether a personable and able man who might have done much work and made his way in many lands  but what his former life had been he would not tell  motherwit he had in plenty and showed insight into men and things which the monks of durham were ready enough to call the spirit of prophecy  after awhile it was whispered that he wrought miraculous cures  that even a bit of the bread which he was wont to eat had healed a sick woman that he fought with daemons in visible shape that he had seen just as one of the old egyptian hermits had seen a little black boy running about between two monks who had quarrelled and come to hard blows and bleeding faces because one of them had made mistakes in the evening service  and in short there were attributed to him during his lifetime and by those who knew him well a host of wonders which would be startling and important were they not exactly the same as those which appear in the life of every hermit since st antony  it is impossible to read the pages of reginald of durham for he the biographer of st cuthbert is also the biographer of st godric without feeling how difficult it is to obtain anything like the truth even from eye witnesses if only men are as they were in those days in a state of religious excitement at a period of spiritual revivals  the ignorant populace were ready to believe and to report anything of the fakeer of finchale  the monks of durham were glad enough to have a wonderworking man belonging to them for ralph flambard in honour of godric had made over to them the hermitage of finchale with its fields and fisheries  the lad who in after years waited on the hermit would have been ready enough to testify that his master saw daemons and other spiritual beings for he began to see them on his own account 312 fell asleep in the forest coming home from durham with some bottles was led in a vision by st john the baptist to the top of a hill and shown by him wonders unspeakable saw on another occasion a daemon in st godrics cell hung all over with bottles of different liquors offering them to the saint who bade the lad drive him out of the little chapel with a holy water sprinkle but not go outside it himself  but the lad in the fury of successful pursuit overstepped the threshold whereon the daemon turning in selfdefence threw a single drop of one of his liquors into the lads mouth and vanished with a laugh of scorn the boys face and throat swelled horribly for three days and he took care thenceforth to obey the holy man more strictly  a story which i have repeated like the one before it only to show the real worth of the evidence on which reginald has composed his book ailred abbot of rievaux for reginalds book though dedicated to hugh pudsey his bishop was prompted by ailred was capable as his horrible story of the nun of watton proves of believing anything and everything which fell in with his fanatical though pious and gentle temper  and here a few words must be said to persons with whose difficulties i deeply sympathise but from whose conclusions i differ utterly those namely who say that if we reject the miracles of these saints lives we must reject also the miracles of the new testament  the answer is as i believe that the apostles and evangelists were sane men  men in their right minds wise calm conducting themselves save in the matter of committing sins like other human beings as befitted the disciples of that son of man who came eating and drinking and was therefore called by the ascetics of his time a gluttonous man and a winebibber  whereas these monks were not as i have said elsewhere in their right minds at all  this is or ought to be patent to any one who will compare the style of the apostles and evangelists with that of the monkish hagiologists  the calm the simplicity the brevity the true grandeur of the former is sufficient evidence of their healthy mindedness and their trustworthiness  the affectation the self consciousness the bombast the false grandeur of the latter is sufficient evidence that they are neither healthyminded or trustworthy  let students compare any passage of st luke or st john however surprising the miracle which it relates with st jeromes life of paul the first hermit or with that famous letter of his to eustochium which although historically important is unfit for the eyes of pureminded readers and does not appear in this volume and let them judge for themselves  let them compare again the opening sentences of the four gospels or of the acts of the apostles with the words with which reginald begins this life of st godric  by the touch of the holy spirits finger the chord of the harmonic human heart resounds melodiously  for when the vein of the heart is touched by the grace of the holy spirit forthwith by the permirific sweetness of the harmony an exceeding operation of sacred virtue is perceived more manifestly to spring forth  with this sweetness of spirit godric the man of god was filled from the very time of his boyhood and grew famous for many admirable works of holy work sic because the harmonic teaching of the holy spirit fired the secrets of his very bosom with a wondrous contact of spiritual graceand let them say after the comparison if the difference between the two styles is not that which exists between one of gods lilies fresh from the field and a tawdry bunch of artificial flowers  but to return  godric himself took part in the history of his own miracles and life  it may be that he so overworked his brain that he believed that he was visited by st peter and taught a hymn by the blessed virgin mary and that he had taken part in a hundred other prodigies but the prologue to the harleian manuscript which the learned editor mr stevenson believes to be an early edition of reginalds own composition confesses that reginald compelled by ailred of rievaux tried in vain for a long while to get the hermits story from him  you wish to write my life he said  know then that godrics life is such as thisgodric at first a gross rustic an unclean liver an usurer a cheat a perjurer a flatterer a wanderer pilfering and greedy now a dead flea a decayed dog a vile worm not a hermit but a hypocrite not a solitary but a gadabout in mind a devourer of alms dainty over good things greedy and negligent lazy and snoring ambitious and prodigal one who is not worthy to serve others and yet every day beats and scolds those who serve him  this and worse than this you may write of godric  then he was silent as one indignant says reginald and i went off in some confusion and the grand old man was left to himself and to his god  the ecclesiastical boswell dared not mention the subject again to his hero for several years though he came after from durham to visit him and celebrate mass for him in his little chapel  after some years however he approached the matter again and whether a pardonable vanity had crept over godric or whether he had begun at last to believe in his miracles or whether the old man had that upon his mind of which he longed to unburthen himself he began to answer questions and reginald delighted to listen and note down till he had finished he says that book of his life and miracles 316 and after a while brought it to the saint and falling on his knees begged him to bless in the name of god and for the benefit of the faithful the deeds of a certain religious man who had suffered much for god in this life which he reginald had composed accurately  the old man perceived that he himself was the subject blessed the book with solemn words what was written therein he does not seem to have read and bade reginald conceal it till his death warning him that a time would come when he should suffer rough and bitter things on account of that book from those who envied him that prophecy says reginald came to pass but how or why he does not tell  there may have been among those shrewd northumbrian heads even then incredulous men who used their common sense  but the story which godric told was wild and beautiful and though we must not depend too much on the accuracy of the old mans recollections or on the honesty of reginalds report who would naturally omit all incidents which made against his heros perfection it is worth listening to as a vivid sketch of the doings of a real human being in that misty distance of the early middle age  he was born he said at walpole in norfolk on the old roman sea bank between the wash and the deep fens  his fathers name was aeilward his mothers aedwenthe keeper of blessedness and the friend of blessedness as reginald translates thempoor and pious folk and being a sharp boy he did not take to fieldwork but preferred wandering the fens as a pedlar first round the villages then as he grew older to castles and to towns buying and sellingwhat reginald does not tell us  but we should be glad to know  one day he had a great deliverance which reginald thinks a miracle wandering along the great tideflats near spalding and the old well stream in search of waifs and strays of wreck or eatables he saw three porpoises stranded far out upon the banks  two were alive and the boy took pity on them so he said and let them be  but one was dead and off it in those days poor folks ate anything he cut as much flesh and blubber as he could carry and toiled back towards the hightide mark  but whether he lost his way among the banks or whether he delayed too long the tide came in on him up to his knees his waist his chin and at last at times over his head the boy made the sign of the cross as all men in danger did then and struggled on valiantly a full mile through the sea like a brave lad never loosening his hold of his precious porpoisemeat till he reached the shore at the very spot from which he had set out  as he grew his pedlar journeys became longer  repeating to himself as he walked the creeds and the lords prayerhis only lorehe walked for four years through lindsey then went to st andrews in scotland after that for the first time to rome  then the love of a wandering sea life came on him and he sailed with his wares round the east coasts not merely as a pedlar but as a sailor himself he went to denmark and to flanders buying and selling till he owned in what port we are not told but probably in lynn or wisbeach half one merchant ship and the quarter of another  a crafty steersman he was a wise weatherprophet a shipman stout in body and in heart probably such a one as chaucer tells us of 350 years after   a dagger hanging by a las hadde hee about his nekke under his arm adoun the hote summer hadde made his hewe al broun and certainly he was a good felaw full many a draught of wine he hadde draw from burdeaux ward while that the chapmen slepe of nice conscience took he no kepe if that he fought and hadde the higher hand by water he sent hem home to every land but of his craft to recken wel his tides his stremes and his strandes him besides his herberwe his mone and his lode manage there was none swiche from hull unto carthage hardy he was and wise i undertake with many a tempest hadde his berd be shake he knew wel alle the havens as they were from gotland to the cape de finisterre and every creke in bretagne and in spain   but gradually there grew on the stout merchantman the thought that there was something more to be done in the world than making money he became a pious man after the fashion of those days  he worshipped at the famous shrine of st andrew  he worshipped too at st cuthberts hermitage at farne and there he said afterwards he longed for the first time for the rest and solitude of the hermitage  he had been sixteen years a seaman now with a seamans temptationsit may be as he told reginald plainly with some of a seamans vices  he may have done things which lay heavy on his conscience  but it was getting time to think about his soul  he took the cross and went off to jerusalem as many a man did then under difficulties incredible dying too often on the way  but godric not only got safe thither but went out of his way home by spain to visit the sanctuary of st james of compostella a see which pope calixtus ii had just raised to metropolitan dignity  then he appears as steward to a rich man in the fens whose sons and young retainers after the lawless fashion of those anglonorman times rode out into the country round to steal the peasants sheep and cattle skin them on the spot and pass them off to the master of the house as venison taken in hunting  they ate and drank roystered and rioted like most other young normans and vexed the staid soul of godric whose nose told him plainly enough whenever he entered the kitchen that what was roasting had never come off a deer  in vain he protested and warned them getting only insults for his pains  at last he told his lord  the lord as was to be expected cared nought about the matter  let the lads rob the english villains  for what other end had their grandfathers conquered the land  godric punished himself as he could not punish them for the unwilling share which he had had in the wrong  it may be that he too had eaten of that stolen food  so away he went into france and down the rhone on pilgrimage to the hermitage of st giles the patron saint of the wild deer and then on to rome a second time and back to his poor parents in the fens  and now follows a strange and beautiful story  all love of seafaring and merchandise had left the deephearted sailor  the heavenly and the eternal the salvation of his sinful soul had become all in all to him and yet he could not rest in the little dreary village on the roman bank  he would go on pilgrimage again then his mother would go likewise and see st peters church and the pope and all the wonders of rome and have her share in all the spiritual blessings which were to be obtained so men thought then at rome alone  so off they set on foot and when they came to ford or ditch godric carried his mother on his back until they came to london town  and there aedwen took off her shoes and vowed out of devotion to the holy apostles peter and paul who so she thought would be well pleased at such an act to walk barefoot to rome and barefoot back again  now just as they went out of london on the dover road there met them in the way the loveliest maiden they had ever seen and asked to bear them company in their pilgrimage  and when they agreed she walked with them sat with them and talked with them with superhuman courtesy and grace and when they turned into an inn she ministered to them herself and washed and kissed their feet and then lay down with them to sleep after the simple fashion of those days  but a holy awe of her as of some saint and goddess fell on the wild seafarer and he never so he used to aver treated her for a moment save as a sister  never did either ask the other who they were and whence they came and godric reported but this was long after the event that no one of the company of pilgrims could see that fair maid save he and his mother alone  so they came safe to rome and back to london town and when they were at the place outside southwark where the fair maid had met them first she asked permission to leave them for she must go to her own land where she had a tabernacle of rest and dwelt in the house of her god and then bidding them bless god who had brought them safe over the alps and across the sea and all along that weary road she went on her way and they saw her no more  then with this fair mysterious face clinging to his memory and it may be never leaving it godric took his mother safe home and delivered her to his father and bade them both after awhile farewell and wandered across england to penrith and hung about the churches there till some kinsmen of his recognised him and gave him a psalter he must have taught himself to read upon his travels which he learnt by heart  then wandering ever in search of solitude he went into the woods and found a cave and passed his time therein in prayer living on green herbs and wild honey acorns and crabs and when he went about to gather food he fell down on his knees every few yards and said a prayer and rose and went on  after awhile he wandered on again until at wolsingham in durham he met with another holy hermit who had been a monk at durham living in a cave in forests in which no man dare dwell so did they swarm with packs of wolves and there the two good men dwelt together till the old hermit fell sick and was like to die  godric nursed him and sat by him to watch for his last breath  for the same longing had come over him which came over marguerite dangouleme when she sat by the dying bed of her favourite maid of honourto see if the spirit when it left the body were visible and what kind of thing it was  whether for instance it was really like the little naked babe which is seen in mediaeval illuminations flying out of the mouths of dying men  but worn out with watching godric could not keep from sleep  all but despairing of his desire he turned to the dying man and spoke says reginald some such words as theseo spirit who art diffused in that body in the likeness of god and art still inside that breast i adjure thee by the highest that thou leave not the prison of this thine habitation while i am overcome by sleep and know not of it  and so he fell asleep  but when he woke the old hermit lay motionless and breathless  poor godric wept called on the dead man called on god his simple heart was set on seeing this one thing  and behold he was consoled in a wondrous fashion  for about the third hour of the day the breath returned  godric hung over him watching his lips  three heavy sighs he drew then a shudder another sigh 323 and then so godric was believed to have said in after years he saw the spirit flit  what it was like he did not like to say for the most obvious reasonthat he saw nothing and was an honest man  a monk teased him much to impart to him this great discovery which seemed to the simple untaught sailor a great spiritual mystery and which was like some other mediaeval mysteries which were miscalled spiritual transubstantiation above all altogether material and gross imaginations  godric answered wisely enough that no man could perceive the substance of the spiritual soul  but the monk insisting and giving him no rest he answered whether he wished to answer a fool according to his folly or whether he tried to fancy as men will who are somewhat vainand if a saint was not vain it was no fault of the monks who beset him that he had really seen something  he told how it was like a dry hot wind rolled into a sphere and shining like the clearest glass but that what it was really like no one could express  thus much at least may be gathered from the involved bombast of reginald  another pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre did godric make before he went to the hermitage in eskdale and settled finally at finchale and there about the hills of judaea he found says reginald hermits dwelling in rockcaves as they had dwelt since the time of st jerome  he washed himself and his hair shirt and little cross in the sacred waters of the jordan and returned after incredible suffering to become the saint of finchale  his hermitage became in due time a stately priory with its community of monks who looked up to the memory of their holy father godric as to that of a demigod  the place is all ruinate now the memory of st godric gone and not one in ten thousand perhaps who visit those crumbling walls beside the rushing wear has heard of the sailorsaint and his mother and that fair maid who tended them on their pilgrimage  meanwhile there were hermits for many years in that same hermitage in eskdale from which a percy expelled st godric possibly because he interfered with the prior claim of some protege of their own for they had a few years before godrics time granted that hermitage to the monks of whitby who were not likely to allow a stranger to establish himself on their ground  about that hermitage hung one of those stories so common in the middle ages in which the hermit appears as the protector of the hunted wild beast a story too which was probably authentic as the curious custom which was said to perpetuate its memory lasted at least till the year 1753  i quote it at length from burtons monasticon eboracense p 78 knowing no other authority  in the fifth year of the reign of king henry ii after the conquest of england by william duke of normandy the lord of uglebardby then called william de bruce and the lord of sneton called ralph de perci with a gentleman and a freeholder called allatson did on the 16th day of october appoint to meet and hunt the wild boar in a certain wood or desert place belonging to the abbot of the monastery of whitby the places name is eskdaleside the abbots name was sedman  then these gentlemen being met with their hounds and boar staves in the place beforenamed and there having found a great wild boar the hounds ran him well near about the chapel and hermitage of eskdaleside where was a monk of whitby who was a hermit  the boar being very sore and very hotly pursued and dead run took in at the chapel door and there died  whereupon the hermit shut the hounds out of the chapel and kept himself within at his meditations and prayers the hounds standing at bay without the gentlemen in the thick of the wood being put behind their game followed the cry of their hounds and so came to the hermitage calling on the hermit who opened the door and came forth and within they found the boar lying dead for which the gentlemen in very great fury because their hounds were put from their game did most violently and cruelly run at the hermit with their boarstaves whereby he died soon after  thereupon the gentlemen perceiving and knowing that they were in peril of death took sanctuary at scarborough  but at that time the abbot being in very great favour with king henry removed them out of the sanctuary whereby they came in danger of the law and not to be privileged but likely to have the severity of the law which was death  but the hermit being a holy and devout man at the point of death sent for the abbot and desired him to send for the gentlemen who had wounded him  the abbot so doing the gentlemen came and the hermit being very sick and weak said unto them i am sure to die of those wounds you have given me  the abbot answered they shall as surely die for the same but the hermit answered not so for i will freely forgive them my death if they will be contented to be enjoined this penance for the safeguard of their souls  the gentlemen being present and terrified with the fear of death bade him enjoin what penance he would so that he would but save their lives  then said the hermit you and yours shall hold your lands of the abbot of whitby and his successors in this manner  that upon ascension eve you or some of you shall come to the woods of the strag heads which is in eskdaleside the same day at sunrising and there shall the abbots officer blow his horn to the intent that you may know how to find him and he shall deliver unto you william de bruce ten stakes eleven struttowers and eleven yethers to be cut by you or some for you with a knife of one penny price and you ralph de perci shall take twenty and one of each sort to be cut in the same manner and you allatson shall take nine of each sort to be cut as aforesaid and to be taken on your backs and carried to the town of whitby and to be there before nine of the clock the same day beforementioned at the same hour of nine of the clock if it be full sea your labour or service shall cease but if it be not full sea each of you shall set your stakes at the brim each stake one yard from the other and so yether them on each side of your yethers and so stake on each side with your struttowers that they may stand three tides without removing by the force thereof  each of you shall do make and execute the said service at that very hour every year except it shall be full sea at that hour  but when it shall so fall out this service shall cease you shall faithfully do this in remembrance that you did most cruelly slay me and that you may the better call to god for mercy repent unfeignedly for your sins and do good works the officers of eskdaleside shall blow out on you out on you out on you for this heinous crime  if you or your successors shall refuse this service so long as it shall not be full sea at the aforesaid hour you or yours shall forfeit your lands to the abbot of whitby or his successors  this i intreat and earnestly beg that you may have lives and goods preserved for this service and i request of you to promise by your parts in heaven that it shall be done by you and your successors as it is aforesaid requested and i will confirm it by the faith of an honest man  then the hermit said  my soul longeth for the lord and i do as freely forgive these men my death as christ forgave the thieves upon the cross and in the presence of the abbot and the rest he said moreover these words  into thy hands o lord i commend my spirit for from the bonds of death thou hast redeemed me o lord of truth  amen  so he yielded up the ghost the eighth day of december ad 1160 upon whose soul god have mercy  amen    anchorites strictly so called    the fertile and peaceable lowlands of england as i have just said offered few spots sufficiently wild and lonely for the habitation of a hermit those therefore who wished to retire from the world into a more strict and solitary life than that which the monastery afforded were in the habit of immuring themselves as anchorites or in old english ankers in little cells of stone built usually against the wall of a church  there is nothing new under the sun and similar anchorites might have been seen in egypt 500 years before the time of st antony immured in cells in the temples of isis or serapis  it is only recently that antiquaries have discovered how common this practice was in england and how frequently the traces of these cells are to be found about our parish churches  they were so common in the diocese of lincoln in the thirteenth century that in 1233 the archdeacon is ordered to inquire whether any anchorites cells had been built without the bishops leave and in many of our parish churches may be seen either on the north or the south side of the chancel a narrow slit in the wall or one of the lights of a window prolonged downwards the prolongation if not now walled up being closed with a shutter through these apertures the incluse or anker watched the celebration of mass and partook of the holy communion  similar cells were to be found in ireland at least in the diocese of ossory and doubtless in scotland also  ducange in his glossary on the word inclusi lays down rules for the size of the ankers cell which must be twelve feet square with three windows one opening into the church one for taking in his food and one for light and the salisbury manual as well as the pontifical of lacy bishop of exeter in the first half of the fifteenth century contains a regular service for the walling in of an anchorite 330  there exists too a most singular and painful book well known to antiquaries but to them alone the ancren riwle addressed to three young ladies who had immured themselves seemingly about the beginning of the thirteenth century at kingston tarrant in dorsetshire  for women as well as men entered these living tombs and there spent their days in dirt and starvation and such prayer and meditation doubtless as the stupified and wornout intellect could compass their only recreation being the gossip of the neighbouring women who came to peep in through the little windowa recreation in which if we are to believe the author of the ancren riwle they were tempted to indulge only too freely till the window of the recluses cell he says became what the smiths forge or the alehouse has become sincethe place where all the gossip and scandal of the village passed from one ear to another  but we must not believe such scandals of all  only too much in earnest must those seven young maidens have been whom st gilbert of sempringham persuaded to immure themselves as a sacrifice acceptable to god in a den along the north wall of his church or that st hutta or huetta in the beginning of the thirteenth century who after ministering to lepers and longing and even trying to become a leper herself immured herself for life in a cell against the church of huy near liege  fearful must have been the fate of these incluses if any evil had befallen the building of which one may say they had become a part more than one in the stormy middle age may have suffered the fate of the poor women immured beside st marys church at mantes who when town and church were burnt by william the conqueror unable to escape or according to william of malmesbury thinking it unlawful to quit their cells even in that extremity perished in the flames and so consummated once and for all their long martyrdom  how long the practice of the hermit life was common in these islands is more than my learning enables me to say  hermits seem from the old chartularies 331 to have been not unfrequent in scotland and the north of england during the whole middle age  we have seen that they were frequent in the times of malcolm canmore and the old celtic church and the latin church which was introduced by st margaret seems to have kept up the fashion  in the middle of the thirteenth century david de haigh conveyed to the monks of cupar the hermitage which gilmichael the hermit once held with three acres of land  in 1329 the convent of durham made a grant of a hermitage to roger eller at norham on the tweed in order that he might have a fit place to fight with the old enemy and bewail his sins apart from the turmoil of men  in 1445 james the second king of scots granted to john smith the hermitage in the forest of kilgur which formerly belonged in heritage to hugh cominch the hermit and was resigned by him with the croft and the green belonging to it and three acres of arable land  i have quoted these few instances to show how long the custom lingered and doubtless hermits were to be found in the remoter parts of these realms when the sudden tempest of the reformation swept away alike the palace of the rich abbot and the cell of the poor recluse and exterminated throughout england the ascetic life the two last hermits whom i have come across in history are both figures which exemplify very well those times of corruption and of change  at loretto not in italy but in musselburgh near edinburgh there lived a hermit who pretended to work miracles and who it seems had charge of some image of our lady of loretto  the scandals which ensued from the visits of young folks to this hermit roused the wrath of that terrible scourge of monks sir david lindsay of the mount  yet as late as 1536 james the fifth of scotland made a pilgrimage from stirling to the shrine in order to procure a propitious passage to france in search of a wife  but in 1543 lord hertford during his destructive voyage to the forth destroyed with other objects of greater consequence the chapel of the lady of lorett which was not likely in those days to be rebuilt and so the hermit of musselburgh vanishes from history  a few years before in 1537 says mr froude 333 while the harbours piers and fortresses were rising in dover an ancient hermit tottered night after night from his cell to a chapel on the cliff and the tapers on the altar before which he knelt in his lonely orisons made a familiar beacon far over the rolling waters the men of the rising world cared little for the sentiment of the past  the anchorite was told sternly by the workmen that his light was a signal to the kings enemies a spanish invasion from flanders was expected and must burn no more and when it was next seen three of them waylaid the old man on his way home threw him down and beat him cruelly  so ended in an undignified way as wornout institutions are wont to end the hermit life in the british isles  will it ever reappear  who can tell  to an age of luxury and unbelief has succeeded more than once in history an age of remorse and superstition  gay gentlemen and gay ladies may renounce the world as they did in the time of st jerome when the world is ready to renounce them  we have already our nunneries our monasteries of more creeds than one and the mountains of kerry or the pine forests of the highlands may some day once more hold hermits persuading themselves to believe and at last succeeding in believing the teaching of st antony instead of that of our lord jesus christ and of that father of the spirits of all flesh who made love and marriage and little children sunshine and flowers the wings of butterflies and the song of birds who rejoices in his own works and bids all who truly reverence him rejoice in them with him  the fancy may seem impossible  it is not more impossible than many religious phenomena seemed forty years ago which are now no fancies but powerful facts  the following books should be consulted by those who wish to follow out this curious subject in detail  the vitae patrum eremiticorum  the acta sanctorum  the bollandists are of course almost exhaustive of any subject on which they treat  but as they are difficult to find save in a few public libraries the acta sanctorum of surius or of aloysius lipommasius may be profitably consulted  butlers lives of the saints is a book common enough but of no great value  m de montalemberts moines doccident and ozanams etudes germaniques may be read with

to have been no other pattern  the hermits who became abbots with their monks were the only teachers of the peopleone had almost said the only christians  whence as early as the sixth century if not the fifth they and their disciples of iona and scotland derived their peculiar tonsure their use of bells their eastern mode of keeping the paschal feast and other peculiarities seemingly without the

on the inner walls of egyptian tombs and probably believed by antony and his compeers to be connected with devilworship explain these visions  in the words of the elders a monk complains of being troubled with pictures old and new  probably again the pain which antony felt was the agony of a fever and the visions which he saw its delirium  44  here is an instance of the original use of the

two english versions of the legend edited by mr thomas wright for the percy society vol xiv  one is in verse and of the earlier part of the fourteenth century and spirited enough  the other a prose version was printed by wynkyn de worde in his edition of the golden legend 1527  260a  in the barony of longford county galway  260b  3000 like 300 seems to be i am informed only an irish expression for any large number  269  some dim legend concerning icebergs and caves therein  270  probably from reports of the volcanic coast of iceland  272  this part of the legend has been changed and humanized as time ran on  in the latin and french versions it has little or no point or moral  in the english judas accounts for the presence of the cloth thus  here i may see what it is to give other mens goods with harm as will many rich men with unright all day take of poor men here and there and almisse alms sithhe afterwards make  for the tongs and the stone he accounts by saying that as he used them for good ends each thing should surely find him which he did for gods love  but in the prose version of wynkyn de worde the tongs have been changed into oxtongues which i gave some tyme to two preestes to praye for me  i bought them with myne owne money and therefore they ease me bycause the fysshes of the sea gnaw on them and spare me  this latter story of the oxtongues has been followed by mr sebastian evans in his poem on st brendan  both he and mr matthew arnold have rendered the moral of the english version very beautifully  274  copied surely from the life of paul the first hermit  283  the famous cathach now in the museum of the royal irish academy was long popularly believed to be the very psalter in question  as a relic of st columba it was carried to battle by the odonnels even as late as 1497 to insure victory for the clan  290  bede book iii cap 3  292  these details and countless stories of st cuthberts miracles are to be found in reginald of durham de admirandis beati cuthberti published by the surtees society  this curious book is admirably edited by mr j raine with an english synopsis at the end which enables the reader for whom the latin is too difficult to enjoy those pictures of life under stephen and henry ii whether moral religious or social of which the book is a rich museum  299  in this hole lie the bones of the venerable bede  303  an english translation of the anglosaxon life has been published by mr godwin of cambridge and is well worth perusal  312  vita s godrici pp 332 333  316  the earlier one that of the harleian mss which mr stevenson thinks was twice afterwards expanded and decorated by him  323  reginald wants to make a wonder incredible in our own times of a very common form thank god of peaceful death  he makes miracles in the same way of the catching of salmon and of otters simple enough to one who like godric knew the river and every wild thing which haunted it  330  that of the salisbury manual is published in the ecclesiologist for august 1848 by the rev sir w h cope to whom i am indebted for the greater number of these curious facts  331  i owe these facts to the courtesy of mr john stuart of
