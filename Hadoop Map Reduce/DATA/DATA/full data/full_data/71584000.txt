apology for this collection which has more to do with life than with letters  its appeal is made to orderly minds  this to be frank about it is a process of tidying up which from the nature of things cannot be regarded as premature  the fact is that i wanted to do it myself because of a feeling that had nothing to do with the considerations of worthiness or unworthiness of the small but unbroken pieces collected within the covers of this volume  of course it may be said that i might have taken up a broom and used it without saying anything about it  that certainly is one way of tidying up  but it would have been too much to have expected me to treat all this matter as removable rubbish  all those things had a place in my life whether any of them deserve to have been picked up and ranged on the shelfthis shelfi cannot say and frankly i have not allowed my mind to dwell on the question  i was afraid of thinking myself into a mood that would hurt my feelings for those pieces of writing whatever may be the comment on their display appertain to the character of the man  and so here they are dusted which was but a decent thing to do but in no way polished extending from the year 98 to the year 20 a thin array for such a stretch of time of really innocent attitudes conrad literary conrad political conrad reminiscent conrad controversial well yes  a oneman showor is it merely the show of one man  the only thing that will not be found amongst those figures and things that have passed away will be conrad en pantoufles  it is a constitutional inability  schlafrock und pantoffeln  not that  never    i dont know whether i dare boast like a certain south american general who used to say that no emergency of war or peace had ever found him with his boots off but i may say that whenever the various periodicals mentioned in this book called on me to come out and blow the trumpet of personal opinions or strike the pensive lute that speaks of the past i always tried to pull on my boots first  i didnt want to do it god knows  their editors to whom i beg to offer my thanks here made me perform mainly by kindness but partly by bribery  well yes bribery  what can you expect  i never pretended to be better than the people in the next street or even in the same street  this volume including these embarrassed introductory remarks is as near as i shall ever come to deshabille in public and perhaps it will do something to help towards a better vision of the man if it gives no more than a partial view of a piece of his back a little dusty after the process of tidying up a little bowed and receding from the world not because of weariness or misanthropy but for other reasons that cannot be helped because the leaves fall the water flows the clock ticks with that horrid pitiless solemnity which you must have observed in the ticking of the hall clock at home  for reasons like that  yes  it recedes  and this was the chance to afford one more view of iteven to my own eyes  the section within this volume called letters explains itself though i do not pretend to say that it justifies its own existence  it claims nothing in its defence except the right of speech which i believe belongs to everybody outside a trappist monastery  the part i have ventured for shortness sake to call life may perhaps justify itself by the emotional sincerity of the feelings to which the various papers included under that head owe their origin  and as they relate to events of which everyone has a date they are in the nature of signposts pointing out the direction my thoughts were compelled to take at the various cross roads  if anybody detects any sort of consistency in the choice this will be only proof positive that wisdom had nothing to do with it whether right or wrong instinct alone is invariable a fact which only adds a deeper shade to its inherent mystery  the appearance of intellectuality these pieces may present at first sight is merely the result of the arrangement of words  the logic that may be found there is only the logic of the language  but i need not labour the point  there will be plenty of people sagacious enough to perceive the absence of all wisdom from these pages  but i believe sufficiently in human sympathies to imagine that very few will question their sincerity  whatever delusions i may have suffered from i have had no delusions as to the nature of the facts commented on here  i may have misjudged their import but that is the sort of error for which one may expect a certain amount of toleration  the only paper of this collection which has never been published before is the note on the polish problem  it was written at the request of a friend to be shown privately and its protectorate idea sprung from a strong sense of the critical nature of the situation was shaped by the actual circumstances of the time  the time was about a month before the entrance of roumania into the war and though honestly i had seen already the shadow of coming events i could not permit my misgivings to enter into and destroy the structure of my plan  i still believe that there was some sense in it  it may certainly be charged with the appearance of lack of faith and it lays itself open to the throwing of many stones but my object was practical and i had to consider warily the preconceived notions of the people to whom it was implicitly addressed and also their unjustifiable hopes  they were unjustifiable but who was to tell them that  i mean who was wise enough and convincing enough to show them the inanity of their mental attitude  the whole atmosphere was poisoned with visions that were not so much false as simply impossible they were also the result of vague and unconfessed fears and that made their strength  for myself with a very definite dread in my heart i was careful not to allude to their character because i did not want the note to be thrown away unread  and then i had to remember that the impossible has sometimes the trick of coming to pass to the confusion of minds and often to the crushing of hearts  of the other papers i have nothing special to say  they are what they are and i am by now too hardened a sinner to feel ashamed of insignificant indiscretions  and as to their appearance in this form i claim that indulgence to which all sinners against themselves are entitled  j c 1920     part iletters   books1905   i   i have not read this authors books and if i have read them i have forgotten what they were about  these words are reported as having been uttered in our midst not a hundred years ago publicly from the seat of justice by a civic magistrate  the words of our municipal rulers have a solemnity and importance far above the words of other mortals because our municipal rulers more than any other variety of our governors and masters represent the average wisdom temperament sense and virtue of the community  this generalisation it ought to be promptly said in the interests of eternal justice and recent friendship does not apply to the united states of america  there if one may believe the long and helpless indignations of their daily and weekly press the majority of municipal rulers appear to be thieves of a particularly irrepressible sort  but this by the way  my concern is with a statement issuing from the average temperament and the average wisdom of a great and wealthy community and uttered by a civic magistrate obviously without fear and without reproach  i confess i am pleased with his temper which is that of prudence  i have not read the books he says and immediately he adds and if i have read them i have forgotten  this is excellent caution  and i like his style it is unartificial and bears the stamp of manly sincerity  as a reported piece of prose this declaration is easy to read and not difficult to believe  many books have not been read still more have been forgotten  as a piece of civic oratory this declaration is strikingly effective  calculated to fall in with the bent of the popular mind so familiar with all forms of forgetfulness it has also the power to stir up a subtle emotion while it starts a train of thoughtand what greater force can be expected from human speech  but it is in naturalness that this declaration is perfectly delightful for there is nothing more natural than for a grave city father to forget what the books he has read oncelong agoin his giddy youth maybewere about  and the books in question are novels or at any rate were written as novels  i proceed thus cautiously following my illustrious example because being without fear and desiring to remain as far as possible without reproach i confess at once that i have not read them  i have not and of the million persons or more who are said to have read them i never met one yet with the talent of lucid exposition sufficiently developed to give me a connected account of what they are about  but they are books part and parcel of humanity and as such in their ever increasing jostling multitude they are worthy of regard admiration and compassion  especially of compassion  it has been said a long time ago that books have their fate  they have and it is very much like the destiny of man they share with us the great incertitude of ignominy or gloryof severe justice and senseless persecutionof calumny and misunderstandingthe shame of undeserved success  of all the inanimate objects of all mens creations books are the nearest to us for they contain our very thought our ambitions our indignations our illusions our fidelity to truth and our persistent leaning towards error  but most of all they resemble us in their precarious hold on life  a bridge constructed according to the rules of the art of bridgebuilding is certain of a long honourable and useful career  but a book as good in its way as the bridge may perish obscurely on the very day of its birth  the art of their creators is not sufficient to give them more than a moment of life of the books born from the restlessness the inspiration and the vanity of human minds those that the muses would love best lie more than all others under the menace of an early death  sometimes their defects will save them  sometimes a book fair to see mayto use a lofty expressionhave no individual soul  obviously a book of that sort cannot die  it can only crumble into dust  but the best of books drawing sustenance from the sympathy and memory of men have lived on the brink of destruction for mens memories are short and their sympathy is we must admit a very fluctuating unprincipled emotion  no secret of eternal life for our books can be found amongst the formulas of art any more than for our bodies in a prescribed combination of drugs  this is not because some books are not worthy of enduring life but because the formulas of art are dependent on things variable unstable and untrustworthy on human sympathies on prejudices on likes and dislikes on the sense of virtue and the sense of propriety on beliefs and theories that indestructible in themselves always change their formoften in the lifetime of one fleeting generation   ii   of all books novels which the muses should love make a serious claim on our compassion  the art of the novelist is simple  at the same time it is the most elusive of all creative arts the most liable to be obscured by the scruples of its servants and votaries the one preeminently destined to bring trouble to the mind and the heart of the artist  after all the creation of a world is not a small undertaking except perhaps to the divinely gifted  in truth every novelist must begin by creating for himself a world great or little in which he can honestly believe  this world cannot be made otherwise than in his own image it is fated to remain individual and a little mysterious and yet it must resemble something already familiar to the experience the thoughts and the sensations of his readers  at the heart of fiction even the least worthy of the name some sort of truth can be foundif only the truth of a childish theatrical ardour in the game of life as in the novels of dumas the father  but the fair truth of human delicacy can be found in mr henry jamess novels and the comical appalling truth of human rapacity let loose amongst the spoils of existence lives in the monstrous world created by balzac  the pursuit of happiness by means lawful and unlawful through resignation or revolt by the clever manipulation of conventions or by solemn hanging on to the skirts of the latest scientific theory is the only theme that can be legitimately developed by the novelist who is the chronicler of the adventures of mankind amongst the dangers of the kingdom of the earth  and the kingdom of this earth itself the ground upon which his individualities stand stumble or die must enter into his scheme of faithful record  to encompass all this in one harmonious conception is a great feat and even to attempt it deliberately with serious intention not from the senseless prompting of an ignorant heart is an honourable ambition  for it requires some courage to step in calmly where fools may be eager to rush as a distinguished and successful french novelist once observed of fiction cest un art trop difficile  it is natural that the novelist should doubt his ability to cope with his task  he imagines it more gigantic than it is  and yet literary creation being only one of the legitimate forms of human activity has no value but on the condition of not excluding the fullest recognition of all the more distinct forms of action  this condition is sometimes forgotten by the man of letters who often especially in his youth is inclined to lay a claim of exclusive superiority for his own amongst all the other tasks of the human mind  the mass of verse and prose may glimmer here and there with the glow of a divine spark but in the sum of human effort it has no special importance  there is no justificative formula for its existence any more than for any other artistic achievement  with the rest of them it is destined to be forgotten without perhaps leaving the faintest trace  where a novelist has an advantage over the workers in other fields of thought is in his privilege of freedomthe freedom of expression and the freedom of confessing his innermost beliefswhich should console him for the hard slavery of the pen   iii   liberty of imagination should be the most precious possession of a novelist  to try voluntarily to discover the fettering dogmas of some romantic realistic or naturalistic creed in the free work of its own inspiration is a trick worthy of human perverseness which after inventing an absurdity endeavours to find for it a pedigree of distinguished ancestors  it is a weakness of inferior minds when it is not the cunning device of those who uncertain of their talent would seek to add lustre to it by the authority of a school  such for instance are the high priests who have proclaimed stendhal for a prophet of naturalism  but stendhal himself would have accepted no limitation of his freedom  stendhals mind was of the first order  his spirit above must be raging with a peculiarly stendhalesque scorn and indignation  for the truth is that more than one kind of intellectual cowardice hides behind the literary formulas  and stendhal was preeminently courageous he wrote his two great novels which so few people have read in a spirit of fearless liberty  it must not be supposed that i claim for the artist in fiction the freedom of moral nihilism  i would require from him many acts of faith of which the first would be the cherishing of an undying hope and hope it will not be contested implies all the piety of effort and renunciation  it is the godsent form of trust in the magic force and inspiration belonging to the life of this earth  we are inclined to forget that the way of excellence is in the intellectual as distinguished from emotional humility  what one feels so hopelessly barren in declared pessimism is just its arrogance  it seems as if the discovery made by many men at various times that there is much evil in the world were a source of proud and unholy joy unto some of the modern writers  that frame of mind is not the proper one in which to approach seriously the art of fiction  it gives an authorgoodness only knows whyan elated sense of his own superiority  and there is nothing more dangerous than such an elation to that absolute loyalty towards his feelings and sensations an author should keep hold of in his most exalted moments of creation  to be hopeful in an artistic sense it is not necessary to think that the world is good  it is enough to believe that there is no impossibility of its being made so  if the flight of imaginative thought may be allowed to rise superior to many moralities current amongst mankind a novelist who would think himself of a superior essence to other men would miss the first condition of his calling  to have the gift of words is no such great matter  a man furnished with a longrange weapon does not become a hunter or a warrior by the mere possession of a firearm many other qualities of character and temperament are necessary to make him either one or the other  of him from whose armoury of phrases one in a hundred thousand may perhaps hit the fardistant and elusive mark of art i would ask that in his dealings with mankind he should be capable of giving a tender recognition to their obscure virtues  i would not have him impatient with their small failings and scornful of their errors  i would not have him expect too much gratitude from that humanity whose fate as illustrated in individuals it is open to him to depict as ridiculous or terrible  i would wish him to look with a large forgiveness at mens ideas and prejudices which are by no means the outcome of malevolence but depend on their education their social status even their professions  the good artist should expect no recognition of his toil and no admiration of his genius because his toil can with difficulty be appraised and his genius cannot possibly mean anything to the illiterate who even from the dreadful wisdom of their evoked dead have so far culled nothing but inanities and platitudes  i would wish him to enlarge his sympathies by patient and loving observation while he grows in mental power  it is in the impartial practice of life if anywhere that the promise of perfection for his art can be found rather than in the absurd formulas trying to prescribe this or that particular method of technique or conception  let him mature the strength of his imagination amongst the things of this earth which it is his business to cherish and know and refrain from calling down his inspiration readymade from some heaven of perfections of which he knows nothing  and i would not grudge him the proud illusion that will come sometimes to a writer the illusion that his achievement has almost equalled the greatness of his dream  for what else could give him the serenity and the force to hug to his breast as a thing delightful and human the virtue the rectitude and sagacity of his own city declaring with simple eloquence through the mouth of a conscript father i have not read this authors books and if i have read them i have forgotten       henry jamesan appreciation1905   the critical faculty hesitates before the magnitude of mr henry jamess work  his books stand on my shelves in a place whose accessibility proclaims the habit of frequent communion  but not all his books  there is no collected edition to date such as some of our masters have been provided with no neat rows of volumes in buckram or half calf putting forth a hasty claim to completeness and conveying to my mind a hint of finality of a surrender to fate of that field in which all these victories have been won  nothing of the sort has been done for mr henry jamess victories in england  in a world such as ours so painful with all sorts of wonders one would not exhaust oneself in barren marvelling over mere bindings had not the fact or rather the absence of the material fact prominent in the case of other men whose writing counts for good or evilhad it not been i say expressive of a direct truth spiritual and intellectual an accident ofi supposethe publishing business acquiring a symbolic meaning from its negative nature  because emphatically in the body of mr henry jamess work there is no suggestion of finality nowhere a hint of surrender or even of probability of surrender to his own victorious achievement in that field where he is a master  happily he will never be able to claim completeness and were he to confess to it in a moment of selfignorance he would not be believed by the very minds for whom such a confession naturally would be meant  it is impossible to think of mr henry james becoming complete otherwise than by the brutality of our common fate whose finality is meaninglessin the sense of its logic being of a material order the logic of a falling stone  i do not know into what brand of ink mr henry james dips his pen indeed i heard that of late he had been dictating but i know that his mind is steeped in the waters flowing from the fountain of intellectual youth  the thinga privilegea miraclewhat you willis not quite hidden from the meanest of us who run as we read  to those who have the grace to stay their feet it is manifest  after some twenty years of attentive acquaintance with mr henry jamess work it grows into absolute conviction which all personal feeling apart brings a sense of happiness into ones artistic existence  if gratitude as someone defined it is a lively sense of favours to come it becomes very easy to be grateful to the author of the ambassadorsto name the latest of his works  the favours are sure to come the spring of that benevolence will never run dry  the stream of inspiration flows brimful in a predetermined direction unaffected by the periods of drought untroubled in its clearness by the storms of the land of letters without languor or violence in its force never running back upon itself opening new visions at every turn of its course through that richly inhabited country its fertility has created for our delectation for our judgment for our exploring  it is in fact a magic spring  with this phrase the metaphor of the perennial spring of the inextinguishable youth of running waters as applied to mr henry jamess inspiration may be dropped  in its volume and force the body of his work may be compared rather to a majestic river  all creative art is magic is evocation of the unseen in forms persuasive enlightening familiar and surprising for the edification of mankind pinned down by the conditions of its existence to the earnest consideration of the most insignificant tides of reality  action in its essence the creative art of a writer of fiction may be compared to rescue work carried out in darkness against cross gusts of wind swaying the action of a great multitude  it is rescue work this snatching of vanishing phases of turbulence disguised in fair words out of the native obscurity into a light where the struggling forms may be seen seized upon endowed with the only possible form of permanence in this world of relative valuesthe permanence of memory  and the multitude feels it obscurely too since the demand of the individual to the artist is in effect the cry take me out of myself meaning really out of my perishable activity into the light of imperishable consciousness  but everything is relative and the light of consciousness is only enduring merely the most enduring of the things of this earth imperishable only as against the shortlived work of our industrious hands  when the last aqueduct shall have crumbled to pieces the last airship fallen to the ground the last blade of grass have died upon a dying earth man indomitable by his training in resistance to misery and pain shall set this undiminished light of his eyes against the feeble glow of the sun  the artistic faculty of which each of us has a minute grain may find its voice in some individual of that last group gifted with a power of expression and courageous enough to interpret the ultimate experience of mankind in terms of his temperament in terms of art  i do not mean to say that he would attempt to beguile the last moments of humanity by an ingenious tale  it would be too much to expectfrom humanity  i doubt the heroism of the hearers  as to the heroism of the artist no doubt is necessary  there would be on his part no heroism the artist in his calling of interpreter creates the clearest form of demonstration because he must  he is so much of a voice that for him silence is like death and the postulate was that there is a group alive clustered on his threshold to watch the last flicker of light on a black sky to hear the last word uttered in the stilled workshop of the earth  it is safe to affirm that if anybody it will be the imaginative man who would be moved to speak on the eve of that day without tomorrowwhether in austere exhortation or in a phrase of sardonic comment who can guess  for my own part from a short and cursory acquaintance with my kind i am inclined to think that the last utterance will formulate strange as it may appear some hope now to us utterly inconceivable  for mankind is delightful in its pride its assurance and its indomitable tenacity  it will sleep on the battlefield among its own dead in the manner of an army having won a barren victory  it will not know when it is beaten and perhaps it is right in that quality  the victories are not perhaps so barren as it may appear from a purely strategical utilitarian point of view  mr henry james seems to hold that belief  nobody has rendered better perhaps the tenacity of temper or known how to drape the robe of spiritual honour about the drooping form of a victor in a barren strife  and the honour is always well won for the struggles mr henry james chronicles with such subtle and direct insight are though only personal contests desperate in their silence none the less heroic in the modern sense for the absence of shouted watchwords clash of arms and sound of trumpets  those are adventures in which only choice souls are ever involved  and mr henry james records them with a fearless and insistent fidelity to the peripeties of the contest and the feelings of the combatants  the fiercest excitements of a romance de cape et depee the romance of yardarm and boarding pike so dear to youth whose knowledge of action as of other things is imperfect and limited are matched for the quickening of our maturer years by the tasks set by the difficulties presented to the sense of truth of necessitybefore all of conductof mr henry jamess men and women  his mankind is delightful  it is delightful in its tenacity it refuses to own itself beaten it will sleep on the battlefield  these warlike images come by themselves under the pen since from the duality of mans nature and the competition of individuals the lifehistory of the earth must in the last instance be a history of a really very relentless warfare  neither his fellows nor his gods nor his passions will leave a man alone  in virtue of these allies and enemies he holds his precarious dominion he possesses his fleeting significance and it is this relation in all its manifestations great and little superficial or profound and this relation alone that is commented upon interpreted demonstrated by the art of the novelist in the only possible way in which the task can be performed by the independent creation of circumstance and character achieved against all the difficulties of expression in an imaginative effort finding its inspiration from the reality of forms and sensations  that a sacrifice must be made that something has to be given up is the truth engraved in the innermost recesses of the fair temple built for our edification by the masters of fiction  there is no other secret behind the curtain  all adventure all love every success is resumed in the supreme energy of an act of renunciation  it is the uttermost limit of our power it is the most potent and effective force at our disposal on which rest the labours of a solitary man in his study the rock on which have been built commonwealths whose might casts a dwarfing shadow upon two oceans  like a natural force which is obscured as much as illuminated by the multiplicity of phenomena the power of renunciation is obscured by the mass of weaknesses vacillations secondary motives and false steps and compromises which make up the sum of our activity  but no man or woman worthy of the name can pretend to anything more to anything greater  and mr henry jamess men and women are worthy of the name within the limits his art so clear so sure of itself has drawn round their activities he would be the last to claim for them titanic proportions  the earth itself has grown smaller in the course of ages  but in every sphere of human perplexities and emotions there are more greatnesses than onenot counting here the greatness of the artist himself  wherever he stands at the beginning or the end of things a man has to sacrifice his gods to his passions or his passions to his gods  that is the problem great enough in all truth if approached in the spirit of sincerity and knowledge  in one of his critical studies published some fifteen years ago mr henry james claims for the novelist the standing of the historian as the only adequate one as for himself and before his audience  i think that the claim cannot be contested and that the position is unassailable fiction is history human history or it is nothing  but it is also more than that it stands on firmer ground being based on the reality of forms and the observation of social phenomena whereas history is based on documents and the reading of print and handwritingon secondhand impression  thus fiction is nearer truth  but let that pass  a historian may be an artist too and a novelist is a historian the preserver the keeper the expounder of human experience  as is meet for a man of his descent and tradition mr henry james is the historian of fine consciences  of course this is a general statement but i dont think its truth will be or can be questioned  its fault is that it leaves so much out and besides mr henry james is much too considerable to be put into the nutshell of a phrase  the fact remains that he has made his choice and that his choice is justified up to the hilt by the success of his art  he has taken for himself the greater part  the range of a fine conscience covers more good and evil than the range of conscience which may be called roughly not fine a conscience less troubled by the nice discrimination of shades of conduct  a fine conscience is more concerned with essentials its triumphs are more perfect if less profitable in a worldly sense  there is in short more truth in its working for a historian to detect and to show  it is a thing of infinite complication and suggestion  none of these escapes the art of mr henry james  he has mastered the country his domain not wild indeed but full of romantic glimpses of deep shadows and sunny places  there are no secrets left within his range  he has disclosed them as they should be disclosedthat is beautifully  and indeed ugliness has but little place in this world of his creation  yet it is always felt in the truthfulness of his art it is there it surrounds the scene it presses close upon it  it is made visible tangible in the struggles in the contacts of the fine consciences in their perplexities in the sophism of their mistakes  for a fine conscience is naturally a virtuous one what is natural about it is just its fineness an abiding sense of the intangible everpresent right  it is most visible in their ultimate triumph in their emergence from miracle through an energetic act of renunciation  energetic not violent the distinction is wide enormous like that between substance and shadow  through it all mr henry james keeps a firm hold of the substance of what is worth having of what is worth holding  the contrary opinion has been if not absolutely affirmed then at least implied with some frequency  to most of us living willingly in a sort of intellectual moonlight in the faintly reflected light of truth the shadows so firmly renounced by mr henry jamess men and women stand out endowed with extraordinary value with a value so extraordinary that their rejection offends by its uncalledfor scrupulousness those businesslike instincts which a careful providence has implanted in our breasts  and apart from that just cause of discontent it is obvious that a solution by rejection must always present a certain lack of finality especially startling when contrasted with the usual methods of solution by rewards and punishments by crowned love by fortune by a broken leg or a sudden death  why the reading public which as a body has never laid upon a storyteller the command to be an artist should demand from him this sham of divine omnipotence is utterly incomprehensible  but so it is and these solutions are legitimate inasmuch as they satisfy the desire for finality for which our hearts yearn with a longing greater than the longing for the loaves and fishes of this earth  perhaps the only true desire of mankind coming thus to light in its hours of leisure is to be set at rest  one is never set at rest by mr henry jamess novels  his books end as an episode in life ends  you remain with the sense of the life still going on and even the subtle presence of the dead is felt in that silence that comes upon the artistcreation when the last word has been read  it is eminently satisfying but it is not final  mr henry james great artist and faithful historian never attempts the impossible    alphonse daudet1898   it is sweet to talk decorously of the dead who are part of our past our indisputable possession  one must admit regretfully that today is but a scramble that tomorrow may never come it is only the precious yesterday that cannot be taken away from us  a gift from the dead great and little it makes life supportable it almost makes one believe in a benevolent scheme of creation  and some kind of belief is very necessary  but the real knowledge of matters infinitely more profound than any conceivable scheme of creation is with the dead alone  that is why our talk about them should be as decorous as their silence  their generosity and their discretion deserve nothing less at our hands and they who belong already to the unchangeable would probably disdain to claim more than this from a mankind that changes its loves and its hates about every twentyfive yearsat the coming of every new and wiser generation  one of the most generous of the dead is daudet who with a prodigality approaching magnificence gave himself up to us without reserve in his work with all his qualities and all his faults  neither his qualities nor his faults were great though they were by no means imperceptible  it is only his generosity that is out of the common  what strikes one most in his work is the disinterestedness of the toiler  with more talent than many bigger men he did not preach about himself he did not attempt to persuade mankind into a belief of his own greatness  he never posed as a scientist or as a seer not even as a prophet and he neglected his interests to the point of never propounding a theory for the purpose of giving a tremendous significance to his art alone of all things in a world that by some strange oversight has not been supplied with an obvious meaning  neither did he affect a passive attitude before the spectacle of life an attitude which in godsand in a rare mortal here and theremay appear godlike but assumed by some men causes one very unwillingly to think of the melancholy quietude of an ape  he was not the wearisome expounder of this or that theory here today and spurned tomorrow  he was not a great artist he was not an artist at all if you likebut he was alphonse daudet a man as naively clear honest and vibrating as the sunshine of his native land that regrettably undiscriminating sunshine which matures grapes and pumpkins alike and cannot of course obtain the commendation of the very select who look at life from under a parasol  naturally being a man from the south he had a rather outspoken belief in himself but his small distinction worth many a greater was in not being in bondage to some vanishing creed  he was a worker who could not compel the admiration of the few but who deserved the affection of the many and he may be spoken of with tenderness and regret for he is not immortalhe is only dead  during his life the simple man whose business it ought to have been to climb in the name of art some elevation or other was content to remain below on the plain amongst his creations and take an eager part in those disasters weaknesses and joys which are tragic enough in their droll way but are by no means so momentous and profound as some writersprobably for the sake of artwould like to make us believe  there is when one thinks of it a considerable want of candour in the august view of life  without doubt a cautious reticence on the subject or even a delicately false suggestion thrown out in that direction is in a way praiseworthy since it helps to uphold the dignity of mana matter of great importance as anyone can see still one cannot help feeling that a certain amount of sincerity would not be wholly blamable  to state then with studied moderation a belief that in unfortunate moments of lucidity is irresistibly borne in upon most of usthe blind agitation caused mostly by hunger and complicated by love and ferocity does not deserve either by its beauty or its morality or its possible results the artistic fuss made over it  it may be consolingfor human folly is very bizarrebut it is scarcely honest to shout at those who struggle drowning in an insignificant pool you are indeed admirable and great to be the victims of such a profound of such a terrible ocean  and daudet was honest perhaps because he knew no betterbut he was very honest  if he saw only the surface of things it is for the reason that most things have nothing but a surface  he did not pretendperhaps because he did not know howhe did not pretend to see any depths in a life that is only a film of unsteady appearances stretched over regions deep indeed but which have nothing to do with the halftruths halfthoughts and whole illusions of existence  the road to these distant regions does not lie through the domain of art or the domain of science where wellknown voices quarrel noisily in a misty emptiness it is a path of toilsome silence upon which travel men simple and unknown with closed lips or maybe whispering their pain softlyonly to themselves  but daudet did not whisper he spoke loudly with animation with a clear felicity of toneas a bird sings  he saw life around him with extreme clearness and he felt it as it isthinner than air and more elusive than a flash of lightning  he hastened to offer it his compassion his indignation his wonder his sympathy without giving a moment of thought to the momentous issues that are supposed to lurk in the logic of such sentiments  he tolerated the little foibles the small ruffianisms the grave mistakes the only thing he distinctly would not forgive was hardness of heart  this unpractical attitude would have been fatal to a better man but his readers have forgiven him  withal he is chivalrous to exiled queens and deformed sempstresses he is pityingly tender to brokendown actors to ruined gentlemen to stupid academicians he is glad of the joys of the commonplace people in a commonplace wayand he never makes a secret of all this  no the man was not an artist  what if his creations are illumined by the sunshine of his temperament so vividly that they stand before us infinitely more real than the dingy illusions surrounding our everyday existence  the misguided man is for ever pottering amongst them lifting up his voice dotting his is in the wrong places  he takes tartarin by the arm he does not conceal his interest in the nabobs cheques his sympathy for an honest academician plus bete que nature his hate for an architect plus mauvais que la gale he is in the thick of it all  he feels with the duc de mora and with felicia ruysand he lets you see it  he does not sit on a pedestal in the hieratic and imbecile pose of some cheap god whose greatness consists in being too stupid to care  he cares immensely for his nabobs his kings his bookkeepers his colettes and his saphos  he vibrates together with his universe and with lamentable simplicity follows m de montpavon on that last walk along the boulevards  monsieur de montpavon marche a la mort and the creator of that unlucky gentilhomme follows with stealthy footsteps with wide eyes with an impressively pointing finger  and who wouldnt look  but it is hard it is sometimes very hard to forgive him the dotted is the pointing finger this making plain of obvious mysteries  monsieur de montpavon marche a la mort and presently on the crowded pavement takes off his hat with punctilious courtesy to the doctors wife who elegant and unhappy is bound on the same pilgrimage  this is too much  we feel we cannot forgive him such meetings the constant whisper of his presence we feel we cannot till suddenly the very naivete of it all touches us with the revealed suggestion of a truth  then we see that the man is not false all this is done in transparent good faith  the man is not melodramatic he is only picturesque  he may not be an artist but he comes as near the truth as some of the greatest  his creations are seen you can look into their very eyes and these are as thoughtless as the eyes of any wise generation that has in its hands the fame of writers yes they are seen and the man who is not an artist is seen also commiserating indignant joyous human and alive in their very midst inevitably they marchent a la mortand they are very near the truth of our common destiny their fate is poignant it is intensely interesting and of not the slightest consequence    guy de maupassant1904 1   to introduce maupassant to english readers with apologetic explanations as though his art were recondite and the tendency of his work immoral would be a gratuitous impertinence  maupassants conception of his art is such as one would expect from a practical and resolute mind but in the consummate simplicity of his technique it ceases to be perceptible  this is one of its greatest qualities and like all the great virtues it is based primarily on self denial  to pronounce a judgment upon the general tendency of an author is a difficult task  one could not depend upon reason alone nor yet trust solely to ones emotions  used together they would in many cases traverse each other because emotions have their own unanswerable logic our capacity for emotion is limited and the field of our intelligence is restricted  responsiveness to every feeling combined with the penetration of every intellectual subterfuge would end not in judgment but in universal absolution  tout comprendre cest tout pardonner  and in this benevolent neutrality towards the warring errors of human nature all light would go out from art and from life  we are at liberty then to quarrel with maupassants attitude towards our world in which like the rest of us he has that share which his senses are able to give him  but we need not quarrel with him violently  if our feelings which are tender happen to be hurt because his talent is not exercised for the praise and consolation of mankind our intelligence which is great should let us see that he is a very splendid sinner like all those who in this valley of compromises err by overdevotion to the truth that is in them  his determinism barren of praise blame and consolation has all the merit of his conscientious art  the worth of every conviction consists precisely in the steadfastness with which it is held  except for his philosophy which in the case of so consummate an artist does not matter unless to the solemn and naive mind maupassant of all writers of fiction demands least forgiveness from his readers  he does not require forgiveness because he is never dull  the interest of a reader in a work of imagination is either ethical or that of simple curiosity  both are perfectly legitimate since there is both a moral and an excitement to be found in a faithful rendering of life  and in maupassants work there is the interest of curiosity and the moral of a point of view consistently preserved and never obtruded for the end of personal gratification  the spectacle of this immense talent served by exceptional faculties and triumphing over the most thankless subjects by an unswerving singleness of purpose is in itself an admirable lesson in the power of artistic honesty one may say of artistic virtue  the inherent greatness of the man consists in this that he will let none of the fascinations that beset a writer working in loneliness turn him away from the straight path from the vouchsafed vision of excellence  he will not be led into perdition by the seductions of sentiment of eloquence of humour of pathos of all that splendid pageant of faults that pass between the writer and his probity on the blank sheet of paper like the glittering cortege of deadly sins before the austere anchorite in the desert air of thebaide  this is not to say that maupassants austerity has never faltered but the fact remains that no tempting demon has ever succeeded in hurling him down from his high if narrow pedestal  it is the austerity of his talent of course that is in question  let the discriminating reader who at times may well spare a moment or two to the consideration and enjoyment of artistic excellence be asked to reflect a little upon the texture of two stories included in this volume a piece of string and a sale  how many openings the last offers for the gratuitous display of the authors wit or clever buffoonery the first for an unmeasured display of sentiment  and both sentiment and buffoonery could have been made very good too in a way accessible to the meanest intelligence at the cost of truth and honesty  here it is where maupassants austerity comes in  he refrains from setting his cleverness against the eloquence of the facts  there is humour and pathos in these stories but such is the greatness of his talent the refinement of his artistic conscience that all his high qualities appear inherent in the very things of which he speaks as if they had been altogether independent of his presentation  facts and again facts are his unique concern  that is why he is not always properly understood  his facts are so perfectly rendered that like the actualities of life itself they demand from the reader the faculty of observation which is rare the power of appreciation which is generally wanting in most of us who are guided mainly by empty phrases requiring no effort demanding from us no qualities except a vague susceptibility to emotion  nobody has ever gained the vast applause of a crowd by the simple and clear exposition of vital facts  words alone strung upon a convention have fascinated us as worthless glass beads strung on a thread have charmed at all times our brothers the unsophisticated savages of the islands  now maupassant of whom it has been said that he is the master of the mot juste has never been a dealer in words  his wares have been not glass beads but polished gems not the most rare and precious perhaps but of the very first water of their kind  that he took trouble with his gems taking them up in the rough and polishing each facet patiently the publication of the two posthumous volumes of short stories proves abundantly  i think it proves also the assertion made here that he was by no means a dealer in words  on looking at the first feeble drafts from which so many perfect stories have been fashioned one discovers that what has been matured improved brought to perfection by unwearied endeavour is not the diction of the tale but the vision of its true shape and detail  those first attempts are not faltering or uncertain in expression  it is the conception which is at fault  the subjects have not yet been adequately seen  his proceeding was not to group expressive words that mean nothing around misty and mysterious shapes dear to muddled intellects and belonging neither to earth nor to heaven  his vision by a more scrupulous prolonged and devoted attention to the aspects of the visible world discovered at last the right words as if miraculously impressed for him upon the face of things and events  this was the particular shape taken by his inspiration it came to him directly honestly in the light of his day not on the tortuous dark roads of meditation  his realities came to him from a genuine source from this universe of vain appearances wherein we men have found everything to make us proud sorry exalted and humble  maupassants renown is universal but his popularity is restricted  it is not difficult to perceive why  maupassant is an intensely national writer  he is so intensely national in his logic in his clearness in his aesthetic and moral conceptions that he has been accepted by his countrymen without having had to pay the tribute of flattery either to the nation as a whole or to any class sphere or division of the nation the truth of his art tells with an irresistible force and he stands excused from the duty of patriotic posturing  he is a frenchman of frenchmen beyond question or cavil and with that he is simple enough to be universally comprehensible  what is wanting to his universal success is the mediocrity of an obvious and appealing tenderness  he neglects to qualify his truth with the drop of facile sweetness he forgets to strew paper roses over the tombs  the disregard of these common decencies lays him open to the charges of cruelty cynicism hardness  and yet it can be safely affirmed that this man wrote from the fulness of a compassionate heart  he is merciless and yet gentle with his mankind he does not rail at their prudent fears and their small artifices he does not despise their labours  it seems to me that he looks with an eye of profound pity upon their troubles deceptions and misery  but he looks at them all  he seesand does not turn away his head  as a matter of fact he is courageous  courage and justice are not popular virtues  the practice of strict justice is shocking to the multitude who always perhaps from an obscure sense of guilt attach to it the meaning of mercy  in the majority of us who want to be left alone with our illusions courage inspires a vague alarm  this is what is felt about maupassant  his qualities to use the charming and popular phrase are not lovable  courage being a force will not masquerade in the robes of affected delicacy and restraint  but if his courage is not of a chivalrous stamp it cannot be denied that it is never brutal for the sake of effect  the writer of these few reflections inspired by a long and intimate acquaintance with the work of the man has been struck by the appreciation of maupassant manifested by many women gifted with tenderness and intelligence  their more delicate and audacious souls are good judges of courage  their finer penetration has discovered his genuine masculinity without display his virility without a pose  they have discerned in his faithful dealings with the world that enterprising and fearless temperament poor in ideas but rich in power which appeals most to the feminine mind  it cannot be denied that he thinks very little  in him extreme energy of perception achieves great results as in men of action the energy of force and desire  his view of intellectual problems is perhaps more simple than their nature warrants still a man who has written yvette cannot be accused of want of subtlety  but one cannot insist enough upon this that his subtlety his humour his grimness though no doubt they are his own are never presented otherwise but as belonging to our life as found in nature whose beauties and cruelties alike breathe the spirit of serene unconsciousness  maupassants philosophy of life is more temperamental than rational  he expects nothing from gods or men  he trusts his senses for information and his instinct for deductions  it may seem that he has made but little use of his mind  but let me be clearly understood  his sensibility is really very great and it is impossible to be sensible unless one thinks vividly unless one thinks correctly starting from intelligible premises to an unsophisticated conclusion  this is literary honesty  it may be remarked that it does not differ very greatly from the ideal honesty of the respectable majority from the honesty of lawgivers of warriors of kings of bricklayers of all those who express their fundamental sentiment in the ordinary course of their activities by the work of their hands  the work of maupassants hands is honest  he thinks sufficiently to concrete his fearless conclusions in illuminative instances  he renders them with that exact knowledge of the means and that absolute devotion to the aim of creating a true effectwhich is art  he is the most accomplished of narrators  it is evident that maupassant looked upon his mankind in another spirit than those writers who make haste to submerge the difficulties of our holdingplace in the universe under a flood of false and sentimental assumptions  maupassant was a true and dutiful lover of our earth  he says himself in one of his descriptive passages nous autres que seduit la terre     it was true  the earth had for him a compelling charm he looks upon her august and furrowed face with the fierce insight of real passion  his is the power of detecting the one immutable quality that matters in the changing aspects of nature and under the evershifting surface of life  to say that he could not embrace in his glance all its magnificence and all its misery is only to say that he was human  he lays claim to nothing that his matchless vision has not made his own  this creative artist has the true imagination he never condescends to invent anything he sets up no empty pretences  and he stoops to no littleness in his artleast of all to the miserable vanity of a catching phrase    anatole france1904   icrainquebille   the latest volume of m anatole france purports by the declaration of its titlepage to contain several profitable narratives  the story of crainquebilles encounter with human justice stands at the head of them a tale of a wellbestowed charity closes the book with the touch of playful irony characteristic of the writer on whom the most distinguished amongst his literary countrymen have conferred the rank of prince of prose  never has a dignity been better borne  m anatole france is a good prince  he knows nothing of tyranny but much of compassion  the detachment of his mind from common errors and current superstitions befits the exalted rank he holds in the commonwealth of literature  it is just to suppose that the clamour of the tribes in the forum had little to do with his elevation  their elect are of another stamp  they are such as their need of precipitate action requires  he is the elect of the senatethe senate of letterswhose conscript fathers have recognised him as primus inter pares a post of pure honour and of no privilege  it is a good choice  first because it is just and next because it is safe  the dignity will suffer no diminution in m anatole frances hands  he is worthy of a great tradition learned in the lessons of the past concerned with the present and as earnest as to the future as a good prince should be in his public action  it is a republican dignity and m anatole france with his sceptical insight into an forms of government is a good republican  he is indulgent to the weaknesses of the people and perceives that political institutions whether contrived by the wisdom of the few or the ignorance of the many are incapable of securing the happiness of mankind  he perceives this truth in the serenity of his soul and in the elevation of his mind  he expresses his convictions with measure restraint and harmony which are indeed princely qualities  he is a great analyst of illusions  he searches and probes their innermost recesses as if they were realities made of an eternal substance  and therein consists his humanity this is the expression of his profound and unalterable compassion  he will flatter no tribe no section in the forum or in the marketplace  his lucid thought is not beguiled into false pity or into the common weakness of affection  he feels that men born in ignorance as in the house of an enemy and condemned to struggle with error and passions through endless centuries should be spared the supreme cruelty of a hope for ever deferred  he knows that our best hopes are irrealisable that it is the almost incredible misfortune of mankind but also its highest privilege to aspire towards the impossible that men have never failed to defeat their highest aims by the very strength of their humanity which can conceive the most gigantic tasks but leaves them disarmed before their irremediable littleness  he knows this well because he is an artist and a master but he knows too that only in the continuity of effort there is a refuge from despair for minds less clearseeing and philosophic than his own  therefore he wishes us to believe and to hope preserving in our activity the consoling illusion of power and intelligent purpose  he is a good and politic prince  the majesty of justice is contained entire in each sentence pronounced by the judge in the name of the sovereign people  jerome crainquebille hawker of vegetables became aware of the august aspect of the law as he stood indicted before the tribunal of the higher police court on a charge of insulting a constable of the force  with this exposition begins the first tale of m anatole frances latest volume  the bust of the republic and the image of the crucified christ appear side by side above the bench occupied by the president bourriche and his two assessors all the laws divine and human are suspended over the head of crainquebille  from the first visual impression of the accused and of the court the author passes by a characteristic and natural turn to the historical and moral significance of those two emblems of state and religion whose accord is only possible to the confused reasoning of an average man  but the reasoning of m anatole france is never confused  his reasoning is clear and informed by a profound erudition  such is not the case of crainquebille a street hawker charged with insulting the constituted power of society in the person of a policeman  the charge is not true nothing was further from his thoughts but amazed by the novelty of his position he does not reflect that the cross on the wall perpetuates the memory of a sentence which for nineteen hundred years all the christian peoples have looked upon as a grave miscarriage of justice  he might well have challenged the president to pronounce any sort of sentence if it were merely to fortyeight hours of simple imprisonment in the name of the crucified redeemer  he might have done so  but crainquebille who has lived pushing every day for half a century his handbarrow loaded with vegetables through the streets of paris has not a philosophic mind  truth to say he has nothing  he is one of the disinherited  properly speaking he has no existence at all or to be strictly truthful he had no existence till m anatole frances philosophic mind and human sympathy have called him up from his nothingness for our pleasure and as the titlepage of the book has it no doubt for our profit also  therefore we behold him in the dock a stranger to all historical political or social considerations which can be brought to bear upon his case  he remains lost in astonishment  penetrated with respect overwhelmed with awe he is ready to trust the judge upon the question of his transgression  in his conscience he does not think himself culpable but m anatole frances philosophical mind discovers for us that he feels all the insignificance of such a thing as the conscience of a mere street hawker in the face of the symbols of the law and before the ministers of social repression  crainquebille is innocent but already the young advocate his defender has half persuaded him of his guilt  on this phrase practically ends the introductory chapter of the story which as the authors dedication states has inspired an admirable draughtsman and a skilful dramatist each in his art to a vision of tragic grandeur  and this opening chapter without a nameconsisting of two and a half pages some four hundred words at mostis a masterpiece of insight and simplicity resumed in m anatole frances distinction of thought and in his princely command of words  it is followed by six more short chapters concise and full delicate and complete like the petals of a flower presenting to us the adventure of crainquebillecrainquebille before the justicean apology for the president of the tribunalof the submission of crainquebille to the laws of the republicof his attitude before the public opinion and so on to the chapter of the last consequences  we see created for us in his outward form and innermost perplexity the old man degraded from his high estate of a lawabiding streethawker and driven to insult really this time the majesty of the social order in the person of another police constable  it is not an act of revolt and still less of revenge crainquebille is too old too resigned too weary too guileless to raise the black standard of insurrection  he is cold and homeless and starving  he remembers the warmth and the food of the prison  he perceives the means to get back there  since he has been locked up he argues with himself for uttering words which as a matter of fact he did not say he will go forth now and to the first policeman he meets will say those very words in order to be imprisoned again  thus reasons crainquebille with simplicity and confidence  he accepts facts  nothing surprises him  but all the phenomena of social organisation and of his own life remain for him mysterious to the end  the description of the policeman in his short cape and hood who stands quite still under the light of a street lamp at the edge of the pavement shining with the wet of a rainy autumn evening along the whole extent of a long and deserted thoroughfare is a perfect piece of imaginative precision  from under the edge of the hood his eyes look upon crainquebille who has just uttered in an uncertain voice the sacramental insulting phrase of the popular slangmort aux vaches  they look upon him shining in the deep shadow of the hood with an expression of sadness vigilance and contempt  he does not move  crainquebille in a feeble and hesitating voice repeats once more the insulting words  but this policeman is full of philosophic superiority disdain and indulgence  he refuses to take in charge the old and miserable vagabond who stands before him shivering and ragged in the drizzle  and the ruined crainquebille victim of a ridiculous miscarriage of justice appalled at this magnanimity passes on hopelessly down the street full of shadows where the lamps gleam each in a ruddy halo of falling mist  m anatole france can speak for the people  this prince of the senate is invested with the tribunitian power  m anatole france is something of a socialist and in that respect he seems to depart from his sceptical philosophy  but as an illustrious statesman now no more a great prince too with an ironic mind and a literary gift has sarcastically remarked in one of his public speeches we are all socialists now  and in the sense in which it may be said that we all in europe are christians that is true enough  to many of us socialism is merely an emotion  an emotion is much and is also less than nothing  it is the initial impulse  the real socialism of today is a religion  it has its dogmas the value of the dogma does not consist in its truthfulness and m anatole france who loves truth does not love dogma  only unlike religion the cohesive strength of socialism lies not in its dogmas but in its ideal  it is perhaps a too materialistic ideal and the mind of m anatole france may not find in it either comfort or consolation  it is not to be doubted that he suspects this himself but there is something reposeful in the finality of popular conceptions  m anatole france a good prince and a good republican will succeed no doubt in being a good socialist  he will disregard the stupidity of the dogma and the unlovely form of the ideal  his art will find its own beauty in the imaginative presentation of wrongs of errors and miseries that call aloud for redress  m anatole france is humane  he is also human  he may be able to discard his philosophy to forget that the evils are many and the remedies are few that there is no universal panacea that fatality is invincible that there is an implacable menace of death in the triumph of the humanitarian idea  he may forget all that because love is stronger than truth  besides crainquebille this volume contains sixteen other stories and sketches  to define them it is enough to say that they are written in m anatole frances prose  one sketch entitled riquet may be found incorporated in the volume of monsieur bergeret a paris  putois is a remarkable little tale significant humorous amusing and symbolic  it concerns the career of a man born in the utterance of a hasty and untruthful excuse made by a lady at a loss how to decline without offence a very pressing invitation to dinner from a very tyrannical aunt  this happens in a provincial town and the lady says in effect impossible my dear aunt  tomorrow i am expecting the gardener  and the garden she glances at is a poor garden it is a wild garden its extent is insignificant and its neglect seems beyond remedy  a gardener  what for asks the aunt  to work in the garden  and the poor lady is abashed at the transparence of her evasion  but the lie is told it is believed and she sticks to it  when the masterful old aunt inquires what is the mans name my dear she answers brazenly his name is putois  where does he live  oh i dont know anywhere  he wont give his address  one leaves a message for him here and there  oh  i see says the other he is a sort of neer do well an idler a vagabond  i advise you my dear to be careful how you let such a creature into your grounds but i have a large garden and when you do not want his services i shall find him some work to do and see he does it too  tell your putois to come and see me  and thereupon putois is born he stalks abroad invisible upon his career of vagabondage and crime stealing melons from gardens and teaspoons from pantries indulging his licentious proclivities becoming the talk of the town and of the countryside seen simultaneously in fardistant places pursued by gendarmes whose brigadier assures the uneasy householders that he knows that scamp very well and wont be long in laying his hands upon him  a detailed description of his person collected from the information furnished by various people appears in the columns of a local newspaper putois lives in his strength and malevolence  he lives after the manner of legendary heroes of the gods of olympus  he is the creation of the popular mind  there comes a time when even the innocent originator of that mysterious and potent evildoer is induced to believe for a moment that he may have a real and tangible presence  all this is told with the wit and the art and the philosophy which is familiar to m anatole frances readers and admirers  for it is difficult to read m anatole france without admiring him  he has the princely gift of arousing a spontaneous loyalty but with this difference that the consent of our reason has its place by the side of our enthusiasm  he is an artist  as an artist he awakens emotion  the quality of his art remains as an inspiration fascinating and inscrutable but the proceedings of his thought compel our intellectual admiration  in this volume the trifle called the military manoeuvres at montil apart from its farreaching irony embodies incidentally the very spirit of automobilism  somehow or other how you cannot tell the flight over the country in a motorcar its sensations its fatigue its vast topographical range its incidents down to the bursting of a tyre are brought home to you with all the force of high imaginative perception  it would be out of place to analyse here the means by which the true impression is conveyed so that the absurd rushing about of general decuir in a 30horsepower car in search of his cavalry brigade becomes to you a more real experience than any dayandnight run you may ever have taken yourself  suffice it to say that m anatole france had thought the thing worth doing and that it becomes in virtue of his art a distinct achievement  and there are other sketches in this book more or less slight but all worthy of regardthe childhoods recollections of professor bergeret and his sister zoe the dialogue of the two upright judges and the conversation of their horses the dream of m jean marteau aimless extravagant apocalyptic and of all the dreams one ever dreamt the most essentially dreamlike  the vision of m anatole france the prince of prose ranges over all the extent of his realm indulgent and penetrating disillusioned and curious finding treasures of truth and beauty concealed from less gifted magicians  contemplating the exactness of his images and the justice of his judgment the freedom of his fancy and the fidelity of his purpose one becomes aware of the futility of literary watchwords and the vanity of all the schools of fiction  not that m anatole france is a wild and untrammelled genius he is not that  issued legitimately from the past he is mindful of his high descent  he has a critical temperament joined to creative power  he surveys his vast domain in a spirit of princely moderation that knows nothing of excesses but much of restraint   iilile des pingouins   m anatole france historian and adventurer has given us many profitable histories of saints and sinners of roman procurators and of officials of the third republic of grandes dames and of dames not so very grand of ornate latinists and of inarticulate street hawkers of priests and generalsin fact the history of all humanity as it appears to his penetrating eye serving a mind marvellously incisive in its scepticism and a heart that of all contemporary hearts gifted with a voice contains the greatest treasure of charitable irony  as to m anatole frances adventures these are wellknown  they lie open to this prodigal world in the four volumes of the vie litteraire describing the adventures of a choice soul amongst masterpieces  for such is the romantic view m anatole france takes of the life of a literary critic history and adventure then seem to be the chosen fields for the magnificent evolutions of m anatole frances prose but no material limits can stand in the way of a genius  the latest book from his penwhich may be called golden as the lips of an eloquent saint once upon a time were acclaimed golden by the faithfulthis latest book is up to a certain point a book of travel  i would not mislead a public whose confidence i court  the book is not a record of globetrotting  i regret it  it would have been a joy to watch m anatole france pouring the clear elixir compounded of his pyrrhonic philosophy his benedictine erudition his gentle wit and most humane irony into such an unpromising and opaque vessel  he would have attempted it in a spirit of benevolence towards his fellow men and of compassion for that life of the earth which is but a vain and transitory illusion  m anatole france is a great magician yet there seem to be tasks which he dare not face  for he is also a sage  it is a book of ocean travelnot however as understood by herr ballin of hamburg the machiavel of the atlantic  it is a book of exploration and discoverynot however as conceived by an enterprising journal and a shrewdly philanthropic king of the nineteenth century  it is nothing so recent as that  it dates much further back long long before the dark age when krupp of essen wrought at his steel plates and a german emperor condescendingly suggested the last improvements in ships dining tables  the best idea of the inconceivable antiquity of that enterprise i can give you is by stating the nature of the explorers ship  it was a trough of stone a vessel of hollowed granite  the explorer was st mael a saint of armorica  i had never heard of him before but i believe now in his arduous existence with a faith which is a tribute to m anatole frances pious earnestness and delicate irony st mael existed  it is distinctly stated of him that his life was a progress in virtue  thus it seems that there may be saints that are not progressively virtuous  st mael was not of that kind  he was industrious  he evangelised the heathen  he erected two hundred and eighteen chapels and seventyfour abbeys  indefatigable navigator of the faith he drifted casually in the miraculous trough of stone from coast to coast and from island to island along the northern seas  at the age of eightyfour his high stature was bowed by his long labours but his sinewy arms preserved their vigour and his rude eloquence had lost nothing of its force  a nautical devil tempting him by the worldly suggestion of fitting out his desultory miraculous trough with mast sail and rudder for swifter progression the idea of haste has sprung from the pride of satan the simple old saint lent his ear to the subtle arguments of the progressive enemy of mankind  the venerable st mael fell away from grace by not perceiving at once that a gift of heaven cannot be improved by the contrivances of human ingenuity  his punishment was adequate  a terrific tempest snatched the rigged ship of stone in its whirlwinds and to be brief the dazed st mael was stranded violently on the island of penguins  the saint wandered away from the shore  it was a flat round island whence rose in the centre a conical mountain capped with clouds  the rain was falling incessantlya gentle soft rain which caused the simple saint to exclaim in great delight this is the island of tears the island of contrition  meantime the inhabitants had flocked in their tens of thousands to an amphitheatre of rocks they were penguins but the holy man rendered deaf and purblind by his years mistook excusably the multitude of silly erect and selfimportant birds for a human crowd  at once he began to preach to them the doctrine of salvation  having finished his discourse he lost no time in administering to his interesting congregation the sacrament of baptism  if you are at all a theologian you will see that it was no mean adventure to happen to a wellmeaning and zealous saint  pray reflect on the magnitude of the issues  it is easy to believe what m anatole france says that when the baptism of the penguins became known in paradise it caused there neither joy nor sorrow but a profound sensation  m anatole france is no mean theologian himself  he reports with great casuistical erudition the debates in the saintly council assembled in heaven for the consideration of an event so disturbing to the economy of religious mysteries  ultimately the baptised penguins had to be turned into human beings and together with the privilege of sublime hopes these innocent birds received the curse of original sin with the labours the miseries the passions and the weaknesses attached to the fallen condition of humanity  at this point m anatole france is again an historian  from being the hakluyt of a saintly adventurer he turns but more concisely into the gibbon of imperial penguins  tracing the development of their civilisation the absurdity of their desires the pathos of their folly and the ridiculous littleness of their quarrels his golden pen lightens by relevant but unpuritanical anecdotes the austerity of a work devoted to a subject so grave as the polity of penguins  it is a very admirable treatment and i hasten to congratulate all men of receptive mind on the feast of wisdom which is theirs for the mere plucking of a book from a shelf    turgenev 21917   dear edward  i am glad to hear that you are about to publish a study of turgenev that fortunate artist who has found so much in life for us and no doubt for himself with the exception of bare justice  perhaps that will come to him too in time  your study may help the consummation  for his luck persists after his death  what greater luck an artist like turgenev could wish for than to find in the englishspeaking world a translator who has missed none of the most delicate most simple beauties of his work and a critic who has known how to analyse and point out its high qualities with perfect sympathy and insight  after twenty odd years of friendship and my first literary friendship too i may well permit myself to make that statement while thinking of your wonderful prefaces as they appeared from time to time in the volumes of turgenevs complete edition the last of which came into the light of public indifference in the ninetyninth year of the nineteenth century  with that year one may say with some justice that the age of turgenev had come to an end too yet work so simple and human so independent of the transitory formulas and theories of art belongs as you point out in the preface to smoke to all time  turgenevs creative activity covers about thirty years  since it came to an end the social and political events in russia have moved at an accelerated pace but the deep origins of them in the moral and intellectual unrest of the souls are recorded in the whole body of his work with the unerring lucidity of a great national writer  the first stirrings the first gleams of the great forces can be seen almost in every page of the novels of the short stories and of a sportsmans sketchesthose marvellous landscapes peopled by unforgettable figures  those will never grow old  fashions in monsters do change but the truth of humanity goes on for ever unchangeable and inexhaustible in the variety of its disclosures  whether turgenevs art which has captured it with such mastery and such gentleness is for all time it is hard to say  since as you say yourself he brings all his problems and characters to the test of love we may hope that it will endure at least till the infinite emotions of love are replaced by the exact simplicity of perfected eugenics  but even by then i think women would not have changed much and the women of turgenev who understood them so tenderly so reverently and so passionatelythey at least are certainly for all time  women are one may say the foundation of his art  they are russian of course  never was a writer so profoundly so wholesouledly national but for nonrussian readers turgenevs russia is but a canvas on which the incomparable artist of humanity lays his colours and his forms in the great light and the free air of the world  had he invented them all and also every stick and stone brook and hill and field in which they move his personages would have been just as true and as poignant in their perplexed lives  they are his own and also universal  any one can accept them with no more question than one accepts the italians of shakespeare  in the larger nonrussian view what should make turgenev sympathetic and welcome to the englishspeaking world is his essential humanity  all his creations fortunate and unfortunate oppressed and oppressors are human beings not strange beasts in a menagerie or damned souls knocking themselves to pieces in the stuffy darkness of mystical contradictions they are human beings fit to live fit to suffer fit to struggle fit to win fit to lose in the endless and inspiring game of pursuing from day to day the everreceding future  i began by calling him lucky and he was in a sense  but one ends by having some doubts  to be so great without the slightest parade and so fine without any tricks of cleverness must be fatal to any mans influence with his contemporaries  frankly i dont want to appear as qualified to judge of things russian it wouldnt be true  i know nothing of them  but i am aware of a few general truths such as for instance that no man whatever may be the loftiness of his character the purity of his motives and the peace of his conscienceno man i say likes to be beaten with sticks during the greater part of his existence  from what one knows of his history it appears clearly that in russia almost any stick was good enough to beat turgenev with in his latter years  when he died the characteristically chickenhearted autocracy hastened to stuff his mortal envelope into the tomb it refused to honour while the sensitive revolutionists went on for a time flinging after his shade those jeers and curses from which that impartial lover of all his countrymen had suffered so much in his lifetime  for he too was sensitive  every page of his writing bears its testimony to the fatal absence of callousness in the man  and now he suffers a little from other things  in truth it is not the convulsed terrorhaunted dostoievski but the serene turgenev who is under a curse  for only think  every gift has been heaped on his cradle absolute sanity and the deepest sensibility the clearest vision and the quickest responsiveness penetrating insight and unfailing generosity of judgment an exquisite perception of the visible world and an unerring instinct for the significant for the essential in the life of men and women the clearest mind the warmest heart the largest sympathyand all that in perfect measure  theres enough there to ruin the prospects of any writer  for you know very well my dear edward that if you had antinous himself in a booth of the worlds fair and killed yourself in protesting that his soul was as perfect as his body you wouldnt get one per cent of the crowd struggling next door for a sight of the double headed nightingale or of some weakkneed giant grinning through a horse collar  j c    stephen cranea note without dates1919   my acquaintance with stephen crane was brought about by mr pawling partner in the publishing firm of mr william heinemann  one day mr pawling said to me stephen crane has arrived in england  i asked him if there was anybody he wanted to meet and he mentioned two names  one of them was yours  i had then just been reading like the rest of the world cranes red badge of courage  the subject of that story was war from the point of view of an individual soldiers emotions  that individual he remains nameless throughout was interesting enough in himself but on turning over the pages of that little book which had for the moment secured such a noisy recognition i had been even more interested in the personality of the writer  the picture of a simple and untried youth becoming through the needs of his country part of a great fighting machine was presented with an earnestness of purpose a sense of tragic issues and an imaginative force of expression which struck me as quite uncommon and altogether worthy of admiration  apparently stephen crane had received a favourable impression from the reading of the nigger of the narcissus a book of mine which had also been published lately  i was truly pleased to hear this  on my next visit to town we met at a lunch  i saw a young man of medium stature and slender build with very steady penetrating blue eyes the eyes of a being who not only sees visions but can brood over them to some purpose  he had indeed a wonderful power of vision which he applied to the things of this earth and of our mortal humanity with a penetrating force that seemed to reach within lifes appearances and forms the very spirit of lifes truth  his ignorance of the world at largehe had seen very little of itdid not stand in the way of his imaginative grasp of facts events and picturesque men  his manner was very quiet his personality at first sight interesting and he talked slowly with an intonation which on some people mainly americans had i believe a jarring effect  but not on me  whatever he said had a personal note and he expressed himself with a graphic simplicity which was extremely engaging  he knew little of literature either of his own country or of any other but he was himself a wonderful artist in words whenever he took a pen into his hand  then his gift came outand it was seen then to be much more than mere felicity of language his impressionism of phrase went really deeper than the surface  in his writing he was very sure of his effects  i dont think he was ever in doubt about what he could do  yet it often seemed to me that he was but half aware of the exceptional quality of his achievement  this achievement was curtailed by his early death  it was a great loss to his friends but perhaps not so much to literature  i think that he had given his measure fully in the few books he had the time to write let me not be misunderstood the loss was great but it was the loss of the delight his art could give not the loss of any further possible revelation  as to himself who can say how much he gained or lost by quitting so early this world of the living which he knew how to set before us in the terms of his own artistic vision  perhaps he did not lose a great deal  the recognition he was accorded was rather languid and given him grudgingly  the worthiest welcome he secured for his tales in this country was from mr w henley in the new review and later towards the end of his life from the late mr william blackwood in his magazine  for the rest i must say that during his sojourn in england he had the misfortune to be as the french say mal entoure  he was beset by people who understood not the quality of his genius and were antagonistic to the deeper fineness of his nature  some of them have died since but dead or alive they are not worth speaking about now  i dont think he had any illusions about them himself yet there was a strain of goodnature and perhaps of weakness in his character which prevented him from shaking himself free from their worthless and patronising attentions which in those days caused me much secret irritation whenever i stayed with him in either of his english homes  my wife and i like best to remember him riding to meet us at the gate of the park at brede  born master of his sincere impressions he was also a born horseman  he never appeared so happy or so much to advantage as on the back of a horse  he had formed the project of teaching my eldest boy to ride and meantime when the child was about two years old presented him with his first dog  i saw stephen crane a few days after his arrival in london  i saw him for the last time on his last day in england  it was in dover in a big hotel in a bedroom with a large window looking on to the sea  he had been very ill and mrs crane was taking him to some place in germany but one glance at that wasted face was enough to tell me that it was the most forlorn of all hopes  the last words he breathed out to me were i am tired  give my love to your wife and child  when i stopped at the door for another look i saw that he had turned his head on the pillow and was staring wistfully out of the window at the sails of a cutter yacht that glided slowly across the frame like a dim shadow against the grey sky  those who have read his little tale horses and the story the open boat in the volume of that name know with what fine understanding he loved horses and the sea  and his passage on this earth was like that of a horseman riding swiftly in the dawn of a day fated to be short and without sunshine    tales of the sea1898   it is by his irresistible power to reach the adventurous side in the character not only of his own but of all nations that marryat is largely human  he is the enslaver of youth not by the literary artifices of presentation but by the natural glamour of his own temperament  to his young heroes the beginning of life is a splendid and warlike lark ending at last in inheritance and marriage  his novels are not the outcome of his art but of his character like the deeds that make up his record of naval service  to the artist his work is interesting as a completely successful expression of an unartistic nature  it is absolutely amazing to us as the disclosure of the spirit animating the stirring time when the nineteenth century was young  there is an air of fable about it  its loss would be irreparable like the curtailment of national story or the loss of an historical document  it is the beginning and the embodiment of an inspiring tradition  to this writer of the sea the sea was not an element  it was a stage where was displayed an exhibition of valour and of such achievement as the world had never seen before  the greatness of that achievement cannot be pronounced imaginary since its reality has affected the destinies of nations nevertheless in its grandeur it has all the remoteness of an ideal  history preserves the skeleton of facts and here and there a figure or a name but it is in marryats novels that we find the mass of the nameless that we see them in the flesh that we obtain a glimpse of the everyday life and an insight into the spirit animating the crowd of obscure men who knew how to build for their country such a shining monument of memories  marryat is really a writer of the service  what sets him apart is his fidelity  his pen serves his country as well as did his professional skill and his renowned courage  his figures move about between water and sky and the water and the sky are there only to frame the deeds of the service  his novels like amphibious creatures live on the sea and frequent the shore where they flounder deplorably  the loves and the hates of his boys are as primitive as their virtues and their vices  his women from the beautiful agnes to the witchlike mother of lieutenant vanslyperken are with the exception of the sailors wives like the shadows of what has never been  his silvas his ribieras his shriftens his delmars remind us of people we have heard of somewhere many times without ever believing in their existence  his morality is honourable and conventional  there is cruelty in his fun and he can invent puns in the midst of carnage  his naiveties are perpetrated in a lurid light there is an endless variety of types all surface with hard edges with memorable eccentricities of outline with a childish and heroic effect in the drawing  they do not belong to life they belong exclusively to the service  and yet they live there is a truth in them the truth of their time a headlong reckless audacity an intimacy with violence an unthinking fearlessness and an exuberance of vitality which only years of war and victories can give  his adventures are enthralling the rapidity of his action fascinates his method is crude his sentimentality obviously incidental is often factitious  his greatness is undeniable  it is undeniable  to a multitude of readers the navy of today is marryats navy still  he has created a priceless legend  if he be not immortal yet he will last long enough for the highest ambition because he has dealt manfully with an inspiring phase in the history of that service on which the life of his country depends  the tradition of the great past he has fixed in his pages will be cherished for ever as the guarantee of the future  he loved his country first the service next the sea perhaps not at all  but the sea loved him without reserve  it gave him his professional distinction and his authors famea fame such as not often falls to the lot of a true artist  at the same time on the other side of the atlantic another man wrote of the sea with true artistic instinct  he is not invincibly young and heroic he is mature and human though for him also the stress of adventure and endeavour must end fatally in inheritance and marriage  for james fenimore cooper nature was not the framework it was an essential part of existence  he could hear its voice he could understand its silence and he could interpret both for us in his prose with all that felicity and sureness of effect that belong to a poetical conception alone  his fame as wide but less brilliant than that of his contemporary rests mostly on a novel which is not of the sea  but he loved the sea and looked at it with consummate understanding  in his sea tales the sea interpenetrates with life it is in a subtle way a factor in the problem of existence and for all its greatness it is always in touch with the men who bound on errands of war or gain traverse its immense solitudes  his descriptions have the magistral ampleness of a gesture indicating the sweep of a vast horizon  they embrace the colours of sunset the peace of starlight the aspects of calm and storm the great loneliness of the waters the stillness of watchful coasts and the alert readiness which marks men who live face to face with the promise and the menace of the sea  he knows the men and he knows the sea  his method may be often faulty but his art is genuine  the truth is within him  the road to legitimate realism is through poetical feeling and he possesses thatonly it is expressed in the leisurely manner of his time  he has the knowledge of simple hearts  long tom coffin is a monumental seaman with the individuality of life and the significance of a type  it is hard to believe that manual and borroughcliffe mr marble of marblehead captain tuck of the packetship montauk or daggett the tenacious commander of the sea lion of marthas vineyard must pass away some day and be utterly forgotten  his sympathy is large and his humour is as genuineand as perfectly unaffectedas is his art  in certain passages he reaches very simply the heights of inspired vision  he wrote before the great american language was born and he wrote as well as any novelist of his time  if he pitches upon episodes redounding to the glory of the young republic surely england has glory enough to forgive him for the sake of his excellence the patriotic bias at her expense  the interest of his tales is convincing and unflagging and there runs through his work a steady vein of friendliness for the old country which the succeeding generations of his compatriots have replaced by a less definite sentiment  perhaps no two authors of fiction influenced so many lives and gave to so many the initial impulse towards a glorious or a useful career  through the distances of space and time those two men of another race have shaped also the life of the writer of this appreciation  life is life and art is artand truth is hard to find in either  yet in testimony to the achievement of both these authors it may be said that in the case of the writer at least the youthful glamour the headlong vitality of the one and the profound sympathy the artistic insight of the otherto which he had surrenderedhave withstood the brutal shock of facts and the wear of laborious years  he has never regretted his surrender    an observer in malaya 31898   in his new volume mr hugh clifford at the beginning of the sketch entitled at the heels of the white man expresses his anxiety as to the state of englands account in the daybook of the recording angel for the good and the bad we have doneboth with the most excellent intentions  the intentions will no doubt count for something though of course every nations conquests are paved with good intentions or it may be that the recording angel looking compassionately at the strife of hearts may disdain to enter into the eternal book the facts of a struggle which has the reward of its righteousness even on this earthin victory and lasting greatness or in defeat and humiliation  and also love will count for much  if the opinion of a lookeron from afar is worth anything mr hugh cliffords anxiety about his countrys record is needless  to the malays whom he governs instructs and guides he is the embodiment of the intentions of the conscience and might of his race  and of all the nations conquering distant territories in the name of the most excellent intentions england alone sends out men who with such a transparent sincerity of feeling can speak as mr hugh clifford does of the place of toil and exile as the land which is very dear to me where the best years of my life have been spentand where i would stake my right hand on it his name is pronounced with respect and affection by those brown men about whom he writes  all these studies are on a high level of interest though not all on the same level  the descriptive chapters results of personal observation seem to me the most interesting  and indeed in a book of this kind it is the authors personality which awakens the greatest interest it shapes itself before one in the ring of sentences it is seen between the lineslike the progress of a traveller in the jungle that may be traced by the sound of the parang chopping the swaying creepers while the man himself is glimpsed now and then indistinct and passing between the trees  thus in his very vagueness of appearance the writer seen through the leaves of his book becomes a fascinating companion in a land of fascination  it is when dealing with the aspects of nature that mr hugh clifford is most convincing  he looks upon them lovingly for the land is very dear to him and he records his cherished impressions so that the forest the great flood the jungle the rapid river and the menacing rock dwell in the memory of the reader long after the book is closed  he does not say anything in so many words of his affection for those who live amid the scenes he describes so well but his humanity is large enough to pardon us if we suspect him of such a rare weakness  in his preface he expresses the regret at not having the gifts whatever they may be of the kailyard school orlooking up to a very different planethe genius of mr barrie  he has however gifts of his own and his genius has served his country and his fortunes in another direction  yet it is when attempting what he professes himself unable to do in telling us the simple story of umat the punkahpuller with unaffected simplicity and halfconcealed tenderness that he comes nearest to artistic achievement  each study in this volume presents some idea illustrated by a fact told without artifice but with an elective sureness of knowledge  the story of tukang buroks love related in the old mans own words conveys the very breath of malay thought and speech  in his little bill the coolie lim teng wah facing his debtor stands very distinct before us an insignificant and tragic victim of fate with whom he had quarrelled to the death over a matter of seven dollars and sixtyeight cents  the story of the schooner with a past may be heard from the straits eastward with many variations  out in the pacific the schooner becomes a cutter and the pearldivers are replaced by the blackbirds of the labour trade  but mr hugh cliffords variation is very good  there is a passage in ita triflejust the diver as seen coming up from the depths that in its dozen lines or so attains to distinct artistic value and scattered through the book there are many other passages of almost equal descriptive excellence  nevertheless to apply artistic standards to this book would be a fundamental error in appreciation  like faith enthusiasm or heroism art veils part of the truth of life to make the rest appear more splendid inspiring or sinister  and this book is only truth interesting and futile truth unadorned simple and straightforward  the resident of pahang has the devoted friendship of umat the punkahpuller he has an individual faculty of vision a large sympathy and the scrupulous consciousness of the good and evil in his hands  he may as well rest content with such gifts  one cannot expect to be at the same time a ruler of men and an irreproachable player on the flute    a happy wanderer1910   converts are interesting people  most of us if you will pardon me for betraying the universal secret have at some time or other discovered in ourselves a readiness to stray far ever so far on the wrong road and what did we do in our pride and our cowardice  casting fearful glances and waiting for a dark moment we buried our discovery discreetly and kept on in the old direction on that old beaten track we have not had courage enough to leave and which we perceive now more clearly than before to be but the arid way of the grave  the convert the man capable of grace i am speaking here in a secular sense is not discreet  his pride is of another kind he jumps gladly off the trackthe touch of grace is mostly suddenand facing about in a new direction may even attain the illusion of having turned his back on death itself  some converts have indeed earned immortality by their exquisite indiscretion  the most illustrious example of a convert that flower of chivalry don quixote de la mancha remains for all the world the only genuine immortal hidalgo  the delectable knight of spain became converted as you know from the ways of a small country squire to an imperative faith in a tender and sublime mission  forthwith he was beaten with sticks and in due course shut up in a wooden cage by the barber and the priest the fit ministers of a justly shocked social order  i do not know if it has occurred to anybody yet to shut up mr luffmann in a wooden cage 4  i do not raise the point because i wish him any harm  quite the contrary  i am a humane person  let him take it as the highest praisebut i must say that he richly deserves that sort of attention  on the other hand i would not have him unduly puffed up with the pride of the exalted association  the grave wisdom the admirable amenity the serene grace of the secular patronsaint of all mortals converted to noble visions are not his  mr luffmann has no mission  he is no knight sublimely errant  but he is an excellent vagabond  he is full of merit that peripatetic guide philosopher and friend of all nations mr roosevelt would promptly excommunicate him with a big stick  the truth is that the exautocrat of all the states does not like rebels against the sullen order of our universe  make the best of it or perishhe cries  a sane lineal successor of the barber and the priest and a sagacious political heir of the incomparable sancho panza another great governor that distinguished litterateur has no mercy for dreamers  and our author happens to be a man of you may trace them in his books some rather fine reveries  every convert begins by being a rebel and i do not see myself how any mercy can possibly be extended to mr luffmann  he is a convert from the creed of strenuous life  for this renegade the body is of little account to him work appears criminal when it suppresses the demands of the inner life while he was young he did grind virtuously at the sacred handle and now he says he has fallen into disgrace with some people because he believes no longer in toil without end  certain respectable folk hate himso he saysbecause he dares to think that poetry beauty and the broad face of the world are the best things to be in love with  he confesses to loving spain on the ground that she is the land of tomorrow and holds the gospel of nevermind  the universal striving to push ahead he considers mere vulgar folly  didnt i tell you he was a fit subject for the cage  it is a relief we are all humane are we not to discover that this desperate character is not altogether an outcast  little girls seem to like him  one of them after listening to some of his tales remarked to her mother wouldnt it be lovely if what he says were true  here you have woman  the charming creatures will neither strain at a camel nor swallow a gnat  not publicly  these operations without which the world they have such a large share in could not go on for ten minutes are left to usmen  and then we are chided for being coarse  this is a refined objection but does not seem fair  another little girlor perhaps the same little girlwrote to him in cordova i hope posterestante is a nice place and that you are very comfortable  woman again  i have in my time told some stories which are i hate false modesty both true and lovely  yet no little girl ever wrote to me in kindly terms  and why simply because i am not enough of a vagabond  the dear despots of the fireside have a weakness for lawless characters  this is amiable but does not seem rational  being quixotic mr luffmann is no impressionist  he is far too earnest in his heart and not half sufficiently precise in his style to be that but he is an excellent narrator  more than any vagabond i have ever met he knows what he is about  there is not one of his quiet days which is dull  you will find in them a lovestory not made up the coupdefoudre the lightningstroke of spanish love and you will marvel how a spell so sudden and vehement can be at the same time so tragically delicate  you will find there landladies devoured with jealousy astute housekeepers delightful boys wise peasants touchy shopkeepers all the cosas de espanaand in addition the pale girl rosario  i recommend that pathetic and silent victim of fate to your benevolent compassion  you will find in his pages the humours of starving workers of the soil the vision among the mountains of an exulting mad spirit in a mighty body and many other visions worthy of attention  and they are exact visions for this idealist is no visionary  he is in sympathy with suffering mankind and has a grasp on real human affairs  i mean the great and pitiful affairs concerned with bread love and the obscure unexpressed needs which drive great crowds to prayer in the holy places of the earth  but i like his conception of what a quiet life is like  his quiet days require no fewer than fortytwo of the fortynine provinces of spain to take their ease in  for his unquiet days i presume the sevenor is it ninecrystal spheres of alexandrian cosmogony would afford but a wretchedly straitened space  a most unconventional thing is his notion of quietness  one would take it as a joke only that perchance to the author of quiet days in spain all days may seem quiet because a courageous convert he is now at peace with himself  how better can we take leave of this interesting vagabond than with the road salutation of passing wayfarers and on you be peace    you have chosen your ideal and it is a good choice  theres nothing like giving up ones life to an unselfish passion  let the rich and the powerful of this globe preach their sound gospel of palpable progress the part of the ideal you embrace is the better one if only in its illusions  no great passion can be barren  may a world of gracious and poignant images attend the lofty solitude of your renunciation    the life beyond1910   you have no doubt noticed that certain books produce a sort of physical effect on onemostly an audible effect  i am not alluding here to blue books or to books of statistics  the effect of these is simply exasperating and no more  no the books i have in mind are just the common books of commerce you and i read when we have five minutes to spare the usual hired books published by ordinary publishers printed by ordinary printers and censored when they happen to be novels by the usual circulating libraries the guardians of our firesides whose names are household words within the four seas  to see the fair and the brave of this free country surrendering themselves with unbounded trust to the direction of the circulating libraries is very touching  it is even in a sense a beautiful spectacle because as you know humility is a rare and fragrant virtue and what can be more humble than to surrender your morals and your intellect to the judgment of one of your tradesmen  i suppose that there are some very perfect people who allow the army and navy stores to censor their diet  so much merit however i imagine is not frequently met with here below  the flesh alas is weak andfrom a certain point of viewso important  a superficial person might be rendered miserable by the simple question what would become of us if the circulating libraries ceased to exist  it is a horrid and almost indelicate supposition but let us be brave and face the truth  on this earth of ours nothing lasts  tout passe tout casse tout lasse  imagine the utter wreck overtaking the morals of our beautiful countryhouses should the circulating libraries suddenly die but pray do not shudder  there is no occasion  their spirit shall survive  i declare this from inward conviction and also from scientific information received lately  for observe the circulating libraries are human institutions  i beg you to follow me closely  they are human institutions and being human they are not animal and therefore they are spiritual  thus any man with enough money to take a shop stock his shelves and pay for advertisements shall be able to evoke the pure and censorious spectre of the circulating libraries whenever his own commercial spirit moves him  for and this is the information alluded to above science having in its infinite wanderings run up against various wonders and mysteries is apparently willing now to allow a spiritual quality to man and i conclude to all his works as well  i do not know exactly what this science may be and i do not think that anybody else knows but that is the information stated shortly  it is contained in a book reposing under my thoughtful eyes 5  i know it is not a censored book because i can see for myself that it is not a novel the author on his side warns me that it is not philosophy that it is not metaphysics that it is not natural science  after this comprehensive warning the definition of the book becomes you will admit a pretty hard nut to crack  but meantime let us return for a moment to my opening remark about the physical effect of some common hired books  a few of them not necessarily books of verse are melodious the music some others make for you as you read has the disagreeable emphasis of a barrelorgan the tinklingcymbals book it was not written by a humorist i only met once but there is infinite variety in the noises books do make  i have now on my shelves a book apparently of the most valuable kind which before i have read halfadozen lines begins to make a noise like a buzzsaw  i am inconsolable i shall never i fear discover what it is all about for the buzzing covers the words and at every try i am absolutely forced to give it up ere the end of the page is reached  the book however which i have found so difficult to define is by no means noisy  as a mere piece of writing it may be described as being breathless itself and taking the readers breath away not by the magnitude of its message but by a sort of anxious volubility in the delivery  the constantly elusive argument and the illustrative quotations go on without a single reflective pause  for this reason alone the reading of that work is a fatiguing process  the author himself i use his own words suspects that what he has written may be theology after all  it may be  it is not my place either to allay or to confirm the authors suspicion of his own work  but i will state its main thesis that science regarded in the gross dictates the spirituality of man and strongly implies a spiritual destiny for individual human beings  this means existence after deaththat is immortality  to find out its value you must go to the book  but i will observe here that an immortality liable at any moment to betray itself fatuously by the forcible incantations of mr stead or professor crookes is scarcely worth having  can you imagine anything more squalid than an immortality at the beck and call of eusapia palladino  that woman lives on the top floor of a neapolitan house and gets our poor pitiful august dead flesh of our flesh bone of our bone spirit of our spirit who have loved suffered and died as we must love suffer and dieshe gets them to beat tambourines in a corner and protrude shadowy limbs through a curtain  this is particularly horrible because if one had to put ones faith in these things one could not even die safely from disgust as one would long to do  and to believe that these manifestations which the author evidently takes for modern miracles will stay our tottering faith to believe that the new psychology has only the other day discovered man to be a spiritual mystery is really carrying humility towards that universal provider science too far        we moderns have complicated our old perplexities to the point of absurdity our perplexities older than religion itself  it is not for nothing that for so many centuries the priest mounting the steps of the altar murmurs why art thou sad my soul and why dost thou trouble me  since the day of creation two veiled figures doubt and melancholy are pacing endlessly in the sunshine of the world  what humanity needs is not the promise of scientific immortality but compassionate pity in this life and infinite mercy on the day of judgment  and for the rest during this transient hour of our pilgrimage we may well be content to repeat the invocation of sar peladan  sar peladan was an occultist a seer a modern magician  he believed in astrology in the spirits of the air in elves he was marvellously and deliciously absurd  incidentally he wrote some incomprehensible poems and a few pages of harmonious prose for you must know a magician is nothing else but a great harmonist  here are some eight lines of the magnificent invocation  let me however warn you strictly between ourselves that my translation is execrable  i am sorry to say i am no magician  o nature indulgent mother forgive  open your arms to the son prodigal and weary  i have attempted to tear asunder the veil you have hung to conceal from us the pain of life and i have been wounded by the mystery    oedipus half way to finding the word of the enigma young faust regretting already the simple life the life of the heart i come back to you repentant reconciled o gentle deceiver    the ascending effort1910   much good paper has been lamentably wasted to prove that science has destroyed that it is destroying or some day may destroy poetry meantime unblushing unseen and often unheard the guileless poets have gone on singing in a sweet strain  how they dare do the impossible and virtually forbidden thing is a cause for wonder but not for legislation not yet  we are at present too busy reforming the silent burglar and planning concerts to soothe the savage breast of the yelling hooligan  as somebodyperhaps a publishersaid lately poetry is of no account now adays  but it is not totally neglected  those persons with goldrimmed spectacles whose usual occupation is to spy upon the obvious have remarked audibly on several occasions that poetry has so far not given to science any acknowledgment worthy of its distinguished position in the popular mind  except that tennyson looked down the throat of a foxglove that erasmus darwin wrote the loves of the plants and a scoffer the loves of the triangles poets have been supposed to be indecorously blind to the progress of science  what tribute for instance has poetry paid to electricity  all i can remember on the spur of the moment is mr arthur symons line about arc lamps hung with the globes of some unnatural fruit  commerce and manufacture praise on every hand in their not mute but inarticulate way the glories of science  poetry does not play its part behold john keats skilful with the surgeons knife but when he writes poetry his inspiration is not from the operating table  here i am reminded though of a modern instance to the contrary in prose  mr h g wells who as far as i know has never written a line of verse was inspired a few years ago to write a short story under the knife  out of a clockdial a brass rod and a whiff of chloroform he has conjured for us a sensation of space and eternity evoked the face of the unknowable and an awesome august voice like the voice of the judgment day a great voice perhaps the voice of science itself uttering the words there shall be no more pain  i advise you to look up that story so human and so intimate because mr wells the writer of prose whose amazing inventiveness we all know remains a poet even in his most perverse moments of scorn for things as they are  his poetic imagination is sometimes even greater than his inventiveness i am not afraid to say but indeed imaginative faculty would make any man a poetwere he born without tongue for speech and without hands to seize his fancy and fasten her down to a wretched piece of paper        the book 6 which in the course of the last few days i have opened and shut several times is not imaginative  but on the other hand it is not a dumb book as some are  it has even a sort of sober and serious eloquence reminding us that not poetry alone is at fault in this matter mr bourne begins his ascending effort with a remark by sir francis galton upon eugenics that if the principles he was advocating were to become effective they must be introduced into the national conscience like a new religion  introduced suggests compulsory vaccination  mr bourne who is not a theologian wishes to league together not science and religion but science and the arts  the intoxicating power of art he thinks is the very thing needed to give the desired effect to the doctrines of science  in uninspired phrase he points to the arts playing once upon a time a part in popularising the christian tenets  with painstaking fervour as great as the fervour of prophets but not so persuasive he foresees the arts some day popularising science  until that day dawns science will continue to be lame and poetry blind  he himself cannot smooth or even point out the way though he thinks that a really prudent people would be greedy of beauty and their public authorities as careful of the sense of comfort as of sanitation  as the writer of those remarkable rustic notebooks the bettesworth book and memoirs of a surrey labourer the author has a claim upon our attention  but his seriousness his patience his almost touching sincerity can only command the respect of his readers and nothing more he is obsessed by science haunted and shadowed by it until he has been bewildered into awe  he knows indeed that art owes its triumphs and its subtle influence to the fact that it issues straight from our organic vitality and is a movement of lifecells with their matchless unintellectual knowledge  but the fact that poetry does not seem obviously in love with science has never made him doubt whether it may not be an argument against his haste to see the marriage ceremony performed amid public rejoicings  many a man has heard or read and believes that the earth goes round the sun one small blob of mud among several others spinning ridiculously with a waggling motion like a top about to fall  this is the copernican system and the man believes in the system without often knowing as much about it as its name  but while watching a sunset he sheds his belief he sees the sun as a small and useful object the servant of his needs and the witness of his ascending effort sinking slowly behind a range of mountains and then he holds the system of ptolemy  he holds it without knowing it  in the same way a poet hears reads and believes a thousand undeniable truths which have not yet got into his blood nor will do after reading mr bournes book he writes therefore as if neither truths nor book existed  life and the arts follow dark courses and will not turn aside to the brilliant arclights of science  some day without a doubtand it may be a consolation to mr bourne to know itfully informed critics will point out that mr daviess poem on a dark woman combing her hair must have been written after the invasion of appendicitis and that mr yeatss had i the heavens embroidered cloths came before radium was quite unnecessarily dragged out of its respectable obscurity in pitchblende to upset the venerable and comparatively naive chemistry of our young days  there are times when the tyranny of science and the cant of science are alarming but there are other times when they are entertainingand this is one of them  many a man prides himself says mr bourne on his piety or his views of art whose whole range of ideas could they be investigated would be found ordinary if not base because they have been adopted in compliance with some external persuasion or to serve some timid purpose instead of proceeding authoritatively from the living selection of his hereditary taste  this extract is a fair sample of the books thought and of its style  but mr bourne seems to forget that persuasion is a vain thing  the appreciation of great art comes from within  it is but the merest justice to say that the transparent honesty of mr bournes purpose is undeniable  but the whole book is simply an earnest expression of a pious wish and like the generality of pious wishes this one seems of little dynamic valuebesides being impracticable  yes indeed  art has served religion artists have found the most exalted inspiration in christianity but the light of transfiguration which has illuminated the profoundest mysteries of our sinful souls is not the light of the generating stations which exposes the depths of our infatuation where our mere cleverness is permitted for a while to grope for the unessential among invincible shadows    the censor of playsan appreciation1907   a couple of years ago i was moved to write a oneact playand i lived long enough to accomplish the task  we live and learn  when the play was finished i was informed that it had to be licensed for performance thus i learned of the existence of the censor of plays  i may say without vanity that i am intelligent enough to have been astonished by that piece of information for facts must stand in some relation to time and space and i was aware of being in englandin the twentiethcentury england  the fact did not fit the date and the place  that was my first thought  it was in short an improper fact  i beg you to believe that i am writing in all seriousness and am weighing my words scrupulously  therefore i dont say inappropriate  i say improperthat is something to be ashamed of  and at first this impression was confirmed by the obscurity in which the figure embodying this after all considerable fact had its being  the censor of plays  his name was not in the mouths of all men  far from it  he seemed stealthy and remote  there was about that figure the scent of the far east like the peculiar atmosphere of a mandarins back yard and the mustiness of the middle ages that epoch when mankind tried to stand still in a monstrous illusion of final certitude attained in morals intellect and conscience  it was a disagreeable impression  but i reflected that probably the censorship of plays was an inactive monstrosity not exactly a survival since it seemed obviously at variance with the genius of the people but an heirloom of past ages a bizarre and imported curiosity preserved because of that weakness one has for ones old possessions apart from any intrinsic value one more object of exotic virtu an oriental potiche a magot chinois conceived by a childish and extravagant imagination but allowed to stand in stolid impotence in the twilight of the upper shelf  thus i quieted my uneasy mind  its uneasiness had nothing to do with the fate of my oneact play  the play was duly produced and an exceptionally intelligent audience stared it coldly off the boards  it ceased to exist  it was a fair and open execution  but having survived the freezing atmosphere of that auditorium i continued to exist labouring under no sense of wrong  i was not pleased but i was content i was content to accept the verdict of a free and independent public judging after its conscience the work of its free independent and conscientious servantthe artist  only thus can the dignity of artistic servitude be preservednot to speak of the bare existence of the artist and the selfrespect of the man  i shall say nothing of the selfrespect of the public  to the self respect of the public the present appeal against the censorship is being made and i join in it with all my heart  for i have lived long enough to learn that the monstrous and outlandish figure the magot chinois whom i believed to be but a memorial of our forefathers mental aberration that grotesque potiche works  the absurd and hollow creature of clay seems to be alive with a sort of surely unconscious life worthy of its traditions  it heaves its stomach it rolls its eyes it brandishes a monstrous arm and with the censorship like a bravo of old venice with a more carnal weapon stabs its victim from behind in the twilight of its upper shelf  less picturesque than the venetian in cloak and mask less estimable too in this that the assassin plied his moral trade at his own risk deriving no countenance from the powers of the republic it stands more malevolent inasmuch that the bravo striking in the dusk killed but the body whereas the grotesque thing nodding its mandarin head may in its absurd unconsciousness strike down at any time the spirit of an honest of an artistic perhaps of a sublime creation  this chinese monstrosity disguised in the trousers of the western barbarian and provided by the state with the immortal mr stigginss plug hat and umbrella is with us  it is an office  an office of trust  and from time to time there is found an official to fill it  he is a public man  the least prominent of public men the most unobtrusive the most obscure if not the most modest  but however obscure a public man may be told the truth if only once in his life  his office flourishes in the shade not in the rustic shade beloved of the violet but in the muddled twilight of mind where tyranny of every sort flourishes  its holder need not have either brain or heart no sight no taste no imagination not even bowels of compassion he needs not these things  he has power  he can kill thought and incidentally truth and incidentally beauty providing they seek to live in a dramatic form  he can do it without seeing without understanding without feeling anything out of mere stupid suspicion as an irresponsible roman caesar could kill a senator  he can do that and there is no one to say him nay  he may call his cook moliere used to do that from below and give her five acts to judge every morning as a matter of constant practice and still remain the unquestioned destroyer of mens honest work  he may have a glass too much  this accident has happened to persons of unimpeachable moralityto gentlemen  he may suffer from spells of imbecility like clodius  he may    what might he not do  i tell you he is the caesar of the dramatic world  there has been since the roman principate nothing in the way of irresponsible power to compare with the office of the censor of plays  looked at in this way it has some grandeur something colossal in the odious and the absurd  this figure in whose power it is to suppress an intellectual conceptionto kill thought a dream for a mad brain my mastersseems designed in a spirit of bitter comedy to bring out the greatness of a philistines conceit and his moral cowardice  but this is england in the twentieth century and one wonders that there can be found a man courageous enough to occupy the post  it is a matter for meditation  having given it a few minutes i come to the conclusion in the serenity of my heart and the peace of my conscience that he must be either an extreme megalomaniac or an utterly unconscious being  he must be unconscious  it is one of the qualifications for his magistracy  other qualifications are equally easy  he must have done nothing expressed nothing imagined nothing  he must be obscure insignificant and mediocrein thought act speech and sympathy  he must know nothing of art of lifeand of himself  for if he did he would not dare to be what he is  like that much questioned and mysterious bird the phoenix he sits amongst the cold ashes of his predecessor upon the altar of morality alone of his kind in the sight of wondering generations  and i will end with a quotation reproducing not perhaps the exact words but the true spirit of a lofty conscience  often when sitting down to write the notice of a play especially when i felt it antagonistic to my canons of art to my tastes or my convictions i hesitated in the fear lest my conscientious blame might check the development of a great talent my sincere judgment condemn a worthy mind with the pen poised in my hand i hesitated whispering to myself what if i were perchance doing my part in killing a masterpiece  such were the lofty scruples of m jules lemaitredramatist and dramatic critic a great citizen and a high magistrate in the republic of letters a censor of plays exercising his august office openly in the light of day with the authority of a european reputation  but then m jules lemaitre is a man possessed of wisdom of great fame of a fine consciencenot an obscure hollow chinese monstrosity ornamented with mr stigginss plug hat and cotton umbrella by its anxious grandmotherthe state  frankly is it not time to knock the improper object off its shelf  it has stood too long there  hatched in pekin i should say by some board of respectable rites the little caravan monster has come to us by way of moscowi suppose  it is outlandish  it is not venerable  it does not belong here  is it not time to knock it off its dark shelf with some implement appropriate to its worth and status  with an old broom handle for instance     part iilife   autocracy and war1905   from the firing of the first shot on the banks of the shaho the fate of the great battle of the russojapanese war hung in the balance for more than a fortnight  the famous threeday battles for which history has reserved the recognition of special pages sink into insignificance before the struggles in manchuria engaging half a million men on fronts of sixty miles struggles lasting for weeks flaming up fiercely and dying away from sheer exhaustion to flame up again in desperate persistence and endas we have seen them end more than oncenot from the victor obtaining a crushing advantage but through the mortal weariness of the combatants  we have seen these things though we have seen them only in the cold silent colourless print of books and newspapers  in stigmatising the printed word as cold silent and colourless i have no intention of putting a slight upon the fidelity and the talents of men who have provided us with words to read about the battles in manchuria  i only wished to suggest that in the nature of things the war in the far east has been made known to us so far in a grey reflection of its terrible and monotonous phases of pain death sickness a reflection seen in the perspective of thousands of miles in the dim atmosphere of official reticence through the veil of inadequate words  inadequate i say because what had to be reproduced is beyond the common experience of war and our imagination luckily for our peace of mind has remained a slumbering faculty notwithstanding the din of humanitarian talk and the real progress of humanitarian ideas  direct vision of the fact or the stimulus of a great art can alone make it turn and open its eyes heavy with blessed sleep and even there as against the testimony of the senses and the stirring up of emotion that saving callousness which reconciles us to the conditions of our existence will assert itself under the guise of assent to fatal necessity or in the enthusiasm of a purely aesthetic admiration of the rendering  in this age of knowledge our sympathetic imagination to which alone we can look for the ultimate triumph of concord and justice remains strangely impervious to information however correctly and even picturesquely conveyed  as to the vaunted eloquence of a serried array of figures it has all the futility of precision without force  it is the exploded superstition of enthusiastic statisticians  an overworked horse falling in front of our windows a man writhing under a cartwheel in the streets awaken more genuine emotion more horror pity and indignation than the stream of reports appalling in their monotony of tens of thousands of decaying bodies tainting the air of the manchurian plains of other tens of thousands of maimed bodies groaning in ditches crawling on the frozen ground filling the field hospitals of the hundreds of thousands of survivors no less pathetic and even more tragic in being left alive by fate to the wretched exhaustion of their pitiful toil  an early victorian or perhaps a previctorian sentimentalist looking out of an upstairs window i believe at a streetperhaps fleet street itselffull of people is reported by an admiring friend to have wept for joy at seeing so much life  these arcadian tears this facile emotion worthy of the golden age comes to us from the past with solemn approval after the close of the napoleonic wars and before the series of sanguinary surprises held in reserve by the nineteenth century for our hopeful grandfathers  we may well envy them their optimism of which this anecdote of an amiable wit and sentimentalist presents an extreme instance but still a true instance and worthy of regard in the spontaneous testimony to that trust in the life of the earth triumphant at last in the felicity of her children  moreover the psychology of individuals even in the most extreme instances reflects the general effect of the fears and hopes of its time  wept for joy  i should think that now after eighty years the emotion would be of a sterner sort  one could not imagine anybody shedding tears of joy at the sight of much life in a street unless perhaps he were an enthusiastic officer of a general staff or a popular politician with a career yet to make  and hardly even that  in the case of the first tears would be unprofessional and a stern repression of all signs of joy at the provision of so much food for powder more in accord with the rules of prudence the joy of the second would be checked before it found issue in weeping by anxious doubts as to the soundness of these electors views upon the question of the hour and the fear of missing the consensus of their votes  no  it seems that such a tender joy would be misplaced now as much as ever during the last hundred years to go no further back  the end of the eighteenth century was too a time of optimism and of dismal mediocrity in which the french revolution exploded like a bombshell  in its lurid blaze the insufficiency of europe the inferiority of minds of military and administrative systems stood exposed with pitiless vividness  and there is but little courage in saying at this time of the day that the glorified french revolution itself except for its destructive force was in essentials a mediocre phenomenon  the parentage of that great social and political upheaval was intellectual the idea was elevated but it is the bitter fate of any idea to lose its royal form and power to lose its virtue the moment it descends from its solitary throne to work its will among the people  it is a king whose destiny is never to know the obedience of his subjects except at the cost of degradation  the degradation of the ideas of freedom and justice at the root of the french revolution is made manifest in the person of its heir a personality without law or faith whom it has been the fashion to represent as an eagle but who was in truth more like a sort of vulture preying upon the body of a europe which did indeed for some dozen of years very much resemble a corpse  the subtle and manifold influence for evil of the napoleonic episode as a school of violence as a sower of national hatreds as the direct provocator of obscurantism and reaction of political tyranny and injustice cannot well be exaggerated  the nineteenth century began with wars which were the issue of a corrupted revolution  it may be said that the twentieth begins with a war which is like the explosive ferment of a moral grave whence may yet emerge a new political organism to take the place of a gigantic and dreaded phantom  for a hundred years the ghost of russian might overshadowing with its fantastic bulk the councils of central and western europe sat upon the gravestone of autocracy cutting off from air from light from all knowledge of themselves and of the world the buried millions of russian people  not the most determined cockney sentimentalist could have had the heart to weep for joy at the thought of its teeming numbers  and yet they were living they are alive yet since through the mist of print we have seen their blood freezing crimson upon the snow of the squares and streets of st petersburg since their generations born in the grave are yet alive enough to fill the ditches and cover the fields of manchuria with their torn limbs to send up from the frozen ground of battlefields a chorus of groans calling for vengeance from heaven to kill and retreat or kill and advance without intermission or rest for twenty hours for fifty hours for whole weeks of fatigue hunger cold and murdertill their ghastly labour worthy of a place amongst the punishments of dantes inferno passing through the stages of courage of fury of hopelessness sinks into the night of crazy despair  it seems that in both armies many men are driven beyond the bounds of sanity by the stress of moral and physical misery  great numbers of soldiers and regimental officers go mad as if by way of protest against the peculiar sanity of a state of war mostly among the russians of course  the japanese have in their favour the tonic effect of success and the innate gentleness of their character stands them in good stead but the japanese grand army has yet another advantage in this nervedestroying contest which for endless arduous toil of killing surpasses all the wars of history  it has a base for its operations a base of a nature beyond the concern of the many books written upon the so called art of war which considered by itself purely as an exercise of human ingenuity is at best only a thing of wellworn simple artifices the japanese army has for its base a reasoned conviction it has behind it the profound belief in the right of a logical necessity to be appeased at the cost of so much blood and treasure  and in that belief whether well or ill founded that army stands on the high ground of conscious assent shouldering deliberately the burden of a longtried faithfulness the other people since each people is an army nowadays torn out from a miserable quietude resembling death itself hurled across space amazed without startingpoint of its own or knowledge of the aim can feel nothing but a horrorstricken consciousness of having mysteriously become the plaything of a black and merciless fate  the profound the instructive nature of this war is resumed by the memorable difference in the spiritual state of the two armies the one forlorn and dazed on being driven out from an abyss of mental darkness into the red light of a conflagration the other with a full knowledge of its past and its future finding itself as it were at every step of the trying war before the eyes of an astonished world  the greatness of the lesson has been dwarfed for most of us by an often halfconscious prejudice of racedifference  the west having managed to lodge its hasty foot on the neck of the east is prone to forget that it is from the east that the wonders of patience and wisdom have come to a world of men who set the value of life in the power to act rather than in the faculty of meditation  it has been dwarfed by this and it has been obscured by a cloud of considerations with whose shaping wisdom and meditation had little or nothing to do by the weary platitudes on the military situation which apart from geographical conditions is the same everlasting situation that has prevailed since the times of hannibal and scipio and further back yet since the beginning of historical recordsince prehistoric times for that matter by the conventional expressions of horror at the tale of maiming and killing by the rumours of peace with guesses more or less plausible as to its conditions  all this is made legitimate by the consecrated custom of writers in such time as thisthe time of a great war  more legitimate in view of the situation created in europe are the speculations as to the course of events after the war  more legitimate but hardly more wise than the irresponsible talk of strategy that never changes and of terms of peace that do not matter  and above it allunaccountably persistentthe decrepit old hundred years old spectre of russias might still faces europe from across the teeming graves of russian people  this dreaded and strange apparition bristling with bayonets armed with chains hung over with holy images that something not of this world partaking of a ravenous ghoul of a blind djinn grown up from a cloud and of the old man of the sea still faces us with its old stupidity with its strange mystical arrogance stamping its shadowy feet upon the gravestone of autocracy already cracked beyond repair by the torpedoes of togo and the guns of oyama already heaving in the bloodsoaked ground with the first stirrings of a resurrection  never before had the western world the opportunity to look so deep into the black abyss which separates a soulless autocracy posing as and even believing itself to be the arbiter of europe from the benighted starved souls of its people  this is the real objectlesson of this war its unforgettable information  and this wars true mission disengaged from the economic origins of that contest from doors open or shut from the fields of korea for russian wheat or japanese rice from the ownership of icefree ports and the command of the waters of the eastits true mission was to lay a ghost  it has accomplished it  whether kuropatkin was incapable or unlucky whether or not russia issuing next year or the year after next from behind a rampart of piledup corpses will win or lose a fresh campaign are minor considerations  the task of japan is done the mission accomplished the ghost of russias might is laid  only europe accustomed so long to the presence of that portent seems unable to comprehend that as in the fables of our childhood the twelve strokes of the hour have rung the cock has crowed the apparition has vanishednever to haunt again this world which has been used to gaze at it with vague dread and many misgivings  it was a fascination  and the hallucination still lasts as inexplicable in its persistence as in its duration  it seems so unaccountable that the doubt arises as to the sincerity of all that talk as to what russia will or will not do whether it will raise or not another army whether it will bury the japanese in manchuria under seventy millions of sacrificed peasants caps as her press boasted a little more than a year ago or give up to japan that jewel of her crown saghalien together with some other things whether perchance as an interesting alternative it will make peace on the amur in order to make war beyond the oxus  all these speculations with many others have appeared gravely in print and if they have been gravely considered by only one reader out of each hundred there must be something subtly noxious to the human brain in the composition of newspaper ink or else it is that the large page the columns of words the leaded headings exalt the mind into a state of feverish credulity  the printed page of the press makes a sort of still uproar taking from men both the power to reflect and the faculty of genuine feeling leaving them only the artificially created need of having something exciting to talk about  the truth is that the russia of our fathers of our childhood of our middleage the testamentary russia of peter the greatwho imagined that all the nations were delivered into the hand of tsardomcan do nothing it can do nothing because it does not exist  it has vanished for ever at last and as yet there is no new russia to take the place of that ill omened creation which being a fantasy of a madmans brain could in reality be nothing else than a figure out of a nightmare seated upon a monument of fear and oppression  the true greatness of a state does not spring from such a contemptible source  it is a matter of logical growth of faith and courage  its inspiration springs from the constructive instinct of the people governed by the strong hand of a collective conscience and voiced in the wisdom and counsel of men who seldom reap the reward of gratitude  many states have been powerful but perhaps none have been truly greatas yet  that the position of a state in reference to the moral methods of its development can be seen only historically is true  perhaps mankind has not lived long enough for a comprehensive view of any particular case  perhaps no one will ever live long enough and perhaps this earth shared out amongst our clashing ambitions by the anxious arrangements of statesmen will come to an end before we attain the felicity of greeting with unanimous applause the perfect fruition of a great state  it is even possible that we are destined for another sort of bliss altogether that sort which consists in being perpetually duped by false appearances but whatever political illusion the future may hold out to our fear or our admiration there will be none it is safe to say which in the magnitude of antihumanitarian effect will equal that phantom now driven out of the world by the thunder of thousands of guns none that in its retreat will cling with an equally shameless sincerity to more unworthy supports to the moral corruption and mental darkness of slavery to the mere brute force of numbers  this very ignominy of infatuation should make clear to mens feelings and reason that the downfall of russias might is unavoidable  spectral it lived and spectral it disappears without leaving a memory of a single generous deed of a single service renderedeven involuntarilyto the polity of nations  other despotisms there have been but none whose origin was so grimly fantastic in its baseness and the beginning of whose end was so gruesomely ignoble  what is amazing is the myth of its irresistible strength which is dying so hard        considered historically russias influence in europe seems the most baseless thing in the world a sort of convention invented by diplomatists for some dark purpose of their own one would suspect if the lack of grasp upon the realities of any given situation were not the main characteristic of the management of international relations  a glance back at the last hundred years shows the invariable one may say the logical powerlessness of russia  as a military power it has never achieved by itself a single great thing  it has been indeed able to repel an illconsidered invasion but only by having recourse to the extreme methods of desperation  in its attacks upon its specially selected victim this giant always struck as if with a withered right hand  all the campaigns against turkey prove this from potemkins time to the last eastern war in 1878 entered upon with every advantage of a wellnursed prestige and a carefully fostered fanaticism  even the half armed were always too much for the might of russia or rather of the tsardom  it was victorious only against the practically disarmed as in regard to its ideal of territorial expansion a glance at a map will prove sufficiently  as an ally russia has been always unprofitable taking her share in the defeats rather than in the victories of her friends but always pushing her own claims with the arrogance of an arbiter of military success  she has been unable to help to any purpose a single principle to hold its own not even the principle of authority and legitimism which nicholas the first had declared so haughtily to rest under his special protection just as nicholas the second has tried to make the maintenance of peace on earth his own exclusive affair  and the first nicholas was a good russian he held the belief in the sacredness of his realm with such an intensity of faith that he could not survive the first shock of doubt  rightly envisaged the crimean war was the end of what remained of absolutism and legitimism in europe  it threw the way open for the liberation of italy  the war in manchuria makes an end of absolutism in russia whoever has got to perish from the shock behind a rampart of dead ukases manifestoes and rescripts  in the space of fifty years the selfappointed apostle of absolutism and the selfappointed apostle of peace the augustus and the augustulus of the regime that was wont to speak contemptuously to european foreign offices in the beautiful french phrases of prince gorchakov have fallen victims each after his kind to their shadowy and dreadful familiar to the phantom part ghoul part djinn part old man of the sea with beak and claws and a double head looking greedily both east and west on the confines of two continents  that nobody through all that time penetrated the true nature of the monster it is impossible to believe  but of the many who must have seen all were either too modest too cautious perhaps too discreet to speak or else were too insignificant to be heard or believed  yet not all  in the very early sixties prince bismarck then about to leave his post of prussian minister in st petersburg calledso the story goesupon another distinguished diplomatist  after some talk upon the general situation the future chancellor of the german empire remarked that it was his practice to resume the impressions he had carried out of every country where he had made a long stay in a short sentence which he caused to be engraved upon some trinket  i am leaving this country now and this is what i bring away from it he continued taking off his finger a new ring to show to his colleague the inscription inside la russie cest le neant  prince bismarck had the truth of the matter and was neither too modest nor too discreet to speak out  certainly he was not afraid of not being believed  yet he did not shout his knowledge from the housetops  he meant to have the phantom as his accomplice in an enterprise which has set the clock of peace back for many a year  he had his way  the german empire has been an accomplished fact for more than a third of a centurya great and dreadful legacy left to the world by the illomened phantom of russias might  it is that phantom which is disappearing nowunexpectedly astonishingly as if by a touch of that wonderful magic for which the east has always been famous  the pretence of belief in its existence will no longer answer anybodys purposes now prince bismarck is dead unless the purposes of the writers of sensational paragraphs as to this neant making an armed descent upon the plains of india  that sort of folly would be beneath notice if it did not distract attention from the real problem created for europe by a war in the far east  for good or evil in the working out of her destiny russia is bound to remain a neant for many long years in a more even than a bismarckian sense  the very fear of this spectre being gone it behoves us to consider its legacythe fact no phantom that accomplished in central europe by its help and connivance  the german empire may feel at bottom the loss of an old accomplice always amenable to the confidential whispers of a bargain but in the first instance it cannot but rejoice at the fundamental weakening of a possible obstacle to its instincts of territorial expansion  there is a removal of that latent feeling of restraint which the presence of a powerful neighbour however implicated with you in a sense of common guilt is bound to inspire  the common guilt of the two empires is defined precisely by their frontier line running through the polish provinces without indulging in excessive feelings of indignation at that countrys partition or going so far as to believewith a late french politicianin the immanente justice des choses it is clear that a material situation based upon an essentially immoral transaction contains the germ of fatal differences in the temperament of the two partners in iniquitywhatever the iniquity is  germany has been the evil counsellor of russia on all the questions of her polish problem always urging the adoption of the most repressive measures with a perfectly logical duplicity prince bismarcks empire has taken care to couple the neighbourly offers of military assistance with merciless advice  the thought of the polish provinces accepting a frank reconciliation with a humanised russia and bringing the weight of homogeneous loyalty within a few miles of berlin has been always intensely distasteful to the arrogant germanising tendencies of the other partner in iniquity  and besides the way to the baltic provinces leads over the niemen and over the vistula  and now when there is a possibility of serious internal disturbances destroying the sort of order autocracy has kept in russia the road over these rivers is seen wearing a more inviting aspect  at any moment the pretext of armed intervention may be found in a revolutionary outbreak provoked by socialists perhapsbut at any rate by the political immaturity of the enlightened classes and by the political barbarism of the russian people  the throes of russian resurrection will be long and painful  this is not the place to speculate upon the nature of these convulsions but there must be some violent breakup of the lamentable tradition a shattering of the social of the administrativecertainly of the territorialunity  voices have been heard saying that the time for reforms in russia is already past  this is the superficial view of the more profound truth that for russia there has never been such a time within the memory of mankind  it is impossible to initiate a rational scheme of reform upon a phase of blind absolutism and in russia there has never been anything else to which the faintest tradition could after ages of error go back as to a parting of ways  in europe the old monarchical principle stands justified in its historical struggle with the growth of political liberty by the evolution of the idea of nationality as we see it concreted at the present time by the inception of that wider solidarity grouping together around the standard of monarchical power these larger agglomerations of mankind this service of unification creating closeknit communities possessing the ability the will and the power to pursue a common ideal has prepared the ground for the advent of a still larger understanding for the solidarity of europeanism which must be the next step towards the advent of concord and justice an advent that however delayed by the fatal worship of force and the errors of national selfishness has been and remains the only possible goal of our progress  the conceptions of legality of larger patriotism of national duties and aspirations have grown under the shadow of the old monarchies of europe which were the creations of historical necessity  there were seeds of wisdom in their very mistakes and abuses  they had a past and a future they were human  but under the shadow of russian autocracy nothing could grow  russian autocracy succeeded to nothing it had no historical past and it cannot hope for a historical future  it can only end  by no industry of investigation by no fantastic stretch of benevolence can it be presented as a phase of development through which a society a state must pass on the way to the full consciousness of its destiny  it lies outside the stream of progress  this despotism has been utterly uneuropean  neither has it been asiatic in its nature  oriental despotisms belong to the history of mankind they have left their trace on our minds and our imagination by their splendour by their culture by their art by the exploits of great conquerors  the record of their rise and decay has an intellectual value they are in their origins and their course the manifestations of human needs the instruments of racial temperament of catastrophic force of faith and fanaticism  the russian autocracy as we see it now is a thing apart  it is impossible to assign to it any rational origin in the vices the misfortunes the necessities or the aspirations of mankind  that despotism has neither an european nor an oriental parentage more it seems to have no root either in the institutions or the follies of this earth  what strikes one with a sort of awe is just this something inhuman in its character  it is like a visitation like a curse from heaven falling in the darkness of ages upon the immense plains of forest and steppe lying dumbly on the confines of two continents a true desert harbouring no spirit either of the east or of the west  this pitiful fate of a country held by an evil spell suffering from an awful visitation for which the responsibility cannot be traced either to her sins or her follies has made russia as a nation so difficult to understand by europe  from the very first ghastly dawn of her existence as a state she had to breathe the atmosphere of despotism she found nothing but the arbitrary will of an obscure autocrat at the beginning and end of her organisation  hence arises her impenetrability to whatever is true in western thought  western thought when it crosses her frontier falls under the spell of her autocracy and becomes a noxious parody of itself  hence the contradictions the riddles of her national life which are looked upon with such curiosity by the rest of the world  the curse had entered her very soul autocracy and nothing else in the world has moulded her institutions and with the poison of slavery drugged the national temperament into the apathy of a hopeless fatalism  it seems to have gone into the blood tainting every mental activity in its source by a halfmystical insensate fascinating assertion of purity and holiness  the government of holy russia arrogating to itself the supreme power to torment and slaughter the bodies of its subjects like a godsent scourge has been most cruel to those whom it allowed to live under the shadow of its dispensation  the worst crime against humanity of that system we behold now crouching at bay behind vast heaps of mangled corpses is the ruthless destruction of innumerable minds  the greatest horror of the worldmadnesswalked faithfully in its train  some of the best intellects of russia after struggling in vain against the spell ended by throwing themselves at the feet of that hopeless despotism as a giddy man leaps into an abyss  an attentive survey of russias literature of her church of her administration and the crosscurrents of her thought must end in the verdict that the russia of today has not the right to give her voice on a single question touching the future of humanity because from the very inception of her being the brutal destruction of dignity of truth of rectitude of all that is faithful in human nature has been made the imperative condition of her existence  the great governmental secret of that imperium which prince bismarck had the insight and the courage to call le neant has been the extirpation of every intellectual hope  to pronounce in the face of such a past the word evolution which is precisely the expression of the highest intellectual hope is a gruesome pleasantry  there can be no evolution out of a grave  another word of less scientific sound has been very much pronounced of late in connection with russias future a word of more vague import a word of dread as much as of hoperevolution  in the face of the events of the last four months this word has sprung instinctively as it were on grave lips and has been heard with solemn forebodings  more or less consciously europe is preparing herself for a spectacle of much violence and perhaps of an inspiring nobility of greatness  and there will be nothing of what she expects  she will see neither the anticipated character of the violence nor yet any signs of generous greatness  her expectations more or less vaguely expressed give the measure of her ignorance of that neant which for so many years had remained hidden behind this phantom of invincible armies  neant  in a way yes  and yet perhaps prince bismarck has let himself be led away by the seduction of a good phrase into the use of an inexact form  the form of his judgment had to be pithy striking engraved within a ring  if he erred then no doubt he erred deliberately  the saying was near enough the truth to serve and perhaps he did not want to destroy utterly by a more severe definition the prestige of the sham that could not deceive his genius  prince bismarck has been really complimentary to the useful phantom of the autocratic might  there is an aweinspiring idea of infinity conveyed in the word neantand in russia there is no idea  she is not a neant she is and has been simply the negation of everything worth living for  she is not an empty void she is a yawning chasm open between east and west a bottomless abyss that has swallowed up every hope of mercy every aspiration towards personal dignity towards freedom towards knowledge every ennobling desire of the heart every redeeming whisper of conscience  those that have peered into that abyss where the dreams of panslavism of universal conquest mingled with the hate and contempt for western ideas drift impotently like shapes of mist know well that it is bottomless that there is in it no ground for anything that could in the remotest degree serve even the lowest interests of mankindand certainly no ground ready for a revolution  the sin of the old european monarchies was not the absolutism inherent in every form of government it was the inability to alter the forms of their legality grown narrow and oppressive with the march of time  every form of legality is bound to degenerate into oppression and the legality in the forms of monarchical institutions sooner perhaps than any other  it has not been the business of monarchies to be adaptive from within  with the mission of uniting and consolidating the particular ambitions and interests of feudalism in favour of a larger conception of a state of giving selfconsciousness force and nationality to the scattered energies of thought and action they were fated to lag behind the march of ideas they had themselves set in motion in a direction they could neither understand nor approve  yet for all that the thrones still remain and what is more significant perhaps some of the dynasties too have survived  the revolutions of european states have never been in the nature of absolute protests en masse against the monarchical principle they were the uprising of the people against the oppressive degeneration of legality  but there never has been any legality in russia she is a negation of that as of everything else that has its root in reason or conscience  the ground of every revolution had to be intellectually prepared  a revolution is a short cut in the rational development of national needs in response to the growth of worldwide ideals  it is conceivably possible for a monarch of genius to put himself at the head of a revolution without ceasing to be the king of his people  for the autocracy of holy russia the only conceivable selfreform issuicide  the same relentless fate holds in its grip the allpowerful ruler and his helpless people  wielders of a power purchased by an unspeakable baseness of subjection to the khans of the tartar horde the princes of russia who in their heart of hearts had come in time to regard themselves as superior to every monarch of europe have never risen to be the chiefs of a nation  their authority has never been sanctioned by popular tradition by ideas of intelligent loyalty of devotion of political necessity of simple expediency or even by the power of the sword  in whatever form of upheaval autocratic russia is to find her end it can never be a revolution fruitful of moral consequences to mankind  it cannot be anything else but a rising of slaves  it is a tragic circumstance that the only thing one can wish to that people who had never seen face to face either law order justice right truth about itself or the rest of the world who had known nothing outside the capricious will of its irresponsible masters is that it should find in the approaching hour of need not an organiser or a lawgiver with the wisdom of a lycurgus or a solon for their service but at least the force of energy and desperation in some as yet unknown spartacus  a brand of hopeless mental and moral inferiority is set upon russian achievements and the coming events of her internal changes however appalling they may be in their magnitude will be nothing more impressive than the convulsions of a colossal body  as her boasted military force that corrupt in its origin has ever struck no other but faltering blows so her soul kept benumbed by her temporal and spiritual master with the poison of tyranny and superstition will find itself on awakening possessed of no language a monstrous fullgrown child having first to learn the ways of living thought and articulate speech  it is safe to say tyranny assuming a thousand protean shapes will remain clinging to her struggles for a long time before her blind multitudes succeed at last in trampling her out of existence under their millions of bare feet  that would be the beginning  what is to come after  the conquest of freedom to call your soul your own is only the first step on the road to excellence  we in europe have gone a step or two further have had the time to forget how little that freedom means  to russia it must seem everything  a prisoner shut up in a noisome dungeon concentrates all his hope and desire on the moment of stepping out beyond the gates  it appears to him pregnant with an immense and final importance whereas what is important is the spirit in which he will draw the first breath of freedom the counsels he will hear the hands he may find extended the endless days of toil that must follow wherein he will have to build his future with no other material but what he can find within himself  it would be vain for russia to hope for the support and counsel of collective wisdom  since 1870 as a distinguished statesman of the old tradition disconsolately exclaimed il ny a plus deurope  there is indeed no europe  the idea of a europe united in the solidarity of her dynasties which for a moment seemed to dawn on the horizon of the vienna congress through the subsiding dust of napoleonic alarums and excursions has been extinguished by the larger glamour of less restraining ideals instead of the doctrines of solidarity it was the doctrine of nationalities much more favourable to spoliations that came to the front and since its greatest triumphs at sadowa and sedan there is no europe meanwhile till the time comes when there will be no frontiers there are alliances so shamelessly based upon the exigencies of suspicion and mistrust that their cohesive force waxes and wanes with every year almost with the event of every passing month  this is the atmosphere russia will find when the last rampart of tyranny has been beaten down but what hands what voices will she find on coming out into the light of day  an ally she has yet who more than any other of russias allies has found that it had parted with lots of solid substance in exchange for a shadow  it is true that the shadow was indeed the mightiest the darkest that the modern world had ever knownand the most overbearing  but it is fading now and the tone of truest anxiety as to what is to take its place will come no doubt from that and no other direction and no doubt also it will have that note of generosity which even in the moments of greatest aberration is seldom wanting in the voice of the french people  two neighbours russia will find at her door  austria traditionally unaggressive whenever her hand is not forced ruled by a dynasty of uncertain future weakened by her duality can only speak to her in an uncertain bilingual phrase  prussia grown in something like forty years from an almost pitiful dependant into a bullying friend and evil counsellor of russias masters may indeed hasten to extend a strong hand to the weakness of her exhausted body but if so it will be only with the intention of tearing away the longcoveted part of her substance  pangermanism is by no means a shape of mists and germany is anything but a neant where thought and effort are likely to lose themselves without sound or trace  it is a powerful and voracious organisation full of unscrupulous selfconfidence whose appetite for aggrandisement will only be limited by the power of helping itself to the severed members of its friends and neighbours  the era of wars so eloquently denounced by the old republicans as the peculiar blood guilt of dynastic ambitions is by no means over yet  they will be fought out differently with lesser frequency with an increased bitterness and the savage tooth andclaw obstinacy of a struggle for existence  they will make us regret the time of dynastic ambitions with their human absurdity moderated by prudence and even by shame by the fear of personal responsibility and the regard paid to certain forms of conventional decency  for if the monarchs of europe have been derided for addressing each other as brother in autograph communications that relationship was at least as effective as any form of brotherhood likely to be established between the rival nations of this continent which we are assured on all hands is the heritage of democracy  in the ceremonial brotherhood of monarchs the reality of bloodties for what little it is worth acted often as a drag on unscrupulous desires of glory or greed  besides there was always the common danger of exasperated peoples and some respect for each others divine right  no leader of a democracy without other ancestry but the sudden shout of a multitude and debarred by the very condition of his power from even thinking of a direct heir will have any interest in calling brother the leader of another democracya chief as fatherless and heirless as himself  the war of 1870 brought about by the third napoleons halfgenerous halfselfish adoption of the principle of nationalities was the first war characterised by a special intensity of hate by a new note in the tune of an old song for which we may thank the teutonic thoroughness  was it not that excellent bourgeoise princess bismarck to keep only to great examples who was so righteously anxious to see men women and childrenemphatically the children tooof the abominable french nation massacred off the face of the earth  this illustration of the new war temper is artlessly revealed in the prattle of the amiable busch the chancellors pet reptile of the press  and this was supposed to be a war for an idea  too much however should not be made of that good wifes and mothers sentiments any more than of the good first emperor williams tears shed so abundantly after every battle by letter telegram and otherwise during the course of the same war before a dumb and shamefaced continent  these were merely the expressions of the simplicity of a nation which more than any other has a tendency to run into the grotesque  there is worse to come  today in the fierce grapple of two nations of different race the short era of national wars seems about to close  no war will be waged for an idea  the noxious idle aristocracies of yesterday fought without malice for an occupation for the honour for the fun of the thing  the virtuous industrious democratic states of tomorrow may yet be reduced to fighting for a crust of dry bread with all the hate ferocity and fury that must attach to the vital importance of such an issue  the dreams sanguine humanitarians raised almost to ecstasy about the year fifty of the last century by the moving sight of the crystal palacecrammed full with that variegated rubbish which it seems to be the bizarre fate of humanity to produce for the benefit of a few employers of labourhave vanished as quickly as they had arisen  the golden hopes of peace have in a single night turned to dead leaves in every drawer of every benevolent theorists writing table  a swift disenchantment overtook the incredible infatuation which could put its trust in the peaceful nature of industrial and commercial competition  industrialism and commercialismwearing highsounding names in many languages weltpolitik may serve for one instance picking up coins behind the severe and disdainful figure of science whose giant strides have widened for us the horizon of the universe by some few inchesstand ready almost eager to appeal to the sword as soon as the globe of the earth has shrunk beneath our growing numbers by another ell or so  and democracy which has elected to pin its faith to the supremacy of material interests will have to fight their battles to the bitter end on a mere pittanceunless indeed some statesman of exceptional ability and overwhelming prestige succeeds in carrying through an international understanding for the delimitation of spheres of trade all over the earth on the model of the territorial spheres of influence marked in africa to keep the competitors for the privilege of improving the nigger as a buying machine from flying prematurely at each others throats  this seems the only expedient at hand for the temporary maintenance of european peace with its alliances based on mutual distrust preparedness for war as its ideal and the fear of wounds luckily stronger so far than the pinch of hunger its only guarantee  the true peace of the world will be a place of refuge much less like a beleaguered fortress and more let us hope in the nature of an inviolable temple  it will be built on less perishable foundations than those of material interests but it must be confessed that the architectural aspect of the universal city remains as yet inconceivablethat the very ground for its erection has not been cleared of the jungle  never before in history has the right of war been more fully admitted in the rounded periods of public speeches in books in public prints in all the public works of peace culminating in the establishment of the hague tribunalthat solemnly official recognition of the earth as a house of strife  to him whose indignation is qualified by a measure of hope and affection the efforts of mankind to work its own salvation present a sight of alarming comicality  after clinging for ages to the steps of the heavenly throne they are now without much modifying their attitude trying with touching ingenuity to steal one by one the thunderbolts of their jupiter  they have removed war from the list of heavensent visitations that could only be prayed against they have erased its name from the supplication against the wrath of war pestilence and famine as it is found in the litanies of the roman catholic church they have dragged the scourge down from the skies and have made it into a calm and regulated institution  at first sight the change does not seem for the better  joves thunderbolt looks a most dangerous plaything in the hands of the people  but a solemnly established institution begins to grow old at once in the discussion abuse worship and execration of men  it grows obsolete odious and intolerable it stands fatally condemned to an unhonoured old age  therein lies the best hope of advanced thought and the best way to help its prospects is to provide in the fullest frankest way for the conditions of the present day  war is one of its conditions it is its principal condition  it lies at the heart of every question agitating the fears and hopes of a humanity divided against itself  the succeeding ages have changed nothing except the watchwords of the armies  the intellectual stage of mankind being as yet in its infancy and states like most individuals having but a feeble and imperfect consciousness of the worth and force of the inner life the need of making their existence manifest to themselves is determined in the direction of physical activity  the idea of ceasing to grow in territory in strength in wealth in influencein anything but wisdom and selfknowledgeis odious to them as the omen of the end  action in which is to be found the illusion of a mastered destiny can alone satisfy our uneasy vanity and lay to rest the haunting fear of the futurea sentiment concealed indeed but proving its existence by the force it has when invoked to stir the passions of a nation  it will be long before we have learned that in the great darkness before us there is nothing that we need fear let us act lest we perishis the cry  and the only form of action open to a state can be of no other than aggressive nature  there are many kinds of aggressions though the sanction of them is one and the samethe magazine rifle of the latest pattern  in preparation for or against that form of action the states of europe are spending now such moments of uneasy leisure as they can snatch from the labours of factory and countinghouse  never before has war received so much homage at the lips of men and reigned with less disputed sway in their minds  it has harnessed science to its guncarriages it has enriched a few respectable manufacturers scattered doles of food and raiment amongst a few thousand skilled workmen devoured the first youth of whole generations and reaped its harvest of countless corpses  it has perverted the intelligence of men women and children and has made the speeches of emperors kings presidents and ministers monotonous with ardent protestations of fidelity to peace  indeed war has made peace altogether its own it has modelled it on its own image a martial overbearing warlord sort of peace with a mailed fist and turnedup moustaches ringing with the din of grand manoeuvres eloquent with allusions to glorious feats of arms it has made peace so magnificent as to be almost as expensive to keep up as itself  it has sent out apostles of its own who at one time went about mostly in newspapers preaching the gospel of the mystic sanctity of its sacrifices and the regenerating power of spilt blood to the poor in mindwhose name is legion  it has been observed that in the course of earthly greatness a day of culminating triumph is often paid for by a morrow of sudden extinction let us hope it is so  yet the dawn of that day of retribution may be a long time breaking above a dark horizon  war is with us now and whether this one ends soon or late war will be with us again  and it is the way of true wisdom for men and states to take account of things as they are  civilisation has done its little best by our sensibilities for whose growth it is responsible  it has managed to remove the sights and sounds of battlefields away from our doorsteps  but it cannot be expected to achieve the feat always and under every variety of circumstance  some day it must fail and we shall have then a wealth of appallingly unpleasant sensations brought home to us with painful intimacy  it is not absurd to suppose that whatever war comes to us next it will not be a distant war waged by russia either beyond the amur or beyond the oxus  the japanese armies have laid that ghost for ever because the russia of the future will not for the reasons explained above be the russia of to day  it will not have the same thoughts resentments and aims  it is even a question whether it will preserve its gigantic frame unaltered and unbroken  all speculation loses itself in the magnitude of the events made possible by the defeat of an autocracy whose only shadow of a title to existence was the invincible power of military conquest  that autocratic russia will have a miserable end in harmony with its base origin and inglorious life does not seem open to doubt  the problem of the immediate future is posed not by the eventual manner but by the approaching fact of its disappearance  the japanese armies in laying the oppressive ghost have not only accomplished what will be recognised historically as an important mission in the worlds struggle against all forms of evil but have also created a situation  they have created a situation in the east which they are competent to manage by themselves and in doing this they have brought about a change in the condition of the west with which europe is not well prepared to deal  the common ground of concord good faith and justice is not sufficient to establish an action upon since the conscience of but very few men amongst us and of no single western nation as yet will brook the restraint of abstract ideas as against the fascination of a material advantage  and eagleeyed wisdom alone cannot take the lead of human action which in its nature must for ever remain shortsighted  the trouble of the civilised world is the want of a common conservative principle abstract enough to give the impulse practical enough to form the rallying point of international action tending towards the restraint of particular ambitions  peace tribunals instituted for the greater glory of war will not replace it  whether such a principle existswho can say  if it does not then it ought to be invented  a sage with a sense of humour and a heart of compassion should set about it without loss of time and a solemn prophet full of words and fire ought to be given the task of preparing the minds  so far there is no trace of such a principle anywhere in sight even its plausible imitations never very effective have disappeared long ago before the doctrine of national aspirations  il ny a plus deuropethere is only an armed and trading continent the home of slowly maturing economical contests for life and death and of loudly proclaimed worldwide ambitions  there are also other ambitions not so loud but deeply rooted in the envious acquisitive temperament of the last corner amongst the great powers of the continent whose feet are not exactly in the oceannot yetand whose head is very high upin pomerania the breeding place of such precious grenadiers that prince bismarck whom it is a pleasure to quote would not have given the bones of one of them for the settlement of the old eastern question  but times have changed since by way of keeping up i suppose some old barbaric german rite the faithful servant of the hohenzollerns was buried alive to celebrate the accession of a new emperor  already the voice of surmises has been heard hinting tentatively at a possible regrouping of european powers  the alliance of the three empires is supposed possible  and it may be possible  the myth of russias power is dying very hardhard enough for that combination to take placesuch is the fascination that a discredited show of numbers will still exercise upon the imagination of a people trained to the worship of force  germany may be willing to lend its support to a tottering autocracy for the sake of an undisputed first place and of a preponderating voice in the settlement of every question in that south east of europe which merges into asia  no principle being involved in such an alliance of mere expediency it would never be allowed to stand in the way of germanys other ambitions  the fall of autocracy would bring its restraint automatically to an end  thus it may be believed that the support russian despotism may get from its once humble friend and client will not be stamped by that thoroughness which is supposed to be the mark of german superiority  russia weakened down to the second place or russia eclipsed altogether during the throes of her regeneration will answer equally well the plans of german policywhich are many and various and often incredible though the aim of them all is the same aggrandisement of territory and influence with no regard to right and justice either in the east or in the west  for that and no other is the true note of your weltpolitik which desires to live  the german eagle with a prussian head looks all round the horizon not so much for something to do that would count for good in the records of the earth as simply for something good to get  he gazes upon the land and upon the sea with the same covetous steadiness for he has become of late a maritime eagle and has learned to box the compass  he gazes north and south and east and west and is inclined to look intemperately upon the waters of the mediterranean when they are blue  the disappearance of the russian phantom has given a foreboding of unwonted freedom to the welt politik  according to the national tendency this assumption of imperial impulses would run into the grotesque were it not for the spikes of the pickelhaubes peeping out grimly from behind  germanys attitude proves that no peace for the earth can be found in the expansion of material interests which she seems to have adopted exclusively as her only aim ideal and watchword  for the use of those who gaze halfunbelieving at the passing away of the russian phantom part ghoul part djinn part old man of the sea and wait halfdoubting for the birth of a nations soul in this age which knows no miracles the oncefamous saying of poor gambetta tribune of the people who was simple and believed in the immanent justice of things may be adapted in the shape of a warning that so far as a future of liberty concord and justice is concerned le prussianismevoila lennemi    the crime of partition1919   at the end of the eighteenth century when the partition of poland had become an accomplished fact the world qualified it at once as a crime this strong condemnation proceeded of course from the west of europe the powers of the centre prussia and austria were not likely to admit that this spoliation fell into the category of acts morally reprehensible and carrying the taint of antisocial guilt  as to russia the third party to the crime and the originator of the scheme she had no national conscience at the time  the will of its rulers was always accepted by the people as the expression of an omnipotence derived directly from god as an act of mere conquest the best excuse for the partition lay simply in the fact that it happened to be possible there was the plunder and there was the opportunity to get hold of it  catherine the great looked upon this extension of her dominions with a cynical satisfaction  her political argument that the destruction of poland meant the repression of revolutionary ideas and the checking of the spread of jacobinism in europe was a characteristically impudent pretence  there may have been minds here and there amongst the russians that perceived or perhaps only felt that by the annexation of the greater part of the polish republic russia approached nearer to the comity of civilised nations and ceased at least territorially to be an asiatic power  it was only after the partition of poland that russia began to play a great part in europe  to such statesmen as she had then that act of brigandage must have appeared inspired by great political wisdom  the king of prussia faithful to the ruling principle of his life wished simply to aggrandise his dominions at a much smaller cost and at much less risk than he could have done in any other direction for at that time poland was perfectly defenceless from a material point of view and more than ever perhaps inclined to put its faith in humanitarian illusions  morally the republic was in a state of ferment and consequent weakness which so often accompanies the period of social reform  the strength arrayed against her was just then overwhelming i mean the comparatively honest because open strength of armed forces but probably from innate inclination towards treachery frederick of prussia selected for himself the part of falsehood and deception appearing on the scene in the character of a friend he entered deliberately into a treaty of alliance with the republic and then before the ink was dry tore it up in brazen defiance of the commonest decency which must have been extremely gratifying to his natural tastes  as to austria it shed diplomatic tears over the transaction  they cannot be called crocodile tears insomuch that they were in a measure sincere  they arose from a vivid perception that austrias allotted share of the spoil could never compensate her for the accession of strength and territory to the other two powers  austria did not really want an extension of territory at the cost of poland  she could not hope to improve her frontier in that way and economically she had no need of galicia a province whose natural resources were undeveloped and whose salt mines did not arouse her cupidity because she had salt mines of her own  no doubt the democratic complexion of polish institutions was very distasteful to the conservative monarchy austrian statesmen did see at the time that the real danger to the principle of autocracy was in the west in france and that all the forces of central europe would be needed for its suppression  but the movement towards a partage on the part of russia and prussia was too definite to be resisted and austria had to follow their lead in the destruction of a state which she would have preferred to preserve as a possible ally against prussian and russian ambitions  it may be truly said that the destruction of poland secured the safety of the french revolution  for when in 1795 the crime was consummated the revolution had turned the corner and was in a state to defend itself against the forces of reaction  in the second half of the eighteenth century there were two centres of liberal ideas on the continent of europe france and poland  on an impartial survey one may say without exaggeration that then france was relatively every bit as weak as poland even perhaps more so  but frances geographical position made her much less vulnerable  she had no powerful neighbours on her frontier a decayed spain in the south and a conglomeration of small german principalities on the east were her happy lot  the only states which dreaded the contamination of the new principles and had enough power to combat it were prussia austria and russia and they had another centre of forbidden ideas to deal with in defenceless poland unprotected by nature and offering an immediate satisfaction to their cupidity  they made their choice and the untold sufferings of a nation which would not die was the price exacted by fate for the triumph of revolutionary ideals  thus even a crime may become a moral agent by the lapse of time and the course of history  progress leaves its dead by the way for progress is only a great adventure as its leaders and chiefs know very well in their hearts  it is a march into an undiscovered country and in such an enterprise the victims do not count  as an emotional outlet for the oratory of freedom it was convenient enough to remember the crime now and then the crime being the murder of a state and the carving of its body into three pieces  there was really nothing to do but to drop a few tears and a few flowers of rhetoric upon the grave  but the spirit of the nation refused to rest therein  it haunted the territories of the old republic in the manner of a ghost haunting its ancestral mansion where strangers are making themselves at home a calumniated ridiculed and poohpoohd ghost and yet never ceasing to inspire a sort of awe a strange uneasiness in the hearts of the unlawful possessors  poland deprived of its independence of its historical continuity with its religion and language persecuted and repressed became a mere geographical expression  and even that itself seemed strangely vague had lost its definite character was rendered doubtful by the theories and the claims of the spoliators who by a strange effect of uneasy conscience while strenuously denying the moral guilt of the transaction were always trying to throw a veil of high rectitude over the crime  what was most annoying to their righteousness was the fact that the nation stabbed to the heart refused to grow insensible and cold  that persistent and almost uncanny vitality was sometimes very inconvenient to the rest of europe also  it would intrude its irresistible claim into every problem of european politics into the theory of european equilibrium into the question of the near east the italian question the question of schleswigholstein and into the doctrine of nationalities  that ghost not content with making its ancestral halls uncomfortable for the thieves haunted also the cabinets of europe waved indecently its bloodstained robes in the solemn atmosphere of council rooms where congresses and conferences sit with closed windows  it would not be exorcised by the brutal jeers of bismarck and the fine railleries of gorchakov  as a polish friend observed to me some years ago till the year 48 the polish problem has been to a certain extent a convenient rallyingpoint for all manifestations of liberalism  since that time we have come to be regarded simply as a nuisance  its very disagreeable  i agreed that it was and he continued what are we to do  we did not create the situation by any outside action of ours  through all the centuries of its existence poland has never been a menace to anybody not even to the turks to whom it has been merely an obstacle  nothing could be more true  the spirit of aggressiveness was absolutely foreign to the polish temperament to which the preservation of its institutions and its liberties was much more precious than any ideas of conquest  polish wars were defensive and they were mostly fought within polands own borders  and that those territories were often invaded was but a misfortune arising from its geographical position  territorial expansion was never the masterthought of polish statesmen  the consolidation of the territories of the serenissime republic which made of it a power of the first rank for a time was not accomplished by force  it was not the consequence of successful aggression but of a long and successful defence against the raiding neighbours from the east the lands of lithuanian and ruthenian speech were never conquered by poland  these peoples were not compelled by a series of exhausting wars to seek safety in annexation  it was not the will of a prince or a political intrigue that brought about the union  neither was it fear the slowlymatured view of the economical and social necessities and before all the ripening moral sense of the masses were the motives that induced the forty three representatives of lithuanian and ruthenian provinces led by their paramount prince to enter into a political combination unique in the history of the world a spontaneous and complete union of sovereign states choosing deliberately the way of peace  never was strict truth better expressed in a political instrument than in the preamble of the first union treaty 1413  it begins with the words this union being the outcome not of hatred but of lovewords that poles have not heard addressed to them politically by any nation for the last hundred and fifty years  this union being an organic living thing capable of growth and development was later modified and confirmed by two other treaties which guaranteed to all the parties in a just and eternal union all their rights liberties and respective institutions  the polish state offers a singular instance of an extremely liberal administrative federalism which in its parliamentary life as well as its international politics presented a complete unity of feeling and purpose  as an eminent french diplomatist remarked many years ago it is a very remarkable fact in the history of the polish state this invariable and unanimous consent of the populations the more so that the king being looked upon simply as the chief of the republic there was no monarchical bond no dynastic fidelity to control and guide the sentiment of the nations and their union remained as a pure affirmation of the national will  the grand duchy of lithuania and its ruthenian provinces retained their statutes their own administration and their own political institutions  that those institutions in the course of time tended to assimilation with the polish form was not the result of any pressure but simply of the superior character of polish civilisation  even after poland lost its independence this alliance and this union remained firm in spirit and fidelity  all the national movements towards liberation were initiated in the name of the whole mass of people inhabiting the limits of the old republic and all the provinces took part in them with complete devotion  it is only in the last generation that efforts have been made to create a tendency towards separation which would indeed serve no one but polands common enemies  and strangely enough it is the internationalists men who professedly care nothing for race or country who have set themselves this task of disruption one can easily see for what sinister purpose  the ways of the internationalists may be dark but they are not inscrutable  from the same source no doubt there will flow in the future a poisoned stream of hints of a reconstituted poland being a danger to the races once so closely associated within the territories of the old republic the old partners in the crime are not likely to forgive their victim its inconvenient and almost shocking obstinacy in keeping alive  they had tried moral assassination before and with some small measure of success for indeed the polish question like all living reproaches had become a nuisance  given the wrong and the apparent impossibility of righting it without running risks of a serious nature some moral alleviation may be found in the belief that the victim had brought its misfortunes on its own head by its own sins  that theory too had been advanced about poland as if other nations had known nothing of sin and folly and it made some way in the world at different times simply because good care was taken by the interested parties to stop the mouth of the accused  but it has never carried much conviction to honest minds  somehow in defiance of the cynical point of view as to the force of lies and against all the power of falsified evidence truth often turns out to be stronger than calumny  with the course of years however another danger sprang up a danger arising naturally from the new political alliances dividing europe into two armed camps  it was the danger of silence  almost without exception the press of western europe in the twentieth century refused to touch the polish question in any shape or form whatever  never was the fact of polish vitality more embarrassing to european diplomacy than on the eve of polands resurrection  when the war broke out there was something gruesomely comic in the proclamations of emperors and archdukes appealing to that invincible soul of a nation whose existence or moral worth they had been so arrogantly denying for more than a century  perhaps in the whole record of human transactions there have never been performances so brazen and so vile as the manifestoes of the german emperor and the grand duke nicholas of russia and i imagine no more bitter insult has been offered to human heart and intelligence than the way in which those proclamations were flung into the face of historical truth  it was like a scene in a cynical and sinister farce the absurdity of which became in some sort unfathomable by the reflection that nobody in the world could possibly be so abjectly stupid as to be deceived for a single moment  at that time and for the first two months of the war i happened to be in poland and i remember perfectly well that when those precious documents came out the confidence in the moral turpitude of mankind they implied did not even raise a scornful smile on the lips of men whose most sacred feelings and dignity they outraged  they did not deign to waste their contempt on them  in fact the situation was too poignant and too involved for either hot scorn or a coldly rational discussion  for the poles it was like being in a burning house of which all the issues were locked  there was nothing but sheer anguish under the strange as if stony calmness which in the utter absence of all hope falls on minds that are not constitutionally prone to despair  yet in this time of dismay the irrepressible vitality of the nation would not accept a neutral attitude i was told that even if there were no issue it was absolutely necessary for the poles to affirm their national existence  passivity which could be regarded as a craven acceptance of all the material and moral horrors ready to fall upon the nation was not to be thought of for a moment therefore it was explained to me the poles must act  whether this was a counsel of wisdom or not it is very difficult to say but there are crises of the soul which are beyond the reach of wisdom  when there is apparently no issue visible to the eyes of reason sentiment may yet find a way out either towards salvation or to utter perdition no one can telland the sentiment does not even ask the question  being there as a stranger in that tense atmosphere which was yet not unfamiliar to me i was not very anxious to parade my wisdom especially after it had been pointed out in answer to my cautious arguments that if life has its values worth fighting for death too has that in it which can make it worthy or unworthy  out of the mental and moral trouble into which the grouping of the powers at the beginning of war had thrown the counsels of poland there emerged at last the decision that the polish legions a peace organisation in galicia directed by pilsudski afterwards given the rank of general and now apparently the chief of the government in warsaw should take the field against the russians  in reality it did not matter against which partner in the crime polish resentment should be directed  there was little to choose between the methods of russian barbarism which were both crude and rotten and the cultivated brutality tinged with contempt of germanys superficial grinding civilisation  there was nothing to choose between them  both were hateful and the direction of the polish effort was naturally governed by austrias tolerant attitude which had connived for years at the semisecret organisation of the polish legions besides the material possibility pointed out the way  that poland should have turned at first against the ally of western powers to whose moral support she had been looking for so many years is not a greater monstrosity than that alliance with russia which had been entered into by england and france with rather less excuse and with a view to eventualities which could perhaps have been avoided by a firmer policy and by a greater resolution in the face of what plainly appeared unavoidable  for let the truth be spoken  the action of germany however cruel sanguinary and faithless was nothing in the nature of a stab in the dark  the germanic tribes had told the whole world in all possible tones carrying conviction the gently persuasive the coldly logical in tones hegelian nietzschean warlike pious cynical inspired what they were going to do to the inferior races of the earth so full of sin and all unworthiness  but with a strange similarity to the prophets of old who were also great moralists and invokers of might they seemed to be crying in a desert  whatever might have been the secret searching of hearts the worthless ones would not take heed  it must also be admitted that the conduct of the menaced governments carried with it no suggestion of resistance  it was no doubt the effect of neither courage nor fear but of that prudence which causes the average man to stand very still in the presence of a savage dog  it was not a very politic attitude and the more reprehensible in so far that it seemed to arise from the mistrust of their own peoples fortitude  on simple matters of life and death a people is always better than its leaders because a people cannot argue itself as a whole into a sophisticated state of mind out of deference for a mere doctrine or from an exaggerated sense of its own cleverness  i am speaking now of democracies whose chiefs resemble the tyrant of syracuse in this that their power is unlimited for who can limit the will of a voting people and who always see the domestic sword hanging by a hair above their heads  perhaps a different attitude would have checked german selfconfidence and her overgrown militarism would have died from the excess of its own strength  what would have been then the moral state of europe it is difficult to say  some other excess would probably have taken its place excess of theory or excess of sentiment or an excess of the sense of security leading to some other form of catastrophe but it is certain that in that case the polish question would not have taken a concrete form for ages  perhaps it would never have taken form  in this world where everything is transient even the most reproachful ghosts end by vanishing out of old mansions out of mens consciences  progress of enlightenment or decay of faith  in the years before the war the polish ghost was becoming so thin that it was impossible to get for it the slightest mention in the papers  a young pole coming to me from paris was extremely indignant but i indulging in that detachment which is the product of greater age longer experience and a habit of meditation refused to share that sentiment  he had gone begging for a word on poland to many influential people and they had one and all told him that they were going to do no such thing  they were all men of ideas and therefore might have been called idealists but the notion most strongly anchored in their minds was the folly of touching a question which certainly had no merit of actuality and would have had the appalling effect of provoking the wrath of their old enemies and at the same time offending the sensibilities of their new friends  it was an unanswerable argument  i couldnt share my young friends surprise and indignation my practice of reflection had also convinced me that there is nothing on earth that turns quicker on its pivot than political idealism when touched by the breath of practical politics  it would be good to remember that polish independence as embodied in a polish state is not the gift of any kind of journalism neither is it the outcome even of some particularly benevolent idea or of any clearly apprehended sense of guilt  i am speaking of what i know when i say that the original and only formative idea in europe was the idea of delivering the fate of poland into the hands of russian tsarism  and let us remember it was assumed then to be a victorious tsarism at that  it was an idea talked of openly entertained seriously presented as a benevolence with a curious blindness to its grotesque and ghastly character  it was the idea of delivering the victim with a kindly smile and the confident assurance that it would be all right to a perfectly unrepentant assassin who after sawing furiously at its throat for a hundred years or so was expected to make friends suddenly and kiss it on both cheeks in the mystic russian fashion  it was a singularly nightmarish combination of international polity and no whisper of any other would have been officially tolerated  indeed i do not think in the whole extent of western europe there was anybody who had the slightest mind to whisper on that subject  those were the days of the dark future when benckendorf put down his name on the committee for the relief of polish populations driven by the russian armies into the heart of russia when the grand duke nicholas the gentleman who advocated a st bartholomews night for the suppression of russian liberalism was displaying his divine i have read the very word in an english newspaper of standing strategy in the great retreat where mr iswolsky carried himself haughtily on the banks of the seine and it was beginning to dawn upon certain people there that he was a greater nuisance even than the polish question  but there is no use in talking about all that  some clever person has said that it is always the unexpected that happens and on a calm and dispassionate survey the world does appear mainly to one as a scene of miracles  out of germanys strength in whose purpose so many people refused to believe came polands opportunity in which nobody could have been expected to believe  out of russias collapse emerged that forbidden thing the polish independence not as a vengeful figure the retributive shadow of the crime but as something much more solid and more difficult to get rid ofa political necessity and a moral solution directly it appeared its practical usefulness became undeniable and also the fact that for better or worse it was impossible to get rid of it again except by the unthinkable way of another carving of another partition of another crime  therein lie the strength and the future of the thing so strictly forbidden no farther back than two years or so of the polish independence expressed in a polish state  it comes into the world morally free not in virtue of its sufferings but in virtue of its miraculous rebirth and of its ancient claim for services rendered to europe  not a single one of the combatants of all the fronts of the world has died consciously for polands freedom  that supreme opportunity was denied even to polands own children  and it is just as well  providence in its inscrutable way had been merciful for had it been otherwise the load of gratitude would have been too great the sense of obligation too crushing the joy of deliverance too fearful for mortals common sinners with the rest of mankind before the eye of the most high  those who died east and west leaving so much anguish and so much pride behind them died neither for the creation of states nor for empty words nor yet for the salvation of general ideas  they died neither for democracy nor leagues nor systems nor yet for abstract justice which is an unfathomable mystery  they died for something too deep for words too mighty for the common standards by which reason measures the advantages of life and death too sacred for the vain discourses that come and go on the lips of dreamers fanatics humanitarians and statesmen  they died      polands independence springs up from that great immolation but polands loyalty to europe will not be rooted in anything so trenchant and burdensome as the sense of an immeasurable indebtedness of that gratitude which in a worldly sense is sometimes called eternal but which lies always at the mercy of weariness and is fatally condemned by the instability of human sentiments to end in negation  polish loyalty will be rooted in something much more solid and enduring in something that could never be called eternal but which is in fact lifeenduring  it will be rooted in the national temperament which is about the only thing on earth that can be trusted  men may deteriorate they may improve too but they dont change  misfortune is a hard school which may either mature or spoil a national character but it may be reasonably advanced that the long course of adversity of the most cruel kind has not injured the fundamental characteristics of the polish nation which has proved its vitality against the most demoralising odds  the various phases of the polish sense of selfpreservation struggling amongst the menacing forces and the no less threatening chaos of the neighbouring powers should be judged impartially  i suggest impartiality and not indulgence simply because when appraising the polish question it is not necessary to invoke the softer emotions  a little calm reflection on the past and the present is all that is necessary on the part of the western world to judge the movements of a community whose ideals are the same but whose situation is unique  this situation was brought vividly home to me in the course of an argument more than eighteen months ago  dont forget i was told that poland has got to live in contact with germany and russia to the end of time  do you understand the force of that expression to the end of time  facts must be taken into account and especially appalling facts such as this to which there is no possible remedy on earth  for reasons which are properly speaking physiological a prospect of friendship with germans or russians even in the most distant future is unthinkable  any alliance of heart and mind would be a monstrous thing and monsters as we all know cannot live you cant base your conduct on a monstrous conception  we are either worth or not worth preserving but the horrible psychology of the situation is enough to drive the national mind to distraction  yet under a destructive pressure of which western europe can have no notion applied by forces that were not only crushing but corrupting we have preserved our sanity  therefore there can be no fear of our losing our minds simply because the pressure is removed  we have neither lost our heads nor yet our moral sense  oppression not merely political but affecting social relations family life the deepest affections of human nature and the very fount of natural emotions has never made us vengeful  it is worthy of notice that with every incentive present in our emotional reactions we had no recourse to political assassination arms in hand hopeless or hopefully and always against immeasurable odds we did affirm ourselves and the justice of our cause but wild justice has never been a part of our conception of national manliness  in all the history of polish oppression there was only one shot fired which was not in battle  only one  and the man who fired it in paris at the emperor alexander ii was but an individual connected with no organisation representing no shade of polish opinion  the only effect in poland was that of profound regret not at the failure but at the mere fact of the attempt  the history of our captivity is free from that stain and whatever follies in the eyes of the world we may have perpetrated we have neither murdered our enemies nor acted treacherously against them nor yet have been reduced to the point of cursing each other  i could not gainsay the truth of that discourse i saw as clearly as my interlocutor the impossibility of the faintest sympathetic bond between poland and her neighbours ever being formed in the future  the only course that remains to a reconstituted poland is the elaboration establishment and preservation of the most correct method of political relations with neighbours to whom polands existence is bound to be a humiliation and an offence  calmly considered it is an appalling task yet one may put ones trust in that national temperament which is so completely free from aggressiveness and revenge  therein lie the foundations of all hope  the success of renewed life for that nation whose fate is to remain in exile ever isolated from the west amongst hostile surroundings depends on the sympathetic understanding of its problems by its distant friends the western powers which in their democratic development must recognise the moral and intellectual kinship of that distant outpost of their own type of civilisation which was the only basis of polish culture  whatever may be the future of russia and the final organisation of germany the old hostility must remain unappeased the fundamental antagonism must endure for years to come  the crime of the partition was committed by autocratic governments which were the governments of their time but those governments were characterised in the past as they will be in the future by their peoples national traits which remain utterly incompatible with the polish mentality and polish sentiment  both the german submissiveness idealistic as it may be and the russian lawlessness fed on the corruption of all the virtues are utterly foreign to the polish nation whose qualities and defects are altogether of another kind tending to a certain exaggeration of individualism and perhaps to an extreme belief in the governing power of free assent the one invariably vital principle in the internal government of the old republic  there was never a history more free from political bloodshed than the history of the polish state which never knew either feudal institutions or feudal quarrels  at the time when heads were falling on the scaffolds all over europe there was only one political execution in polandonly one and as to that there still exists a tradition that the great chancellor who democratised polish institutions and had to order it in pursuance of his political purpose could not settle that matter with his conscience till the day of his death  poland too had her civil wars but this can hardly be made a matter of reproach to her by the rest of the world  conducted with humanity they left behind them no animosities and no sense of repression and certainly no legacy of hatred  they were but a recognised argument in political discussion and tended always towards conciliation  i cannot imagine whatever form of democratic government poland elaborates for itself that either the nation or its leaders would do anything but welcome the closest scrutiny of their renewed political existence  the difficulty of the problem of that existence will be so great that some errors will be unavoidable and one may be sure that they will be taken advantage of by its neighbours to discredit that living witness to a great historical crime  if not the actual frontiers then the moral integrity of the new state is sure to be assailed before the eyes of europe  economical enmity will also come into play when the worlds work is resumed again and competition asserts its power  charges of aggression are certain to be made especially as related to the small states formed of the territories of the old republic  and everybody knows the power of lies which go about clothed in coats of many colours whereas as is well known truth has no such advantage and for that reason is often suppressed as not altogether proper for everyday purposes  it is not often recognised because it is not always fit to be seen  already there are innuendoes threats hints thrown out and even awful instances fabricated out of inadequate materials but it is historically unthinkable that the poland of the future with its sacred tradition of freedom and its hereditary sense of respect for the rights of individuals and states should seek its prosperity in aggressive action or in moral violence against that part of its once fellowcitizens who are ruthenians or lithuanians  the only influence that cannot be restrained is simply the influence of time which disengages truth from all facts with a merciless logic and prevails over the passing opinions the changing impulses of men  there can be no doubt that the moral impulses and the material interests of the new nationalities which seem to play now the game of disintegration for the benefit of the worlds enemies will in the end bring them nearer to the poland of this wars creation will unite them sooner or later by a spontaneous movement towards the state which had adopted and brought them up in the development of its own humane culturethe offspring of the west    a note on the polish problem1916   we must start from the assumption that promises made by proclamation at the beginning of this war may be binding on the individuals who made them under the stress of coming events but cannot be regarded as binding the governments after the end of the war  poland has been presented with three proclamations  two of them were in such contrast with the avowed principles and the historic action for the last hundred years since the congress of vienna of the powers concerned that they were more like cynical insults to the nations deepest feelings its memory and its intelligence than state papers of a conciliatory nature  the german promises awoke nothing but indignant contempt the russian a bitter incredulity of the most complete kind  the austrian proclamation which made no promises and contented itself with pointing out the austro polish relations for the last fortyfive years was received in silence for it is a fact that in austrian poland alone polish nationality was recognised as an element of the empire and individuals could breathe the air of freedom of civil life if not of political independence  but for poles to be germanophile is unthinkable  to be russophile or austrophile is at best a counsel of despair in view of a european situation which because of the grouping of the powers seems to shut from them every hope expressed or unexpressed of a national future nursed through more than a hundred years of suffering and oppression  through most of these years and especially since 1830 poland i use this expression since poland exists as a spiritual entity today as definitely as it ever existed in her past has put her faith in the western powers  politically it may have been nothing more than a consoling illusion and the nation had a halfconsciousness of this  but what poland was looking for from the western powers without discouragement and with unbroken confidence was moral support  this is a fact of the sentimental order  but such facts have their positive value for their idealism derives from perhaps the highest kind of reality  a sentiment asserts its claim by its force persistence and universality  in poland that sentimental attitude towards the western powers is universal  it extends to all classes  the very children are affected by it as soon as they begin to think  the political value of such a sentiment consists in this that it is based on profound resemblances  therefore one can build on it as if it were a material fact  for the same reason it would be unsafe to disregard it if one proposed to build solidly  the poles whom superficial or illinformed theorists are trying to force into the social and psychological formula of slavonism are in truth not slavonic at all in temperament in feeling in mind and even in unreason they are western with an absolute comprehension of all western modes of thought even of those which are remote from their historical experience  that element of racial unity which may be called polonism remained compressed between prussian germanism on one side and the russian slavonism on the other  for germanism it feels nothing but hatred  but between polonism and slavonism there is not so much hatred as a complete and ineradicable incompatibility  no political work of reconstructing poland either as a matter of justice or expediency could be sound which would leave the new creation in dependence to germanism or to slavonism  the first need not be considered  the second must beunless the powers elect to drop the polish question either under the cover of vague assurances or without any disguise whatever  but if it is considered it will be seen at once that the slavonic solution of the polish question can offer no guarantees of duration or hold the promise of security for the peace of europe  the only basis for it would be the grand dukes manifesto  but that manifesto signed by a personage now removed from europe to asia and by a man moreover who if true to himself to his conception of patriotism and to his family tradition could not have put his hand to it with any sincerity of purpose is now divested of all authority  the forcible vagueness of its promises its startling inconsistency with the hundred years of ruthlessly denationalising oppression permit one to doubt whether it was ever meant to have any authority  but in any case it could have had no effect  the very nature of things would have brought to nought its professed intentions  it is impossible to suppose that a state of russias power and antecedents would tolerate a privileged community of to russia unnational complexion within the body of the empire  all history shows that such an arrangement however hedged in by the most solemn treaties and declarations cannot last  in this case it would lead to a tragic issue  the absorption of polonism is unthinkable  the last hundred years of european history proves it undeniably  there remains then extirpation a process of blood and iron and the last act of the polish drama would be played then before a europe too weary to interfere and to the applause of germany  it would not be just to say that the disappearance of polonism would add any strength to the slavonic power of expansion  it would add no strength but it would remove a possibly effective barrier against the surprises the future of europe may hold in store for the western powers  thus the question whether polonism is worth saving presents itself as a problem of politics with a practical bearing on the stability of european peaceas a barrier or perhaps better in view of its detached position as an outpost of the western powers placed between the great might of slavonism which has not yet made up its mind to anything and the organised germanism which has spoken its mind with no uncertain voice before the world  looked at in that light alone polonism seems worth saving  that it has lived so long on its trust in the moral support of the western powers may give it another and even stronger claim based on a truth of a more profound kind  polonism had resisted the utmost efforts of germanism and slavonism for more than a hundred years  why  because of the strength of its ideals conscious of their kinship with the west  such a power of resistance creates a moral obligation which it would be unsafe to neglect  there is always a risk in throwing away a tool of proved temper  in this profound conviction of the practical and ideal worth of polonism one approaches the problem of its preservation with a very vivid sense of the practical difficulties derived from the grouping of the powers  the uncertainty of the extent and of the actual form of victory for the allies will increase the difficulty of formulating a plan of polish regeneration at the present moment  poland to strike its roots again into the soil of political europe will require a guarantee of security for the healthy development and for the untrammelled play of such institutions as she may be enabled to give to herself  those institutions will be animated by the spirit of polonism which having been a factor in the history of europe and having proved its vitality under oppression has established its right to live  that spirit despised and hated by germany and incompatible with slavonism because of moral differences cannot avoid being in its renewed assertion an object of dislike and mistrust  as an unavoidable consequence of the past poland will have to begin its existence in an atmosphere of enmities and suspicions  that advanced outpost of western civilisation will have to hold its ground in the midst of hostile camps always its historical fate  against the menace of such a specially dangerous situation the paper and ink of public treaties cannot be an effective defence  nothing but the actual living active participation of the two western powers in the establishment of the new polish commonwealth and in the first twenty years of its existence will give the poles a sufficient guarantee of security in the work of restoring their national life  an anglofrench protectorate would be the ideal form of moral and material support  but russia as an ally must take her place in it on such a footing as will allay to the fullest extent her possible apprehensions and satisfy her national sentiment  that necessity will have to be formally recognised  in reality russia has ceased to care much for her polish possessions public recognition of a mistake in political morality and a voluntary surrender of territory in the cause of european concord cannot damage the prestige of a powerful state  the new spheres of expansion in regions more easily assimilable will more than compensate russia for the loss of territory on the western frontier of the empire  the experience of dual controls and similar combinations has been so unfortunate in the past that the suggestion of a triple protectorate may well appear at first sight monstrous even to unprejudiced minds  but it must be remembered that this is a unique case and a problem altogether exceptional justifying the employment of exceptional means for its solution  to those who would doubt the possibility of even bringing such a scheme into existence the answer may be made that there are psychological moments when any measure tending towards the ends of concord and justice may be brought into being  and it seems that the end of the war would be the moment for bringing into being the political scheme advocated in this note  its success must depend on the singleness of purpose in the contracting powers and on the wisdom the tact the abilities the goodwill of men entrusted with its initiation and its further control  finally it may be pointed out that this plan is the only one offering serious guarantees to all the parties occupying their respective positions within the scheme  if her existence as a state is admitted as just expedient and necessary poland has the moral right to receive her constitution not from the hand of an old enemy but from the western powers alone though of course with the fullest concurrence of russia  this constitution elaborated by a committee of poles nominated by the three governments will after due discussion and amendment by the high commissioners of the protecting powers be presented to poland as the initial document the charter of her new life freely offered and unreservedly accepted  it should be as simple and short as a written constitution can beestablishing the polish commonwealth settling the lines of representative institutions the form of judicature and leaving the greatest measure possible of selfgovernment to the provinces forming part of the recreated poland  this constitution will be promulgated immediately after the three powers had settled the frontiers of the new state including the town of danzic free port and a proportion of seaboard  the legislature will then be called together and a general treaty will regulate polands international portion as a protected state the status of the high commissioners and suchlike matters  the legislature will ratify thus making poland as it were a party in the establishment of the protectorate  a point of importance  other general treaties will define polands position in the anglofranco russian alliance fix the numbers of the army and settle the participation of the powers in its organisation and training    poland revisited1915   i   i have never believed in political assassination as a means to an end and least of all in assassination of the dynastic order  i dont know how far murder can ever approach the perfection of a fine art but looked upon with the cold eye of reason it seems but a crude expedient of impatient hope or hurried despair  there are few men whose premature death could influence human affairs more than on the surface  the deeper stream of causes depends not on individuals who like the mass of mankind are carried on by a destiny which no murder has ever been able to placate divert or arrest  in july of last year i was a stranger in a strange city in the midlands and particularly out of touch with the worlds politics  never a very diligent reader of newspapers there were at that time reasons of a private order which caused me to be even less informed than usual on public affairs as presented from day to day in that necessarily atmosphereless perspectiveless manner of the daily papers which somehow for a man possessed of some historic sense robs them of all real interest  i dont think i had looked at a daily for a month past  but though a stranger in a strange city i was not lonely thanks to a friend who had travelled there out of pure kindness to bear me company in a conjuncture which in a most private sense was somewhat trying  it was this friend who one morning at breakfast informed me of the murder of the archduke ferdinand  the impression was mediocre  i was barely aware that such a man existed i remembered only that not long before he had visited london  the recollection was rather of a cloud of insignificant printed words his presence in this country provoked  various opinions had been expressed of him but his importance was archducal dynastic purely accidental  can there be in the world of real men anything more shadowy than an archduke  and now he was no more removed with an atrocity of circumstances which made one more sensible of his humanity than when he was in life  i connected that crime with balkanic plots and aspirations so little that i had actually to ask where it had happened  my friend told me it was in serajevo and wondered what would be the consequences of that grave event  he asked me what i thought would happen next  it was with perfect sincerity that i answered nothing and having a great repugnance to consider murder as a factor of politics i dismissed the subject  it fitted with my ethical sense that an act cruel and absurd should be also useless  i had also the vision of a crowd of shadowy archdukes in the background out of which one would step forward to take the place of that dead man in the light of the european stage and then to speak the whole truth there was no man capable of forming a judgment who attended so little to the march of events as i did at that time  what for want of a more definite term i must call my mind was fixed upon my own affairs not because they were in a bad posture but because of their fascinating holidaypromising aspect  i had been obtaining my information as to europe at second hand from friends good enough to come down now and then to see us  they arrived with their pockets full of crumpled newspapers and answered my queries casually with gentle smiles of scepticism as to the reality of my interest  and yet i was not indifferent but the tension in the balkans had become chronic after the acute crisis and one could not help being less conscious of it  it had wearied out ones attention  who could have guessed that on that wild stage we had just been looking at a miniature rehearsal of the great worlddrama the reduced model of the very passions and violences of what the future held in store for the powers of the old world  here and there perhaps rare minds had a suspicion of that possibility while they watched old europe stagemanaging fussily by means of notes and conferences the prophetic reproduction of its awaiting fate  it was wonderfully exact in the spirit same roar of guns same protestations of superiority same words in the air race liberation justiceand the same mood of trivial demonstrations  one could not take today a ticket for petersburg  you mean petrograd would say the booking clerk  shortly after the fall of adrianople a friend of mine passing through sophia asked for some cafe turc at the end of his lunch  monsieur veut dire cafe balkanique the patriotic waiter corrected him austerely  i will not say that i had not observed something of that instructive aspect of the war of the balkans both in its first and in its second phase  but those with whom i touched upon that vision were pleased to see in it the evidence of my alarmist cynicism  as to alarm i pointed out that fear is natural to man and even salutary  it has done as much as courage for the preservation of races and institutions  but from a charge of cynicism i have always shrunk instinctively  it is like a charge of being blind in one eye a moral disablement a sort of disgraceful calamity that must he carried off with a jaunty bearinga sort of thing i am not capable of  rather than be thought a mere jaunty cripple i allowed myself to be blinded by the gross obviousness of the usual arguments  it was pointed out to me that these eastern nations were not far removed from a savage state  their economics were yet at the stage of scratching the earth and feeding the pigs  the highlydeveloped material civilisation of europe could not allow itself to be disturbed by a war  the industry and the finance could not allow themselves to be disorganised by the ambitions of an idle class or even the aspirations whatever they might be of the masses  very plausible all this sounded  war does not pay  there had been a book written on that themean attempt to put pacificism on a material basis  nothing more solid in the way of argument could have been advanced on this trading and manufacturing globe  war was bad business  this was final  but truth to say on this july day i reflected but little on the condition of the civilised world  whatever sinister passions were heaving under its splendid and complex surface i was too agitated by a simple and innocent desire of my own to notice the signs or interpret them correctly  the most innocent of passions will take the edge off ones judgment  the desire which possessed me was simply the desire to travel  and that being so it would have taken something very plain in the way of symptoms to shake my simple trust in the stability of things on the continent  my sentiment and not my reason was engaged there  my eyes were turned to the past not to the future the past that one cannot suspect and mistrust the shadowy and unquestionable moral possession the darkest struggles of which wear a halo of glory and peace  in the preceding month of may we had received an invitation to spend some weeks in poland in a country house in the neighbourhood of cracow but within the russian frontier  the enterprise at first seemed to me considerable  since leaving the sea to which i have been faithful for so many years i have discovered that there is in my composition very little stuff from which travellers are made  i confess that my first impulse about a projected journey is to leave it alone  but the invitation received at first with a sort of dismay ended by rousing the dormant energy of my feelings  cracow is the town where i spent with my father the last eighteen months of his life  it was in that old royal and academical city that i ceased to be a child became a boy had known the friendships the admirations the thoughts and the indignations of that age  it was within those historical walls that i began to understand things form affections lay up a store of memories and a fund of sensations with which i was to break violently by throwing myself into an unrelated existence  it was like the experience of another world  the wings of time made a great dusk over all this and i feared at first that if i ventured bodily in there i would discover that i who have had to do with a good many imaginary lives have been embracing mere shadows in my youth  i feared  but fear in itself may become a fascination  men have gone alone and trembling into graveyards at midnightjust to see what would happen  and this adventure was to be pursued in sunshine  neither would it be pursued alone  the invitation was extended to us all  this journey would have something of a migratory character the invasion of a tribe  my present all that gave solidity and value to it at any rate would stand by me in this test of the reality of my past  i was pleased with the idea of showing my companions what polish country life was like to visit the town where i was at school before the boys by my side should grow too old and gaining an individual past of their own should lose their unsophisticated interest in mine  it is only in the short instants of early youth that we have the faculty of coming out of ourselves to see dimly the visions and share the emotions of another soul  for youth all is reality in this world and with justice since it apprehends so vividly its images behind which a longer life makes one doubt whether there is any substance  i trusted to the fresh receptivity of these young beings in whom unless heredity is an empty word there should have been a fibre which would answer to the sight to the atmosphere to the memories of that corner of the earth where my own boyhood had received its earliest independent impressions  the first days of the third week in july while the telegraph wires hummed with the words of enormous import which were to fill blue books yellow books white books and to arouse the wonder of mankind passed for us in lighthearted preparations for the journey  what was it but just a rush through germany to get across as quickly as possible  germany is the part of the earths solid surface of which i know the least  in all my life i had been across it only twice  i may well say of it vidi tantum and the very little i saw was through the window of a railway carriage at express speed  those journeys of mine had been more like pilgrimages when one hurries on towards the goal for the satisfaction of a deeper need than curiosity  in this last instance too i was so incurious that i would have liked to have fallen asleep on the shores of england and opened my eyes if it were possible only on the other side of the silesian frontier  yet in truth as many others have done i had sensed itthat promised land of steel of chemical dyes of method of efficiency that race planted in the middle of europe assuming in grotesque vanity the attitude of europeans amongst effete asiatics or barbarous niggers and with a consciousness of superiority freeing their hands from all moral bonds anxious to take up if i may express myself so the perfect mans burden  meantime in a clearing of the teutonic forest their sages were rearing a tree of cynical wisdom a sort of upas tree whose shade may be seen now lying over the prostrate body of belgium  it must be said that they laboured openly enough watering it with the most authentic sources of all madness and watching with their bespectacled eyes the slow ripening of the glorious bloodred fruit  the sincerest words of peace words of menace and i verily believe words of abasement even if there had been a voice vile enough to utter them would have been wasted on their ecstasy for when the fruit ripens on a branch it must fall  there is nothing on earth that can prevent it   ii   for reasons which at first seemed to me somewhat obscure that one of my companions whose wishes are law decided that our travels should begin in an unusual way by the crossing of the north sea  we should proceed from harwich to hamburg  besides being thirtysix times longer than the dover calais passage this rather unusual route had an air of adventure in better keeping with the romantic feeling of this polish journey which for so many years had been before us in a state of a project full of colour and promise but always retreating elusive like an enticing mirage  and after all it had turned out to be no mirage  no wonder they were excited  its no mean experience to lay your hands on a mirage  the day of departure had come the very hour had struck  the luggage was coming downstairs  it was most convincing  poland then if erased from the map yet existed in reality it was not a mere pays du reve where you can travel only in imagination  for no man they argued not even father an habitual pursuer of dreams would push the love of the novelists art of makebelieve to the point of burdening himself with real trunks for a voyage au pays du reve  as we left the door of our house nestling in perhaps the most peaceful nook in kent the sky after weeks of perfectly brazen serenity veiled its blue depths and started to weep fine tears for the refreshment of the parched fields  a pearly blur settled over them and a light sifted of all glare of everything unkindly and searching that dwells in the splendour of unveiled skies  all unconscious of going towards the very scenes of war i carried off in my eye this tiny fragment of great britain a few fields a wooded rise a clump of trees or two with a short stretch of road and here and there a gleam of red wall and tiled roof above the darkening hedges wrapped up in soft mist and peace  and i felt that all this had a very strong hold on me as the embodiment of a beneficent and gentle spirit that it was dear to me not as an inheritance but as an acquisition as a conquest in the sense in which a woman is conqueredby love which is a sort of surrender  these were strange as if disproportionate thoughts to the matter in hand which was the simplest sort of a continental holiday  and i am certain that my companions near as they are to me felt no other trouble but the suppressed excitement of pleasurable anticipation  the forms and the spirit of the land before their eyes were their inheritance not their conquestwhich is a thing precarious and therefore the most precious possessing you if only by the fear of unworthiness rather than possessed by you  moreover as we sat together in the same railway carriage they were looking forward to a voyage in space whereas i felt more and more plainly that what i had started on was a journey in time into the past a fearful enough prospect for the most consistent but to him who had not known how to preserve against his impulses the order and continuity of his lifeso that at times it presented itself to his conscience as a series of betrayalsstill more dreadful  i down here these thoughts so exclusively personal to explain why there was no room in my consciousness for the apprehension of a european war  i dont mean to say that i ignored the possibility i simply did not think of it  and it made no difference for if i had thought of it it could only have been in the lame and inconclusive way of the common uninitiated mortals and i am sure that nothing short of intellectual certitudeobviously unattainable by the man in the streetcould have stayed me on that journey which now that i had started on it seemed an irrevocable thing a necessity of my selfrespect  london the london before the war flaunting its enormous glare as of a monstrous conflagration up into the black skywith its best venicelike aspect of rainy evenings the wet asphalted streets lying with the sheen of sleeping water in winding canals and the great houses of the city towering all dark like empty palaces above the reflected lights of the glistening roadway  everything in the subdued incomplete nightlife around the mansion house went on normally with its fascinating air of a dead commercial city of sombre walls through which the inextinguishable activity of its millions streamed east and west in a brilliant flow of lighted vehicles  in liverpool street as usual too through the double gates a continuous line of taxicabs glided down the inclined approach and up again like an endless chain of dredgerbuckets pouring in the passengers and dipping them out of the great railway station under the inexorable pallid face of the clock telling off the diminishing minutes of peace  it was the hour of the boattrains to holland to hamburg and there seemed to be no lack of people fearless reckless or ignorant who wanted to go to these places  the station was normally crowded and if there was a great flutter of evening papers in the multitude of hands there were no signs of extraordinary emotion on that multitude of faces  there was nothing in them to distract me from the thought that it was singularly appropriate that i should start from this station on the retraced way of my existence  for this was the station at which thirtyseven years before i arrived on my first visit to london  not the same building but the same spot  at nineteen years of age after a period of probation and training i had imposed upon myself as ordinary seaman on board a north sea coaster i had come up from lowestoftmy first long railway journey in englandto sign on for an antipodean voyage in a deepwater ship  straight from a railway carriage i had walked into the great city with something of the feeling of a traveller penetrating into a vast and unexplored wilderness  no explorer could have been more lonely  i did not know a single soul of all these millions that all around me peopled the mysterious distances of the streets  i cannot say i was free from a little youthful awe but at that age ones feelings are simple  i was elated  i was pursuing a clear aim i was carrying out a deliberate plan of making out of myself in the first place a seaman worthy of the service good enough to work by the side of the men with whom i was to live and in the second place i had to justify my existence to myself to redeem a tacit moral pledge  both these aims were to be attained by the same effort  how simple seemed the problem of life then on that hazy day of early september in the year 1878 when i entered london for the first time  from that point of viewyouth and a straightforward scheme of conductit was certainly a year of grace  all the help i had to get in touch with the world i was invading was a piece of paper not much bigger than the palm of my handin which i held ittorn out of a larger plan of london for the greater facility of reference  it had been the object of careful study for some days past  the fact that i could take a conveyance at the station never occurred to my mind no not even when i got out into the street and stood taking my anxious bearings in the midst so to speak of twenty thousand hansoms  a strange absence of mind or unconscious conviction that one cannot approach an important moment of ones life by means of a hired carriage  yes it would have been a preposterous proceeding  and indeed i was to make an australian voyage and encircle the globe before ever entering a london hansom  another document a cutting from a newspaper containing the address of an obscure shipping agent was in my pocket  and i needed not to take it out  that address was as if graven deep in my brain  i muttered its words to myself as i walked on navigating the sea of london by the chart concealed in the palm of my hand for i had vowed to myself not to inquire my way from anyone  youth is the time of rash pledges  had i taken a wrong turning i would have been lost and if faithful to my pledge i might have remained lost for days for weeks have left perhaps my bones to be discovered bleaching in some blind alley of the whitechapel district as it had happened to lonely travellers lost in the bush  but i walked on to my destination without hesitation or mistake showing there for the first time some of that faculty to absorb and make my own the imaged topography of a chart which in later years was to help me in regions of intricate navigation to keep the ships entrusted to me off the ground  the place i was bound to was not easy to find  it was one of those courts hidden away from the charted and navigable streets lost among the thick growth of houses like a dark pool in the depths of a forest approached by an inconspicuous archway as if by secret path a dickensian nook of london that wonder city the growth of which bears no sign of intelligent design but many traces of freakishly sombre phantasy the great master knew so well how to bring out by the magic of his understanding love  and the office i entered was dickensian too  the dust of the waterloo year lay on the panes and frames of its windows early georgian grime clung to its sombre wainscoting  it was one oclock in the afternoon but the day was gloomy  by the light of a single gasjet depending from the smoked ceiling i saw an elderly man in a long coat of black broadcloth  he had a grey beard a big nose thick lips and heavy shoulders  his curly white hair and the general character of his head recalled vaguely a burly apostle in the barocco style of italian art  standing up at a tall shabby slanting desk his silverrimmed spectacles pushed up high on his forehead he was eating a muttonchop which had been just brought to him from some dickensian eatinghouse round the corner  without ceasing to eat he turned to me his florid barocco apostles face with an expression of inquiry  i produced elaborately a series of vocal sounds which must have borne sufficient resemblance to the phonetics of english speech for his face broke into a smile of comprehension almost at onceoh its you who wrote a letter to me the other day from lowestoft about getting a ship  i had written to him from lowestoft  i cant remember a single word of that letter now  it was my very first composition in the english language  and he had understood it evidently for he spoke to the point at once explaining that his business mainly was to find good ships for young gentlemen who wanted to go to sea as premium apprentices with a view of being trained for officers  but he gathered that this was not my object  i did not desire to be apprenticed  was that the case  it was  he was good enough to say then of course i see that you are a gentleman  but your wish is to get a berth before the mast as an able seaman if possible  is that it  it was certainly my wish but he stated doubtfully that he feared he could not help me much in this  there was an act of parliament which made it penal to procure ships for sailors  an actofparliament  a law he took pains to impress it again and again on my foreign understanding while i looked at him in consternation  i had not been half an hour in london before i had run my head against an act of parliament  what a hopeless adventure  however the barocco apostle was a resourceful person in his way and we managed to get round the hard letter of it without damage to its fine spirit  yet strictly speaking it was not the conduct of a good citizen and in retrospect there is an unfilial flavour about that early sin of mine  for this act of parliament the merchant shipping act of the victorian era had been in a manner of speaking a father and mother to me  for many years it had regulated and disciplined my life prescribed my food and the amount of my breathing space had looked after my health and tried as much as possible to secure my personal safety in a risky calling  it isnt such a bad thing to lead a life of hard toil and plain duty within the four corners of an honest act of parliament  and i am glad to say that its seventies have never been applied to me  in the year 1878 the year of peace with honour i had walked as lone as any human being in the streets of london out of liverpool street station to surrender myself to its care  and now in the year of the war waged for honour and conscience more than for any other cause i was there again no longer alone but a man of infinitely dear and close ties grown since that time of work done of words written of friendships secured  it was like the closing of a thirtysixyear cycle  all unaware of the war angel already awaiting with the trumpet at his lips the stroke of the fatal hour i sat there thinking that this life of ours is neither long nor short but that it can appear very wonderful entertaining and pathetic with symbolic images and bizarre associations crowded into one halfhour of retrospective musing  i felt too that this journey so suddenly entered upon was bound to take me away from daily lifes actualities at every step  i felt it more than ever when presently we steamed out into the north sea on a dark night fitful with gusts of wind and i lingered on deck alone of all the tale of the ships passengers  that sea was to me something unforgettable something much more than a name  it had been for some time the schoolroom of my trade  on it i may safely say i had learned too my first words of english  a wild and stormy abode sometimes was that confined shallowwater academy of seamanship from which i launched myself on the wide oceans  my teachers had been the sailors of the norfolk shore coast men with steady eyes mighty limbs and gentle voice men of very few words which at least were never bare of meaning honest strong steady men sobered by domestic ties one and all as far as i can remember  that is what years ago the north sea i could hear growling in the dark all round the ship had been for me  and i fancied that i must have been carrying its voice in my ear ever since for nothing could be more familiar than those short angry sounds i was listening to with a smile of affectionate recognition  i could not guess that before many days my old schoolroom would be desecrated by violence littered with wrecks with death walking its waves hiding under its waters  perhaps while i am writing these words the children or maybe the grandchildren of my pacific teachers are out in trawlers under the naval flag dredging for german submarine mines   iii   i have said that the north sea was my finishing school of seamanship before i launched myself on the wider oceans  confined as it is in comparison with the vast stage of this watergirt globe i did not know it in all its parts  my classroom was the region of the english east coast which in the year of peace with honour had long forgotten the war episodes belonging to its maritime history  it was a peaceful coast agricultural industrial the home of fishermen  at night the lights of its many towns played on the clouds or in clear weather lay still here and there in brilliant pools above the inkblack outline of the land  on many a night i have hauled at the braces under the shadow of that coast envying as sailors will the people on shore sleeping quietly in their beds within sound of the sea  i imagine that not one head on those envied pillows was made uneasy by the slightest premonition of the realities of naval war the short lifetime of one generation was to bring so close to their homes  though far away from that region of kindly memories and traversing a part of the north sea much less known to me i was deeply conscious of the familiarity of my surroundings  it was a cloudy nasty day and the aspects of nature dont change unless in the course of thousands of yearsor perhaps centuries  the phoenicians its first discoverers the romans the first imperial rulers of that sea had experienced days like this so different in the wintry quality of the light even on a july afternoon from anything they had ever known in their native mediterranean  for myself a very late comer into that sea and its former pupil i accorded amused recognition to the characteristic aspect so well remembered from my days of training  the same old thing  a grey green expanse of smudgy waters grinning angrily at one with white foam ridges and over all a cheerless unglowing canopy apparently made of wet blottingpaper  from time to time a flurry of fine rain blew along like a puff of smoke across the dots of distant fishing boats very few very scattered and tossing restlessly on an ever dissolving ever re forming skyline  those flurries and the steady rolling of the ship accounted for the emptiness of the decks favouring my reminiscent mood  it might have been a day of five and thirty years ago when there were on this and every other sea more sails and less smokestacks to be seen  yet thanks to the unchangeable sea i could have given myself up to the illusion of a revised past had it not been for the periodical transit across my gaze of a german passenger  he was marching round and round the boat deck with characteristic determination  two sturdy boys gambolled round him in his progress like two disorderly satellites round their parent planet he was bringing them home from their school in england for their holiday  what could have induced such a sound teuton to entrust his offspring to the unhealthy influences of that effete corrupt rotten and criminal country i cannot imagine  it could hardly have been from motives of economy  i did not speak to him  he trod the deck of that decadent british ship with a scornful foot while his breast and to a large extent his stomach too appeared expanded by the consciousness of a superior destiny  later i could observe the same truculent bearing touched with the racial grotesqueness in the men of the landwehr corps that passed through cracow to reinforce the austrian army in eastern galicia  indeed the haughty passenger might very well have been most probably was an officer of the landwehr and perhaps those two fine active boys are orphans by now  thus things acquire significance by the lapse of time  a citizen a father a warrior a mote in the dustcloud of six million fighting particles an unconsidered trifle for the jaws of war his humanity was not consciously impressed on my mind at the time  mainly for me he was a sharp tapping of heels round the corner of the deckhouse a white yachting cap and a green overcoat getting periodically between my eyes and the shifting cloudhorizon of the ashygrey north sea  he was but a shadowy intrusion and a disregarded one for far away there to the west in the direction of the dogger bank where fishermen go seeking their daily bread and sometimes find their graves i could behold an experience of my own in the winter of 81 not of war truly but of a fairly lively contest with the elements which were very angry indeed  there had been a troublesome week of it including one hateful nightor a night of hate it isnt for nothing that the north sea is also called the german oceanwhen all the fury stored in its heart seemed concentrated on one ship which could do no better than float on her side in an unnatural disagreeable precarious and altogether intolerable manner  there were on board besides myself seventeen men all good and true including a round enormous dutchman who in those hours between sunset and sunrise managed to lose his blownout appearance somehow became as it were deflated and thereafter for a good long time moved in our midst wrinkled and slack all over like a halfcollapsed balloon  the whimpering of our deckboy a skinny impressionable little scarecrow out of a trainingship for whom because of the tender immaturity of his nerves this display of german ocean frightfulness was too much before the year was out he developed into a sufficiently cheeky young ruffian his desolate whimpering i say heard between the gusts of that black savage night was much more present to my mind and indeed to my senses than the green overcoat and the white cap of the german passenger circling the deck indefatigably attended by his two gyrating children  thats a very nice gentleman  this information together with the fact that he was a widower and a regular passenger twice a year by the ship was communicated to me suddenly by our captain  at intervals through the day he would pop out of the chartroom and offer me short snatches of conversation  he owned a simple soul and a not very entertaining mind and he was without malice and i believe quite unconsciously a warm germanophil  and no wonder  as he told me himself he had been fifteen years on that run and spent almost as much of his life in hamburg as in harwich  wonderful people they are he repeated from time to time without entering into particulars but with many nods of sagacious obstinacy what he knew of them i suppose were a few commercial travellers and small merchants most likely  but i had observed long before that german genius has a hypnotising power over halfbaked souls and halflighted minds  there is an immense force of suggestion in highly organised mediocrity  had it not hypnotised half europe  my man was very much under the spell of german excellence  on the other hand his contempt for france was equally general and unbounded  i tried to advance some arguments against this position but i only succeeded in making him hostile  i believe you are a frenchman yourself he snarled at last giving me an intensely suspicious look and forthwith broke off communications with a man of such unsound sympathies  hour by hour the blottingpaper sky and the great flat greenish smudge of the sea had been taking on a darker tone without any change in their colouring and texture  evening was coming on over the north sea  black uninteresting hummocks of land appeared dotting the duskiness of water and clouds in the eastern board tops of islands fringing the german shore  while i was looking at their antics amongst the wavesand for all their solidity they were very elusive things in the failing lightanother passenger came out on deck  this one wore a dark overcoat and a grey cap  the yellow leather strap of his binocular case crossed his chest  his elderly red cheeks nourished but a very thin crop of short white hairs and the end of his nose was so perfectly round that it determined the whole character of his physiognomy  indeed nothing else in it had the slightest chance to assert itself  his disposition unlike the widowers appeared to be mild and humane  he offered me the loan of his glasses  he had a wife and some small children concealed in the depths of the ship and he thought they were very well where they were his eldest son was about the decks somewhere  we are americans he remarked weightily but in a rather peculiar tone he spoke english with the accent of our captains wonderful people and proceeded to give me the history of the familys crossing the atlantic in a white star liner  they remained in england just the time necessary for a railway journey from liverpool to harwich  his people those in the depths of the ship were naturally a little tired  at that moment a young man of about twenty his son rushed up to us from the foredeck in a state of intense elation  hurrah he cried under his breath  the first german light  hurrah  and those two american citizens shook hands on it with the greatest fervour while i turned away and received full in the eyes the brilliant wink of the borkum lighthouse squatting low down in the darkness  the shade of the night had settled on the north sea  i do not think i have ever seen before a night so full of lights  the great change of sea life since my time was brought home to me  i had been conscious all day of an interminable procession of steamers  they went on and on as if in chase of each other the baltic trade the trade of scandinavia of denmark of germany pitching heavily into a head sea and bound for the gateway of dover straits  singly and in small companies of two and three they emerged from the dull colourless sunless distances ahead as if the supply of rather roughly finished mechanical toys were inexhaustible in some mysterious cheap store away there below the grey curve of the earth  cargo steam vessels have reached by this time a height of utilitarian ugliness which when one reflects that it is the product of human ingenuity strikes hopeless awe into one  these dismal creations look still uglier at sea than in port and with an added touch of the ridiculous  their rolling waddle when seen at a certain angle their abrupt clockwork nodding in a seaway so unlike the soaring lift and swing of a craft under sail have in them something caricatural a suggestion of a low parody directed at noble predecessors by an improved generation of dull mechanical toilers conceited and without grace  when they switched on each of these unlovely cargo tanks carried tame lightning within its slabsided body when they switched on their lamps they spangled the night with the cheap electric shopglitter here there and everywhere as of some high street broken up and washed out to sea  later heligoland cut into the overhead darkness with its powerful beam infinitely prolonged out of unfathomable night under the clouds  i remained on deck until we stopped and a steam pilotboat so overlighted amidships that one could not make out her complete shape glided across our bows and sent a pilot on board  i fear that the oar as a working implement will become presently as obsolete as the sail the pilot boarded us in a motordinghy  more and more is mankind reducing its physical activities to pulling levers and twirling little wheels  progress  yet the older methods of meeting natural forces demanded intelligence too an equally fine readiness of wits  and readiness of wits working in combination with the strength of muscles made a more complete man  it was really a surprisingly small dinghy and it ran to and fro like a waterinsect fussing noisily down there with immense selfimportance within hail of us the hull of the elbe lightship floated all dark and silent under its enormous round service lantern a faithful black shadow watching the broad estuary full of lights  such was my first view of the elbe approached under the wings of peace ready for flight away from the luckless shores of europe  our visual impressions remain with us so persistently that i find it extremely difficult to hold fast to the rational belief that now everything is dark over there that the elbe lightship has been towed away from its post of duty the triumphant beam of heligoland extinguished and the pilotboat laid up or turned to warlike uses for lack of its proper work to do  and obviously it must be so  any trickle of oversea trade that passes yet that way must be creeping along cautiously with the unlighted warblighted black coast close on one hand and sudden death on the other  for all the space we steamed through that sunday evening must now be one great minefield sown thickly with the seeds of hate while submarines steal out to sea over the very spot perhaps where the insectdinghy put a pilot on board of us with so much fussy importance  mines submarines  the last word in seawarfare progressimpressively disclosed by this war  there have been other wars  wars not inferior in the greatness of the stake and in the fierce animosity of feelings  during that one which was finished a hundred years ago it happened that while the english fleet was keeping watch on brest an american perhaps fulton himself offered to the maritime prefect of the port and to the french admiral an invention which would sink all the unsuspecting english ships one after anotheror at any rate most of them  the offer was not even taken into consideration and the prefect ends his report to the minister in paris with a fine phrase of indignation it is not the sort of death one would deal to brave men  and behold before history had time to hatch another war of the like proportions in the intensity of aroused passions and the greatness of issues the dead flavour of archaism descended on the manly sentiment of those selfdenying words  mankind has been demoralised since by its own mastery of mechanical appliances  its spirit is apparently so weak now and its flesh has grown so strong that it will face any deadly horror of destruction and cannot resist the temptation to use any stealthy murderous contrivance  it has become the intoxicated slave of its own detestable ingenuity  it is true too that since the napoleonic time another sort of wardoctrine has been inculcated in a nation and held out to the world   iv   on this journey of ours which for me was essentially not a progress but a retracing of footsteps on the road of life i had no beacons to look for in germany  i had never lingered in that land which on the whole is so singularly barren of memorable manifestations of generous sympathies and magnanimous impulses  an ineradicable invincible provincialism of envy and vanity clings to the forms of its thought like a frowsy garment  even while yet very young i turned my eyes away from it instinctively as from a threatening phantom  i believe that children and dogs have in their innocence a special power of perception as far as spectral apparitions and coming misfortunes are concerned  i let myself be carried through germany as if it were pure space without sights without sounds  no whispers of the war reached my voluntary abstraction  and perhaps not so very voluntary after all  each of us is a fascinating spectacle to himself and i had to watch my own personality returning from another world as it were to revisit the glimpses of old moons  considering the condition of humanity i am perhaps not so much to blame for giving myself up to that occupation  we prize the sensation of our continuity and we can only capture it in that way  by watching  we arrived in cracow late at night  after a scrambly supper i said to my eldest boy i cant go to bed  i am going out for a look round coming  he was ready enough  for him all this was part of the interesting adventure of the whole journey  we stepped out of the portal of the hotel into an empty street very silent and bright with moonlight  i was indeed revisiting the glimpses of the moon  i felt so much like a ghost that the discovery that i could remember such material things as the right turn to take and the general direction of the street gave me a moment of wistful surprise  the street straight and narrow ran into the great market square of the town the centre of its affairs and of the lighter side of its life  we could see at the far end of the street a promising widening of space  at the corner an unassuming but armed policeman wearing ceremoniously at midnight a pair of white gloves which made his big hands extremely noticeable turned his head to look at the grizzled foreigner holding forth in a strange tongue to a youth on whose arm he leaned  the square immense in its solitude was full to the brim of moonlight the garland of lights at the foot of the houses seemed to burn at the bottom of a bluish pool  i noticed with infinite satisfaction that the unnecessary trees the municipality insisted upon sticking between the stones had been steadily refusing to grow  they were not a bit bigger than the poor victims i could remember  also the paving operations seemed to be exactly at the same point at which i left them forty years before  there were the dull tornup patches on that bright expanse the piles of paving material looking ominously black like heads of rocks on a silvery sea  who was it that said that time works wonders  what an exploded superstition  as far as these trees and these paving stones were concerned it had worked nothing  the suspicion of the unchangeableness of things already vaguely suggested to my senses by our rapid drive from the railway station was agreeably strengthened within me  we are now on the line ab i said to my companion importantly  it was the name bestowed in my time on one of the sides of the square by the senior students of that town of classical learning and historical relics  the common citizens knew nothing of it and even if they had would not have dreamed of taking it seriously  he who used it was of the initiated belonged to the schools  we youngsters regarded that name as a fine jest the invention of a most excellent fancy  even as i uttered it to my boy i experienced again that sense of my privileged initiation and then happening to look up at the wall i saw in the light of the corner lamp a white castiron tablet fixed thereon bearing an inscription in raised black letters thus line ab  heavens  the name had been adopted officially  any town urchin any guttersnipe any herbselling woman of the marketplace any wandering boeotian was free to talk of the line ab to walk on the line ab to appoint to meet his friends on the line ab  it had become a mere name in a directory  i was stunned by the extreme mutability of things  time could work wonders and no mistake  a municipality had stolen an invention of excellent fancy and a fine jest had turned into a horrid piece of cast iron  i proposed that we should walk to the other end of the line using the profaned name not only without gusto but with positive distaste  and this too was one of the wonders of time for a bare minute had worked that change  there was at the end of the line a certain street i wanted to look at i explained to my companion  to our right the unequal massive towers of st marys church soared aloft into the ethereal radiance of the air very black on their shaded sides glowing with a soft phosphorescent sheen on the others  in the distance the florian gate thick and squat under its pointed roof barred the street with the square shoulders of the old city wall  in the narrow brilliantly pale vista of bluish flagstones and silvery fronts of houses its black archway stood out small and very distinct  there was not a soul in sight and not even the echo of a footstep for our ears  into this coldly illuminated and dumb emptiness there issued out of my aroused memory a small boy of eleven wending his way not very fast to a preparatory school for daypupils on the second floor of the third house down from the florian gate  it was in the winter months of 1868  at eight oclock of every morning that god made sleet or shine i walked up florian street  but of that my first school i remember very little  i believe that one of my cosufferers there has become a much appreciated editor of historical documents  but i didnt suffer much from the various imperfections of my first school  i was rather indifferent to school troubles  i had a private gnawing worm of my own  this was the time of my fathers last illness  every evening at seven turning my back on the florian gate i walked all the way to a big old house in a quiet narrow street a good distance beyond the great square  there in a large drawingroom panelled and bare with heavy cornices and a lofty ceiling in a little oasis of light made by two candles in a desert of dusk i sat at a little table to worry and ink myself all over till the task of my preparation was done  the table of my toil faced a tall white door which was kept closed now and then it would come ajar and a nun in a white coif would squeeze herself through the crack glide across the room and disappear  there were two of these noiseless nursing nuns  their voices were seldom heard  for indeed what could they have had to say  when they did speak to me it was with their lips hardly moving in a claustral clear whisper  our domestic matters were ordered by the elderly housekeeper of our neighbour on the second floor a canon of the cathedral lent for the emergency  she too spoke but seldom  she wore a black dress with a cross hanging by a chain on her ample bosom  and though when she spoke she moved her lips more than the nuns she never let her voice rise above a peacefully murmuring note  the air around me was all piety resignation and silence  i dont know what would have become of me if i had not been a reading boy  my prep finished i would have had nothing to do but sit and watch the awful stillness of the sick room flow out through the closed door and coldly enfold my scared heart  i suppose that in a futile childish way i would have gone crazy  but i was a reading boy  there were many books about lying on consoles on tables and even on the floor for we had not had time to settle down  i read  what did i not read  sometimes the elder nun gliding up and casting a mistrustful look on the open pages would lay her hand lightly on my head and suggest in a doubtful whisper perhaps it is not very good for you to read these books  i would raise my eyes to her face mutely and with a vague gesture of giving it up she would glide away  later in the evening but not always i would be permitted to tiptoe into the sick room to say goodnight to the figure prone on the bed which often could not acknowledge my presence but by a slow movement of the eyes put my lips dutifully to the nerveless hand lying on the coverlet and tiptoe out again  then i would go to bed in a room at the end of the corridor and often not always cry myself into a good sound sleep  i looked forward to what was coming with an incredulous terror  i turned my eyes from it sometimes with success and yet all the time i had an awful sensation of the inevitable  i had also moments of revolt which stripped off me some of my simple trust in the government of the universe  but when the inevitable entered the sick room and the white door was thrown wide open i dont think i found a single tear to shed  i have a suspicion that the canons housekeeper looked on me as the most callous little wretch on earth  the day of the funeral came in due course and all the generous youth of the schools the grave senate of the university the delegations of the tradeguilds might have obtained if they cared de visu evidence of the callousness of the little wretch  there was nothing in my aching head but a few words some such stupid sentences as its done or its accomplished in polish it is much shorter or something of the sort repeating itself endlessly  the long procession moved out of the narrow street down a long street past the gothic front of st marys under its unequal towers towards the florian gate  in the moonlightflooded silence of the old town of glorious tombs and tragic memories i could see again the small boy of that day following a hearse a space kept clear in which i walked alone conscious of an enormous following the clumsy swaying of the tall black machine the chanting of the surpliced clergy at the head the flames of tapers passing under the low archway of the gate the rows of bared heads on the pavements with fixed serious eyes  half the population had turned out on that fine may afternoon  they had not come to honour a great achievement or even some splendid failure  the dead and they were victims alike of an unrelenting destiny which cut them off from every path of merit and glory  they had come only to render homage to the ardent fidelity of the man whose life had been a fearless confession in word and deed of a creed which the simplest heart in that crowd could feel and understand  it seemed to me that if i remained longer there in that narrow street i should become the helpless prey of the shadows i had called up  they were crowding upon me enigmatic and insistent in their clinging air of the grave that tasted of dust and of the bitter vanity of old hopes  lets go back to the hotel my boy i said  its getting late  it will be easily understood that i neither thought nor dreamt that night of a possible war  for the next two days i went about amongst my fellow men who welcomed me with the utmost consideration and friendliness but unanimously derided my fears of a war  they would not believe in it  it was impossible  on the evening of the second day i was in the hotels smoking room an irrationally private apartment a sanctuary for a few choice minds of the town always pervaded by a dim religious light and more hushed than any club readingroom i have ever been in  gathered into a small knot we were discussing the situation in subdued tones suitable to the genius of the place  a gentleman with a fine head of white hair suddenly pointed an impatient finger in my direction and apostrophised me  what i want to know is whether should there be war england would come in  the time to draw a breath and i spoke out for the cabinet without faltering  most assuredly  i should think all europe knows that by this time  he took hold of the lapel of my coat and giving it a slight jerk for greater emphasis said forcibly  then if england will as you say and all the world knows it there can be no war  germany wont be so mad as that  on the morrow by noon we read of the german ultimatum  the day after came the declaration of war and the austrian mobilisation order  we were fairly caught  all that remained for me to do was to get my party out of the way of eventual shells  the best move which occurred to me was to snatch them up instantly into the mountains to a polish health resort of great reputewhich i did at the rate of one hundred miles in eleven hours by the last civilian train permitted to leave cracow for the next three weeks  and there we remained amongst the poles from all parts of poland not officially interned but simply unable to obtain the permission to travel by train or road  it was a wonderful a poignant two months  this is not the time and perhaps not the place to enlarge upon the tragic character of the situation a whole people seeing the culmination of its misfortunes in a final catastrophe unable to trust anyone to appeal to anyone to look for help from any quarter deprived of all hope and even of its last illusions and unable in the trouble of minds and the unrest of consciences to take refuge in stoical acceptance  i have seen all this  and i am glad i have not so many years left me to remember that appalling feeling of inexorable fate tangible palpable come after so many cruel years a figure of dread murmuring with iron lips the final words ruinand extinction  but enough of this  for our little band there was the awful anguish of incertitude as to the real nature of events in the west  it is difficult to give an idea how ugly and dangerous things looked to us over there belgium knocked down and trampled out of existence france giving in under repeated blows a military collapse like that of 1870 and england involved in that disastrous alliance her army sacrificed her people in a panic  polish papers of course had no other but german sources of information  naturally we did not believe all we read but it was sometimes excessively difficult to react with sufficient firmness  we used to shut our door and there away from everybody we sat weighing the news hunting up discrepancies scenting lies finding reasons for hopefulness and generally cheering each other up  but it was a beastly time  people used to come to me with very serious news and ask what do you think of it  and my invariable answer was whatever has happened or is going to happen whoever wants to make peace you may be certain that england will not make it not for ten years if necessary  but enough of this too  through the unremitting efforts of polish friends we obtained at last the permission to travel to vienna  once there the wing of the american eagle was extended over our uneasy heads we cannot be sufficiently grateful to the american ambassador who all along interested himself in our fate for his exertions on our behalf his invaluable assistance and the real friendliness of his reception in vienna  owing to mr penfields action we obtained the permission to leave austria  and it was a near thing for his excellency has informed my american publishers since that a week later orders were issued to have us detained till the end of the war  however we effected our hairs breadth escape into italy and reaching genoa took passage in a dutch mail steamer homewardbound from java with london as a port of call  on that searoute i might have picked up a memory at every mile if the past had not been eclipsed by the tremendous actuality  we saw the signs of it in the emptiness of the mediterranean the aspect of gibraltar the misty glimpse in the bay of biscay of an outwardbound convoy of transports in the presence of british submarines in the channel innumerable drifters flying the naval flag dotted the narrow waters and two naval officers coming on board off the south foreland piloted the ship through the downs  the downs  there they were thick with the memories of my sealife  but what were to me now the futilities of an individual past  as our ships head swung into the estuary of the thames a deep yet faint concussion passed through the air a shock rather than a sound which missing my ear found its way straight into my heart  turning instinctively to look at my boys i happened to meet my wifes eyes  she also had felt profoundly coming from far away across the grey distances of the sea the faint boom of the big guns at work on the coast of flandersshaping the future    first news1918   four years ago on the first day of august in the town of cracow austrian poland nobody would believe that the war was coming  my apprehensions were met by the words we have had these scares before this incredulity was so universal amongst people of intelligence and information that even i who had accustomed myself to look at the inevitable for years past felt my conviction shaken  at that time it must be noted the austrian army was already partly mobilised and as we came through austrian silesia we had noticed all the bridges being guarded by soldiers  austria will back down was the opinion of all the wellinformed men with whom i talked on the first of august  the session of the university was ended and the students were either all gone or going home to different parts of poland but the professors had not all departed yet on their respective holidays and amongst them the tone of scepticism prevailed generally  upon the whole there was very little inclination to talk about the possibility of a war  nationally the poles felt that from their point of view there was nothing to hope from it  whatever happens said a very distinguished man to me we may be certain that its our skins which will pay for it as usual  a wellknown literary critic and writer on economical subjects said to me war seems a material impossibility precisely because it would mean the complete ruin of all material interests  he was wrong as we know but those who said that austria as usual would back down were as a matter of fact perfectly right  austria did back down  what these men did not foresee was the interference of germany and one cannot blame them very well for who could guess that when the balance stood even the german sword would be thrown into the scale with nothing in the open political situation to justify that act or rather that crimeif crime can ever be justified  for as the same intelligent man said to me as it is those people meaning germans have very nearly the whole world in their economic grip  their prestige is even greater than their actual strength  it can get for them practically everything they want  then why risk it  and there was no apparent answer to the question put in that way  i must also say that the poles had no illusions about the strength of russia  those illusions were the monopoly of the western world  next day the librarian of the university invited me to come and have a look at the library which i had not seen since i was fourteen years old it was from him that i learned that the greater part of my fathers mss was preserved there  he confessed that he had not looked them through thoroughly yet but he told me that there was a lot of very important letters bearing on the epoch from 60 to 63 to and from many prominent poles of that time and he added there is a bundle of correspondence that will appeal to you personally  those are letters written by your father to an intimate friend in whose papers they were found  they contain many references to yourself though you couldnt have been more than four years old at the time  your father seems to have been extremely interested in his son  that afternoon i went to the university taking with me my eldest son  the attention of that young englishman was mainly attracted by some relics of copernicus in a glass case  i saw the bundle of letters and accepted the kind proposal of the librarian that he should have them copied for me during the holidays  in the range of the deserted vaulted rooms lined with books full of august memories and in the passionless silence of all this enshrined wisdom we walked here and there talking of the past the great historical past in which lived the inextinguishable spark of national life and all around us the centuriesold buildings lay still and empty composing themselves to rest after a year of work on the minds of another generation  no echo of the german ultimatum to russia penetrated that academical peace  but the news had come  when we stepped into the street out of the deserted main quadrangle we three i imagine were the only people in the town who did not know of it  my boy and i parted from the librarian who hurried home to pack up for his holiday and walked on to the hotel where we found my wife actually in the car waiting for us to take a run of some ten miles to the country house of an old schoolfriend of mine  he had been my greatest chum  in my wanderings about the world i had heard that his later career both at school and at the university had been of extraordinary brilliancein classics i believe  but in this the irongrey moustache period of his life he informed me with badly concealed pride that he had gained world fame as the inventorno inventor is not the wordproducer i believe would be the right termof a wonderful kind of beetroot seed  the beet grown from this seed contained more sugar to the square inchor was it to the square rootthan any other kind of beet  he exported this seed not only with profit and even to the united states but with a certain amount of glory which seemed to have gone slightly to his head  there is a fundamental strain of agriculturalist in a pole which no amount of brilliance even classical can destroy  while we were having tea outside looking down the lovely slope of the gardens at the view of the city in the distance the possibilities of the war faded from our minds suddenly my friends wife came to us with a telegram in her hand and said calmly general mobilisation do you know  we looked at her like men aroused from a dream  yes she insisted they are already taking the horses out of the ploughs and carts  i said we had better go back to town as quick as we can and my friend assented with a troubled look yes you had better  as we passed through villages on our way back we saw mobs of horses assembled on the commons with soldiers guarding them and groups of villagers looking on silently at the officers with their notebooks checking deliveries and writing out receipts  some old peasant women were already weeping aloud  when our car drew up at the door of the hotel the manager himself came to help my wife out  in the first moment i did not quite recognise him his luxuriant black locks were gone his head was closely cropped and as i glanced at it he smiled and said i shall sleep at the barracks to night  i cannot reproduce the atmosphere of that night the first night after mobilisation  the shops and the gateways of the houses were of course closed but all through the dark hours the town hummed with voices the echoes of distant shouts entered the open windows of our bedroom  groups of men talking noisily walked in the middle of the roadway escorted by distressed women men of all callings and of all classes going to report themselves at the fortress  now and then a military car tooting furiously would whisk through the streets empty of wheeled traffic like an intensely black shadow under the great flood of electric lights on the grey pavement  but what produced the greatest impression on my mind was a gathering at night in the coffeeroom of my hotel of a few men of mark whom i was asked to join  it was about one oclock in the morning  the shutters were up  for some reason or other the electric light was not switched on and the big room was lit up only by a few tall candles just enough for us to see each others faces by  i saw in those faces the awful desolation of men whose country torn in three found itself engaged in the contest with no will of its own and not even the power to assert itself at the cost of life  all the past was gone and there was no future whatever happened no road which did not seem to lead to moral annihilation  i remember one of those men addressing me after a period of mournful silence compounded of mental exhaustion and unexpressed forebodings  what do you think england will do  if there is a ray of hope anywhere it is only there  i said i believe i know what england will do this was before the news of the violation of belgian neutrality arrived though i wont tell you for i am not absolutely certain  but i can tell you what i am absolutely certain of  it is this if england comes into the war then no matter who may want to make peace at the end of six months at the cost of right and justice england will keep on fighting for years if necessary  you may reckon on that  what even alone asked somebody across the room  i said yes even alone  but if things go so far as that england will not be alone  i think that at that moment i must have been inspired    well done1918   i   it can be safely said that for the last four years the seamen of great britain have done well  i mean that every kind and sort of human being classified as seaman steward foremast hand fireman lamptrimmer mate master engineer and also all through the innumerable ratings of the navy up to that of admiral has done well  i dont say marvellously well or miraculously well or wonderfully well or even very well because these are simply overstatements of undisciplined minds  i dont deny that a man may be a marvellous being but this is not likely to be discovered in his lifetime and not always even after he is dead  mans marvellousness is a hidden thing because the secrets of his heart are not to be read by his fellows  as to a mans work if it is done well it is the very utmost that can be said  you can do well and you can do no more for people to see  in the navy where human values are thoroughly understood the highest signal of commendation complimenting a ship that is a ships company on some achievements consists exactly of those two simple words well done followed by the name of the ship  not marvellously done astonishingly done wonderfully doneno only just  well done soandso  and to the men it is a matter of infinite pride that somebody should judge it proper to mention aloud as it were that they have done well it is a memorable occurrence for in the sea services you are expected professionally and as a matter of course to do well because nothing less will do  and in sober speech no man can be expected to do more than well  the superlatives are mere signs of uninformed wonder  thus the official signal which can express nothing but a delicate share of appreciation becomes a great honour  speaking now as a purely civil seaman or perhaps i ought to say civilian because politeness is not what i have in my mind i may say that i have never expected the merchant service to do otherwise than well during the war  there were people who obviously did not feel the same confidence nay who even confidently expected to see the collapse of merchant seamens courage  i must admit that such pronouncements did arrest my attention  in my time i have never been able to detect any faint hearts in the ships companies with whom i have served in various capacities  but i reflected that i had left the sea in 94 twenty years before the outbreak of the war that was to apply its severe test to the quality of modern seamen  perhaps they had deteriorated i said unwillingly to myself  i remembered also the alarmist articles i had read about the great number of foreigners in the british merchant service and i didnt know how far these lamentations were justified  in my time the proportion of nonbritishers in the crews of the ships flying the red ensign was rather under onethird which as a matter of fact was less than the proportion allowed under the very strict french navigation laws for the crews of the ships of that nation  for the strictest laws aiming at the preservation of national seamen had to recognise the difficulties of manning merchant ships all over the world the onethird of the french law seemed to be the irreducible minimum  but the british proportion was even less  thus it may be said that up to the date i have mentioned the crews of british merchant ships engaged in deep water voyages to australia to the east indies and round the horn were essentially british  the small proportion of foreigners which i remember were mostly scandinavians and my general impression remains that those men were good stuff  they appeared always able and ready to do their duty by the flag under which they served  the majority were norwegians whose courage and straightness of character are matters beyond doubt  i remember also a couple of finns both carpenters of course and very good craftsmen a swede the most scientific sailmaker i ever met another swede a steward who really might have been called a british seaman since he had sailed out of london for over thirty years a rather superior person one italian an everlastingly smiling but a pugnacious character one frenchman a most excellent sailor tireless and indomitable under very difficult circumstances one hollander whose placid manner of looking at the ship going to pieces under our feet i shall never forget and one young colourless muscularly very strong german of no particular character  of noneuropean crews lascars and kalashes i have had very little experience and that was only in one steamship and for something less than a year  it was on the same occasion that i had my only sight of chinese firemen  sight is the exact word  one didnt speak to them  one saw them going along the decks to and fro characteristic figures with rolledup pigtails very dirty when coming off duty and very cleanfaced when going on duty  they never looked at anybody and one never had occasion to address them directly their appearances in the light of day were very regular and yet somewhat ghostlike in their detachment and silence  but of the white crews of british ships and almost exclusively british in blood and descent the immediate predecessors of the men whose worth the nation has discovered for itself today i have had a thorough experience  at first amongst them then with them i have shared all the conditions of their very special life  for it was very special  in my early days starting out on a voyage was like being launched into eternity  i say advisedly eternity instead of space because of the boundless silence which swallowed up one for eighty daysfor one hundred daysfor even yet more days of an existence without echoes and whispers like eternity itself  for one cant conceive a vocal eternity  an enormous silence in which there was nothing to connect one with the universe but the incessant wheeling about of the sun and other celestial bodies the alternation of light and shadow eternally chasing each other over the sky  the time of the earth though most carefully recorded by the halfhourly bells did not count in reality  it was a special life and the men were a very special kind of men  by this i dont mean to say they were more complex than the generality of mankind  neither were they very much simpler  i have already admitted that man is a marvellous creature and no doubt those particular men were marvellous enough in their way  but in their collective capacity they can be best defined as men who lived under the command to do well or perish utterly  i have written of them with all the truth that was in me and with an the impartiality of which i was capable  let me not be misunderstood in this statement  affection can be very exacting and can easily miss fairness on the critical side  i have looked upon them with a jealous eye expecting perhaps even more than it was strictly fair to expect  and no wondersince i had elected to be one of them very deliberately very completely without any looking back or looking elsewhere  the circumstances were such as to give me the feeling of complete identification a very vivid comprehension that if i wasnt one of them i was nothing at all  but what was most difficult to detect was the nature of the deep impulses which these men obeyed  what spirit was it that inspired the unfailing manifestations of their simple fidelity no outward cohesive force of compulsion or discipline was holding them together or had ever shaped their unexpressed standards  it was very mysterious  at last i came to the conclusion that it must be something in the nature of the life itself the sealife chosen blindly embraced for the most part accidentally by those men who appeared but a loose agglomeration of individuals toiling for their living away from the eyes of mankind  who can tell how a tradition comes into the world  we are children of the earth  it may be that the noblest tradition is but the offspring of material conditions of the hard necessities besetting mens precarious lives  but once it has been born it becomes a spirit  nothing can extinguish its force then  clouds of greedy selfishness the subtle dialectics of revolt or fear may obscure it for a time but in very truth it remains an immortal ruler invested with the power of honour and shame   ii   the mysteriously born tradition of seacraft commands unity in a body of workers engaged in an occupation in which men have to depend upon each other  it raises them so to speak above the frailties of their dead selves  i dont wish to be suspected of lack of judgment and of blind enthusiasm  i dont claim special morality or even special manliness for the men who in my time really lived at sea and at the present time live at any rate mostly at sea  but in their qualities as well as in their defects in their weaknesses as well as in their virtue there was indubitably something apart  they were never exactly of the earth earthly  they couldnt be that  chance or desire mostly desire had set them apart often in their very childhood and what is to be remarked is that from the very nature of things this early appeal this early desire had to be of an imaginative kind  thus their simple minds had a sort of sweetness  they were in a way preserved  i am not alluding here to the preserving qualities of the salt in the sea  the salt of the sea is a very good thing in its way it preserves for instance one from catching a beastly cold while one remains wet for weeks together in the roaring forties  but in sober unpoetical truth the seasalt never gets much further than the seamans skin which in certain latitudes it takes the opportunity to encrust very thoroughly  that and nothing more  and then what is this sea the subject of so many apostrophes in verse and prose addressed to its greatness and its mystery by men who had never penetrated either the one or the other  the sea is uncertain arbitrary featureless and violent  except when helped by the varied majesty of the sky there is something inane in its serenity and something stupid in its wrath which is endless boundless persistent and futilea grey hoary thing raging like an old ogre uncertain of its prey  its very immensity is wearisome  at any time within the navigating centuries mankind might have addressed it with the words what are you after all oh yes we know  the greatest scene of potential terror a devouring enigma of space  yes  but our lives have been nothing if not a continuous defiance of what you can do and what you may hold a spiritual and material defiance carried on in our plucky cockleshells on and on beyond the successive provocations of your unreadable horizons  ah but the charm of the sea  oh yes charm enough  or rather a sort of unholy fascination as of an elusive nymph whose embrace is death and a medusas head whose stare is terror  that sort of charm is calculated to keep men morally in order  but as to seasalt with its particular bitterness like nothing else on earth that i am safe to say penetrates no further than the seamens lips  with them the inner soundness is caused by another kind of preservative of which nobody will be surprised to hear the main ingredient is a certain kind of love that has nothing to do with the futile smiles and the futile passions of the sea  being love this feeling is naturally naive and imaginative  it has also in it that strain of fantasy that is so often nay almost invariably to be found in the temperament of a true seaman  but i repeat that i claim no particular morality for seamen  i will admit without difficulty that i have found amongst them the usual defects of mankind characters not quite straight uncertain tempers vacillating wills capriciousness small meannesses all this coming out mostly on the contact with the shore and all rather naive peculiar a little fantastic  i have even had a downright thief in my experience  one  this is indeed a minute proportion but it might have been my luck and since i am writing in eulogy of seamen i feel irresistibly tempted to talk about this unique specimen not indeed to offer him as an example of morality but to bring out certain characteristics and set out a certain point of view  he was a large strong man with a guileless countenance not very communicative with his shipmates but when drawn into any sort of conversation displaying a very painstaking earnestness  he was fair and candideyed of a very satisfactory smartness and from the officer ofthewatch point of viewaltogether dependable  then suddenly he went and stole  and he didnt go away from his honourable kind to do that thing to somebody on shore he stole right there on the spot in proximity to his shipmates on board his own ship with complete disregard for old brown our night watchman whose fame for trustworthiness was utterly blasted for the rest of the voyage and in such a way as to bring the profoundest possible trouble to all the blameless souls animating that ship  he stole eleven golden sovereigns and a gold pocket chronometer and chain  i am really in doubt whether the crime should not be entered under the category of sacrilege rather than theft  those things belonged to the captain  there was certainly something in the nature of the violation of a sanctuary and of a particularly impudent kind too because he got his plunder out of the captains stateroom while the captain was asleep there  but look now at the fantasy of the man  after going through the pockets of the clothes he did not hasten to retreat  no  he went deliberately into the saloon and removed from the sideboard two big heavy silverplated lamps which he carried to the foreend of the ship and stood symmetrically on the knightheads  this i must explain means that he took them away as far as possible from the place where they belonged these were the deeds of darkness  in the morning the bosun came along dragging after him a hose to wash the focsle head and beholding the shiny cabin lamps resplendent in the morning light one on each side of the bowsprit he was paralysed with awe  he dropped the nozzle from his nerveless handsand such hands too  i happened along and he said to me in a distracted whisper look at that sir look  take them back aft at once yourself i said very amazed too  as we approached the quarterdeck we perceived the steward a prey to a sort of sacred horror holding up before us the captains trousers  bronzed men with brooms and buckets in their hands stood about with open mouths  i have found them lying in the passage outside the captains door the steward declared faintly  the additional statement that the captains watch was gone from its hook by the bedside raised the painful sensation to the highest pitch  we knew then we had a thief amongst us our thief  behold the solidarity of a ships company  he couldnt be to us like any other thief  we all had to live under the shadow of his crime for days but the police kept on investigating and one morning a young woman appeared on board swinging a parasol attended by two policemen and identified the culprit  she was a barmaid of some bar near the circular quay and knew really nothing of our man except that he looked like a respectable sailor  she had seen him only twice in her life  on the second occasion he begged her nicely as a great favour to take care for him of a small solidly tiedup paper parcel for a day or two  but he never came near her again  at the end of three weeks she opened it and of course seeing the contents was much alarmed and went to the nearest policestation for advice  the police took her at once on board our ship where all hands were mustered on the quarterdeck she stared wildly at all our faces pointed suddenly a finger with a shriek thats the man and incontinently went off into a fit of hysterics in front of thirtysix seamen  i must say that never in my life did i see a ships company look so frightened  yes in this tale of guilt there was a curious absence of mere criminality and a touch of that fantasy which is often a part of a seamans character  it wasnt greed that moved him i think  it was something much less simple boredom perhaps or a bet or the pleasure of defiance  and now for the point of view  it was given to me by a short blackbearded ab of the crew who on sea passages washed my flannel shirts mended my clothes and generally looked after my room  he was an excellent needleman and washerman and a very good sailor  standing in this peculiar relation to me he considered himself privileged to open his mind on the matter one evening when he brought back to my cabin three clean and neatly folded shirts  he was profoundly pained  he said what a ships company  never seen such a crowd  liars cheats thieves     it was a needlessly jaundiced view  there were in that ships company three or four fellows who dealt in tall yarns and i knew that on the passage out there had been a dispute over a game in the focsle once or twice of a rather acute kind so that all cardplaying had to be abandoned  in regard to thieves as we know there was only one and he i am convinced came out of his reserve to perform an exploit rather than to commit a crime  but my blackbearded friends indignation had its special morality for he added with a burst of passion and on board our ship tooa ship like this    therein lies the secret of the seamens special character as a body  the ship this ship our ship the ship we serve is the moral symbol of our life  a ship has to be respected actually and ideally her merit her innocence are sacred things  of all the creations of man she is the closest partner of his toil and courage  from every point of view it is imperative that you should do well by her  and as always in the case of true love all you can do for her adds only to the tale of her merits in your heart  mute and compelling she claims not only your fidelity but your respect  and the supreme well done which you may earn is made over to her   iii   it is my deep conviction or perhaps i ought to say my deep feeling born from personal experience that it is not the sea but the ships of the sea that guide and command that spirit of adventure which some say is the second nature of british men  i dont want to provoke a controversy for intellectually i am rather a quietist but i venture to affirm that the main characteristic of the british men spread all over the world is not the spirit of adventure so much as the spirit of service  i think that this could be demonstrated from the history of great voyages and the general activity of the race  that the british man has always liked his service to be adventurous rather than otherwise cannot be denied for each british man began by being young in his time when all risk has a glamour  afterwards with the course of years risk became a part of his daily work he would have missed it from his side as one misses a loved companion  the mere love of adventure is no saving grace  it is no grace at all  it lays a man under no obligation of faithfulness to an idea and even to his own self  roughly speaking an adventurer may be expected to have courage or at any rate may be said to need it  but courage in itself is not an ideal  a successful highwayman showed courage of a sort and pirate crews have been known to fight with courage or perhaps only with reckless desperation in the manner of cornered rats  there is nothing in the world to prevent a mere lover or pursuer of adventure from running at any moment  there is his own self his mere taste for excitement the prospect of some sort of gain but there is no sort of loyalty to bind him in honour to consistent conduct  i have noticed that the majority of mere lovers of adventure are mightily careful of their skins and the proof of it is that so many of them manage to keep it whole to an advanced age  you find them in mysterious nooks of islands and continents mostly rednosed and wateryeyed and not even amusingly boastful  there is nothing more futile under the sun than a mere adventurer  he might have loved at one timewhich would have been a saving grace  i mean loved adventure for itself  but if so he was bound to lose this grace very soon  adventure by itself is but a phantom a dubious shape without a heart  yes there is nothing more futile than an adventurer but nobody can say that the adventurous activities of the british race are stamped with the futility of a chase after mere emotions  the successive generations that went out to sea from these isles went out to toil desperately in adventurous conditions  a man is a worker  if he is not that he is nothing  just nothinglike a mere adventurer  those men understood the nature of their work but more or less dimly in various degrees of imperfection  the best and greatest of their leaders even had never seen it clearly because of its magnitude and the remoteness of its end  this is the common fate of mankind whose most positive achievements are born from dreams and visions followed loyally to an unknown destination  and it doesnt matter  for the great mass of mankind the only saving grace that is needed is steady fidelity to what is nearest to hand and heart in the short moment of each human effort  in other and in greater words what is needed is a sense of immediate duty and a feeling of impalpable constraint  indeed seamen and duty are all the time inseparable companions  it has been suggested to me that this sense of duty is not a patriotic sense or a religious sense or even a social sense in a seaman  i dont know  it seems to me that a seamans duty may be an unconscious compound of these three something perhaps smaller than either but something much more definite for the simple mind and more adapted to the humbleness of the seamans task  it has been suggested also to me that the impalpable constraint is put upon the nature of a seaman by the spirit of the sea which he serves with a dumb and dogged devotion  those are fine words conveying a fine idea  but this i do know that it is very difficult to display a dogged devotion to a mere spirit however great  in everyday life ordinary men require something much more material effective definite and symbolic on which to concentrate their love and their devotion  and then what is it this spirit of the sea it is too great and too elusive to be embraced and taken to a human breast  all that a guileless or guileful seaman knows of it is its hostility its exaction of toil as endless as its everrenewed horizons no  what awakens the seamans sense of duty what lays that impalpable constraint upon the strength of his manliness what commands his not always dumb if always dogged devotion is not the spirit of the sea but something that in his eyes has a body a character a fascination and almost a soulit is his ship  there is not a day that has passed for many centuries now without the sun seeing scattered over all the seas groups of british men whose material and moral existence is conditioned by their loyalty to each other and their faithful devotion to a ship  each age has sent its contingent not of sons for the great mass of seamen have always been a childless lot but of loyal and obscure successors taking up the modest but spiritual inheritance of a hard life and simple duties of duties so simple that nothing ever could shake the traditional attitude born from the physical conditions of the service  it was always the ship bound on any possible errand in the service of the nation that has been the stage for the exercise of seamens primitive virtues  the dimness of great distances and the obscurity of lives protected them from the nations admiring gaze  those scattered distant ships companies seemed to the eyes of the earth only one degree removed on the right side i suppose from the other strange monsters of the deep  if spoken of at all they were spoken of in tones of halfcontemptuous indulgence  a good many years ago it was my lot to write about one of those ships companies on a certain sea under certain circumstances in a book of no particular length  that small group of men whom i tried to limn with loving care but sparing none of their weaknesses was characterised by a friendly reviewer as a lot of engaging ruffians  this gave me some food for thought  was it then in that guise that they appeared through the mists of the sea distant perplexed and simpleminded  and what on earth is an engaging ruffian  he must be a creature of literary imagination i thought for the two words dont match in my personal experience  it has happened to me to meet a few ruffians here and there but i never found one of them engaging  i consoled myself however by the reflection that the friendly reviewer must have been talking like a parrot which so often seems to understand what it says  yes in the mists of the sea and in their remoteness from the rest of the race the shapes of those men appeared distorted uncouth and faintso faint as to be almost invisible  it needed the lurid light of the engines of war to bring them out into full view very simple without worldly graces organised now into a body of workers by the genius of one of themselves who gave them a place and a voice in the social scheme but in the main still apart in their homeless childless generations scattered in loyal groups over all the seas giving faithful care to their ships and serving the nation which since they are seamen can give them no reward but the supreme well done    tradition1918   work is the law  like iron that lying idle degenerates into a mass of useless rust like water that in an unruffled pool sickens into a stagnant and corrupt state so without action the spirit of men turns to a dead thing loses its force ceases prompting us to leave some trace of ourselves on this earth  the sense of the above lines does not belong to me  it may be found in the notebooks of one of the greatest artists that ever lived leonardo da vinci  it has a simplicity and a truth which no amount of subtle comment can destroy  the master who had meditated so deeply on the rebirth of arts and sciences on the inward beauty of all thingsships lines womens facesand on the visible aspects of nature was profoundly right in his pronouncement on the work that is done on the earth  from the hard work of men are born the sympathetic consciousness of a common destiny the fidelity to right practice which makes great craftsmen the sense of right conduct which we may call honour the devotion to our calling and the idealism which is not a misty winged angel without eyes but a divine figure of terrestrial aspect with a clear glance and with its feet resting firmly on the earth on which it was born  and work will overcome all evil except ignorance which is the condition of humanity and like the ambient air fills the space between the various sorts and conditions of men which breeds hatred fear and contempt between the masses of mankind and puts on mens lips on their innocent lips words that are thoughtless and vain  thoughtless for instance were the words that in all innocence i believe came on the lips of a prominent statesman making in the house of commons an eulogistic reference to the british merchant service  in this name i include men of diverse status and origin who live on and by the sea by it exclusively outside all professional pretensions and social formulas men for whom not only their daily bread but their collective character their personal achievement and their individual merit come from the sea  those words of the statesman were meant kindly but after all this is not a complete excuse  rightly or wrongly we expect from a man of national importance a larger and at the same time a more scrupulous precision of speech for it is possible that it may go echoing down the ages  his words were  it is right when thinking of the navy not to forget the men of the merchant service who have shownand it is more surprising because they have had no traditions towards itcourage as great etc etc  and then he went on talking of the execution of captain fryatt an event of undying memory but less connected with the permanent unchangeable conditions of sea service than with the wrong view german minds delight in taking of englishmens psychology  the enemy he said meant by this atrocity to frighten our sailors away from the sea  what has happened he goes on to ask  never at any time in peace have sailors stayed so short a time ashore or shown such a readiness to step again into a ship  which means in other words that they answered to the call  i should like to know at what time of history the english merchant service the great body of merchant seamen had failed to answer the call  noticed or unnoticed ignored or commanded they have answered invariably the call to do their work the very conditions of which made them what they are they have always served the nations needs through their own invariable fidelity to the demands of their special life but with the development and complexity of material civilisation they grew less prominent to the nations eye among all the vast schemes of national industry  never was the need greater and the call to the services more urgent than today and those inconspicuous workers on whose qualities depends so much of the national welfare have answered it without dismay facing risk without glory in the perfect faithfulness to that tradition which the speech of the statesman denies to them at the very moment when he thinks fit to praise their courage    and mention his surprise  the hour of opportunity has strucknot for the first timefor the merchant service and if i associate myself with all my heart in the admiration and the praise which is the greatest reward of brave men i must be excused from joining in any sentiment of surprise  it is perhaps because i have not been born to the inheritance of that tradition which has yet fashioned the fundamental part of my character in my young days that i am so consciously aware of it and venture to vindicate its existence in this outspoken manner  merchant seamen have always been what they are now from their earliest days before the royal navy had been fashioned out of the material they furnished for the hands of kings and statesmen  their work has made them as work undertaken with singleminded devotion makes men giving to their achievements that vitality and continuity in which their souls are expressed tempered and matured through the succeeding generations  in its simplest definition the work of merchant seamen has been to take ships entrusted to their care from port to port across the seas and from the highest to the lowest to watch and labour with devotion for the safety of the property and the lives committed to their skill and fortitude through the hazards of innumerable voyages  that was always the clear task the single aim the simple ideal the only problem for an unselfish solution  the terms of it have changed with the years its risks have worn different aspects from time to time there are no longer any unexplored seas  human ingenuity has devised better means to meet the dangers of natural forces  but it is always the same problem  the youngsters who were growing up at sea at the end of my service are commanding ships now  at least i have heard of some of them who do  and whatever the shape and power of their ships the character of the duty remains the same  a mine or a torpedo that strikes your ship is not so very different from a sharp uncharted rock tearing her life out of her in another way  at a greater cost of vital energy under the well nigh intolerable stress of vigilance and resolution they are doing steadily the work of their professional forefathers in the midst of multiplied dangers  they go to and fro across the oceans on their everlasting task the same men the same stout hearts the same fidelity to an exacting tradition created by simple toilers who in their time knew how to live and die at sea  allowed to share in this work and in this tradition for something like twenty years i am bold enough to think that perhaps i am not altogether unworthy to speak of it  it was the sphere not only of my activity but i may safely say also of my affections but after such a close connection it is very difficult to avoid bringing in ones own personality  without looking at all at the aspects of the labour problem i can safely affirm that i have never never seen british seamen refuse any risk any exertion any effort of spirit or body up to the extremest demands of their calling  years agoit seems ages agoi have seen the crew of a british ship fight the fire in the cargo for a whole sleepless week and then with her decks blown up i have seen them still continue the fight to save the floating shell  and at last i have seen them refuse to be taken off by a vessel standing by and this only in order to see the last of our ship at the word at the simple word of a man who commanded them a worthy soul indeed but of no heroic aspect i have seen that  i have shared their days in small boats  hard days ages ago  and now let me mention a story of today  i will try to relate it here mainly in the words of the chief engineer of a certain steamship which after bunkering left lerwick bound for iceland  the weather was cold the sea pretty rough with a stiff head wind  all went well till next day about 130 pm then the captain sighted a suspicious object far away to starboard  speed was increased at once to close in with the faroes and good lookouts were set fore and aft  nothing further was seen of the suspicious object but about half past three without any warning the ship was struck amidships by a torpedo which exploded in the bunkers  none of the crew was injured by the explosion and all hands without exception behaved admirably  the chief officer with his watch managed to lower the no 3 boat  two other boats had been shattered by the explosion and though another lifeboat was cleared and ready there was no time to lower it and some of us jumped while others were washed overboard  meantime the captain had been busy handing lifebelts to the men and cheering them up with words and smiles with no thought of his own safety  the ship went down in less than four minutes  the captain was the last man on board going down with her and was sucked under  on coming up he was caught under an upturned boat to which five hands were clinging  one lifeboat says the chief engineer which was floating empty in the distance was cleverly manoeuvred to our assistance by the steward who swam off to her pluckily  our next endeavour was to release the captain who was entangled under the boat  as it was impossible to right her we setto to split her side open with the boat hook because by awful bad luck the head of the axe we had flew off at the first blow and was lost  the rescue took thirty minutes and the extricated captain was in a pitiable condition being badly bruised and having swallowed a lot of salt water he was unconscious  while at that work the submarine came to the surface quite close and made a complete circle round us the seven men that we counted on the conning tower laughing at our efforts  there were eighteen of us saved  i deeply regret the loss of the chief officer a fine fellow and a kind shipmate showing splendid promise  the other men lostone ab one greaser and two firemenwere quiet conscientious good fellows  with no restoratives in the boat they endeavoured to bring the captain round by means of massage  meantime the oars were got out in order to reach the faroes which were about thirty miles dead to windward but after about nine hours hard work they had to desist and putting out a seaanchor they took shelter under the canvas boatcover from the cold wind and torrential rain  says the narrator we were all very wet and miserable and decided to have two biscuits all round  the effects of this and being under the shelter of the canvas warmed us up and made us feel pretty well contented  at about sunrise the captain showed signs of recovery and by the time the sun was up he was looking a lot better much to our relief  after being informed of what had been done the revived captain dropped a bombshell in our midst by proposing to make for the shetlands which were only one hundred and fifty miles off  the wind is in our favour he said  i promise to take you there  are you all willing thiscomments the chief engineerfrom a man who but a few hours previously had been hauled back from the grave  the captains confident manner inspired the men and they all agreed  under the best possible conditions a boatrun of one hundred and fifty miles in the north atlantic and in winter weather would have been a feat of no mean merit but in the circumstances it required uncommon nerve and skill to carry out such a promise  with an oar for a mast and the boatcover cut down for a sail they started on their dangerous journey with the boat compass and the stars for their guide  the captains undaunted serenity buoyed them all up against despondency  he told them what point he was making for  it was ronas hill and we struck it as straight as a die  the chief engineer commends also the ship steward for the manner in which he made the little food they had last the cheery spirit he manifested and the great help he was to the captain by keeping the men in good humour  that trusty man had his hands cruelly chafed with the rowing but it never damped his spirits  they made ronas hill as straight as a die and the chief engineer cannot express their feelings of gratitude and relief when they set their feet on the shore  he praises the unbounded kindness of the people in hillswick  it seemed to us all like paradise regained he says concluding his letter with the words  and there was our captain just his usual self as if nothing had happened as if bringing the boat that hazardous journey and being the means of saving eighteen souls was to him an everyday occurrence  such is the chief engineers testimony to the continuity of the old tradition of the sea which made by the work of men has in its turn created for them their simple ideal of conduct    confidence1919   i   the seamen hold up the edifice  they have been holding it up in the past and they will hold it up in the future whatever this future may contain of logical development of unforeseen new shapes of great promises and of dangers still unknown  it is not an unpardonable stretching of the truth to say that the british empire rests on transportation  i am speaking now naturally of the sea as a man who has lived on it for many years at a time too when on sighting a vessel on the horizon of any of the great oceans it was perfectly safe to bet any reasonable odds on her being a british shipwith the certitude of making a pretty good thing of it at the end of the voyage  i have tried to convey here in popular terms the strong impression remembered from my young days  the red ensign prevailed on the high seas to such an extent that one always experienced a slight shock on seeing some other combination of colours blow out at the peak or flagpole of any chance encounter in deep water  in the long run the persistence of the visual fact forced upon the mind a halfunconscious sense of its inner significance  we have all heard of the wellknown view that trade follows the flag  and that is not always true  there is also this truth that the flag in normal conditions represents commerce to the eye and understanding of the average man  this is a truth but it is not the whole truth  in its numbers and in its unfailing ubiquity the british red ensign under which naval actions too have been fought adventures entered upon and sacrifices offered represented in fact something more than the prestige of a great trade  the flutter of that piece of red bunting showered sentiment on the nations of the earth  i will not venture to say that in every case that sentiment was of a friendly nature  of hatred half concealed or concealed not at all this is not the place to speak and indeed the little i have seen of it about the world was tainted with stupidity and seemed to confess in its very violence the extreme poorness of its case but generally it was more in the nature of envious wonder qualified by a halfconcealed admiration  that flag which but for the union jack in the corner might have been adopted by the most radical of revolutions affirmed in its numbers the stability of purpose the continuity of effort and the greatness of britains opportunity pursued steadily in the order and peace of the world that world which for twentyfive years or so after 1870 may be said to have been living in holy calm and hushed silence with only now and then a slight clink of metal as if in some distant part of mankinds habitation some restless body had stumbled over a heap of old armour   ii   we who have learned by now what a worldwar is like may be excused for considering the disturbances of that period as insignificant brawls mere holeandcorner scuffles  in the world which memory depicts as so wonderfully tranquil all over it was the sea yet that was the safest place  and the red ensign commercial industrial historic pervaded the sea  assertive only by its numbers highly significant and under its character of a tradeemblem nationally expressive it was symbolic of old and new ideas of conservatism and progress of routine and enterprise of drudgery and adventureand of a certain easygoing optimism that would have appeared the father of sloth itself if it had not been so stubbornly so everlastingly active  the unimaginative hardworking men great and small who served this flag afloat and ashore nursed dumbly a mysterious sense of its greatness  it sheltered magnificently their vagabond labours under the sleepless eye of the sun  it held up the edifice  but it crowned it too  this is not the extravagance of a mixed metaphor  it is the sober expression of a not very complex truth  within that double function the national life that flag represented so well went on in safety assured of its daily crust of bread for which we all pray and without which we would have to give up faith hope and charity the intellectual conquests of our minds and the sanctified strength of our labouring arms  i may permit myself to speak of it in these terms because as a matter of fact it was on that very symbol that i had founded my life and as i have said elsewhere in a moment of outspoken gratitude had known for many years no other roof above my head  in those days that symbol was not particularly regarded  superficially and definitely it represented but one of the forms of national activity rather remote from the closeknit organisations of other industries a kind of toil not immediately under the public eye  it was of its navy that the nation looking out of the windows of its worldwide edifice was proudly aware  and that was but fair  the navy is the armed man at the gate  an existence depending upon the sea must be guarded with a jealous sleepless vigilance for the sea is but a fickle friend  it had provoked conflicts encouraged ambitions and had lured some nations to destructionas we know  heman or peoplewho boasting of long years of familiarity with the sea neglects the strength and cunning of his right hand is a fool  the pride and trust of the nation in its navy so strangely mingled with moments of neglect caused by a particularly thickheaded idealism is perfectly justified  it is also very proper for it is good for a body of men conscious of a great responsibility to feel themselves recognised if only in that fallible imperfect and often irritating way in which recognition is sometimes offered to the deserving  but the merchant service had never to suffer from that sort of irritation  no recognition was thrust on it offensively and truth to say it did not seem to concern itself unduly with the claims of its own obscure merit  it had no consciousness  it had no words  it had no time  to these busy men their work was but the ordinary labour of earning a living their duties in their everrecurring round had like the sun itself the commonness of daily things their individual fidelity was not so much united as merely coordinated by an aim that shone with no spiritual lustre  they were everyday men  they were that eminently when the great opportunity came to them to link arms in response to a supreme call they received it with characteristic simplicity incorporating selfsacrifice into the texture of their common task and as far as emotion went framing the horror of mankinds catastrophic time within the rigid rules of their professional conscience  and who can say that they could have done better than this  such was their past both remote and near  it has been stubbornly consistent and as this consistency was based upon the character of men fashioned by a very old tradition there is no doubt that it will endure such changes as came into the sea life have been for the main part mechanical and affecting only the material conditions of that inbred consistency  that men dont change is a profound truth  they dont change because it is not necessary for them to change even if they could accomplish that miracle  it is enough for them to be infinitely adaptableas the last four years have abundantly proved   iii   thus one may await the future without undue excitement and with unshaken confidence  whether the hues of sunrise are angry or benign gorgeous or sinister we shall always have the same sky over our heads  yet by a kindly dispensation of providence the human faculty of astonishment will never lack food  what could be more surprising for instance than the calm invitation to great britain to discard the force and protection of its navy  it has been suggested it has been proposedi dont know whether it has been pressed  probably not much  for if the excursions of audacious folly have no bounds that human eye can see reason has the habit of never straying very far away from its throne  it is not the first time in history that excited voices have been heard urging the warrior still panting from the fray to fling his tried weapons on the altar of peace for they would be needed no more  and such voices have been in undying hope or extreme weariness listened to sometimes but not for long  after all every sort of shouting is a transitory thing  it is the grim silence of facts that remains  the british merchant service has been challenged in its supremacy before it will be challenged again  it may be even asked menacingly in the name of some humanitarian doctrine or some empty ideal to step down voluntarily from that place which it has managed to keep for so many years  but i imagine that it will take more than words of brotherly love or brotherly anger which as is well known is the worst kind of anger to drive british seamen armed or unarmed from the seas  firm in this indestructible if not easily explained conviction i can allow myself to think placidly of that long long future which i shall not see  my confidence rests on the hearts of men who do not change though they may forget many things for a time and even forget to be themselves in a moment of false enthusiasm  but of that i am not afraid  it will not be for long  i know the men  through the kindness of the admiralty which let me confess here in a white sheet i repaid by the basest ingratitude i was permitted during the war to renew my contact with the british seamen of the merchant service  it is to their generosity in recognising me under the shore rust of twentyfive years as one of themselves that i owe one of the deepest emotions of my life  never for a moment did i feel among them like an idle wandering ghost from a distant past  they talked to me seriously openly and with professional precision of facts of events of implements i had never heard of in my time but the hands i grasped were like the hands of the generation which had trained my youth and is now no more  i recognised the character of their glances the accent of their voices  their moving tales of modern instances were presented to me with that peculiar turn of mind flavoured by the inherited humour and sagacity of the sea  i dont know what the seaman of the future will be like  he may have to live all his days with a telephone tied up to his head and bristle all over with scientific antennae like a figure in a fantastic tale  but he will always be the man revealed to us lately immutable in his slight variations like the closed path of this planet of ours on which he must find his exact position once at the very least in every twentyfour hours  the greatest desideratum of a sailors life is to be certain of his position  it is a source of great worry at times but i dont think that it need be so at this time  yet even the best position has its dangers on account of the fickleness of the elements  but i think that left untrammelled to the individual effort of its creators and to the collective spirit of its servants the british merchant service will manage to maintain its position on this restless and watery globe    flight1917   to begin at the end i will say that the landing surprised me by a slight and very characteristically dead sort of shock  i may fairly call myself an amphibious creature  a good half of my active existence has been passed in familiar contact with salt water and i was aware theoretically that water is not an elastic body but it was only then that i acquired the absolute conviction of the fact  i remember distinctly the thought flashing through my head by jove it isnt elastic  such is the illuminating force of a particular experience  this landing on the water of the north sea was effected in a short biplane after one hour and twenty minutes in the air  i reckon every minute like a miser counting his hoard for if what ive got is mine i am not likely now to increase the tale  that feeling is the effect of age  it strikes me as i write that when next time i leave the surface of this globe it wont be to soar bodily above it in the air  quite the contrary  and i am not thinking of a submarine either     but let us drop this dismal strain and go back logically to the beginning  i must confess that i started on that flight in a statei wont say of fury but of a most intense irritation  i dont remember ever feeling so annoyed in my life  it came about in this way  two or three days before i had been invited to lunch at an rnas station and was made to feel very much at home by the nicest lot of quietly interesting young men it had ever been my good fortune to meet  then i was taken into the sheds  i walked respectfully round and round a lot of machines of all kinds and the more i looked at them the more i felt somehow that for all the effect they produced on me they might have been so many landvehicles of an eccentric design  so i said to commander o who very kindly was conducting me this is all very fine but to realise what one is looking at one must have been up  he said at once ill give you a flight tomorrow if you like  i postulated that it should be none of those ten minutes in the air affairs  i wanted a real business flight  commander o assured me that i would get awfully bored but i declared that i was willing to take that risk  very well he said  eleven oclock tomorrow  dont be late  i am sorry to say i was about two minutes late which was enough however for commander o to greet me with a shout from a great distance oh  you are coming then  of course i am coming i yelled indignantly  he hurried up to me  all right  theres your machine and heres your pilot  come along  a lot of officers closed round me rushed me into a hut two of them began to button me into the coat two more were ramming a cap on my head others stood around with goggles with binoculars   i couldnt understand the necessity of such haste  we werent going to chase fritz there was no sign of fritz anywhere in the blue  those dear boys did not seem to notice my agefiftyeight if a daynor my infirmitiesa gouty subject for years  this disregard was very flattering and i tried to live up to it but the pace seemed to me terrific  they galloped me across a vast expanse of open ground to the waters edge  the machine on its carriage seemed as big as a cottage and much more imposing  my young pilot went up like a bird  there was an idle able bodied ladder loafing against a shed within fifteen feet of me but as nobody seemed to notice it i recommended myself mentally to heaven and started climbing after the pilot  the close view of the real fragility of that rigid structure startled me considerably while commander o discomposed me still more by shouting repeatedly dont put your foot there  i didnt know where to put my foot  there was a slight crack i heard some swearwords below me and then with a supreme effort i rolled in and dropped into a basketchair absolutely winded  a small crowd of mechanics and officers were looking up at me from the ground and while i gasped visibly i thought to myself that they would be sure to put it down to sheer nervousness  but i hadnt breath enough in my body to stick my head out and shout down to them  you know it isnt that at all  generally i try not to think of my age and infirmities  they are not a cheerful subject  but i was never so angry and disgusted with them as during that minute or so before the machine took the water  as to my feelings in the air those who will read these lines will know their own which are so much nearer the mind and the heart than any writings of an unprofessional can be  at first all my faculties were absorbed and as if neutralised by the sheer novelty of the situation  the first to emerge was the sense of security so much more perfect than in any small boat ive ever been in the as it were material stillness and immobility though it was a bumpy day  i very soon ceased to hear the roar of the wind and enginesunless indeed some cylinders missed when i became acutely aware of that  within the rigid spread of the powerful planes so strangely motionless i had sometimes the illusion of sitting as if by enchantment in a block of suspended marble  even while looking over at the aeroplanes shadow running prettily over land and sea i had the impression of extreme slowness  i imagine that had she suddenly nose dived out of control i would have gone to the final smash without a single additional heartbeat  i am sure i would not have known  it is doubtless otherwise with the man in control  but there was no dive and i returned to earth after an hour and twenty minutes without having felt bored for a single second  i descended by the ladder thinking that i would never go flying again  no never any morelest its mysterious fascination whose invisible wing had brushed my heart up there should change to unavailing regret in a man too old for its glory    some reflections on the loss of the titanic1912   it is with a certain bitterness that one must admit to oneself that the late ss titanic had a good press  it is perhaps because i have no great practice of daily newspapers i have never seen so many of them together lying about my room that the white spaces and the big lettering of the headlines have an incongruously festive air to my eyes a disagreeable effect of a feverish exploitation of a sensational godsend and if ever a loss at sea fell under the definition in the terms of a bill of lading of act of god this one does in its magnitude suddenness and severity and in the chastening influence it should have on the selfconfidence of mankind  i say this with all the seriousness the occasion demands though i have neither the competence nor the wish to take a theological view of this great misfortune sending so many souls to their last account  it is but a natural reflection  another one flowing also from the phraseology of bills of lading a bill of lading is a shipping document limiting in certain of its clauses the liability of the carrier is that the kings enemies of a more or less overt sort are not altogether sorry that this fatal mishap should strike the prestige of the greatest merchant service of the world  i believe that not a thousand miles from these shores certain public prints have betrayed in gothic letters their satisfactionto speak plainlyby rather illnatured comments  in what light one is to look at the action of the american senate is more difficult to say  from a certain point of view the sight of the august senators of a great power rushing to new york and beginning to bully and badger the luckless yamsion the very quayside so to speakseems to furnish the shakespearian touch of the comic to the real tragedy of the fatuous drowning of all these people who to the last moment put their trust in mere bigness in the reckless affirmations of commercial men and mere technicians and in the irresponsible paragraphs of the newspapers booming these ships  yes a grim touch of comedy  one asks oneself what these men are after with this very provincial display of authority  i beg my friends in the united states pardon for calling these zealous senators men  i dont wish to be disrespectful  they may be of the stature of demigods for all i know but at that great distance from the shores of effete europe and in the presence of so many guileless dead their size seems diminished from this side  what are they after  what is there for them to find out  we know what had happened  the ship scraped her side against a piece of ice and sank after floating for two hours and a half taking a lot of people down with her  what more can they find out from the unfair badgering of the unhappy yamsi or the ruffianly abuse of the same  yamsi i should explain is a mere code address and i use it here symbolically  i have seen commerce pretty close  i know what it is worth and i have no particular regard for commercial magnates but one must protest against these bumblelike proceedings  is it indignation at the loss of so many lives which is at work here  well the american railroads kill very many people during one single year i dare say  then why dont these dignitaries come down on the presidents of their own railroads of which one cant say whether they are mere means of transportation or a sort of gambling game for the use of american plutocrats  is it only an ardent and upon the whole praiseworthy desire for information  but the reports of the inquiry tell us that the august senators though raising a lot of questions testifying to the complete innocence and even blankness of their minds are unable to understand what the second officer is saying to them  we are so informed by the press from the other side  even such a simple expression as that one of the lookout men was stationed in the eyes of the ship was too much for the senators of the land of graphic expression  what it must have been in the more recondite matters i wont even try to think because i have no mind for smiles just now  they were greatly exercised about the sound of explosions heard when half the ship was under water already  was there one  were there two  they seemed to be smelling a rat there  has not some charitable soul told them what even schoolboys who read sea stories know that when a ship sinks from a leak like this a deck or two is always blown up and that when a steamship goes down by the head the boilers may and often do break adrift with a sound which resembles the sound of an explosion  and they may indeed explode for all i know  in the only case i have seen of a steamship sinking there was such a sound but i didnt dive down after her to investigate  she was not of 45000 tons and declared unsinkable but the sight was impressive enough  i shall never forget the muffled mysterious detonation the sudden agitation of the sea round the slowly raised stern and to this day i have in my eye the propeller seen perfectly still in its frame against a clear evening sky  but perhaps the second officer has explained to them by this time this and a few other little facts  though why an officer of the british merchant service should answer the questions of any king emperor autocrat or senator of any foreign power as to an event in which a british ship alone was concerned and which did not even take place in the territorial waters of that power passes my understanding  the only authority he is bound to answer is the board of trade  but with what face the board of trade which having made the regulations for 10000 ton ships put its dear old bald head under its wing for ten years took it out only to shelve an important report and with a dreary murmur unsinkable put it back again in the hope of not being disturbed for another ten years with what face it will be putting questions to that man who has done his duty as to the facts of this disaster and as to his professional conduct in itwell i dont know  i have the greatest respect for our established authorities  i am a disciplined man and i have a natural indulgence for the weaknesses of human institutions but i will own that at times i have regretted theirhow shall i say ittheir imponderability  a board of tradewhat is it  a board of    i believe the speaker of the irish parliament is one of the members of it a ghost  less than that as yet a mere memory  an office with adequate and no doubt comfortable furniture and a lot of perfectly irresponsible gentlemen who exist packed in its equable atmosphere softly as if in a lot of cottonwool and with no care in the world for there can be no care without personal responsibilitysuch for instance as the seamen havethose seamen from whose mouths this irresponsible institution can take away the breadas a disciplinary measure  yesits all that  and what more  the name of a politiciana party man  less than nothing a mere void without as much as a shadow of responsibility cast into it from that light in which move the masses of men who work who deal in things and face the realitiesnot the wordsof this life  years ago i remember overhearing two genuine shellbacks of the old type commenting on a ships officer who if not exactly incompetent did not commend himself to their severe judgment of accomplished sailormen  said one resuming and concluding the discussion in a funnily judicial tone  the board of trade must have been drunk when they gave him his certificate  i confess that this notion of the board of trade as an entity having a brain which could be overcome by the fumes of strong liquor charmed me exceedingly  for then it would have been unlike the limited companies of which some exasperated wit has once said that they had no souls to be saved and no bodies to be kicked and thus were free in this world and the next from all the effective sanctions of conscientious conduct  but unfortunately the picturesque pronouncement overheard by me was only a characteristic sally of an annoyed sailor  the board of trade is composed of bloodless departments  it has no limbs and no physiognomy or else at the forthcoming inquiry it might have paid to the victims of the titanic disaster the small tribute of a blush  i ask myself whether the marine department of the board of trade did really believe when they decided to shelve the report on equipment for a time that a ship of 45000 tons that any ship could be made practically indestructible by means of watertight bulkheads  it seems incredible to anybody who had ever reflected upon the properties of material such as wood or steel  you cant let builders say what they like make a ship of such dimensions as strong proportionately as a much smaller one  the shocks our old whalers had to stand amongst the heavy floes in baffins bay were perfectly staggering notwithstanding the most skilful handling and yet they lasted for years  the titanic if one may believe the last reports has only scraped against a piece of ice which i suspect was not an enormously bulky and comparatively easily seen berg but the low edge of a floeand sank  leisurely enough god knowsand here the advantage of bulkheads comes infor time is a great friend a good helperthough in this lamentable case these bulkheads served only to prolong the agony of the passengers who could not be saved  but she sank causing apart from the sorrow and the pity of the loss of so many lives a sort of surprised consternation that such a thing should have happened at all  why  you build a 45000 tons hotel of thin steel plates to secure the patronage of say a couple of thousand rich people for if it had been for the emigrant trade alone there would have been no such exaggeration of mere size you decorate it in the style of the pharaohs or in the louis quinze stylei dont know whichand to please the aforesaid fatuous handful of individuals who have more money than they know what to do with and to the applause of two continents you launch that mass with two thousand people on board at twentyone knots across the seaa perfect exhibition of the modern blind trust in mere material and appliances  and then this happens  general uproar  the blind trust in material and appliances has received a terrible shock  i will say nothing of the credulity which accepts any statement which specialists technicians and officepeople are pleased to make whether for purposes of gain or glory  you stand there astonished and hurt in your profoundest sensibilities  but what else under the circumstances could you expect  for my part i could much sooner believe in an unsinkable ship of 3000 tons than in one of 40000 tons  it is one of those things that stand to reason  you cant increase the thickness of scantling and plates indefinitely  and the mere weight of this bigness is an added disadvantage  in reading the reports the first reflection which occurs to one is that if that luckless ship had been a couple of hundred feet shorter she would have probably gone clear of the danger  but then perhaps she could not have had a swimming bath and a french cafe  that of course is a serious consideration  i am well aware that those responsible for her short and fatal existence ask us in desolate accents to believe that if she had hit end on she would have survived  which by a sort of coy implication seems to mean that it was all the fault of the officer of the watch he is dead now for trying to avoid the obstacle we shall have presently in deference to commercial and industrial interests a new kind of seamanship  a very new and progressive kind if you see anything in the way by no means try to avoid it smash at it full tilt  and thenand then only you shall see the triumph of material of clever contrivances of the whole box of engineering tricks in fact and cover with glory a commercial concern of the most unmitigated sort a great trust and a great shipbuilding yard justly famed for the superexcellence of its material and workmanship unsinkable  see  i told you she was unsinkable if only handled in accordance with the new seamanship  everythings in that  and doubtless the board of trade if properly approached would consent to give the needed instructions to its examiners of masters and mates behold the examinationroom of the future  enter to the grizzled examiner a young man of modest aspect are you well up in modern seamanship  i hope so sir  hm lets see  you are at night on the bridge in charge of a 150000 tons ship with a motor track organ loft etc etc with a full cargo of passengers a full crew of 1500 cafe waiters two sailors and a boy three collapsible boats as per board of trade regulations and going at your threequarter speed of say about forty knots  you perceive suddenly right ahead and close to something that looks like a large icefloe  what would you do  put the helm amidships  very well  why  in order to hit end on  on what grounds should you endeavour to hit end on  because we are taught by our builders and masters that the heavier the smash the smaller the damage and because the requirements of material should be attended to  and so on and so on  the new seamanship when in doubt try to ram fairlywhatevers before you  very simple  if only the titanic had rammed that piece of ice which was not a monstrous berg fairly every puffing paragraph would have been vindicated in the eyes of the credulous public which pays  but would it have been  well i doubt it  i am well aware that in the eighties the steamship arizona one of the greyhounds of the ocean in the jargon of that day did run bows on against a very unmistakable iceberg and managed to get into port on her collision bulkhead  but the arizona was not if i remember rightly 5000 tons register let alone 45000 and she was not going at twenty knots per hour  i cant be perfectly certain at this distance of time but her sea speed could not have been more than fourteen at the outside  both these facts made for safety  and even if she had been engined to go twenty knots there would not have been behind that speed the enormous mass so difficult to check in its impetus the terrific weight of which is bound to do damage to itself or others at the slightest contact  i assure you it is not for the vain pleasure of talking about my own poor experiences but only to illustrate my point that i will relate here a very unsensational little incident i witnessed now rather more than twenty years ago in sydney nsw  ships were beginning then to grow bigger year after year though of course the present dimensions were not even dreamt of  i was standing on the circular quay with a sydney pilot watching a big mail steamship of one of our bestknown companies being brought alongside  we admired her lines her noble appearance and were impressed by her size as well though her length i imagine was hardly half that of the titanic  she came into the cove as that part of the harbour is called of course very slowly and at some hundred feet or so short of the quay she lost her way  that quay was then a wooden one a fine structure of mighty piles and stringers bearing a roadwaya thing of great strength  the ship as i have said before stopped moving when some hundred feet from it  then her engines were rung on slow ahead and immediately rung off again  the propeller made just about five turns i should say  she began to move stealing on so to speak without a ripple coming alongside with the utmost gentleness  i went on looking her over very much interested but the man with me the pilot muttered under his breath too much too much  his exercised judgment had warned him of what i did not even suspect  but i believe that neither of us was exactly prepared for what happened  there was a faint concussion of the ground under our feet a groaning of piles a snapping of great iron bolts and with a sound of ripping and splintering as when a tree is blown down by the wind a great strong piece of wood a baulk of squared timber was displaced several feet as if by enchantment  i looked at my companion in amazement  i could not have believed it i declared no he said  you would not have thought she would have cracked an eggeh  i certainly wouldnt have thought that  he shook his head and added ah  these great big things they want some handling  some months afterwards i was back in sydney  the same pilot brought me in from sea  and i found the same steamship or else another as like her as two peas lying at anchor not far from us  the pilot told me she had arrived the day before and that he was to take her alongside tomorrow i reminded him jocularly of the damage to the quay  oh he said we are not allowed now to bring them in under their own steam  we are using tugs  a very wise regulation  and this is my pointthat size is to a certain extent an element of weakness  the bigger the ship the more delicately she must be handled  here is a contact which in the pilots own words you wouldnt think could have cracked an egg with the astonishing result of something like eighty feet of good strong wooden quay shaken loose iron bolts snapped a baulk of stout timber splintered  now suppose that quay had been of granite as surely it is nowor instead of the quay if there had been say a north atlantic fog there with a full grown iceberg in it awaiting the gentle contact of a ship groping its way along blindfold  something would have been hurt but it would not have been the iceberg  apparently there is a point in development when it ceases to be a true progressin trade in games in the marvellous handiwork of men and even in their demands and desires and aspirations of the moral and mental kind  there is a point when progress to remain a real advance must change slightly the direction of its line  but this is a wide question what i wanted to point out here isthat the old arizona the marvel of her day was proportionately stronger handier better equipped than this triumph of modern naval architecture the loss of which in common parlance will remain the sensation of this year  the clatter of the presses has been worthy of the tonnage of the preliminary paeans of triumph round that vanished hull of the reckless statements and elaborate descriptions of its ornate splendour  a great babble of news and what sort of news too good heavens and eager comment has arisen around this catastrophe though it seems to me that a less strident note would have been more becoming in the presence of so many victims left struggling on the sea of lives miserably thrown away for nothing or worse than nothing for false standards of achievement to satisfy a vulgar demand of a few moneyed people for a banal hotel luxurythe only one they can understandand because the big ship pays in one way or another in money or in advertising value  it is in more ways than one a very ugly business and a mere scrape along the ships side so slight that if reports are to be believed it did not interrupt a card party in the gorgeously fitted but in chaste style smokingroomor was it in the delightful french cafeis enough to bring on the exposure  all the people on board existed under a sense of false security  how false it has been sufficiently demonstrated  and the fact which seems undoubted that some of them actually were reluctant to enter the boats when told to do so shows the strength of that falsehood  incidentally it shows also the sort of discipline on board these ships the sort of hold kept on the passengers in the face of the unforgiving sea  these people seemed to imagine it an optional matter whereas the order to leave the ship should be an order of the sternest character to be obeyed unquestioningly and promptly by every one on board with men to enforce it at once and to carry it out methodically and swiftly  and it is no use to say it cannot be done for it can  it has been done  the only requisite is manageableness of the ship herself and of the numbers she carries on board  that is the great thing which makes for safety  a commander should be able to hold his ship and everything on board of her in the hollow of his hand as it were  but with the modern foolish trust in material and with those floating hotels this has become impossible  a man may do his best but he cannot succeed in a task which from greed or more likely from sheer stupidity has been made too great for anybodys strength  the readers of the english review who cast a friendly eye nearly six years ago on my reminiscences and know how much the merchant service ships and men has been to me will understand my indignation that those men of whom speaking in no sentimental phrase but in the very truth of feeling i cant even now think otherwise than as brothers have been put by their commercial employers in the impossibility to perform efficiently their plain duty and this from motives which i shall not enumerate here but whose intrinsic unworthiness is plainly revealed by the greatness the miserable greatness of that disaster  some of them have perished to die for commerce is hard enough but to go under that sea we have been trained to combat with a sense of failure in the supreme duty of ones calling is indeed a bitter fate  thus they are gone and the responsibility remains with the living who will have no difficulty in replacing them by others just as good at the same wages  it was their bitter fate  but i who can look at some arduous years when their duty was my duty too and their feelings were my feelings can remember some of us who once upon a time were more fortunate  it is of them that i would talk a little for my own comfort partly and also because i am sticking all the time to my subject to illustrate my point the point of manageableness which i have raised just now  since the memory of the lucky arizona has been evoked by others than myself and made use of by me for my own purpose let me call up the ghost of another ship of that distant day whose less lucky destiny inculcates another lesson making for my argument  the douro a ship belonging to the royal mail steam packet company was rather less than onetenth the measurement of the titanic  yet strange as it may appear to the ineffable hotel exquisites who form the bulk of the firstclass cross atlantic passengers people of position and wealth and refinement did not consider it an intolerable hardship to travel in her even all the way from south america this being the service she was engaged upon  of her speed i know nothing but it must have been the average of the period and the decorations of her saloons were i dare say quite up to the mark but i doubt if her birth had been boastfully paragraphed all round the press because that was not the fashion of the time  she was not a mass of material gorgeously furnished and upholstered  she was a ship and she was not in the apt words of an article by commander c crutchley rnr which i have just read run by a sort of hotel syndicate composed of the chief engineer the purser and the captain as these monstrous atlantic ferries are  she was really commanded manned and equipped as a ship meant to keep the sea a ship first and last in the fullest meaning of the term as the fact i am going to relate will show  she was off the spanish coast homeward bound and fairly full just like the titanic and further the proportion of her crew to her passengers i remember quite well was very much the same  the exact number of souls on board i have forgotten  it might have been nearly three hundred certainly not more  the night was moonlit but hazy the weather fine with a heavy swell running from the westward which means that she must have been rolling a great deal and in that respect the conditions for her were worse than in the case of the titanic  some time either just before or just after midnight to the best of my recollection she was run into amidships and at right angles by a large steamer which after the blow backed out and herself apparently damaged remained motionless at some distance  my recollection is that the douro remained afloat after the collision for fifteen minutes or thereabouts  it might have been twenty but certainly something under the halfhour  in that time the boats were lowered all the passengers put into them and the lot shoved off  there was no time to do anything more  all the crew of the douro went down with her literally without a murmur  when she went she plunged bodily down like a stone  the only members of the ships company who survived were the third officer who was from the first ordered to take charge of the boats and the seamen told off to man them two in each  nobody else was picked up  a quartermaster one of the saved in the way of duty with whom i talked a month or so afterwards told me that they pulled up to the spot but could neither see a head nor hear the faintest cry  but i have forgotten  a passenger was drowned  she was a ladys maid who frenzied with terror refused to leave the ship  one of the boats waited near by till the chief officer finding himself absolutely unable to tear the girl away from the rail to which she dung with a frantic grasp ordered the boat away out of danger  my quartermaster told me that he spoke over to them in his ordinary voice and this was the last sound heard before the ship sank  the rest is silence  i daresay there was the usual official inquiry but who cared for it  that sort of thing speaks for itself with no uncertain voice though the papers i remember gave the event no space to speak of no large headlinesno headlines at all  you see it was not the fashion at the time  a seamanlike piece of work of which one cherishes the old memory at this juncture more than ever before  she was a ship commanded manned equippednot a sort of marine ritz proclaimed unsinkable and sent adrift with its casual population upon the sea without enough boats without enough seamen but with a parisian cafe and four hundred of poor devils of waiters to meet dangers which let the engineers say what they like lurk always amongst the waves sent with a blind trust in mere material lightheartedly to a most miserable most fatuous disaster  and there are too many ugly developments about this tragedy  the rush of the senatorial inquiry before the poor wretches escaped from the jaws of death had time to draw breath the vituperative abuse of a man no more guilty than others in this matter and the suspicion of this aimless fuss being a political move to get home on the mt company into which in common parlance the united states government has got its knife i dont pretend to understand why though with the rest of the world i am aware of the fact  perhaps there may be an excellent and worthy reason for it but i venture to suggest that to take advantage of so many pitiful corpses is not pretty  and the exploiting of the mere sensation on the other side is not pretty in its wealth of heartless inventions  neither is the welter of marconi lies which has not been sent vibrating without some reason for which it would be nauseous to inquire too closely  and the calumnious baseless gratuitous circumstantial lie charging poor captain smith with desertion of his post by means of suicide is the vilest and most ugly thing of all in this outburst of journalistic enterprise without feeling without honour without decency  but all this has its moral  and that other sinking which i have related here and to the memory of which a seaman turns with relief and thankfulness has its moral too  yes material may fail and men too may fail sometimes but more often men when they are given the chance will prove themselves truer than steel that wonderful thin steel from which the sides and the bulkheads of our modern sealeviathans are made    certain aspects of the admirable inquiry into the loss of the titanic1912   i have been taken to task by a friend of mine on the other side for my strictures on senator smiths investigation into the loss of the titanic in the number of the english review for may 1912  i will admit that the motives of the investigation may have been excellent and probably were my criticism bore mainly on matters of form and also on the point of efficiency  in that respect i have nothing to retract  the senators of the commission had absolutely no knowledge and no practice to guide them in the conduct of such an investigation and this fact gave an air of unreality to their zealous exertions  i think that even in the united states there is some regret that this zeal of theirs was not tempered by a large dose of wisdom  it is fitting that people who rush with such ardour to the work of putting questions to men yet gasping from a narrow escape should have i wouldnt say a tincture of technical information but enough knowledge of the subject to direct the trend of their inquiry  the newspapers of two continents have noted the remarks of the president of the senatorial commission with comments which i will not reproduce here having a scant respect for the organs of public opinion as they fondly believe themselves to be  the absolute value of their remarks was about as great as the value of the investigation they either mocked at or extolled  to the united states senate i did not intend to be disrespectful  i have for that body of which one hears mostly in connection with tariffs as much reverence as the best of americans  to manifest more or less would be an impertinence in a stranger  i have expressed myself with less reserve on our board of trade  that was done under the influence of warm feelings  we were all feeling warmly on the matter at that time  but at any rate our board of trade inquiry conducted by an experienced president discovered a very interesting fact on the very second day of its sitting the fact that the watertight doors in the bulkheads of that wonder of naval architecture could be opened down below by any irresponsible person  thus the famous closing apparatus on the bridge paraded as a device of greater safety with its attachments of warning bells coloured lights and all these prettypretties was in the case of this ship little better than a technical farce  it is amusing if anything connected with this stupid catastrophe can be amusing to see the secretly crestfallen attitude of technicians  they are the high priests of the modern cult of perfected material and of mechanical appliances and would fain forbid the profane from inquiring into its mysteries  we are the masters of progress they say and you should remain respectfully silent  and they take refuge behind their mathematics  i have the greatest regard for mathematics as an exercise of mind  it is the only manner of thinking which approaches the divine but mere calculations of which these men make so much when unassisted by imagination and when they have gained mastery over common sense are the most deceptive exercises of intellect  two and two are four and two are six  that is immutable you may trust your soul to that but you must be certain first of your quantities  i know how the strength of materials can be calculated away and also the evidence of ones senses for it is by some sort of calculation involving weights and levels that the technicians responsible for the titanic persuaded themselves that a ship not divided by watertight compartments could be unsinkable because you know she was not divided  you and i and our little boys when we want to divide say a box take care to procure a piece of wood which will reach from the bottom to the lid  we know that if it does not reach all the way up the box will not be divided into two compartments it will be only partly divided  the titanic was only partly divided she was just sufficiently divided to drown some poor devils like rats in a trap  it is probable that they would have perished in any case but it is a particularly horrible fate to die boxed up like this  yes she was sufficiently divided for that but not sufficiently divided to prevent the water flowing over  therefore to a plain man who knows something of mathematics but is not bemused by calculations she was from the point of view of unsinkability not divided at all  what would you say of people who would boast of a fireproof building an hotel for instance saying oh we have it divided by fireproof bulkheads which would localise any outbreak and if you were to discover on closer inspection that these bulkheads closed no more than twothirds of the openings they were meant to close leaving above an open space through which draught smoke and fire could rush from one end of the building to the other  and furthermore that those partitions being too high to climb over the people confined in each menaced compartment had to stay there and become asphyxiated or roasted because no exits to the outside say to the roof had been provided  what would you think of the intelligence or candour of these advertising people  what would you think of them  and yet apart from the obvious difference in the action of fire and water the cases are essentially the same  it would strike you and me and our little boys who are not engineers yet that to approachi wont say attainsomewhere near absolute safety the divisions to keep out water should extend from the bottom right up to the uppermost deck of the hull  i repeat the hull because there are above the hull the decks of the superstructures of which we need not take account  and further as a provision of the commonest humanity that each of these compartments should have a perfectly independent and free access to that uppermost deck that is into the open  nothing less will do  division by bulkheads that really divide and free access to the deck from every watertight compartment then the responsible man in the moment of danger and in the exercise of his judgment could close all the doors of these watertight bulkheads by whatever clever contrivance has been invented for the purpose without a qualm at the awful thought that he may be shutting up some of his fellow creatures in a deathtrap that he may be sacrificing the lives of men who down there are sticking to the posts of duty as the engineroom staffs of the merchant service have never failed to do  i know very well that the engineers of a ship in a moment of emergency are not quaking for their lives but as far as i have known them attend calmly to their duty  we all must die but hang it all a man ought to be given a chance if not for his life then at least to die decently  its bad enough to have to stick down there when something disastrous is going on and any moment may be your last but to be drowned shut up under deck is too bad  some men of the titanic died like that it is to be feared compartmented so to speak  just think what it means  nothing can approach the horror of that fate except being buried alive in a cave or in a mine or in your family vault  so once more continuous bulkheadsa clear way of escape to the deck out of each watertight compartment  nothing less  and if specialists the precious specialists of the sort that builds unsinkable ships tell you that it cannot be done dont you believe them  it can be done and they are quite clever enough to do it too  the objections they will raise however disguised in the solemn mystery of technical phrases will not be technical but commercial  i assure you that there is not much mystery about a ship of that sort  she is a tank  she is a tank ribbed joisted stayed but she is no greater mystery than a tank  the titanic was a tank eight hundred feet long fitted as an hotel with corridors bedrooms halls and so on not a very mysterious arrangement truly and for the hazards of her existence i should think about as strong as a huntley and palmer biscuittin  i make this comparison because huntley and palmer biscuittins being almost a national institution are probably known to all my readers  well about that strong and perhaps not quite so strong  just look at the side of such a tin and then think of a 50000 ton ship and try to imagine what the thickness of her plates should be to approach anywhere the relative solidity of that biscuittin  in my varied and adventurous career i have been thrilled by the sight of a huntley and palmer biscuittin kicked by a mule skyhigh as the saying is  it came back to earth smiling with only a sort of dimple on one of its cheeks  a proportionately severe blow would have burst the side of the titanic or any other triumph of modern naval architecture like brown paperi am willing to bet  i am not saying this by way of disparagement  there is reason in things you cant make a 50000 ton ship as strong as a huntley and palmer biscuittin  but there is also reason in the way one accepts facts and i refuse to be awed by the size of a tank bigger than any other tank that ever went afloat to its doom  the people responsible for her though disconcerted in their hearts by the exposure of that disaster are giving themselves airs of superioritypriests of an oracle which has failed but still must remain the oracle  the assumption is that they are ministers of progress  but the mere increase of size is not progress  if it were elephantiasis which causes a mans legs to become as large as treetrunks would be a sort of progress whereas it is nothing but a very ugly disease  yet directly this very disconcerting catastrophe happened the servants of the silly oracle began to cry its no use you cant resist progress  the big ship has come to stay  well let her stay on then in gods name  but she isnt a servant of progress in any sense  she is the servant of commercialism  for progress if dealing with the problems of a material world has some sort of moral aspectif only say that of conquest which has its distinct value since man is a conquering animal  but bigness is mere exaggeration  the men responsible for these big ships have been moved by considerations of profit to be made by the questionable means of pandering to an absurd and vulgar demand for banal luxurythe seaside hotel luxury  one even asks oneself whether there was such a demand  it is inconceivable to think that there are people who cant spend five days of their life without a suite of apartments cafes bands and suchlike refined delights  i suspect that the public is not so very guilty in this matter  these things were pushed on to it in the usual course of trade competition  if tomorrow you were to take all these luxuries away the public would still travel  i dont despair of mankind  i believe that if by some catastrophic miracle all ships of every kind were to disappear off the face of the waters together with the means of replacing them there would be found before the end of the week men millionaires perhaps cheerfully putting out to sea in bathtubs for a fresh start  we are all like that  this sort of spirit lives in mankind still uncorrupted by the socalled refinements the ingenuity of tradesmen who look always for something new to sell offers to the public  let her stayi mean the big shipsince she has come to stay  i only object to the attitude of the people who having called her into being and having romanced to speak politely about her assume a detached sort of superiority goodness only knows why and raise difficulties in the way of every suggestiondifficulties about boats about bulkheads about discipline about davits all sorts of difficulties  to most of them the only answer would be where theres a will theres a waythe most wise of proverbs  but some of these objections are really too stupid for anything  i shall try to give an instance of what i mean  this inquiry is admirably conducted  i am not alluding to the lawyers representing various interests who are trying to earn their fees by casting all sorts of mean aspersions on the characters of all sorts of people not a bit worse than themselves  it is honest to give value for your wages and the bravos of ancient venice who kept their stilettos in good order and never failed to deliver the stab bargained for with their employers considered themselves an honest body of professional men no doubt  but they dont compel my admiration whereas the conduct of this inquiry does  and as it is pretty certain to be attacked i take this opportunity to deposit here my nickel of appreciation  well lately there came before it witnesses responsible for the designing of the ship  one of them was asked whether it would not be advisable to make each coalbunker of the ship a watertight compartment by means of a suitable door  the answer to such a question should have been certainly for it is obvious to the simplest intelligence that the more watertight spaces you provide in a ship consistently with having her workable the nearer you approach safety  but instead of admitting the expediency of the suggestion this witness at once raised an objection as to the possibility of closing tightly the door of a bunker on account of the slope of coal  this with the true experts attitude of my dear man you dont know what you are talking about  now would you believe that the objection put forward was absolutely futile  i dont know whether the distinguished president of the court perceived this  very likely he did though i dont suppose he was ever on terms of familiarity with a ships bunker  but i have  i have been inside and you may take it that what i say of them is correct  i dont wish to be wearisome to the benevolent reader but i want to put his finger so to speak on the inanity of the objection raised by the expert  a bunker is an enclosed space for holding coals generally located against the ships side and having an opening a doorway in fact into the stokehold  men called trimmers go in there and by means of implements called slices make the coal run through that opening on to the floor of the stokehold where it is within reach of the stokers firemens shovels  this being so you will easily understand that there is constantly a more or less thick layer of coal generally shaped in a slope lying in that doorway  and the objection of the expert was that because of this obstruction it would be impossible to close the watertight door and therefore that the thing could not be done  and that objection was inane  a watertight door in a bulkhead may be defined as a metal plate which is made to close a given opening by some mechanical means  and if there were a law of medes and persians that a watertight door should always slide downwards and never otherwise the objection would be to a great extent valid  but what is there to prevent those doors to be fitted so as to move upwards or horizontally or slantwise  in which case they would go through the obstructing layer of coal as easily as a knife goes through butter  anyone may convince himself of it by experimenting with a light piece of board and a heap of stones anywhere along our roads  probably the joint of such a door would weep a littleand there is no necessity for its being hermetically tightbut the object of converting bunkers into spaces of safety would be attained  you may take my word for it that this could be done without any great effort of ingenuity  and that is why i have qualified the experts objection as inane  of course these doors must not be operated from the bridge because of the risk of trapping the coaltrimmers inside the bunker but on the signal of all other watertight doors in the ship being closed as would be done in case of a collision they too could be closed on the order of the engineer of the watch who would see to the safety of the trimmers if the rent in the ships side were within the bunker itself that would become manifest enough without any signal and the rush of water into the stokehold could be cut off directly the doorplate came into its place say a minute at the very outside  naturally if the blow of a rightangled collision for instance were heavy enough to smash through the inner bulkhead of the bunker why there would be then nothing to do but for the stokers and trimmers and everybody in there to clear out of the stokeroom  but that does not mean that the precaution of having watertight doors to the bunkers is useless superfluous or impossible 7  and talking of stokeholds firemen and trimmers men whose heavy labour has not a single redeeming feature which is unhealthy uninspiring arduous without the reward of personal pride in it sheer hard brutalising toil belonging neither to earth nor sea i greet with joy the advent for marine purposes of the internal combustion engine  the disappearance of the marine boiler will be a real progress which anybody in sympathy with his kind must welcome  instead of the unthrifty unruly nondescript crowd the boilers require a crowd of men in the ship but not of her we shall have comparatively small crews of disciplined intelligent workers able to steer the ship handle anchors man boats and at the same time competent to take their place at a bench as fitters and repairers the resourceful and skilled seamenmechanics of the future the legitimate successors of these seamensailors of the past who had their own kind of skill hardihood and tradition and whose last days it has been my lot to share  one lives and learns and hears very surprising thingsthings that one hardly knows how to take whether seriously or jocularly how to meetwith indignation or with contempt  things said by solemn experts by exalted directors by glorified ticketsellers by officials of all sorts  i suppose that one of the uses of such an inquiry is to give such people enough rope to hang themselves with  and i hope that some of them wont neglect to do so  one of them declared two days ago that there was nothing to learn from the catastrophe of the titanic  that he had been giving his best consideration to certain rules for ten years and had come to the conclusion that nothing ever happened at sea and that rules and regulations boats and sailors were unnecessary that what was really wrong with the titanic was that she carried too many boats  no i am not joking  if you dont believe me pray look back through the reports and you will find it all there  i dont recollect the officials name but it ought to have been poohbah  well poohbah said all these things and when asked whether he really meant it intimated his readiness to give the subject more of his best considerationfor another ten years or so apparentlybut he believed oh yes he was certain that had there been fewer boats there would have been more people saved  really when reading the report of this admirably conducted inquiry one isnt certain at times whether it is an admirable inquiry or a felicitous operabouffe of the gilbertian typewith a rather grim subject to be sure  yes rather grimbut the comic treatment never fails  my readers will remember that in the number of the english review for may 1912 i quoted the old case of the arizona and went on from that to prophesy the coming of a new seamanship in a spirit of irony far removed from fun at the call of the sublime builders of unsinkable ships  i thought that as a small boy of my acquaintance says i was doing a sarcasm and regarded it as a rather wild sort of sarcasm at that  well i am blessed excuse the vulgarism if a witness has not turned up who seems to have been inspired by the same thought and evidently longs in his heart for the advent of the new seamanship  he is an expert of course and i rather believe hes the same gentleman who did not see his way to fit watertight doors to bunkers  with ludicrous earnestness he assured the commission of his intense belief that had only the titanic struck endon she would have come into port all right  and in the whole tone of his insistent statement there was suggested the regret that the officer in charge who is dead now and mercifully outside the comic scope of this inquiry was so illadvised as to try to pass clear of the ice  thus my sarcastic prophecy that such a suggestion was sure to turn up receives an unexpected fulfilment  you will see yet that in deference to the demands of progress the theory of the new seamanship will become established whatever you see in front of youram it fair    the new seamanship  looks simple doesnt it  but it will be a very exact art indeed  the proper handling of an unsinkable ship you see will demand that she should be made to hit the iceberg very accurately with her nose because should you perchance scrape the bluff of the bow instead she may without ceasing to be as unsinkable as before find her way to the bottom  i congratulate the future transatlantic passengers on the new and vigorous sensations in store for them  they shall go bounding across from iceberg to iceberg at twentyfive knots with precision and safety and a cheerful bumpy soundas the immortal poem has it  it will be a teethloosening exhilarating experience  the decorations will be louisquinze of course and the cafe shall remain open all night  but what about the priceless sevres porcelain and the venetian glass provided for the service of transatlantic passengers well i am afraid all that will have to be replaced by silver goblets and plates  nasty common cheap silver  but those who will go to sea must be prepared to put up with a certain amount of hardship  and there shall be no boats  why should there be no boats  because pooh bah has said that the fewer the boats the more people can be saved and therefore with no boats at all no one need be lost  but even if there was a flaw in this argument pray look at the other advantages the absence of boats gives you  there cant be the annoyance of having to go into them in the middle of the night and the unpleasantness after saving your life by the skin of your teeth of being hauled over the coals by irreproachable members of the bar with hints that you are no better than a cowardly scoundrel and your wife a heartless monster  less boats  no boats  great should be the gratitude of passageselling combines to poohbah and they ought to cherish his memory when he dies but no fear of that  his kind never dies  all you have to do o combine is to knock at the door of the marine department look in and beckon to the first man you see  that will be he very much at your serviceprepared to affirm after ten years of my best consideration and a bundle of statistics in hand that theres no lesson to be learned and that there is nothing to be done  on an earlier day there was another witness before the court of inquiry a mighty official of the white star line  the impression of his testimony which the report gave is of an almost scornful impatience with all this fuss and pother  boats  of course we have crowded our decks with them in answer to this ignorant clamour  mere lumber  how can we handle so many boats with our davits  your people dont know the conditions of the problem  we have given these matters our best consideration and we have done what we thought reasonable  we have done more than our duty  we are wise and good and impeccable  and whoever says otherwise is either ignorant or wicked  this is the gist of these scornful answers which disclose the psychology of commercial undertakings  it is the same psychology which fifty or so years ago before samuel plimsoll uplifted his voice sent overloaded ships to sea  why shouldnt we cram in as much cargo as our ships will hold  look how few how very few of them get lost after all  men dont change  not very much  and the only answer to be given to this manager who came out impatient and indignant from behind the plate glass windows of his shop to be discovered by this inquiry and to tell us that he they the whole three million or thirty million for all i know capital organisation for selling passages has considered the problem of boatsthe only answer to give him is that this is not a problem of boats at all  it is the problem of decent behaviour  if you cant carry or handle so many boats then dont cram quite so many people on board  it is as simple as thatthis problem of right feeling and right conduct the real nature of which seems beyond the comprehension of ticketproviders  dont sell so many tickets my virtuous dignitary after all men and women unless considered from a purely commercial point of view are not exactly the cattle of the westernocean trade that used some twenty years ago to be thrown overboard on an emergency and left to swim round and round before they sank  if you cant get more boats then sell less tickets  dont drown so many people on the finest calmest night that was ever known in the north atlanticeven if you have provided them with a little music to get drowned by  sell less tickets thats the solution of the problem your mercantile highness  but there would be a cry oh  this requires consideration  ten years of iteh  well no  this does not require consideration  this is the very first thing to do  at once  limit the number of people by the boats you can handle  thats honesty  and then you may go on fumbling for years about these precious davits which are such a stumblingblock to your humanity  these fascinating patent davits  these davits that refuse to do three times as much work as they were meant to do  oh  the wickedness of these davits  one of the great discoveries of this admirable inquiry is the fascination of the davits  all these people positively cant get away from them they shuffle about and groan around their davits  whereas the obvious thing to do is to eliminate the manhandled davits altogether  dont you think that with all the mechanical contrivances with all the generated power on board these ships it is about time to get rid of the hundred yearsold manpower appliances  cranes are what is wanted low compact cranes with adjustable heads one to each set of six or nine boats  and if people tell you of insuperable difficulties if they tell you of the swing and spin of spanned boats dont you believe them  the heads of the cranes need not be any higher than the heads of the davits  the lift required would be only a couple of inches  as to the spin there is a way to prevent that if you have in each boat two men who know what they are about  i have taken up on board a heavy ships boat in the open sea the ship rolling heavily with a common cargo derrick  and a cargo derrick is very much like a crane but a crane devised ad hoc would be infinitely easier to work  we must remember that the loss of this ship has altered the moral atmosphere  as long as the titanic is remembered an ugly rush for the boats may be feared in case of some accident  you cant hope to drill into perfect discipline a casual mob of six hundred firemen and waiters but in a ship like the titanic you can keep on a permanent trustworthy crew of one hundred intelligent seamen and mechanics who would know their stations for abandoning ship and would do the work efficiently  the boats could be lowered with sufficient dispatch  one does not want to let rip ones boats by the run all at the same time  with six boatcranes six boats would be simultaneously swung filled and got away from the side and if any sort of order is kept the ship could be cleared of the passengers in a quite short time  for there must be boats enough for the passengers and crew whether you increase the number of boats or limit the number of passengers irrespective of the size of the ship  that is the only honest course  any other would be rather worse than putting sand in the sugar for which a tradesman gets fined or imprisoned  do not let us take a romantic view of the socalled progress  a company selling passages is a tradesman though from the way these people talk and behave you would think they are benefactors of mankind in some mysterious way engaged in some lofty and amazing enterprise  all these boats should have a motorengine in them  and of course the glorified tradesman the mummified official the technicians and all these secretly disconcerted hangerson to the enormous ticketselling enterprise will raise objections to it with every air of superiority but dont believe them  doesnt it strike you as absurd that in this age of mechanical propulsion of generated power the boats of such ultra modern ships are fitted with oars and sails implements more than three thousand years old  old as the siege of troy  older    and i know what i am talking about  only six weeks ago i was on the river in an ancient rough ships boat fitted with a twocylinder motorengine of 75 hp  just a common ships boat which the man who owns her uses for taking the workmen and stevedores to and from the ships loading at the buoys off greenhithe  she would have carried some thirty people  no doubt has carried as many daily for many months  and she can tow a twentyfive ton water bargewhich is also part of that mans business  it was a boisterous day half a gale of wind against the flood tide  two fellows managed her  a youngster of seventeen was cox and a firstrate cox he was too a fellow in a torn blue jersey not much older of the usual riverside type looked after the engine  i spent an hour and a half in her running up and down and across that reach  she handled perfectly  with eight or twelve oars out she could not have done anything like as well  these two youngsters at my request kept her stationary for ten minutes with a touch of engine and helm now and then within three feet of a big ugly mooring buoy over which the water broke and the spray flew in sheets and which would have holed her if she had bumped against it  but she kept her position it seemed to me to an inch without apparently any trouble to these boys  you could not have done it with oars  and her engine did not take up the space of three men even on the assumption that you would pack people as tight as sardines in a box  not the room of three people i tell you  but no one would want to pack a boat like a sardinebox  there must be room enough to handle the oars but in that old ships boat even if she had been desperately overcrowded there was power manageable by two riverside youngsters to get away quickly from a ships side very important for your safety and to make room for other boats the power to keep her easily head to sea the power to move at five to seven knots towards a rescuing ship the power to come safely alongside  and all that in an engine which did not take up the room of three people  a poor boatman who had to scrape together painfully the few sovereigns of the price had the idea of putting that engine into his boat  but all these designers directors managers constructors and others whom we may include in the generic name of yamsi never thought of it for the boats of the biggest tank on earth or rather on sea  and therefore they assume an air of impatient superiority and make objectionshowever sick at heart they may be  and i hope they are at least as much as a grocer who has sold a tin of imperfect salmon which destroyed only half a dozen people  and you know the tinning of salmon was progress as much at least as the building of the titanic  more in fact  i am not attacking shipowners  i care neither more nor less for lines companies combines and generally for trade arrayed in purple and fine linen than the trade cares for me  but i am attacking foolish arrogance which is fair game the offensive posture of superiority by which they hide the sense of their guilt while the echoes of the miserably hypocritical cries along the alleyways of that ship any more women  any more women linger yet in our ears  i have been expecting from one or the other of them all bearing the generic name of yamsi something a sign of some sort some sincere utterance in the course of this admirable inquiry of manly of genuine compunction  in vain  all trade talk  not a whisperexcept for the conventional expression of regret at the beginning of the yearly reportwhich otherwise is a cheerful document  dividends you know  the shop is doing well  and the admirable inquiry goes on punctuated by idiotic laughter by paidfor cries of indignation from under legal wigs bringing to light the psychology of various commercial characters too stupid to know that they are giving themselves awayan admirably laborious inquiry into facts that speak nay shout for themselves  i am not a softheaded humanitarian faddist  i have been ordered in my time to do dangerous work i have ordered others to do dangerous work i have never ordered a man to do any work i was not prepared to do myself i attach no exaggerated value to human life  but i know it has a value for which the most generous contributions to the mansion house and heroes funds cannot pay  and they cannot pay for it because people even of the third class excuse my plain speaking are not cattle  death has its sting  if yamsis managers head were forcibly held under the water of his bath for some little time he would soon discover that it has  some people can only learn from that sort of experience which comes home to their own dear selves  i am not a sentimentalist therefore it is not a great consolation to me to see all these people breveted as heroes by the penny and halfpenny press  it is no consolation at all  in extremity in the worst extremity the majority of people even of common people will behave decently  its a fact of which only the journalists dont seem aware hence their enthusiasm i suppose  but i who am not a sentimentalist think it would have been finer if the band of the titanic had been quietly saved instead of being drowned while playingwhatever tune they were playing the poor devils  i would rather they had been saved to support their families than to see their families supported by the magnificent generosity of the subscribers  i am not consoled by the false writtenup drury lane aspects of that event which is neither drama nor melodrama nor tragedy but the exposure of arrogant folly there is nothing more heroic in being drowned very much against your will off a holed helpless big tank in which you bought your passage than in dying of colic caused by the imperfect salmon in the tin you bought from your grocer  and thats the truth  the unsentimental truth stripped of the romantic garment the press has wrapped around this most unnecessary disaster    protection of ocean liners 81914   the loss of the empress of ireland awakens feelings somewhat different from those the sinking of the titanic had called up on two continents the grief for the lost and the sympathy for the survivors and the bereaved are the same but there is not and there cannot be the same undercurrent of indignation  the good ship that is gone i remember reading of her launch something like eight years ago had not been ushered in with beat of drum as the chief wonder of the world of waters the company who owned her had no agents authorised or unauthorised giving boastful interviews about her unsinkability to newspaper reporters ready to swallow any sort of trade statement if only sensational enough for their readersreaders as ignorant as themselves of the nature of all things outside the commonest experience of the man in the street  no there was nothing of that in her case  the company was content to have as fine staunch seaworthy a ship as the technical knowledge of that time could make her  in fact she was as safe a ship as nine hundred and ninetynine ships out of any thousand now afloat upon the sea  no whatever sorrow one can feel one does not feel indignation this was not an accident of a very boastful marine transportation this was a real casualty of the sea  the indignation of the new south wales premier flashed telegraphically to canada is perfectly uncalledfor  that statesman whose sympathy for poor mates and seamen is so suspect to me that i wouldnt take it at fifty per cent discount does not seem to know that a british court of marine inquiry ordinary or extraordinary is not a contrivance for catching scapegoats  i who have been seaman mate and master for twenty years holding my certificate under the board of trade may safely say that none of us ever felt in danger of unfair treatment from a court of inquiry  it is a perfectly impartial tribunal which has never punished seamen for the faults of shipownersas indeed it could not do even if it wanted to  and there is another thing the angry premier of new south wales does not know  it is this that for a ship to float for fifteen minutes after receiving such a blow by a bare stem on her bare side is not so bad  she took a tremendous list which made the minutes of grace vouchsafed her of not much use for the saving of lives  but for that neither her owners nor her officers are responsible  it would have been wonderful if she had not listed with such a hole in her side  even the aquitania with such an opening in her outer hull would be bound to take a list  i dont say this with the intention of disparaging this latest triumph of marine architectureto use the consecrated phrase  the aquitania is a magnificent ship  i believe she would bear her people unscathed through ninetynine per cent of all possible accidents of the sea  but suppose a collision out on the ocean involving damage as extensive as this one was and suppose then a gale of wind coming on  even the aquitania would not be quite seaworthy for she would not be manageable  we have been accustoming ourselves to put our trust in material technical skill invention and scientific contrivances to such an extent that we have come at last to believe that with these things we can overcome the immortal gods themselves  hence when a disaster like this happens there arises besides the shock to our humane sentiments a feeling of irritation such as the hon gentleman at the head of the new south wales government has discharged in a telegraphic flash upon the world  but it is no use being angry and trying to hang a threat of penal servitude over the heads of the directors of shipping companies  you cant get the better of the immortal gods by the mere power of material contrivances  there will be neither scapegoats in this matter nor yet penal servitude for anyone  the directors of the canadian pacific railway company did not sell safety at sea to the people on board the empress of ireland  they never in the slightest degree pretended to do so  what they did was to sell them a seapassage giving very good value for the money  nothing more  as long as men will travel on the water the seagods will take their toll  they will catch good seamen napping or confuse their judgment by arts well known to those who go to sea or overcome them by the sheer brutality of elemental forces  it seems to me that the resentful seagods never do sleep and are never weary wherein the seamen who are mere mortals condemned to unending vigilance are no match for them  and yet it is right that the responsibility should be fixed  it is the fate of men that even in their contests with the immortal gods they must render an account of their conduct  life at sea is the life in which simple as it is you cant afford to make mistakes  with whom the mistake lies here is not for me to say  i see that sir thomas shaughnessy has expressed his opinion of captain kendalls absolute innocence  this statement premature as it is does him honour for i dont suppose for a moment that the thought of the material issue involved in the verdict of the court of inquiry influenced him in the least  i dont suppose that he is more impressed by the writ of two million dollars nailed or more likely pasted to the foremast of the norwegian than i am who dont believe that the storstad is worth two million shillings  this is merely a move of commercial law and even the whole majesty of the british empire so finely invoked by the sheriff cannot squeeze more than a very moderate quantity of blood out of a stone  sir thomas in his confident pronouncement stands loyally by a loyal and distinguished servant of his company  this thing has to be investigated yet and it is not proper for me to express my opinion though i have one in this place and at this time but i need not conceal my sympathy with the vehement protestations of captain andersen  a charge of neglect and indifference in the matter of saving lives is the cruellest blow that can be aimed at the character of a seaman worthy of the name  on the face of the facts as known up to now the charge does not seem to be true  if upwards of three hundred people have been as stated in the last reports saved by the storstad then that ship must have been at hand and rendering all the assistance in her power  as to the point which must come up for the decision of the court of inquiry it is as fine as a hair  the two ships saw each other plainly enough before the fog closed on them  no one can question captain kendalls prudence  he has been as prudent as ever he could be  there is not a shadow of doubt as to that  but there is this question accepting the position of the two ships when they saw each other as correctly described in the very latest newspaper reports it seems clear that it was the empress of irelands duty to keep clear of the collier and what the court will have to decide is whether the stopping of the liner was under the circumstances the best way of keeping her clear of the other ship which had the right to proceed cautiously on an unchanged course  this reduced to its simplest expression is the question which the court will have to decide  and now apart from all problems of manoeuvring of rules of the road of the judgment of the men in command away from their possible errors and from the points the court will have to decide if we ask ourselves what it was that was needed to avert this disaster costing so many lives spreading so much sorrow and to a certain point shocking the public conscienceif we ask that question what is the answer to be  i hardly dare set it down  yes what was it that was needed what ingenious combinations of shipbuilding what transverse bulkheads what skill what geniushow much expense in money and trained thinking what learned contriving to avert that disaster  to save that ship all these lives so much anguish for the dying and so much grief for the bereaved all that was needed in this particular case in the way of science money ingenuity and seamanship was a man and a corkfender  yes a man a quartermaster an able seaman that would know how to jump to an order and was not an excitable fool  in my time at sea there was no lack of men in british ships who could jump to an order and were not excitable fools  as to the socalled corkfender it is a sort of soft balloon made from a net of thick rope rather more than a foot in diameter  it is such a long time since i have indented for corkfenders that i dont remember how much these things cost apiece  one of them hung judiciously over the side at the end of its lanyard by a man who knew what he was about might perhaps have saved from destruction the ship and upwards of a thousand lives  two men with a heavy ropefender would have been better but even the other one might have made all the difference between a very damaging accident and downright disaster  by the time the corkfender had been squeezed between the liners side and the bluff of the storstads bow the effect of the latters reversed propeller would have been produced and the ships would have come apart with no more damage than bulged and started plates  wasnt there lying about on that liners bridge fitted with all sorts of scientific contrivances a couple of simple and effective corkfendersor on board of that norwegian either  there must have been since one ship was just out of a dock or harbour and the other just arriving  that is the time if ever when corkfenders are lying about a ships decks  and there was plenty of time to use them and exactly in the conditions in which such fenders are effectively used  the water was as smooth as in any dock one ship was motionless the other just moving at what may be called dockspeed when entering leaving or shifting berths and from the moment the collision was seen to be unavoidable till the actual contact a whole minute elapsed  a minutean age under the circumstances  and no one thought of the homely expedient of dropping a simple unpretending ropefender between the destructive stern and the defenceless side  i appeal confidently to all the seamen in the still united kingdom from his majesty the king who has been really at sea to the youngest intelligent ab in any ship that will dock next tide in the ports of this realm whether there was not a chance there  i have followed the sea for more than twenty years i have seen collisions i have been involved in a collision myself and i do believe that in the case under consideration this little thing would have made all that enormous differencethe difference between considerable damage and an appalling disaster  many letters have been written to the press on the subject of collisions i have seen some  they contain many suggestions valuable and otherwise but there is only one which hits the nail on the head  it is a letter to the times from a retired captain of the royal navy  it is printed in small type but it deserved to be printed in letters of gold and crimson the writer suggests that all steamers should be obliged by law to carry hung over their stern what we at sea call a pudding  this solution of the problem is as wonderful in its simplicity as the celebrated trick of columbuss egg and infinitely more useful to mankind  a pudding is a thing something like a bolster of stout rope net stuffed with old junk but thicker in the middle than at the ends  it can be seen on almost every tug working in our docks  it is in fact a fixed ropefender always in a position where presumably it would do most good  had the storstad carried such a pudding proportionate to her size say two feet diameter in the thickest part across her stern and hung above the level of her hawsepipes there would have been an accident certainly and some repairwork for the nearest shipyard but there would have been no loss of life to deplore  it seems almost too simple to be true but i assure you that the statement is as true as anything can be  we shall see whether the lesson will be taken to heart  we shall see  there is a commission of learned men sitting to consider the subject of saving life at sea  they are discussing bulkheads boats davits manning navigation but i am willing to bet that not one of them has thought of the humble pudding they can make what rules they like  we shall see if with that disaster calling aloud to them they will make the rule that every steamship should carry a permanent fender across her stern from two to four feet in diameter in its thickest part in proportion to the size of the ship but perhaps they may think the thing too rough and unsightly for this scientific and aesthetic age  it certainly wont look very pretty but i make bold to say it will save more lives at sea than any amount of the marconi installations which are being forced on the shipowners on that very groundthe safety of lives at sea  we shall see        to the editor of the daily express  sir  as i fully expected this mornings post brought me not a few letters on the subject of that article of mine in the illustrated london news  and they are very much what i expected them to be  i shall address my reply to captain littlehales since obviously he can speak with authority and speaks in his own name not under a pseudonym and also for the reason that it is no use talking to men who tell you to shut your head for a confounded fool  they are not likely to listen to you  but if there be in liverpool anybody not too angry to listen i want to assure him or them that my exclamatory line was there no one on board either of these ships to think of dropping a fenderetc was not uttered in the spirit of blame for anyone  i would not dream of blaming a seaman for doing or omitting to do anything a person sitting in a perfectly safe and unsinkable study may think of  all my sympathy goes to the two captains much the greater share of it to captain kendall who has lost his ship and whose load of responsibility was so much heavier  i may not know a great deal but i know how anxious and perplexing are those nearly endon approaches so infinitely more trying to the men in charge than a frank rightangle crossing  i may begin by reminding captain littlehales that i as well as himself have had to form my opinion or rather my vision of the accident from printed statements of which many must have been loose and inexact and none could have been minutely circumstantial  i have read the reports of the times and the daily telegraph and no others  what stands in the columns of these papers is responsible for my conclusionor perhaps for the state of my feelings when i wrote the illustrated london news article  from these sober and unsensational reports i derived the impression that this collision was a collision of the slowest sort  i take it of course that both the men in charge speak the strictest truth as to preliminary facts  we know that the empress of ireland was for a time lying motionless  and if the captain of the storstad stopped his engines directly the fog came on as he says he did then taking into account the adverse current of the river the storstad by the time the two ships sighted each other again must have been barely moving over the ground  the over the ground speed is the only one that matters in this discussion  in fact i represented her to myself as just creeping on aheadno more  this i contend is an imaginative view and we can form no other not utterly absurd for a seaman to adopt  so much for the imaginative view of the sad occurrence which caused me to speak of the fender and be chided for it in unmeasured terms  not by captain littlehales however and i wish to reply to what he says with all possible deference  his illustration borrowed from boxing is very apt and in a certain sense makes for my contention  yes  a blow delivered with a boxingglove will draw blood or knock a man out but it would not crush in his nose flat or break his jaw for himat least not always  and this is exactly my point  twice in my sea life i have had occasion to be impressed by the preserving effect of a fender  once i was myself the man who dropped it over  not because i was so very clever or smart but simply because i happened to be at hand  and i agree with captain littlehales that to see a steamers stern coming at you at the rate of only two knots is a staggering experience  the thing seems to have power enough behind it to cut half through the terrestrial globe  and perhaps captain littlehales is right  it may be that i am mistaken in my appreciation of circumstances and possibilities in this caseor in any such case  perhaps what was really wanted there was an extraordinary man and an extraordinary fender  i care nothing if possibly my deep feeling has betrayed me into something which some people call absurdity  absurd was the word applied to the proposal for carrying enough boats for all on board the big liners  and my absurdity can affect no lives break no bonesneed make no one angry  why should i care then as long as out of the discussion of my absurdity there will emerge the acceptance of the suggestion of captain f papillon rn for the universal and compulsory fitting of very heavy collision fenders on the stems of all mechanically propelled ships  an extraordinary man we cannot always get from heaven on order but an extraordinary fender that will do its work is well within the power of a committee of old boatswains to plan out make and place in position  i beg to ask not in a provocative spirit but simply as to a matter of fact which he is better qualified to judge than i amwill captain littlehales affirm that if the storstad had carried slung securely across the stem even nothing thicker than a single bale of wool an ordinary handpressed australian woolbale it would have made no difference  if scientific men can invent an air cushion a gas cushion or even an electricity cushion with wires or without to fit neatly round the stems and bows of ships then let them go to work in gods name and produce another marvel of science without loss of time  for something like this has long been duetoo long for the credit of that part of mankind which is not absurd and in which i include among others such people as marine underwriters for instance  meanwhile turning to materials i am familiar with i would put my trust in canvas lots of big rope and in large very large quantities of old junk  it sounds awfully primitive but if it will mitigate the mischief in only fifty per cent of cases is it not well worth trying  most collisions occur at slow speeds and it ought to be remembered that in case of a big liners loss involving many lives she is generally sunk by a ship much smaller than herself  joseph conrad    a friendly place   eighteen years have passed since i last set foot in the london sailors home  i was not staying there then i had gone in to try to find a man i wanted to see  he was one of those able seamen who in a watch are a perfect blessing to a young officer  i could perhaps remember here and there among the shadows of my sealife a more daring man or a more agile man or a man more expert in some special branch of his callingsuch as wire splicing for instance but for allround competence he was unequalled  as character he was sterling stuff  his name was anderson he had a fine quiet face kindly eyes and a voice which matched that something attractive in the whole man  though he looked yet in the prime of life shoulders chest limbs untouched by decay and though his hair and moustache were only irongrey he was on board ship generally called old andy by his fellows  he accepted the name with some complacency  i made my enquiry at the highlyglazed entry office  the clerk on duty opened an enormous ledger and after running his finger down a page informed me that anderson had gone to sea a week before in a ship bound round the horn  then smiling at me he added old andy  we know him well here  what a nice fellow  i who knew what a good man in a sailor sense he was assented without reserve  heaven only knows when if ever he came back from that voyage to the sailors home of which he was a faithful client  i went out glad to know he was safely at sea but sorry not to have seen him though indeed if i had we would not have exchanged more than a score of words perhaps  he was not a talkative man old andy whose affectionate shipname clung to him even in that sailors home where the staff understood and liked the sailors those men without a home and did its duty by them with an unobtrusive tact with a patient and humorous sense of their idiosyncrasies to which i hasten to testify now when the very existence of that institution is menaced after so many years of most useful work  walking away from it on that day eighteen years ago i was far from thinking it was for the last time  great changes have come since over land and sea and if i were to seek somebody who knew old andy it would be of all people in the world mr john galsworthy  for mr john galsworthy andy and myself have been shipmates together in our different stations for some forty days in the indian ocean in the early nineties  and but for us two old andys very memory would be gone from this changing earth  yes things have changedthe very sky the atmosphere the light of judgment which falls on the labours of men either splendid or obscure having been asked to say a word to the public on behalf of the sailors home i felt immensely flatteredand troubled  flattered to have been thought of in that connection troubled to find myself in touch again with that past so deeply rooted in my heart  and the illusion of nearness is so great while i trace these lines that i feel as if i were speaking in the name of that worthy sailorshade of old andy whose faithfully hard life seems to my vision a thing of yesterday        but though the past keeps firm hold on one yet one feels with the same warmth that the men and the institutions of today have their merit and their claims  others will know how to set forth before the public the merit of the sailors home in the eloquent terms of hard facts and some few figures  for myself i can only bring a personal note give a glimpse of the human side of the good work for sailors ashore carried on through so many decades with a perfect understanding of the end in view i have been in touch with the sailors home for sixteen years of my life off and on i have seen the changes in the staff and i have observed the subtle alterations in the physiognomy of that stream of sailors passing through it in from the sea and out again to sea between the years 1878 and 1894  i have listened to the talk on the decks of ships in all latitudes when its name would turn up frequently and if i had to characterise its good work in one sentence i would say that for seamen the well street home was a friendly place  it was essentially just that quietly unobtrusively with a regard for the independence of the men who sought its shelter ashore and with no ulterior aims behind that effective friendliness  no small merit this and its claim on the generosity of the public is derived from a long record of valuable public service  since we are all agreed that the men of the merchant service are a national asset worthy of care and sympathy the public could express this sympathy no better than by enabling the sailors home so useful in the past to continue its friendly offices to the seamen of future generations     footnotes   1  yvette and other stories  translated by ada galsworthy
