about on our side of the great sandy desert which shuts us off from the land of oz even during the past exciting years so i hope it will appeal to your love of novelty  a long and confining illness has prevented my answering all the good letters sent meunless stamps were enclosedbut from now on i hope to be able to give prompt attention to each and every letter with which my readers favor me  assuring you that my love for you has never faltered and hoping the oz books will continue to give you pleasure as long as i am able to write them i am  yours affectionately    l frank baum   royal historian of oz   ozcot   at hollywood   in california   1919     1  mount munch   on the east edge of the land of oz in the munchkin country is a big tall hill called mount munch  one one side the bottom of this hill just touches the deadly sandy desert that separates the fairyland of oz from all the rest of the world but on the other side the hill touches the beautiful fertile country of the munchkins  the munchkin folks however merely stand off and look at mount munch and know very little about it for about a third of the way up its sides become too steep to climb and if any people live upon the top of that great towering peak that seems to reach nearly to the skies the munchkins are not aware of the fact  but people do live there just the same  the top of mount munch is shaped like a saucer broad and deep and in the saucer are fields where grains and vegetables grow and flocks are fed and brooks flow and trees bear all sorts of things  there are houses scattered here and there each having its family of hyups as the people call themselves  the hyups seldom go down the mountain for the same reason that the munchkins never climb up the sides are too steep  in one of the houses lived a wise old hyup named bini aru who used to be a clever sorcerer  but ozma of oz who rules everyone in the land of oz had made a decree that no one should practice magic in her dominions except glinda the good and the wizard of oz and when glinda sent this royal command to the hyups by means of a strongwinged eagle old bini aru at once stopped performing magical arts  he destroyed many of his magic powders and tools of magic and afterward honestly obeyed the law  he had never seen ozma but he knew she was his ruler and must be obeyed  there was only one thing that grieved him  he had discovered a new and secret method of transformations that was unknown to any other sorcerer  glinda the good did not know it nor did the little wizard of oz nor dr pipt nor old mombi nor anyone else who dealt in magic arts  it was bini arus own secret  by its means it was the simplest thing in the world to transform anyone into beast bird or fish or anything else and back again once you know how to pronounce the mystical word pyrzqxgl  bini aru had used this secret many times but not to cause evil or suffering to others  when he had wandered far from home and was hungry he would say i want to become a cowpyrzqxgl in an instant he would be a cow and then he would eat grass and satisfy his hunger all beasts and birds can talk in the land of oz so when the cow was no longer hungry it would say i want to be bini aru again pyrzqxgl and the magic word properly pronounced would instantly restore him to his proper form  now of course i would not dare to write down this magic word so plainly if i thought my readers would pronounce it properly and so be able to transform themselves and others but it is a fact that no one in all the world except bini aru had ever up to the time this story begins been able to pronounce pyrzqxgl the right way so i think it is safe to give it to you  it might be well however in reading this story aloud to be careful not to pronounce pyrzqxgl the proper way and thus avoid all danger of the secret being able to work mischief  bini aru having discovered the secret of instant transformation which required no tools or powders or other chemicals or herbs and always worked perfectly was reluctant to have such a wonderful discovery entirely unknown or lost to all human knowledge  he decided not to use it again since ozma had forbidden him to do so but he reflected that ozma was a girl and some time might change her mind and allow her subjects to practice magic in which case bini aru could again transform himself and others at willunless of course he forgot how to pronounce pyrzqxgl in the meantime  after giving the matter careful thought he decided to write the word and how it should be pronounced in some secret place so that he could find it after many years but where no one else could ever find it  that was a clever idea but what bothered the old sorcerer was to find a secret place  he wandered all over the saucer at the top of mount munch but found no place in which to write the secret word where others might not be likely to stumble upon it  so finally he decided it must be written somewhere in his own house  bini aru had a wife named mopsi aru who was famous for making fine huckleberry pies and he had a son named kiki aru who was not famous at all  he was noted as being cross and disagreeable because he was not happy and he was not happy because he wanted to go down the mountain and visit the big world below and his father would not let him  no one paid any attention to kiki aru because he didnt amount to anything anyway  once a year there was a festival on mount munch which all the hyups attended  it was held in the center of the saucershaped country and the day was given over to feasting and merrymaking  the young folks danced and sang songs the women spread the tables with good things to eat and the men played on musical instruments and told fairy tales  kiki aru usually went to these festivals with his parents and then sat sullenly outside the circle and would not dance or sing or even talk to the other young people  so the festival did not make him any happier than other days and this time he told bini aru and mopsi aru that he would not go  he would rather stay at home and be unhappy all by himself he said and so they gladly let him stay  but after he was left alone kiki decided to enter his fathers private room where he was forbidden to go and see if he could find any of the magic tools bini aru used to work with when he practiced sorcery  as he went in kiki stubbed his toe on one of the floor boards  he searched everywhere but found no trace of his fathers magic  all had been destroyed  much disappointed he started to go out again when he stubbed his toe on the same floor board  that set him thinking  examining the board more closely kiki found it had been pried up and then nailed down again in such a manner that it was a little higher than the other boards  but why had his father taken up the board  had he hidden some of his magic tools underneath the floor  kiki got a chisel and pried up the board but found nothing under it he was just about to replace the board when it slipped from his hand and turned over and he saw something written on the underside of it the light was rather dim so he took the board to the window and examined it and found that the writing described exactly how to pronounce the magic word pyrzqxgl which would transform anyone into anything instantly and back again when the word was repeated  now at first kiki aru didnt realize what a wonderful secret he had discovered but he thought it might be of use to him and so he took a piece of paper and made on it an exact copy of the instructions for pronouncing pyrzqxgl  then he folded the paper and put it in his pocket and replaced the board in the floor so that no one would suspect it had been removed  after this kiki went into the garden and sitting beneath a tree made a careful study of the paper  he had always wanted to get away from mount munch and visit the big worldespecially the land of ozand the idea now came to him that if he could transform himself into a bird he could fly to any place he wished to go and fly back again whenever he cared to  it was necessary however to learn by heart the way to pronounce the magic word because a bird would have no way to carry a paper with it and kiki would be unable to resume his proper shape if he forgot the word or its pronunciation  so he studied it a long time repeating it a hundred times in his mind until he was sure he would not forget it  but to make safety doubly sure he placed the paper in a tin box in a neglected part of the garden and covered the box with small stones  by this time it was getting late in the day and kiki wished to attempt his first transformation before his parents returned from the festival so he stood on the front porch of his home and said  i want to become a big strong bird like a hawkpyrzqxgl he pronounced it the right way so in a flash he felt that he was completely changed in form  he flapped his wings hopped to the porch railing and said cawoo  cawoo  then he laughed and said half aloud i suppose thats the funny sound this sort of a bird makes  but now let me try my wings and see if im strong enough to fly across the desert  for he had decided to make his first trip to the country outside the land of oz  he had stolen this secret of transformation and he knew he had disobeyed the law of oz by working magic  perhaps glinda or the wizard of oz would discover him and punish him so it would be good policy to keep away from oz altogether  slowly kiki rose into the air and resting on his broad wings floated in graceful circles above the saucershaped mountaintop  from his height he could see far across the burning sands of the deadly desert another country that might be pleasant to explore so he headed that way and with strong steady strokes of his wings began the long flight     2  the hawk   even a hawk has to fly high in order to cross the deadly desert from which poisonous fumes are constantly rising  kiki aru felt sick and faint by the time he reached good land again for he could not quite escape the effects of the poisons  but the fresh air soon restored him and he alighted in a broad tableland which is called hiland  just beyond it is a valley known as loland and these two countries are ruled by the gingerbread man john dough with chick the cherub as his prime minister  the hawk merely stopped here long enough to rest and then he flew north and passed over a fine country called merryland which is ruled by a lovely wax doll  then following the curve of the desert he turned north and settled on a treetop in the kingdom of noland  kiki was tired by this time and the sun was now setting so he decided to remain here till morning  from his treetop he could see a house near by which looked very comfortable  a man was milking a cow in the yard and a pleasantfaced woman came to the door and called him to supper  that made kiki wonder what sort of food hawks ate  he felt hungry but didnt know what to eat or where to get it  also he thought a bed would be more comfortable than a treetop for sleeping so he hopped to the ground and said i want to become kiki aru againpyrzqxgl  instantly he had resumed his natural shape and going to the house he knocked upon the door and asked for some supper  who are you asked the man of the house  a stranger from the land of oz replied kiki aru  then you are welcome said the man  kiki was given a good supper and a good bed and he behaved very well although he refused to answer all the questions the good people of noland asked him  having escaped from his home and found a way to see the world the young man was no longer unhappy and so he was no longer cross and disagreeable  the people thought him a very respectable person and gave him breakfast next morning after which he started on his way feeling quite contented  having walked for an hour or two through the pretty country that is ruled by king bud kiki aru decided he could travel faster and see more as a bird so he transformed himself into a white dove and visited the great city of nole and saw the kings palace and gardens and many other places of interest  then he flew westward into the kingdom of ix and after a day in queen zixis country went on westward into the land of ev  every place he visited he thought was much more pleasant than the saucercountry of the hyups and he decided that when he reached the finest country of all he would settle there and enjoy his future life to the utmost  in the land of ev he resumed his own shape again for the cities and villages were close together and he could easily go on foot from one to another of them  toward evening he came to a good inn and asked the innkeeper if he could have food and lodging  you can if you have the money to pay said the man otherwise you must go elsewhere  this surprised kiki for in the land of oz they do not use money at all everyone being allowed to take what he wishes without price  he had no money therefore and so he turned away to seek hospitality elsewhere  looking through an open window into one of the rooms of the inn as he passed along he saw an old man counting on a table a big heap of gold pieces which kiki thought to be money  one of these would buy him supper and a bed he reflected so he transformed himself into a magpie and flying through the open window caught up one of the gold pieces in his beak and flew out again before the old man could interfere  indeed the old man who was robbed was quite helpless for he dared not leave his pile of gold to chase the magpie and before he could place the gold in a sack in his pocket the robber bird was out of sight and to seek it would be folly  kiki aru flew to a group of trees and dropping the gold piece to the ground resumed his proper shape and then picked up the money and put it in his pocket  youll be sorry for this exclaimed a small voice just over his head  kiki looked up and saw that a sparrow perched upon a branch was watching him  sorry for what he demanded  oh i saw the whole thing asserted the sparrow  i saw you look in the window at the gold and then make yourself into a magpie and rob the poor man and then i saw you fly here and make the bird into your former shape  thats magic and magic is wicked and unlawful and you stole money and thats a still greater crime  youll be sorry some day  i dont care replied kiki aru scowling  arent you afraid to be wicked asked the sparrow  no i didnt know i was being wicked said kiki but if i was im glad of it  i hate good people  ive always wanted to be wicked but i didnt know how  haw haw haw laughed someone behind him in a big voice thats the proper spirit my lad  im glad ive met you shake hands  the sparrow gave a frightened squeak and flew away     3  two bad ones   kiki turned around and saw a queer old man standing near  he didnt stand straight for he was crooked  he had a fat body and thin legs and arms  he had a big round face with bushy white whiskers that came to a point below his waist and white hair that came to a point on top of his head  he wore dullgray clothes that were tight fitting and his pockets were all bunched out as if stuffed full of something  i didnt know you were here said kiki  i didnt come until after you did said the queer old man  who are you asked kiki  my names ruggedo  i used to be the nome king but i got kicked out of my country and now im a wanderer  what made them kick you out inquired the hyup boy  well its the fashion to kick kings nowadays  i was a pretty good kingto myselfbut those dreadful oz people wouldnt let me alone so i had to abdicate  what does that mean  it means to be kicked out  but lets talk about something pleasant who are you and where did you come from  im called kiki aru  i used to live on mount munch in the land of oz but now im a wanderer like yourself  the nome king gave him a shrewd look  i heard that bird say that you transformed yourself into a magpie and back again  is that true  kiki hesitated but saw no reason to deny it  he felt that it would make him appear more important  wellyes he said  then youre a wizard  no i only understand transformations he admitted  well thats pretty good magic anyhow declared old ruggedo  i used to have some very fine magic myself but my enemies took it all away from me  where are you going now  im going into the inn to get some supper and a bed said kiki  have you the money to pay for it asked the nome  i have one gold piece  which you stole  very good  and youre glad that youre wicked better yet  i like you young man and ill go to the inn with you if youll promise not to eat eggs for supper  dont you like eggs asked kiki  im afraid of em theyre dangerous said ruggedo with a shudder  all right agreed kiki i wont ask for eggs  then come along said the nome  when they entered the inn the landlord scowled at kiki and said  i told you i would not feed you unless you had money  kiki showed him the gold piece  and how about you asked the landlord turning to ruggedo  have you money  ive something better answered the old nome and taking a bag from one of his pockets he poured from it upon the table a mass of glittering gemsdiamonds rubies and emeralds  the landlord was very polite to the strangers after that  he served them an excellent supper and while they ate it the hyup boy asked his companion  where did you get so many jewels  well ill tell you answered the nome  when those oz people took my kingdom away from mejust because it was my kingdom and i wanted to run it to suit myselfthey said i could take as many precious stones as i could carry  so i had a lot of pockets made in my clothes and loaded them all up  jewels are fine things to have with you when you travel you can trade them for anything  are they better than gold pieces asked kiki  the smallest of these jewels is worth a hundred gold pieces such as you stole from the old man  dont talk so loud begged kiki uneasily  some one else might hear what you are saying  after supper they took a walk together and the former nome king said  do you know the shaggy man and the scarecrow and the tin woodman and dorothy and ozma and all the other oz people  no replied the boy i have never been away from mount munch until i flew over the deadly desert the other day in the shape of a hawk  then youve never seen the emerald city of oz  never  well said the nome i knew all the oz people and you can guess i do not love them  all during my wanderings i have brooded on how i can be revenged on them  now that ive met you i can see a way to conquer the land of oz and be king there myself which is better than being king of the nomes  how can you do that inquired kiki aru wonderingly  never mind how  in the first place ill make a bargain with you tell me the secret of how to perform transformations and i will give you a pocketful of jewels the biggest and finest that i possess  no said kiki who realized that to share his power with another would be dangerous to himself  ill give you two pocketsful of jewels said the nome  no answered kiki  ill give you every jewel i possess  no no no said kiki who was beginning to be frightened  then said the nome with a wicked look at the boy ill tell the innkeeper that you stole that gold piece and he will have you put in prison  kiki laughed at the threat  before he can do that said he i will transform myself into a lion and tear him to pieces or into a bear and eat him up or into a fly and fly away where he could not find me  can you really do such wonderful transformations asked the old nome looking at him curiously  of course declared kiki  i can transform you into a stick of wood in a flash or into a stone and leave you here by the roadside  the wicked nome shivered a little when he heard that but it made him long more than ever to possess the great secret  after a while he said  ill tell you what ill do  if you will help me to conquer oz and to transform the oz people who are my enemies into sticks or stones by telling me your secret ill agree to make you the ruler of all oz and i will be your prime minister and see that your orders are obeyed  ill help do that said kiki but i wont tell you my secret  the nome was so furious at this refusal that he jumped up and down with rage and spluttered and choked for a long time before he could control his passion  but the boy was not at all frightened  he laughed at the wicked old nome which made him more furious than ever  lets give up the idea he proposed when ruggedo had quieted somewhat  i dont know the oz people you mention and so they are not my enemies  if theyve kicked you out of your kingdom thats your affairnot mine  wouldnt you like to be king of that splendid fairyland asked ruggedo  yes i would replied kiki aru but you want to be king yourself and we would quarrel over it  no said the nome trying to deceive him  i dont care to be king of oz come to think it over  i dont even care to live in that country  what i want first is revenge  if we can conquer oz ill get enough magic then to conquer my own kingdom of the nomes and ill go back and live in my underground caverns which are more homelike than the top of the earth  so heres my proposition help me conquer oz and get revenge and help me get the magic away from glinda and the wizard and ill let you be king of oz forever afterward  ill think it over answered kiki and that is all he would say that evening  in the night when all in the inn were asleep but himself old ruggedo the nome rose softly from his couch and went into the room of kiki aru the hyup and searched everywhere for the magic tool that performed his transformations  of course there was no such tool and although ruggedo searched in all the boys pockets he found nothing magical whatever  so he went back to his bed and began to doubt that kiki could perform transformations  next morning he said  which way do you travel today  i think i shall visit the rose kingdom answered the boy  that is a long journey declared the nome  i shall transform myself into a bird said kiki and so fly to the rose kingdom in an hour  then transform me also into a bird and i will go with you suggested ruggedo  but in that case let us fly together to the land of oz and see what it looks like  kiki thought this over  pleasant as were the countries he had visited he heard everywhere that the land of oz was more beautiful and delightful  the land of oz was his own country too and if there was any possibility of his becoming its king he must know something about it  while kiki the hyup thought ruggedo the nome was also thinking  this boy possessed a marvelous power and although very simple in some ways he was determined not to part with his secret  however if ruggedo could get him to transport the wily old nome to oz which he could reach in no other way he might then induce the boy to follow his advice and enter into the plot for revenge which he had already planned in his wicked heart  there are wizards and magicians in oz remarked kiki after a time they might discover us in spite of our transformations  not if we are careful ruggedo assured him  ozma has a magic picture in which she can see whatever she wishes to see but ozma will know nothing of our going to oz and so she will not command her magic picture to show where we are or what we are doing  glinda the good has a great book called the book of records in which is magically written everything that people do in the land of oz just the instant they do it  then said kiki there is no use our attempting to conquer the country for glinda would read in her book all that we do and as her magic is greater than mine she would soon put a stop to our plans  i said people didnt i retorted the nome  the book doesnt make a record of what birds do or beasts  it only tells the doings of people  so if we fly into the country as birds glinda wont know anything about it  two birds couldnt conquer the land of oz asserted the boy scornfully  no thats true admitted ruggedo and then he rubbed his forehead and stroked his long pointed beard and thought some more  ah now i have the idea he declared  i suppose you can transform us into beasts as well as birds  of course  and can you make a bird a beast and a beast a bird again without taking a human form in between  certainly said kiki  i can transform myself or others into anything that can talk  theres a magic word that must be spoken in connection with the transformations and as beasts and birds and dragons and fishes can talk in oz we may become any of these we desire to  however if i transformed myself into a tree i would always remain a tree because then i could not utter the magic word to change the transformation  i see i see said ruggedo nodding his bushy white head until the point of his hair waved back and forth like a pendulum  that fits in with my idea exactly  now listen and ill explain to you my plan well fly to oz as birds and settle in one of the thick forests in the gillikin country  there you will transform us into powerful beasts and as glinda doesnt keep any track of the doings of beasts we can act without being discovered  but how can two beasts raise an army to conquer the powerful people of oz inquired kiki  thats easy  but not an army of people mind you  that would be quickly discovered  and while we are in oz you and i will never resume our human forms until weve conquered the country and destroyed glinda and ozma and the wizard and dorothy and all the rest and so have nothing more to fear from them  it is impossible to kill anyone in the land of oz declared kiki  it isnt necessary to kill the oz people rejoined ruggedo  im afraid i dont understand you objected the boy  what will happen to the oz people and what sort of an army could we get together except of people  ill tell you  the forests of oz are full of beasts  some of them in the faraway places are savage and cruel and would gladly follow a leader as savage as themselves  they have never troubled the oz people much because they had no leader to urge them on but we will tell them to help us conquer oz and as a reward we will transform all the beasts into men and women and let them live in the houses and enjoy all the good things and we will transform all the people of oz into beasts of various sorts and send them to live in the forests and the jungles that is a splendid idea you must admit and its so easy that we wont have any trouble at all to carry it through to success  will the beasts consent do you think asked the boy  to be sure they will  we can get every beast in oz on our sideexcept a few who live in ozmas palace and they wont count     4  conspirators   kiki aru didnt know much about oz and didnt know much about the beasts who lived there but the old nomes plan seemed to him to be quite reasonable  he had a faint suspicion that ruggedo meant to get the best of him in some way and he resolved to keep a close watch on his fellowconspirator  as long as he kept to himself the secret word of the transformations ruggedo would not dare to harm him and he promised himself that as soon as they had conquered oz he would transform the old nome into a marble statue and keep him in that form forever  ruggedo on his part decided that he could by careful watching and listening surprise the boys secret and when he had learned the magic word he would transform kiki aru into a bundle of faggots and burn him up and so be rid of him  this is always the way with wicked people  they cannot be trusted even by one another  ruggedo thought he was fooling kiki and kiki thought he was fooling ruggedo so both were pleased  its a long way across the desert remarked the boy and the sands are hot and send up poisonous vapors  let us wait until evening and then fly across in the night when it will be cooler  the former nome king agreed to this and the two spent the rest of that day in talking over their plans  when evening came they paid the innkeeper and walked out to a little grove of trees that stood near by  remain here for a few minutes and ill soon be back said kiki and walking swiftly away he left the nome standing in the grove  ruggedo wondered where he had gone but stood quietly in his place until all of a sudden his form changed to that of a great eagle and he uttered a piercing cry of astonishment and flapped his wings in a sort of panic  at once his eagle cry was answered from beyond the grove and another eagle even larger and more powerful than the transformed ruggedo came sailing through the trees and alighted beside him  now we are ready for the start said the voice of kiki coming from the eagle  ruggedo realized that this time he had been outwitted  he had thought kiki would utter the magic word in his presence and so he would learn what it was but the boy had been too shrewd for that  as the two eagles mounted high into the air and began their flight across the great desert that separates the land of oz from all the rest of the world the nome said  when i was king of the nomes i had a magic way of working transformations that i thought was good but it could not compare with your secret word  i had to have certain tools and make passes and say a lot of mystic words before i could transform anybody  what became of your magic tools inquired kiki  the oz people took them all away from methat horrid girl dorothy and that terrible fairy ozma the ruler of ozat the time they took away my underground kingdom and kicked me upstairs into the cold heartless world  why did you let them do that asked the boy  well said ruggedo i couldnt help it  they rolled eggs at meeggsdreadful eggsand if an egg even touches a nome he is ruined for life  is any kind of an egg dangerous to a nome  any kind and every kind  an egg is the only thing im afraid of     5  a happy corner of oz   there is no other country so beautiful as the land of oz  there are no other people so happy and contented and prosperous as the oz people they have all they desire they love and admire their beautiful girl ruler ozma of oz and they mix work and play so justly that both are delightful and satisfying and no one has any reason to complain  once in a while something happens in oz to disturb the peoples happiness for a brief time for so rich and attractive a fairyland is sure to make a few selfish and greedy outsiders envious and therefore certain evildoers have treacherously plotted to conquer oz and enslave its people and destroy its girl ruler and so gain the wealth of oz for themselves  but up to the time when the cruel and crafty nome ruggedo conspired with kiki aru the hyup all such attempts had failed  the oz people suspected no danger  life in the worlds nicest fairyland was one round of joyous happy days  in the center of the emerald city of oz the capital city of ozmas dominions is a vast and beautiful garden surrounded by a wall inlaid with shining emeralds and in the center of this garden stands ozmas royal palace the most splendid building ever constructed  from a hundred towers and domes floated the banners of oz which included the ozmies the munchkins the gillikins the winkies and the quadlings the banner of the munchkins is blue that of the winkies yellow the gillikin banner is purple and the quadlings banner is red  the colors of the emerald city are of course green  ozmas own banner has a green center and is divided into four quarters  these quarters are colored blue purple yellow and red indicating that she rules over all the countries of the land of oz  this fairyland is so big however that all of it is not yet known to its girl ruler and it is said that in some far parts of the country in forests and mountain fastnesses in hidden valleys and thick jungles are people and beasts that know as little about ozma as she knows of them  still these unknown subjects are not nearly so numerous as the known inhabitants of oz who occupy all the countries near to the emerald city  indeed im sure it will not be long until all parts of the fairyland of oz are explored and their peoples made acquainted with their ruler for in ozmas palace are several of her friends who are so curious that they are constantly discovering new and extraordinary places and inhabitants  one of the most frequent discoverers of these hidden places in oz is a little kansas girl named dorothy who is ozmas dearest friend and lives in luxurious rooms in the royal palace  dorothy is indeed a princess of oz but she does not like to be called a princess and because she is simple and sweet and does not pretend to be anything but an ordinary little girl she is called just dorothy by everybody and is the most popular person next to ozma in all the land of oz  one morning dorothy crossed the hall of the palace and knocked on the door of another girl named trot also a guest and friend of ozma  when told to enter dorothy found that trot had company an old sailorman with one wooden leg and one meat leg who was sitting by the open window puffing smoke from a corncob pipe  this sailorman was named capn bill and he had accompanied trot to the land of oz and was her oldest and most faithful comrade and friend  dorothy liked capn bill too and after she had greeted him she said to trot  you know ozmas birthday is next month and ive been wondering what i can give here as a birthday present  shes so good to us all that we certainly ought to remember her birthday  thats true agreed trot  ive been wondering too what i could give ozma  its pretty hard to decide cause shes got already all she wants and as shes a fairy and knows a lot about magic she could satisfy any wish  i know returned dorothy but that isnt the point  it isnt that ozma needs anything but that it will please her to know weve remembered her birthday  but what shall we give her  trot shook her head in despair  ive tried to think and i cant she declared  its the same way with me said dorothy  i know one thing that ud please her remarked capn bill turning his round face with its fringe of whiskers toward the two girls and staring at them with his big lightblue eyes wide open  what is it capn bill  its an enchanted flower said he  its a pretty plant that stands in a golden flowerpot an grows all sorts o flowers one after another  one minute a fine rose buds an blooms an then a tulip an next a chryschrys  anthemum said dorothy helping him  thats it and next a dahlia an then a daffydil an on all through the range o posies  jus as soon as one fades away another comes of a different sort an the perfume from em is mighty snifty an they keeps bloomin night and day year in an year out  thats wonderful exclaimed dorothy  i think ozma would like it  but where is the magic flower and how can we get it asked trot  dunno zacly slowly replied capn bill  the glass cat tol me about it only yesterday an said it was in some lonely place up at the noreast o here  the glass cat goes travelin all around oz you know an the little critter sees a lot o things no one else does  thats true said dorothy thoughtfully  northeast of here must be in the munchkin country and perhaps a good way off so lets ask the glass cat to tell us how to get to the magic flower  so the two girls with capn bill stumping along on his wooden leg after them went out into the garden and after some time spent in searching they found the glass cat curled up in the sunshine beside a bush fast sleep  the glass cat is one of the most curious creatures in all oz  it was made by a famous magician named dr pipt before ozma had forbidden her subjects to work magic  dr pipt had made the glass cat to catch mice but the cat refused to catch mice and was considered more curious than useful  this astonished cat was made all of glass and was so clear and transparent that you could see through it as easily as through a window  in the top of its head however was a mass of delicate pink balls which looked like jewels but were intended for brains  it had a heart made of bloodred ruby  the eyes were two large emeralds  but aside from these colors all the rest of the animal was of clear glass and it had a spunglass tail that was really beautiful  here wake up  said capn bill  we want to talk to you  slowly the glass cat got upon its feed yawned and then looked at the three who stood before it  how dare you disturb me it asked in a peevish voice  you ought to be ashamed of yourselves  never mind that returned the sailor  do you remember tellin me yesterday bout a magic flower in a gold pot  do you think im a fool  look at my brainsyou can see em work  of course i remember said the cat  well where can we find it  you cant  its none of your business anyhow  go away and let me sleep advised the glass cat  now see here said dorothy we want the magic flower to give to ozma on her birthday  youd be glad to please ozma wouldnt you  im not sure replied the creature  why should i want to please anybody  youve got a heart cause i can see it inside of you said trot  yes its a pretty heart and im fond of it said the cat twisting around to view its own body  but its made from a ruby and its hard as nails  arent you good for anything asked trot  yes im pretty to look at and thats more than can be said of you retorted the creature  trot laughed at this and dorothy who understood the glass cat pretty well said soothingly  you are indeed beautiful and if you can tell capn bill where to find the magic flower all the people in oz will praise your cleverness the flower will belong to ozma but everyone will know the glass cat discovered it  this was the kind of praise the crystal creature liked  well it said while the pink brains rolled around i found the magic flower way up in the north of the munchkin country where few people live or ever go  theres a river there that flows through a forest and in the middle of the forest there is a small island on which stands the gold pot in which grows the magic flower  how did you get to the island asked dorothy  glass cats cant swim  no but im not afraid of water was the reply  i just walked across the river on the bottom  under the water exclaimed trot  the cat gave her a scornful look  how could i walk over the water on the bottom of the river  if you were transparent anyone could see your brains were not working  but im sure you could never find the place alone  it has always been hidden from the oz people  but you with your fine pink brains could find it again i spose remarked dorothy  yes and if you want that magic flower for ozma ill go with you and show you the way  thats lovely of you declared dorothy  trot and capn bill will go with you for this is to be their birthday present to ozma  while youre gone ill have to find something else to give her  all right  come on then capn said the glass cat starting to move away  wait a minute begged trot  how long will we be gone  oh about a week  then ill put some things in a basket to take with us said the girl and ran into the palace to make her preparations for the journey     6  ozmas birthday presents   when capn bill and trot and the glass cat had started for the hidden island in the faroff river to get the magic flower dorothy wondered again what she could give ozma on her birthday  she met the patchwork girl and said  what are you going to give ozma for a birthday present  ive written a song for her answered the strange patchwork girl who went by the name of scraps and who through stuffed with cotton had a fair assortment of mixed brains  its a splendid song and the chorus runs this way    i am crazy   youre a daisy     ozma dear   im demented   youre contented     ozma dear   i am patched and gay and glary   youre a sweet and lovely fairy   may your birthdays all be happy     ozma dear   how do you like it dorothy inquired the patchwork girl  is it good poetry scraps asked dorothy doubtfully  its as good as any ordinary song was the reply  i have given it a dandy title too  i shall call the song when ozma has a birthday everybodys sure to be gay for she cannot help the fact that she was born  thats a pretty long title scraps said dorothy  that makes it stylish replied the patchwork girl turning a somersault and alighting on one stuffed foot nowadays the titles are sometimes longer than the songs  dorothy left her and walked slowly toward the place where she met the tin woodman just going up the front steps  what are you going to give ozma on her birthday she asked  its a secret but ill tell you replied the tin woodman who was emperor of the winkies  i am having my people make ozma a lovely girdle set with beautiful tin nuggets  each tin nugget will be surrounded by a circle of emeralds just to set it off to good advantage  the clasp of the girdle will be pure tin  wont that be fine  im sure shell like it said dorothy  do you know what i can give her  i havent the slightest idea dorothy  it took me three months to think of my own present for ozma  the girl walked thoughtfully around to the back of the palace and presently came upon the famous scarecrow of oz who has having two of the palace servants stuff his legs with fresh straw  what are you going to give ozma on her birthday asked dorothy  i want to surprise her answered the scarecrow  i wont tell promised dorothy  well im having some straw slippers made for herall straw mind you and braided very artistically  ozma has always admired my straw filling so im sure shell be pleased with these lovely straw slippers  ozma will be pleased with anything her loving friends give her said the girl  what im worried about scarecrow is what to give ozma that she hasnt got already  thats what worried me until i thought of the slippers said the scarecrow  youll have to think dorothy thats the only way to get a good idea  if i hadnt such wonderful brains id never have thought of those straw footdecorations  dorothy left him and went to her room where she sat down and tried to think hard  a pink kitten was curled up on the windowsill and dorothy asked her  what can i give ozma for her birthday present  oh give her some milk replied the pink kitten thats the nicest thing i know of  a fuzzy little black dog had squatted down at dorothys feet and now looked up at her with intelligent eyes  tell me toto said the girl what would ozma like best for a birthday present  the little black dog wagged his tail  your love said he  ozma wants to be loved more than anything else  but i already love her toto  then tell her you love her twice as much as you ever did before  that wouldnt be true objected dorothy for ive always loved her as much as i could and really toto i want to give ozma some present cause everyone else will give her a present  let me see said toto  how would it be to give her that useless pink kitten  no toto that wouldnt do  then six kisses  no thats no present  well i guess youll have to figure it out for yourself dorothy said the little dog  to my notion youre more particular than ozma will be  dorothy decided that if anyone could help her it would be glinda the good the wonderful sorceress of oz who was ozmas faithful subject and friend  but glindas castle was in the quadling country and quite a journey from the emerald city  so the little girl went to ozma and asked permission to use the wooden sawhorse and the royal red wagon to pay a visit to glinda and the girl ruler kissed princess dorothy and graciously granted permission  the wooden sawhorse was one of the most remarkable creatures in oz its body was a small log and its legs were limbs of trees stuck in the body  its eyes were knots its mouth was sawed in the end of the log and its ears were two chips  a small branch had been left at the rear end of the log to serve as a tail  ozma herself during one of her early adventures had brought this wooden horse to life and so she was much attached to the queer animal and had shod the bottoms of its wooden legs with plates of gold so they would not wear out  the sawhorse was a swift and willing traveler and though it could talk if need arose it seldom said anything unless spoken to  when the sawhorse was harnessed to the red wagon there were no reins to guide him because all that was needed was to tell him where to go  dorothy now told him to go to glindas castle and the sawhorse carried her there with marvelous speed  glinda said dorothy when she had been greeted by the sorceress who was tall and stately with handsome and dignified features and dressed in a splendid and becoming gown what are you going to give ozma for a birthday present  the sorceress smiled and answered  come into my patio and i will show you  so they entered a place that was surrounded by the wings of the great castle but had no roof and was filled with flowers and fountains and exquisite statuary and many settees and chairs of polished marble or filigree gold  here there were gathered fifty beautiful young girls glindas handmaids who had been selected from all parts of the land of oz on account of their wit and beauty and sweet dispositions  it was a great honor to be made one of glindas handmaidens  when dorothy followed the sorceress into this delightful patio all the fifty girls were busily weaving and their shuttles were filled with a sparkling green spun glass such as the little girl had never seen before  what is it glinda she asked  one of my recent discoveries explained the sorceress  i have found a way to make threads from emeralds by softening the stones and then spinning them into long silken strands  with these emerald threads we are weaving cloth to make ozma a splendid court gown for her birthday you will notice that the threads have all the beautiful glitter and luster of the emeralds from which they are made and so ozmas new dress will be the most magnificent the world has ever seen and quite fitting for our lovely ruler of the fairyland of oz  dorothys eyes were fairly dazed by the brilliance of the emerald cloth some of which the girls had already woven  ive never seen anything so beautiful she said with a sigh  but tell me glinda what can i give our lovely ozma on her birthday  the good sorceress considered this question for a long time before she replied  finally she said  of course there will be a grand feast at the royal palace on ozmas birthday and all our friends will be present  so i suggest that you make a fine big birthday cake of ozma and surround it with candles  oh just a cake exclaimed dorothy in disappointment  nothing is nicer for a birthday said the sorceress  how many candles should there be on the cake asked the girl  just a row of them replied glinda for no one knows how old ozma is although she appears to us to be just a young girlas fresh and fair as if she had lived but a few years  a cake doesnt seem like much of a present dorothy asserted  make it a surprise cake suggested the sorceress  dont you remember the four and twenty blackbirds that were baked in a pie well you need not use live blackbirds in your cake but you could have some surprise of a different sort  like what questioned dorothy eagerly  if i told you it wouldnt be your present to ozma but mine answered the sorceress with a smile  think it over my dear and i am sure you can originate a surprise that will add greatly to the joy and merriment of ozmas birthday banquet  dorothy thanked her friend and entered the red wagon and told the sawhorse to take her back home to the palace in the emerald city  on the way she thought the matter over seriously of making a surprise birthday cake and finally decided what to do  as soon as she reached home she went to the wizard of oz who had a room fitted up in one of the high towers of the palace where he studied magic so as to be able to perform such wizardry as ozma commanded him to do for the welfare of her subjects  the wizard and dorothy were firm friends and had enjoyed many strange adventures together  he was a little man with a bald head and sharp eyes and a round jolly face and because he was neither haughty nor proud he had become a great favorite with the oz people  wizard said dorothy i want you to help me fix up a present for ozmas birthday  ill be glad to do anything for you and for ozma he answered whats on your mind dorothy  im going to make a great cake with frosting and candles and all that you know  very good said the wizard  in the center of this cake im going to leave a hollow place with just a roof of the frosting over it continued the girl  very good repeated the wizard nodding his bald head  in that hollow place said dorothy i want to hide a lot of monkeys about three inches high and after the cake is placed on the banquet table i want the monkeys to break through the frosting and dance around on the tablecloth  then i want each monkey to cut out a piece of cake and hand it to a guest  mercy me cried the little wizard as he chuckled with laughter  is that all you want dorothy  almost said she  can you think of anything more the little monkeys can do wizard  not just now he replied  but where will you get such tiny monkeys  thats where youre to help me said dorothy  in some of those wild forests in the gillikin country are lots of monkeys  big ones said the wizard  well you and i will go there and well get some of the big monkeys and you will make them smalljust three inches highby means of your magic and well put the little monkeys all in a basket and bring them home with us  then youll train them to danceup here in your room where no one can see themand on ozmas birthday well put em into the cake and theyll know by that time just what to do  the wizard looked at dorothy with admiring approval and chuckled again  thats really clever my dear he said and i see no reason why we cant do it just the way you say if only we can get the wild monkeys to agree to it  do you think theyll object asked the girl  yes but perhaps we can argue them into it  anyhow its worth trying and ill help you if youll agree to let this surprise cake be a present to ozma from you and me together  ive been wondering what i could give ozma and as ive got to train the monkeys as well as make them small i think you ought to make me your partner  of course said dorothy ill be glad to do so  then its a bargain declared the wizard  we must go to seek those monkeys at once however for it will take time to train them and well have to travel a good way to the gillikin forests where they live  im ready to go any time agreed dorothy  shall we ask ozma to let us take the sawhorse  the wizard did not answer that at once  he took time to think of the suggestion  no he answered at length the red wagon couldnt get through the thick forests and theres some danger to us in going into the wild places to search for monkeys  so i propose we take the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger  we can ride on their backs as well as in the red wagon and if there is danger to us from other beasts these two friendly champions will protect us from all harm  thats a splendid idea exclaimed dorothy  lets go now and ask the hungry tiger and the cowardly lion if they will help us  shall we ask ozma if we can go  i think not said the wizard getting his hat and his black bag of magic tools  this is to be a surprise for her birthday and so she mustnt know where were going  well just leave word in case ozma inquires for us that well be back in a few days     7  the forest of gugu   in the central western part of the gillikin country is a great tangle of trees called gugu forest  it is the biggest forest in all oz and stretches miles and miles in every directionnorth south east and west  adjoining it on the east side is a range of rugged mountains covered with underbrush and small twisted trees  you can find this place by looking at the map of the land of oz  gugu forest is the home of most of the wild beasts that inhabit oz these are seldom disturbed in their leafy haunts because there is no reason why oz people should go there except on rare occasions and most parts of the forest have never been seen by any eyes but the eyes of the beasts who make their home there  the biggest beasts inhabit the great forest while the smaller ones live mostly in the mountain underbrush at the east  now you must know that there are laws in the forests as well as in every other place and these laws are made by the beasts themselves and are necessary to keep them from fighting and tearing one another to pieces  in gugu forest there is a kingan enormous yellow leopard called guguafter whom the forest is named  and this king has three other beasts to advise him in keeping the laws and maintaining orderbru the bear loo the unicorn and rango the gray apewho are known as the kings counselors  all these are fierce and ferocious beasts and hold their high offices because they are more intelligent and more feared then their fellows  since oz became a fairyland no man woman or child ever dies in that land nor is anyone ever sick  likewise the beasts of the forests never die so that long years add to their cunning and wisdom as well as to their size and strength  it is possible for beastsor even peopleto be destroyed but the task is so difficult that it is seldom attempted because it is free from sickness and death is one reason why oz is a fairyland but it is doubtful whether those who come to oz from the outside world as dorothy and buttonbright and trot and capn bill and the wizard did will live forever or cannot be injured  even ozma is not sure about this and so the guests of ozma from other lands are always carefully protected from any danger so as to be on the safe side  in spite of the laws of the forests there are often fights among the beasts some of them have lost an eye or an ear or even had a leg torn off  the king and the kings counselors always punish those who start a fight but so fierce is the nature of some beasts that they will at times fight in spite of laws and punishment  over this vast wild forest of gugu flew two eagles one morning and near the center of the jungle the eagles alighted on a branch of a tall tree  here is the place for us to begin our work said one who was ruggedo the nome  do many beasts live here asked kiki aru the other eagle  the forest is full of them said the nome  there are enough beasts right here to enable us to conquer the people of oz if we can get them to consent to join us  to do that we must go among them and tell them our plans so we must now decide on what shapes we had better assume while in the forest  i suppose we must take the shapes of beasts said kiki  of course  but that requires some thought  all kinds of beasts live here and a yellow leopard is king  if we become leopards the king will be jealous of us  if we take the forms of some of the other beasts we shall not command proper respect  i wonder if the beasts will attack us asked kiki  im a nome and immortal so nothing can hurt me replied ruggedo  i was born in the land of oz so nothing can hurt me said kiki  but in order to carry out our plans we must win the favor of all the animals of the forest  then what shall we do asked kiki  let us mix the shapes of several beasts so we will not look like any one of them proposed the wily old nome  let us have the heads of lions the bodies of monkeys the wings of eagles and the tails of wild asses with knobs of gold on the end of them instead of bunches of hair  wont that make a queer combination inquired kiki  the queerer the better declared ruggedo  all right said kiki  you stay here and ill fly away to another tree and transform us both and then well climb down our trees and meet in the forest  no said the nome we mustnt separate  you must transform us while we are together  i wont do that asserted kiki firmly  youre trying to get my secret and i wont let you  the eyes of the other eagle flashed angrily but ruggedo did not dare insist  if he offended this boy he might have to remain an eagle always and he wouldnt like that  some day he hoped to be able to learn the secret word of the magical transformations but just now he must let kiki have his own way  all right he said gruffly do as you please  so kiki flew to a tree that was far enough distant so that ruggedo could not overhear him and said i want ruggedo the nome and myself to have the heads of lions the bodies of monkeys the wings of eagles and the tails of wild asses with knobs of gold on the ends of them instead of bunches of hairpyrzqxgl  he pronounced the magic word in the proper manner and at once his form changed to the one he had described  he spread his eagles wings and finding they were strong enough to support his monkey body and lion head he flew swiftly to the tree where he had left ruggedo  the nome was also transformed and was climbing down the tree because the branches all around him were so thickly entwined that there was no room between them to fly  kiki quickly joined his comrade and it did not take them long to reach the ground     8  the limoneags make trouble   there had been trouble in the forest of gugu that morning  chipo the wild boar had bitten the tail off arx the giraffe while the latter had his head among the leaves of a tree eating his breakfast  arx kicked with his heels and struck tirrip the great kangaroo who had a new baby in her pouch  tirrip knew it was the wild boars fault so she knocked him over with one powerful blow and then ran away to escape chipos sharp tusks  in the chase that followed a giant porcupine stuck fifty sharp quills into the boar and a chimpanzee in a tree threw a cocoanut at the porcupine that jammed its head into its body  all this was against the laws of the forest and when the excitement was over gugu the leopard king called his royal counselors together to decide how best to punish the offenders  the four lords of the forest were holding solemn council in a small clearing when they saw two strange beasts approaching thembeasts the like of which they had never seen before  not one of the four however relaxed his dignity or showed by a movement that he was startled  the great leopard crouched at full length upon a fallen treetrunk  bru the bear sat on his haunches before the king rango the gray ape stood with his muscular arms folded and loo the unicorn reclined much as a horse does between his fellowcouncillors  with one consent they remained silent eyeing with steadfast looks the intruders who were making their way into their forest domain  well met brothers said one of the strange beasts coming to a halt beside the group while his comrade with hesitation lagged behind  we are not brothers returned the gray ape sternly  who are you and how came you in the forest of gugu  we are two limoneags said ruggedo inventing the name  our home is in sky island and we have come to earth to warn the forest beasts that the people of oz are about to make war upon them and enslave them so that they will become beasts of burden forever after and obey only the will of their twolegged masters  a low roar of anger arose from the council of beasts  whos going to do that asked loo the unicorn in a high squeaky voice at the same time rising to his feet  the people of oz said ruggedo  but what will we be doing inquired the unicorn  thats what ive come to talk to you about  you neednt talk  well fight the oz people screamed the unicorn well smash em well trample em well gore em well  silence growled gugu the king and loo obeyed although still trembling with wrath  the cold steady gaze of the leopard wandered over the two strange beasts  the people of oz said he have not been our friends they have not been our enemies  they have let us alone and we have let them alone  there is no reason for war between us  they have no slaves  they could not use us as slaves if they should conquer us  i think you are telling us lies you strange limoneagyou mixedup beast who are neither one thing nor another  oh on my word its the truth protested the nome in the beasts shape  i wouldnt lie for the world i  silence again growled gugu the king and somehow even ruggedo was abashed and obeyed the edict  what do you say bru asked the king turning to the great bear who had until now said nothing  how does the mixed beast know that what he says is true asked the bear  why i can fly you know having the wings of an eagle explained the nome  i and my comrade yonder turning to kiki flew to a grove in oz and there we heard the people telling how they will make many ropes to snare you beasts and then they will surround this forest and all other forests and make you prisoners  so we came here to warn you for being beasts ourselves although we live in the sky we are your friends  the leopards lip curled and showed his enormous teeth sharp as needles  he turned to the gray ape  what do you think rango he asked  send these mixed beasts away your majesty replied the gray ape they are mischiefmakers  dont do thatdont do that cried the unicorn nervously  the stranger said he would tell us what to do  let him tell us then  are we fools not to heed a warning  gugu the king turned to ruggedo  speak stranger he commanded  well said the nome its this way the land of oz is a fine country  the people of oz have many good thingshouses with soft beds all sorts of nicetasting food pretty clothes lovely jewels and many other things that beasts know nothing of  here in the dark forests the poor beasts have hard work to get enough to eat and to find a bed to rest in  but the beasts are better than the people and why should they not have all the good things the people have  so i propose that before the oz people have the time to make all those ropes to snare you with that all we beasts get together and march against the oz people and capture them  then the beasts will become the masters and the people their slaves  what good would that do us asked bru the bear  it would save you from slavery for one thing and you could enjoy all the fine things of oz people have  beasts wouldnt know what to do with the things people use said the gray ape  but this is only part of my plan insisted the nome  listen to the rest of it  we two limoneags are powerful magicians  when you have conquered the oz people we will transform them all into beasts and send them to the forests to live and we will transform all the beasts into people so they can enjoy all the wonderful delights of the emerald city  for a moment no beast spoke  then the king said prove it  prove what asked ruggedo  prove that you can transform us  if you are a magician transform the unicorn into a man  then we will believe you  if you fail we will destroy you  all right said the nome  but im tired so ill let my comrade make the transformation  kiki aru had stood back from the circle but he had heard all that was said  he now realized that he must make good ruggedos boast so he retreated to the edge of the clearing and whispered the magic word  instantly the unicorn became a fat chubby little man dressed in the purple gillikin costume and it was hard to tell which was the more astonished the king the bear the ape or the former unicorn  its true shorted the manbeast  good gracious look what i am its wonderful  the king of beasts now addressed ruggedo in a more friendly tone  we must believe your story since you have given us proof of your power said he  but why if you are so great a magician cannot you conquer the oz people without our help and so save us the trouble  alas replied the crafty old nome no magician is able to do everything  the transformations are easy to us because we are limoneags but we cannot fight or conquer even such weak creatures as the oz people  but we will stay with you and advise and help you and we will transform all the oz people into beasts when the time comes and all the beasts into people  gugu the king turned to his counselors  how shall we answer this friendly stranger he asked  loo the former unicorn was dancing around and cutting capers like a clown  on my word your majesty he said this being a man is more fun than being a unicorn  you look like a fool said the gray ape  well i feel fine declared the manbeast  i think i prefer to be a bear said big bru  i was born a bear and i know a bears ways  so i am satisfied to live as a bear lives  that said the old nome is because you know nothing better  when we have conquered the oz people and you become a man youll be glad of it  the immense leopard rested his chin on the log and seemed thoughtful  the beasts of the forest must decide this matter for themselves he said  go you rango the gray ape and tell your monkey tribe to order all the forest beasts to assemble in the great clearing at sunrise tomorrow  when all are gathered together this mixedup beast who is a magician shall talk to them and tell them what he has told us  then if they decide to fight the oz people who have declared war on us i will lead the beasts to battle  rango the gray ape turned at once and glided swiftly through the forest on his mission  the bear gave a grunt and walked away  gugu the king rose and stretched himself  then he said to ruggedo meet us at sunrise tomorrow and with stately stride vanished among the trees  the manunicorn left alone with the strangers suddenly stopped his foolish prancing  youd better make me a unicorn again he said  i like being a man but the forest beasts wont know im their friend loo and they might tear me in pieces before morning  so kiki changed him back to his former shape and the unicorn departed to join his people  ruggedo the nome was much pleased with his success  tomorrow he said to kiki aru well win over these beasts and set them to fight and conquer the oz people  then i will have my revenge on ozma and dorothy and all the rest of my enemies  but i am doing all the work said kiki  never mind youre going to be king of oz promised ruggedo  will the big leopard let me be king asked the boy anxiously  the nome came close to him and whispered  if gugu the leopard opposes us you will transform him into a tree and then he will be helpless  of course agreed kiki and he said to himself i shall also transform this deceitful nome into a tree for he lies and i cannot trust him     9  the isle of the magic flower   the glass cat was a good guide and led trot and capn bill by straight and easy paths through all the settled part of the munchkin country and then into the north section where there were few houses and finally through a wild country where there were no houses or paths at all  but the walking was not difficult and at last they came to the edge of a forest and stopped there to make camp and sleep until morning  from branches of trees capn bill made a tiny house that was just big enough for the little girl to crawl into and lie down  but first they ate some of the food trot had carried in the basket  dont you want some too she asked the glass cat  no answered the creature  i suppose youll hunt around an catch a mouse remarked capn bill  me  catch a mouse  why should i do that inquired the glass cat  why then you could eat it said the sailorman  i beg to inform you returned the crystal tabby that i do not eat mice  being transparent so anyone can see through me id look nice wouldnt i with a common mouse inside me  but the fact is that i havent any stomach or other machinery that would permit me to eat things  the careless magician who made me didnt think id need to eat i suppose  dont you ever get hungry or thirsty asked trot  never  i dont complain you know at the way im made for ive never yet seen any living thing as beautiful as i am  i have the handsomest brains in the world  theyre pink and you can see em work  i wonder said trot thoughtfully as she ate her bread and jam if my brains whirl around in the same way yours do  no not the same way surely returned the glass cat for in that case theyd be as good as my brains except that theyre hidden under a thick boney skull  brains remarked capn bill is of all kinds and work different ways  but ive noticed that them as thinks that their brains is best is often mistook  trot was a little disturbed by sounds from the forest that night for many beasts seemed prowling among the trees but she was confident capn bill would protect her from harm  and in fact no beast ventured from the forest to attack them  at daybreak they were up again and after a simple breakfast capn bill said to the glass cat  up anchor mate and lets forge ahead  i dont suppose were far from that magic flower are we  not far answered the transparent one as it led the way into the forest but it may take you some time to get to it  before long they reached the bank of a river  it was not very wide at this place but as they followed the banks in a northerly direction it gradually broadened  suddenly the bluegreen leaves of the trees changed to a purple hue and trot noticed this and said  i wonder what made the colors change like that  its because we have left the munchkin country and entered the gillikin country explained the glass cat  also its a sign our journey is nearly ended  the river made a sudden turn and after the travelers had passed around the bend they saw that the stream had now become as broad as a small lake and in the center of the lake they beheld a little island not more than fifty feet in extent either way  something glittered in the middle of this tiny island and the glass cat paused on the bank and said  there is the gold flowerpot containing the magic flower which is very curious and beautiful  if you can get to the island your task is endedexcept to carry the thing home with you  capn bill looked at the broad expanse of water and began to whistle a low quavering tune  trot knew that the whistle meant that capn bill was thinking and the old sailor didnt look at the island as much as he looked at the trees upon the bank where they stood  presently he took from the big pocket of his coat an axeblade wound in an old cloth to keep the sharp edge from cutting his clothing  then with a large pocket knife he cut a small limb from a tree and whittled it into a handle for his axe  sit down trot he advised the girl as he worked  ive got quite a job ahead of me now for ive got to build us a raft  what do we need a raft for capn  why to take us to the island  we cant walk under water in the river bed as the glass cat did so we must float atop the water  can you make a raft capn bill  o course trot if you give me time  the little girl sat down on a log and gazed at the island of the magic flower  nothing else seemed to grow on the tiny isle  there was no tree no shrub no grass even as far as she could make out from that distance  but the gold pot glittered in the rays of the sun and trot could catch glimpses of glowing colors above it as the magic flower changed from one sort to another  when i was here before remarked the glass cat lazily reclining at the girls feet i saw two kalidahs on this very bank where they had come to drink  what are kalidahs asked the girl  the most powerful and ferocious beasts in all oz  this forest is their especial home and so there are few other beasts to be found except monkeys  the monkeys are spry enough to keep out of the way of the fierce kalidahs which attack all other animals and often fight among themselves  did they try to fight you when you saw em asked trot getting very much excited  yes  they sprang upon me in an instant but i lay flat on the ground so i wouldnt get my legs broken by the great weight of the beasts and when they tried to bite me i laughed at them and jeered them until they were frantic with rage for they nearly broke their teeth on my hard glass  so after a time they discovered they could not hurt me and went away  it was great fun  i hope they dont come here again to drinknot while were here anyhow returned the girl for im not made of glass nor is capn bill and if those bad beasts bit us wed get hurt  capn bill was cutting from the trees some long stakes making them sharp at one end and leaving a crotch at the other end  these were to bind the logs of his raft together  he had fashioned several and was just finishing another when the glass cat cried look out  theres a kalidah coming toward us  trot jumped up greatly frightened and looked at the terrible animal as if fascinated by its fierce eyes for the kalidah was looking at her too and its look wasnt at all friendly  but capn bill called to her wade into the river trot up to your kneesan stay there and she obeyed him at once  the sailorman hobbled forward the stake in one hand and his axe in the other and got between the girl and the beast which sprang upon him with a growl of defiance  capn bill moved pretty slowly sometimes but now he was quick as could be  as the kalidah sprang toward him he stuck out his wooden leg and the point of it struck the beast between the eyes and sent it rolling upon the ground  before it could get upon its feet again the sailor pushed the sharp stake right through its body and then with the flat side of the axe he hammered the stake as far into the ground as it would go  by this means he captured the great beast and made it harmless for try as it would it could not get away from the stake that held it  capn bill knew he could not kill the kalidah for no living thing in oz can be killed so he stood back and watched the beast wriggle and growl and paw the earth with its sharp claws and then satisfied it could not escape he told trot to come out of the water again and dry her wet shoes and stockings in the sun  are you sure he cant get away she asked  id bet a cookie on it said capn bill so trot came ashore and took off her shoes and stockings and laid them on the log to dry while the sailorman resumed his work on the raft  the kalidah realizing after many struggles that it could not escape now became quiet but it said in a harsh snarling voice  i suppose you think youre clever to pin me to the ground in this manner  but when my friends the other kalidahs come here theyll tear you to pieces for treating me this way  praps remarked capn bill coolly as he chopped at the logs an praps not  when are your folks comin here  i dont know admitted the kalidah  but when they do come you cant escape them  if they hold off long enough ill have my raft ready said capn bill  what are you going to do with a raft inquired the beast  were goin over to that island to get the magic flower  the huge beast looked at him in surprise a moment and then it began to laugh  the laugh was a good deal like a roar and it had a cruel and derisive sound but it was a laugh nevertheless  good said the kalidah  good  very good  im glad youre going to get the magic flower  but what will you do with it  were going to take it to ozma as a present on her birthday  the kalidah laughed again then it became sober  if you get to the land on your raft before my people can catch you it said you will be safe from us  we can swim like ducks so the girl couldnt have escaped me by getting into the water but kalidahs dont go to that island over there  why not asked trot  the beast was silent  tell us the reason urged capn bill  well its the isle of the magic flower answered the kalidah and we dont care much for magic  if you hadnt had a magic leg instead of a meat one you couldnt have knocked me over so easily and stuck this wooden pin through me  ive been to the magic isle said the glass cat and ive watched the magic flower bloom and im sure its too pretty to be left in that lonely place where only beasts prowl around it and no else sees it  so were going to take it away to the emerald city  i dont care the beast replied in a surly tone  we kalidahs would be just as contented if there wasnt a flower in our forest  what good are the things anyhow  dont you like pretty things asked trot  no  you ought to admire my pink brains anyhow declared the glass cat theyre beautiful and you can see em work  the beast only growled in reply and capn bill having now cut all his logs to a proper size began to roll them to the waters edge and fasten them together     10  stuck fast   the day was nearly gone when at last the raft was ready  it aint so very big said the old sailor but i dont weigh much an you trot dont weigh half as much as i do an the glass pussy dont count  but its safe isnt it inquired the girl  yes its good enough to carry us to the island an back again an thats about all we can expect of it  saying this capn bill pushed the raft into the water and when it was afloat stepped upon it and held out his hand to trot who quickly followed him  the glass cat boarded the raft last of all  the sailor had cut a long pole and had also whittled a flat paddle and with these he easily propelled the raft across the river  as they approached the island the wonderful flower became more plainly visible and they quickly decided that the glass cat had not praised it too highly  the colors of the flowers that bloomed in quick succession were strikingly bright and beautiful and the shapes of the blossoms were varied and curious  indeed they did not resemble ordinary flowers at all  so intently did trot and capn bill gaze upon the golden flowerpot that held the magic flower that they scarcely noticed the island itself until the raft beached upon its sands  but then the girl exclaimed how funny it is capn bill that nothing else grows here excep the magic flower  then the sailor glanced at the island and saw that it was all bare ground without a weed a stone or a blade of grass  trot eager to examine the flower closer sprang from the raft and ran up the bank until she reached the golden flowerpot  then she stood beside it motionless and filled with wonder  capn bill joined her coming more leisurely and he too stood in silent admiration for a time  ozma will like this remarked the glass cat sitting down to watch the shifting hues of the flowers  im sure she wont have as fine a birthday present from anyone else  do you spose its very heavy capn  and can we get it home without breaking it asked trot anxiously  well ive lifted many bigger things than that he replied but lets see what it weighs  he tried to take a step forward but could not lift his meat foot from the ground  his wooden leg seemed free enough but the other would not budge  i seem stuck trot he said with a perplexed look at his foot  it aint mud an it aint glue but somethins holdin me down  the girl attempted to lift her own feet to go nearer to her friend but the ground held them as fast as it held capn bills foot  she tried to slide them or to twist them around but it was no use she could not move either foot a hairs breadth  this is funny she exclaimed what do you spose has happened to us capn bill  im tryin to make out he answered  take off your shoes trot praps its the leather soles thats stuck to the ground  she leaned down and unlaced her shoes but found she could not pull her feet out of them  the glass cat which was walking around as naturally as ever now said  your foot has got roots to it capn and i can see the roots going into the ground where they spread out in all directions  its the same way with trot  thats why you cant move  the roots hold you fast  capn bill was rather fat and couldnt see his own feet very well but he squatted down and examined trots feet and decided that the glass cat was right  this is hard luck he declared in a voice that showed he was uneasy at the discovery  were prisners trot on this funny island an id like to know how were ever goin to get loose sos we can get home again  now i know why the kalidah laughed at us said the girl and why he said none of the beasts ever came to this island  the horrid creature knew wed be caught and wouldnt warn us  in the meantime the kalidah although pinned fast to the earth by capn bills stake was facing the island and now the ugly expression which passed over its face when it defied and sneered at capn bill and trot had changed to one of amusement and curiosity  when it saw the adventurers had actually reached the island and were standing beside the magic flower it heaved a breath of satisfactiona long deep breath that swelled its deep chest until the beast could feel the stake that held him move a little as if withdrawing itself from the ground  ah ha murmured the kalidah a little more of this will set me free and allow me to escape  so he began breathing as hard as he could puffing out his chest as much as possible with each indrawing breath and by doing this he managed to raise the stake with each powerful breath until at last the kalidahusing the muscles of his four legs as well as his deep breathsfound itself free of the sandy soil  the stake was sticking right through him however so he found a rock deeply set in the bank and pressed the sharp point of the stake upon the surface of this rock until he had driven it clear through his body  then by getting the stake tangled among some thorny bushes and wiggling his body he managed to draw it out altogether  there he exclaimed except for those two holes in me im as good as ever but i must admit that that old woodenlegged fellow saved both himself and the girl by making me a prisoner  now the kalidahs although the most disagreeable creatures in the land of oz were nevertheless magical inhabitants of a magical fairyland and in their natures a certain amount of good was mingled with the evil  this one was not very revengeful and now that his late foes were in danger of perishing his anger against them faded away  our own kalidah king he reflected has certain magical powers of his own  perhaps he knows how to fill up these two holes in my body  so without paying any more attention to trot and capn bill than they were paying to him he entered the forest and trotted along a secret path that led to the hidden lair of all the kalidahs  while the kalidah was making good its escape capn bill took his pipe from his pocket and filled it with tobacco and lighted it  then as he puffed out the smoke he tried to think what could be done  the glass cat seems all right he said an my wooden leg didnt take roots and grow either  so its only flesh that gets caught  its magic that does it capn  i know trot and thats what sticks me  were livin in a magic country but neither of us knows any magic an so we cant help ourselves  couldnt the wizard of oz help usor glinda the good asked the little girl  ah now were beginnin to reason he answered  id probably thought o that myself in a minute more  by good luck the glass cat is free an so it can run back to the emerald city an tell the wizard about our fix an ask him to come an help us get loose  will you go trot asked the cat speaking very earnestly  im no messenger to be sent here and there asserted the curious animal in a sulky tone of voice  well said capn bill youve got to go home anyhow cause you dont want to stay here i take it  and when you get home it wouldnt worry you much to tell the wizard whats happened to us  thats true said the cat sitting on its haunches and lazily washing its face with one glass paw  i dont mind telling the wizardwhen i get home  wont you go now pleaded trot  we dont want to stay here any longer than we can help and everybody in oz will be interested in you and call you a hero and say nice things about you because you helped your friends out of trouble  that was the best way to manage the glass cat which was so vain that it loved to be praised  im going home right away said the creature and ill tell the wizard to come and help you  saying this it walked down to the water and disappeared under the surface  not being able to manage the raft alone the glass cat walked on the bottom of the river as it had done when it visited the island before and soon they saw it appear on the farther bank and trot into the forest where it was quickly lost to sight among the trees  then trot heaved a deep sigh  capn said she were in a bad fix  theres nothing here to eat and we cant even lie down to sleep  unless the glass cat hurries and the wizard hurries i dont know whats going to become of us     11  the beasts of the forest of gugu   that was a wonderful gathering of wild animals in the forest of gugu next sunrise  rango the gray ape had even called his monkey sentinels away from the forest edge and every beast little and big was in the great clearing where meetings were held on occasions of great importance  in the center of the clearing stood a great shelving rock having a flat inclined surface and on this sat the stately leopard gugu who was king of the forest  on the ground beneath him squatted bru the bear loo the unicorn and rango the gray ape the kings three counselors and in front of them stood the two strange beasts who had called themselves limoneags but were really the transformations of ruggedo the nome and kiki aru the hyup  then came the beastsrows and rows and rows of them  the smallest beasts were nearest the kings rock throne then there were wolves and foxes lynxes and hyenas and the like behind them were gathered the monkey tribes who were hard to keep in order because they teased the other animals and were full of mischievous tricks  back of the monkeys were the pumas jaguars tigers and lions and their kind next the bears all sizes and colors after them bisons wild asses zebras and unicorns farther on the rhinoceri and hippopotami and at the far edge of the forest close to the trees that shut in the clearing was a row of thickskinned elephants still as statues but with eyes bright and intelligent  many other kinds of beasts too numerous to mention were there and some were unlike any beasts we see in the menageries and zoos in our country  some were from the mountains west of the forest and some from the plains at the east and some from the river but all present acknowledged the leadership of gugu who for many years had ruled them wisely and forced all to obey the laws  when the beasts had taken their places in the clearing and the rising sun was shooting its first bright rays over the treetops king gugu rose on his throne  the leopards giant form towering above all the others caused a sudden hush to fall on the assemblage  brothers he said in his deep voice a stranger has come among us a beast of curious form who is a great magician and is able to change the shapes of men or beasts at his will  this stranger has come to us with another of his kind from out of the sky to warn us of a danger which threatens us all and to offer us a way to escape from that danger  he says he is our friend and he has proved to me and to my counselors his magic powers  will you listen to what he has to say to youto the message he has brought from the sky  let him speak came in a great roar from the great company of assembled beasts  so ruggedo the nome sprang upon the flat rock beside gugu the king and another roar gentle this time showed how astonished the beasts were at the sight of his curious form  his lions face was surrounded by a mane of pure white hair his eagles wings were attached to the shoulders of his monkey body and were so long that they nearly touched the ground he had powerful arms and legs in addition to the wings and at the end of his long strong tail was a golden ball  never had any beast beheld such a curious creature before and so the very sight of the stranger who was said to be a great magician filled all present with awe and wonder  kiki stayed down below and half hidden by the shelf of rock was scarcely noticed  the boy realized that the old nome was helpless without his magic power but he also realized that ruggedo was the best talker  so he was willing the nome should take the lead  beasts of the forest of gugu began ruggedo the nome my comrade and i are your friends  we are magicians and from our home in the sky we can look down into the land of oz and see everything that is going on also we can hear what the people below us are saying  that is how we heard ozma who rules the land of oz say to her people the beasts in the forest of gugu are lazy and are of no use to us  let us go to their forest and make them all our prisoners  let us tie them with ropes and beat them with sticks until they work for us and become our willing slaves  and when the people heard ozma of oz say this they were glad and raised a great shout and said we will do it  we will make the beasts of the forest of gugu our slaves  the wicked old nome could say no more just then for such a fierce roar of anger rose from the multitude of beasts that his voice was drowned by the clamor  finally the roar died away like distant thunder and ruggedo the nome went on with his speech  having heard the oz people plot against your liberty we watched to see what they would do and saw them all begin making ropesropes long and shortwith which to snare our friends the beasts  you are angry but we also were angry for when the oz people became the enemies of the beasts they also became our enemies for we too are beasts although we live in the sky  and my comrade and i said we will save our friends and have revenge on the oz people and so we came here to tell you of your danger and of our plan to save you  we can save ourselves cried an old elephant  we can fight  the oz people are fairies and you cant fight against magic unless you also have magic answered the nome  tell us your plan shouted the huge tiger and the other beasts echoed his words crying tell us your plan  my plan is simple replied ruggedo  by our magic we will transform all you animals into men and womenlike the oz peopleand we will transform all the oz people into beasts  you can then live in the fine houses of the land of oz and eat the fine food of the oz people and wear their fine clothes and sing and dance and be happy  and the oz people having become beasts will have to live here in the forest and hunt and fight for food and often go hungry as you now do and have no place to sleep but a bed of leaves or a hole in the ground  having become men and women you beasts will have all the comforts you desire and having become beasts the oz people will be very miserable  that is our plan and if you agree to it we will all march at once into the land of oz and quickly conquer our enemies  when the stranger ceased speaking a great silence fell on the assemblage for the beasts were thinking of what he had said  finally one of the walruses asked  can you really transform beasts into men and men into beasts  he canhe can cried loo the unicorn prancing up and down in an excited manner  he transformed me only last evening and he can transform us all  gugu the king now stepped forward  you have heard the stranger speak said he and now you must answer him  it is for you to decide  shall we agree to this plan or not  yes shouted some of the animals  no shouted others  and some were yet silent  gugu looked around the great circle  take more time to think he suggested  your answer is very important  up to this time we have had no trouble with the oz people but we are proud and free and never will become slaves  think carefully and when you are ready to answer i will hear you     12  kiki uses his magic   then arose a great confusion of sounds as all the animals began talking to their fellows  the monkeys chattered and the bears growled and the voices of the jaguars and lions rumbled and the wolves yelped and the elephants had to trumpet loudly to make their voices heard  such a hubbub had never been known in the forest before and each beast argued with his neighbor until it seemed the noise would never cease  ruggedo the nome waved his arms and fluttered his wings to try to make them listen to him again but the beasts paid no attention  some wanted to fight the oz people some wanted to be transformed and some wanted to do nothing at all  the growling and confusion had grown greater than ever when in a flash silence fell on all the beasts present the arguments were hushed and all gazed in astonishment at a strange sight  for into the circle strode a great lionbigger and more powerful than any other lion thereand on his back rode a little girl who smiled fearlessly at the multitude of beasts  and behind the lion and the little girl came another beasta monstrous tiger who bore upon his back a funny little man carrying a black bag  right past the rows of wondering beasts the strange animals walked advancing until they stood just before the rock throne of gugu  then the little girl and the funny little man dismounted and the great lion demanded in a loud voice  who is king in this forest  i am answered gugu looking steadily at the other  i am gugu the leopard and i am king of this forest  then i greet your majesty with great respect said the lion perhaps you have heard of me gugu  i am called the cowardly lion and i am king of all beasts the world over  gugus eyes flashed angrily  yes said he i have heard of you  you have long claimed to be king of beasts but no beast who is a coward can be king over me  he isnt a coward your majesty asserted the little girl hes just cowardly thats all  gugu looked at her  all the other beasts were looking at her too  who are you asked the king  me  oh im just dorothy she answered  how dare you come here demanded the king  why im not afraid to go anywhere if the cowardly lion is with me she said  i know him pretty well and so i can trust him  hes always afraid when we get into trouble and thats why hes cowardly but hes a terrible fighter and thats why he isnt a coward  he doesnt like to fight you know but when he has to there isnt any beast living that can conquer him  gugu the king looked at the big powerful form of the cowardly lion and knew she spoke the truth  also the other lions of the forest now came forward and bowed low before the strange lion  we welcome your majesty said one  we have known you many years ago before you went to live at the emerald city and we have seen you fight the terrible kalidahs and conquer them so we know you are the king of all beasts  it is true replied the cowardly lion but i did not come here to rule the beasts of this forest  gugu is king here and i believe he is a good king and just and wise  i come with my friends to be the guest of gugu and i hope we are welcome  that pleased the great leopard who said very quickly  yes you at least are welcome to my forest  but who are these strangers with you  dorothy has introduced herself replied the lion and you are sure to like her when you know her better  this man is the wizard of oz a friend of mine who can do wonderful tricks of magic  and here is my true and tried friend the hungry tiger who lives with me in the emerald city  is he always hungry asked loo the unicorn  i am replied the tiger answering the question himself  i am always hungry for fat babies  cant you find any fat babies in oz to eat inquired loo the unicorn  there are plenty of them of course said the tiger but unfortunately i have such a tender conscience that it wont allow me to eat babies  so im always hungry for em and never can eat em because my conscience wont let me  now of all the surprised beasts in that clearing not one was so much surprised at the sudden appearance of these four strangers as ruggedo the nome  he was frightened too for he recognized them as his most powerful enemies but he also realized that they could not know he was the former king of the nomes because of the beasts form he wore which disguised him so effectually  so he took courage and resolved that the wizard and dorothy should not defeat his plans  it was hard to tell just yet what the vast assemblage of beasts thought of the new arrivals  some glared angrily at them but more of them seemed to be curious and wondering  all were interested however and they kept very quiet and listened carefully to all that was said  kiki aru who had remained unnoticed in the shadow of the rock was at first more alarmed by the coming of the strangers than even ruggedo was and the boy told himself that unless he acted quickly and without waiting to ask the advice of the old nome their conspiracy was likely to be discovered and all their plans to conquer and rule oz be defeated  kiki didnt like the way ruggedo acted either for the former king of the nomes wanted to do everything his own way and made the boy who alone possessed the power of transformations obey his orders as if he were a slave  another thing that disturbed kiki aru was the fact that a real wizard had arrived who was said to possess many magical powers and this wizard carried his tools in a black bag and was the friend of the oz people and so would probably try to prevent war between the beasts of the forest and the people of oz  all these things passed through the mind of the hyup boy while the cowardly lion and gugu the king were talking together and that was why he now began to do several strange things  he had found a place near to the point where he stood where there was a deep hollow in the rock so he put his face into this hollow and whispered softly so he would not be heard  i want the wizard of oz to become a foxpyrzqxgl  the wizard who had stood smilingly beside his friends suddenly felt his form change to that of a fox and his black bag fell to the ground kiki reached out an arm and seized the bag and the fox cried as loud as it could  treason  theres a traitor here with magic powers  everyone was startled at this cry and dorothy seeing her old friends plight screamed and exclaimed mercy me  but the next instant the little girls form had changed to that of a lamb with fleecy white wool and dorothy was too bewildered to do anything but look around her in wonder  the cowardly lions eyes now flashed fire he crouched low and lashed the ground with his tail and gazed around to discover who the treacherous magician might be  but kiki who had kept his face in the hollow rock again whispered the magic word and the great lion disappeared and in his place stood a little boy dressed in munchkin costume  the little munchkin boy was as angry as the lion had been but he was small and helpless  ruggedo the nome saw what was happening and was afraid kiki would spoil all his plans so he leaned over the rock and shouted stop kikistop  kiki would not stop however  instead he transformed the nome into a goose to ruggedos horror and dismay  but the hungry tiger had witnessed all these transformations and he was watching to see which of those present was to blame for them  when ruggedo spoke to kiki the hungry tiger knew that he was the magician so he made a sudden spring and hurled his great body full upon the form of the limoneag crouching against the rock  kiki didnt see the tiger coming because his face was still in the hollow and the heavy body of the tiger bore him to the earth just as he said pyrzqxgl for the fifth time  so now the tiger which was crushing him changed to a rabbit and relieved of its weight kiki sprang up and spreading his eagles wings flew into the branches of a tree where no beast could easily reach him  he was not an instant too quick in doing this for gugu the king had crouched on the rocks edge and was about to spring on the boy  from his tree kiki transformed gugu into a fat gillikin woman and laughed aloud to see how the woman pranced with rage and how astonished all the beasts were at their kings new shape  the beasts were frightened too fearing they would share the fate of gugu so a stampede began when rango the gray ape sprang into the forest and bru the bear and loo the unicorn followed as quickly as they could  the elephants backed into the forest and all the other animals big and little rushed after them scattering through the jungles until the clearing was far behind  the monkeys scrambled into the trees and swung themselves from limb to limb to avoid being trampled upon by the bigger beasts and they were so quick that they distanced all the rest  a panic of fear seemed to have overtaken the forest people and they got as far away from the terrible magician as they possibly could  but the transformed ones stayed in the clearing being so astonished and bewildered by their new shapes that they could only look at one another in a dazed and helpless fashion although each one was greatly annoyed at the trick that had been played on him  who are you the munchkin boy asked the rabbit and who are you the fox asked the lamb and who are you the rabbit asked the fat gillikin woman  im dorothy said the woolly lamb  im the wizard said the fox  im the cowardly lion said the munchkin boy  im the hungry tiger said the rabbit  im gugu the king said the fat woman  but when they asked the goose who he was ruggedo the nome would not tell them  im just a goose he replied and what i was before i cannot remember     13  the loss of the black bag   kiki aru in the form of the limoneag had scrambled into the high thick branches of the tree so no one could see him and there he opened the wizards black bag which he had carried away in his flight he was curious to see what the wizards magic tools looked like and hoped he could use some of them and so secure more power but after he had taken the articles one by one from the bag he had to admit they were puzzles to him  for unless he understood their uses they were of no value whatever  kiki aru the hyup boy was no wizard or magician at all and could do nothing unusual except to use the magic word he had stolen from his father on mount munch  so he hung the wizards black bag on a branch of the tree and then climbed down to the lower limbs that he might see what the victims of his transformations were doing  they were all on top of the flat rock talking together in tones so low that kiki could not hear what they said  this is certainly a misfortune remarked the wizard in the foxs form but our transformations are a sort of enchantment which is very easy to breakwhen you know how and have the tools to do it with  the tools are in my black bag but where is the bag  no one knew that for none had seen kiki aru fly away with it  lets look and see if we can find it suggested dorothy the lamb  so they left the rock and all of them searched the clearing high and low without finding the bag of magic tools  the goose searched as earnestly as the others for if he could discover it he meant to hide it where the wizard could never find it because if the wizard changed him back to his proper form along with the others he would then be recognized as ruggedo the nome and they would send him out of the land of oz and so ruin all his hopes of conquest  ruggedo was not really sorry now that he thought about it that kiki had transformed all these oz folks  the forest beasts it was true had been so frightened that they would now never consent to be transformed into men but kiki could transform them against their will and once they were all in human forms it would not be impossible to induce them to conquer the oz people  so all was not lost thought the old nome and the best thing for him to do was to rejoin the hyup boy who had the secret of the transformations  so having made sure the wizards black bag was not in the clearing the goose wandered away through the trees when the others were not looking and when out of their hearing he began calling kiki aru  kiki aru  quackquack  kiki aru  the boy and the woman the fox the lamb and the rabbit not being able to find the bag went back to the rock all feeling exceedingly strange  wheres the goose asked the wizard  he must have run away replied dorothy  i wonder who he was  i think said gugu the king who was the fat woman that the goose was the stranger who proposed that we make war upon the oz people  if so his transformation was merely a trick to deceive us and he has now gone to join his comrade that wicked limoneag who obeyed all his commands  what shall we do now asked dorothy  shall we go back to the emerald city as we are and then visit glinda the good and ask her to break the enchantments  i think so replied the wizard fox  and we can take gugu the king with us and have glinda restore him to his natural shape  but i hate to leave my bag of magic tools behind me for without it i shall lose much of my power as a wizard  also if i go back to the emerald city in the shape of a fox the oz people will think im a poor wizard and will lose their respect for me  let us make still another search for your tools suggested the cowardly lion and then if we fail to find the black bag anywhere in this forest we must go back home as we are  why did you come here anyway inquired gugu  we wanted to borrow a dozen monkeys to use on ozmas birthday explained the wizard  we were going to make them small and train them to do tricks and put them inside ozmas birthday cake  well said the forest king you would have to get the consent of rango the gray ape to do that  he commands all the tribes of monkeys  im afraid its too late now said dorothy regretfully  it was a splendid plan but weve got troubles of our own and i dont like being a lamb at all  youre nice and fuzzy said the cowardly lion  thats nothing declared dorothy  ive never been specially proud of myself but id rather be the way i was born than anything else in the whole world   the glass cat although it had some disagreeable ways and manners nevertheless realized that trot and capn bill were its friends and so was quite disturbed at the fix it had gotten them into by leading them to the isle of the magic flower  the ruby heart of the glass cat was cold and hard but still it was a heart and to have a heart of any sort is to have some consideration for others  but the queer transparent creature didnt want trot and capn bill to know it was sorry for them and therefore it moved very slowly until it had crossed the river and was out of sight among the trees of the forest  then it headed straight toward the emerald city and trotted so fast that it was like a crystal streak crossing the valleys and plains  being glass the cat was tireless and with no reason to delay its journey it reached ozmas palace in wonderfully quick time  wheres the wizard it asked the pink kitten which was curled up in the sunshine on the lowest step of the palace entrance  dont bother me lazily answered the pink kitten whose name was eureka  i must find the wizard at once said the glass cat  then find him advised eureka and went to sleep again  the glass cat darted up the stairway and came upon toto dorothys little black dog  wheres the wizard asked the cat  gone on a journey with dorothy replied toto  when did they go and where have they gone demanded the cat  they went yesterday and i heard them say they would go to the great forest in the munchkin country  dear me said the glass cat that is a long journey  but they rode on the hungry tiger and the cowardly lion explained toto and the wizard carried his black bag of magic tools  the glass cat knew the great forest of gugu well for it had traveled through this forest many times in its journeys through the land of oz and it reflected that the forest of gugu was nearer to the isle of the magic flower than the emerald city was and so if it could manage to find the wizard it could lead him across the gillikin country to where trot and capn bill were prisoned  it was a wild country and little traveled but the glass cat knew every path  so very little time need be lost after all  without stopping to ask any more questions the cat darted out of the palace and away from the emerald city taking the most direct route to the forest of gugu  again the creature flashed through the country like a streak of light and it would surprise you to know how quickly it reached the edge of the great forest  there were no monkey guards among the trees to cry out a warning and this was so unusual that it astonished the glass cat  going farther into the forest it presently came upon a wolf which at first bounded away in terror  but then seeing it was only a glass cat the wolf stopped and the cat could see it was trembling as if from a terrible fright  whats the matter asked the cat  a dreadful magician has come among us exclaimed the wolf and hes changing the forms of all the beastsquick as a winkand making them all his slaves  the glass cat smiled and said  why thats only the wizard of oz  he may be having some fun with you forest people but the wizard wouldnt hurt a beast for anything  i dont mean the wizard explained the wolf  and if the wizard of oz is that funny little man who rode a great tiger into the clearing hes been transformed himself by the terrible magician  the wizard transformed  why thats impossible declared the glass cat  no it isnt  i saw him with my own eyes changed into the form of a fox and the girl who was with him was changed to a woolly lamb  the glass cat was indeed surprised  when did that happen it asked  just a little while ago in the clearing  all the animals had met there but they ran away when the magician began his transformations and im thankful i escaped with my natural shape  but im still afraid and im going somewhere to hide  with this the wolf ran on and the glass cat which knew where the big clearing was went toward it  but now it walked more slowly and its pink brains rolled and tumbled around at a great rate because it was thinking over the amazing news the wolf had told it  when the glass cat reached the clearing it saw a fox a lamb a rabbit a munchkin boy and a fat gillikin woman all wandering around in an aimless sort of way for they were again searching for the black bag of magic tools  the cat watched them a moment and then it walked slowly into the open space  at once the lamb ran toward it crying  oh wizard heres the glass cat  where dorothy asked the fox  here  the boy and the woman and the rabbit now joined the fox and the lamb and they all stood before the glass cat and speaking together almost like a chorus asked have you seen the black bag  often replied the glass cat but not lately  its lost said the fox and we must find it  are you the wizard asked the cat  yes  and who are these others  im dorothy said the lamb  im the cowardly lion said the munchkin boy  im the hungry tiger said the rabbit  im gugu king of the forest said the fat woman  the glass cat sat on its hind legs and began to laugh  my what a funny lot exclaimed the creature  who played this joke on you  its no joke at all declared the wizard  it was a cruel wicked transformation and the magician that did it has the head of a lion the body of a monkey the wings of an eagle and a round ball on the end of his tail  the glass cat laughed again  that magician must look funnier than you do it said  where is he now  somewhere in the forest said the cowardly lion  he just jumped into that tall maple tree over there for he can climb like a monkey and fly like an eagle and then he disappeared in the forest  and there was another magician just like him who was his friend added dorothy but they probably quarreled for the wickedest one changed his friend into the form of a goose  what became of the goose asked the cat looking around  he must have gone away to find his friend answered gugu the king but a goose cant travel very fast so we could easily find him if we wanted to  the worst thing of all said the wizard is that my black bag is lost  it disappeared when i was transformed  if i could find it i could easily break these enchantments by means of my magic and we would resume our own forms again  will you help us search for the black bag friend cat  of course replied the glass cat  but i expect the strange magician carried it away with him  if hes a magician he knows you need that bag and perhaps hes afraid of your magic  so hes probably taken the bag with him and you wont see it again unless you find the magician  that sounds reasonable remarked the lamb which was dorothy  those pink brains of yours seem to be working pretty well today  if the glass cat is right said the wizard in a solemn voice theres more trouble ahead of us  that magician is dangerous and if we go near him he may transform us into shapes not as nice as these  i dont see how we could be any worse off growled gugu who was indignant because he was forced to appear in the form of a fat woman  anyway said the cowardly lion our best plan is to find the magician and try to get the black bag from him  we may manage to steal it or perhaps we can argue him into giving it to us  why not find the goose first asked dorothy  the goose will be angry at the magician and he may be able to help us  that isnt a bad idea returned the wizard  come on friends lets find that goose  we will separate and search in different directions and the first to find the goose must bring him here where we will all meet again in an hour     14  the wizard learns the magic word   now the goose was the transformation of old ruggedo who was at one time king of the nomes and he was even more angry at kiki aru than were the others who shapes had been changed  the nome detested anything in the way of a bird because birds lay eggs and eggs are feared by all the nomes more than anything else in the world  a goose is a foolish bird too and ruggedo was dreadfully ashamed of the shape he was forced to wear  and it would make him shudder to reflect that the goose might lay an egg  so the nome was afraid of himself and afraid of everything around him if an egg touched him he could then be destroyed and almost any animal he met in the forest might easily conquer him  and that would be the end of old ruggedo the nome  aside from these fears however he was filled with anger against kiki whom he had meant to trap by cleverly stealing from him the magic word the boy must have been crazy to spoil everything the way he did but ruggedo knew that the arrival of the wizard had scared kiki and he was not sorry the boy had transformed the wizard and dorothy and made them helpless  it was his own transformation that annoyed him and made him indignant so he ran about the forest hunting for kiki so that he might get a better shape and coax the boy to follow his plans to conquer the land of oz  kiki aru hadnt gone very far away for he had surprised himself as well as the others by the quick transformations and was puzzled as to what to do next  ruggedo the nome was overbearing and tricky and kiki knew he was not to be depended on but the nome could plan and plot which the hyup boy was not wise enough to do and so when he looked down through the branches of a tree and saw a goose waddling along below and heard it cry out kiki aru  quackquack  kiki aru the boy answered in a low voice here i am and swung himself down to the lowest limb of the tree  the goose looked up and saw him  youve bungled things in a dreadful way exclaimed the goose  why did you do it  because i wanted to answered kiki  you acted as if i was your slave and i wanted to show these forest people that i am more powerful than you  the goose hissed softly but kiki did not hear that  old ruggedo quickly recovered his wits and muttered to himself this boy is the goose although it is i who wear the gooses shape  i will be gentle with him now and fierce with him when i have him in my power  then he said aloud to kiki  well hereafter i will be content to acknowledge you the master  you bungled things as i said but we can still conquer oz  how asked the boy  first give me back the shape of the limoneag and then we can talk together more conveniently suggested the nome  wait a moment then said kiki and climbed higher up the tree there he whispered the magic word and the goose became a limoneag as he had been before  good said the nome well pleased as kiki joined him by dropping down from the tree  now let us find a quiet place where we can talk without being overheard by the beasts  so the two started away and crossed the forest until they came to a place where the trees were not so tall nor so close together and among these scattered trees was another clearing not so large as the first one where the meeting of the beasts had been held  standing on the edge of this clearing and looking across it they saw the trees on the farther side full of monkeys who were chattering together at a great rate of the sights they had witnessed at the meeting  the old nome whispered to kiki not to enter the clearing or allow the monkeys to see them  why not asked the boy drawing back  because those monkeys are to be our armythe army which will conquer oz said the nome  sit down here with me kiki and keep quiet and i will explain to you my plan  now neither kiki aru nor ruggedo had noticed that a sly fox had followed them all the way from the tree where the goose had been transformed to the limoneag  indeed this fox who was none other than the wizard of oz had witnessed the transformation of the goose and now decided he would keep watch on the conspirators and see what they would do next  a fox can move through a forest very softly without making any noise and so the wizards enemies did not suspect his presence  but when they sat down by the edge of the clearing to talk with their backs toward him the wizard did not know whether to risk being seen by creeping closer to hear what they said or whether it would be better for him to hide himself until they moved on again  while he considered this question he discovered near him a great tree which had a hollow trunk and there was a round hole in this tree about three feet above the ground  the wizard fox decided it would be safer for him to hide inside the hollow tree so he sprang into the hole and crouched down in the hollow so that his eyes just came to the edge of the hole by which he had entered and from here he watched the forms of the two limoneags  this is my plan said the nome to kiki speaking so low that the wizard could only hear the rumble of his voice  since you can transform anything into any form you wish we will transform these monkeys into an army and with that army we will conquer the oz people  the monkeys wont make much of an army objected kiki  we need a great army but not a numerous one responded the nome you will transform each monkey into a giant man dressed in a fine uniform and armed with a sharp sword  there are fifty monkeys over there and fifty giants would make as big an army as we need  what will they do with the swords asked kiki  nothing can kill the oz people  true said ruggedo  the oz people cannot be killed but they can be cut into small pieces and while every piece will still be alive we can scatter the pieces around so that they will be quite helpless therefore the oz people will be afraid of the swords of our army and we will conquer them with ease  that seems like a good idea replied the boy approvingly  and in such a case we need not bother with the other beasts of the forest  no you have frightened the beasts and they would no longer consent to assist us in conquering oz  but those monkeys are foolish creatures and once they are transformed to giants they will do just as we say and obey our commands  can you transform them all at once  no i must take one at a time said kiki  but the fifty transformations can be made in an hour or so  stay here ruggedo and i will change the first monkeythat one at the left on the end of the limbinto a giant with a sword  where are you going asked the nome  i must not speak the magic word in the presence of another person declared kiki who was determined not to allow his treacherous companion to learn his secret so i will go where you cannot hear me  ruggedo the nome was disappointed but he hoped still to catch the boy unawares and surprise the magic word  so he merely nodded his lion head and kiki got up and went back into the forest a short distance here he spied a hollow tree and by chance it was the same hollow tree in which the wizard of oz now in the form of a fox had hidden himself  as kiki ran up to the tree the fox ducked its head so that it was out of sight in the dark hollow beneath the hole and then kiki put his face into the hole and whispered i want that monkey on the branch at the left to become a giant man fifty feet tall dressed in a uniform and with a sharp swordpyrzqxgl  then he ran back to ruggedo but the wizard fox had heard quite plainly every word that he had said  the monkey was instantly transformed into the giant and the giant was so big that as he stood on the ground his head was higher than the trees of the forest  the monkeys raised a great chatter but did not seem to understand that the giant was one of themselves  good cried the nome  hurry kiki and transform the others  so kiki rushed back to the tree and putting his face to the hollow whispered  i want the next monkey to be just like the firstpyrzqxgl  again the wizard fox heard the magic word and just how it was pronounced  but he sat still in the hollow and waited to hear it again so it would be impressed on his mind and he would not forget it  kiki kept running to the edge of the forest and back to the hollow tree again until he had whispered the magic word six times and six monkeys had been changed to six great giants  then the wizard decided he would make an experiment and use the magic word himself  so while kiki was running back to the nome the fox stuck his head out of the hollow and said softly i want that creature who is running to become a hickorynutpyrzqxgl  instantly the limoneag form of kiki aru the hyup disappeared and a small hickorynut rolled upon the ground a moment and then lay still  the wizard was delighted and leaped from the hollow just as ruggedo looked around to see what had become of kiki  the nome saw the fox but no kiki so he hastily rose to his feet  the wizard did not know how powerful the queer beast might be so he resolved to take no chances  i want this creature to become a walnutpyrzqxgl he said aloud but he did not pronounce the magic word in quite the right way and ruggedos form did not change  but the nome knew at once that pyrzqxgl was the magic word so he rushed at the fox and cried  i want you to become a goosepyrzqxgl  but the nome did not pronounce the word aright either having never heard it spoken but once before and then with a wrong accent  so the fox was not transformed but it had to run away to escape being caught by the angry nome  ruggedo now began pronouncing the magic word in every way he could think of hoping to hit the right one and the fox hiding in a bush was somewhat troubled by the fear that he might succeed  however the wizard who was used to magic arts remained calm and soon remembered exactly how kiki aru had pronounced the word  so he repeated the sentence he had before uttered and ruggedo the nome became an ordinary walnut  the wizard now crept out from the bush and said i want my own form againpyrzqxgl  instantly he was the wizard of oz and after picking up the hickorynut and the walnut and carefully placing them in his pocket he ran back to the big clearing  dorothy the lamb uttered a bleat of delight when she saw her old friend restored to his natural shape  the others were all there not having found the goose  the fat gillikin woman the munchkin boy the rabbit and the glass cat crowded around the wizard and asked what had happened  before he explained anything of his adventure he transformed them allexcept of course the glass catinto their natural shapes and when their joy permitted them to quiet somewhat he told how he had by chance surprised the magicians secret and been able to change the two limoneags into shapes that could not speak and therefore would be unable to help themselves  and the little wizard showed his astonished friends the hickorynut and the walnut to prove that he had spoken the truth  butsee hereexclaimed dorothy  what has become of those giant soldiers who used to be monkeys  i forgot all about them admitted the wizard but i suppose they are still standing there in the forest     15  the lonesome duck   trot and capn bill stood before the magic flower actually rooted to the spot  arent you hungry capn asked the little girl with a long sigh for she had been standing there for hours and hours  well replied the sailorman i aint sayin as i couldnt eat trotif a dinner was handybut i guess old folks dont get as hungry as young folks do  im not sure bout that capn bill she said thoughtfully  age might make a diffrence but seems to me size would make a bigger diffrence  seeing youre twice as big as me you ought to be twice as hungry  i hope i am he rejoined for i can stand it a while longer  i do hope the glass cat will hurry and i hope the wizard wont waste time acomin to us  trot sighed again and watched the wonderful magic flower because there was nothing else to do  just now a lovely group of pink peonies budded and bloomed but soon they faded away and a mass of deep blue lilies took their place  then some yellow chrysanthemums blossomed on the plant and when they had opened all their petals and reached perfection they gave way to a lot of white floral balls spotted with crimsona flower trot had never seen before  but i get awful tired watchin flowers an flowers an flowers she said impatiently  theyre might pretty observed capn bill  i know and if a person could come and look at the magic flower just when she felt like it it would be a fine thing but to have to stand and watch it whether you want to or not isnt so much fun  i wish capn bill the thing would grow fruit for a while instead of flowers  scarcely had she spoken when the white balls with crimson spots faded away and a lot of beautiful ripe peaches took their place  with a cry of mingled surprise and delight trot reached out and plucked a peach from the bush and began to eat it finding it delicious  capn bill was somewhat dazed at the girls wish being granted so quickly so before he could pick a peach they had faded away and bananas took their place  grab one capn exclaimed trot and even while eating the peach she seized a banana with her other hand and tore it from the bush  the old sailor was still bewildered  he put out a hand indeed but he was too late for now the bananas disappeared and lemons took their place  pshaw cried trot  you cant eat those things but watch out capn for something else  cocoanuts next appeared but capn bill shook his head  cant crack em he remarked cause we havent anything handy to smash em with  well take one anyhow advised trot but the cocoanuts were gone now and a deep purple pearshaped fruit which was unknown to them took their place  again capn bill hesitated and trot said to him  you ought to have captured a peach and a banana as i did  if youre not careful capn youll miss all your chances  here ill divide my banana with you  even as she spoke the magic plant was covered with big red apples growing on every branch and capn bill hesitated no longer  he grabbed with both hands and picked two apples while trot had only time to secure one before they were gone  its curious remarked the sailor munching his apple how these fruits keep good when youve picked em but dispear inter thin air if theyre left on the bush  the whole thing is curious declared the girl and it couldnt exist in any country but this where magic is so common  those are limes dont pick em for theyd pucker up your mouth andooo here come plums and she tucked her apple in her apron pocket and captured three plumseach one almost as big as an eggbefore they disappeared capn bill got some too but both were too hungry to fast any longer so they began eating their apples and plums and let the magic bush bear all sorts of fruits one after another  the capn stopped once to pick a fine cantaloupe which he held under his arm and trot having finished her plums got a handful of cherries and an orange but when almost every sort of fruit had appeared on the bush the crop ceased and only flowers as before bloomed upon it  i wonder why it changed back mused trot who was not worried because she had enough fruit to satisfy her hunger  well you only wished it would bear fruit for a while said the sailor and it did  praps if youd said forever trot it would have always been fruit  but why should my wish be obeyed asked the girl  im not a fairy or a wizard or any kind of a magicmaker  i guess replied capn bill that this little island is a magic island and any folks on it can tell the bush what to produce an itll produce it  do you think i could wish for anything else capn and get it she inquired anxiously  what are you thinkin of trot  im thinking of wishing that these roots on our feet would disappear and let us free  try it trot  so she tried it and the wish had no effect whatever  try it yourself capn she suggested  then capn bill made the wish to be free with no better result  no said he its no use the wishes only affect the magic plant but im glad we can make it bear fruit cause now we know we wont starve before the wizard gets to us  but im gettn tired standing here so long complained the girl if i could only lift one foot and rest it id feel better  same with me trot  ive noticed that if youve got to do a thing and cant help yourself it gets to be a hardship mighty quick  folks that can raise their feet dont appreciate what a blessing it is said trot thoughtfully  i never knew before what fun it is to raise one foot an then another any time you feel like it  theres lots o things folks dont preciate replied the sailorman if somethin would most stop your breath youd think breathin easy was the finest thing in life  when a persons well he dont realize how jolly it is but when he gets sick he members the time he was well an wishes that time would come back  most folks forget to thank god for givin em two good legs till they lose one o em like i did and then its too late cept to praise god for leavin one  your wooden leg aint so bad capn she remarked looking at it critically  anyhow it dont take root on a magic island like our meat legs do  i aint complainin said capn bill  whats that swimmin towards us trot he added looking over the magic flower and across the water  the girl looked too and then she replied  its a bird of some sort  its like a duck only i never saw a duck have so many colors  the bird swam swiftly and gracefully toward the magic isle and as it drew nearer its gorgeously colored plumage astonished them  the feathers were of many hues of glistening greens and blues and purples and it had a yellow head with a red plume and pink white and violet in its tail  when it reached the isle it came ashore and approached them waddling slowly and turning its head first to one side and then to the other so as to see the girl and the sailor better  youre strangers said the bird coming to a halt near them and youve been caught by the magic isle and made prisoners  yes returned trot with a sigh were rooted  but i hope we wont grow  youll grow small said the bird  youll keep growing smaller every day until bye and bye therell be nothing left of you  thats the usual way on this magic isle  how do you know about it and who are you anyhow asked capn bill  im the lonesome duck replied the bird  i suppose youve heard of me  no said trot i cant say i have  what makes you lonesome  why i havent any family or any relations returned the duck  havent you any friends  not a friend  and ive nothing to do  ive lived a long time and ive got to live forever because i belong in the land of oz where no living thing dies  think of existing year after year with no friends no family and nothing to do  can you wonder im lonesome  why dont you make a few friends and find something to do inquired capn bill  i cant make friends because everyone i meetbird beast or personis disagreeable to me  in a few minutes i shall be unable to bear your society longer and then ill go away and leave you said the lonesome duck  and as for doing anything theres no use in it all i meet are doing something so i have decided its common and uninteresting and i prefer to remain lonesome  dont you have to hunt for your food asked trot  no  in my diamond palace a little way up the river food is magically supplied me but i seldom eat because it is so common  you must be a magician duck remarked capn bill  why so  well ordinary ducks dont have diamond palaces an magic food like you do  true and thats another reason why im lonesome  you must remember im the only duck in the land of oz and im not like any other duck in the outside world  seems to me you like bein lonesome observed capn bill  i cant say i like it exactly replied the duck but since it seems to be my fate im rather proud of it  how do you spose a single solitary duck happened to be in the land of oz asked trot wonderingly  i used to know the reason many years ago but ive quite forgotten it declared the duck  the reason for a thing is never so important as the thing itself so theres no use remembering anything but the fact that im lonesome  i guess youd be happier if you tried to do something asserted trot if you cant do anything for yourself you can do things for others and then youd get lots of friends and stop being lonesome  now youre getting disagreeable said the lonesome duck and i shall have to go and leave you  cant you help us any pleaded the girl  if theres anything magic about you you might get us out of this scrape  i havent any magic strong enough to get you off the magic isle replied the lonesome duck  what magic i possess is very simple but i find it enough for my own needs  if we could only sit down a while we could stand it better said trot but we have nothing to sit on  then you will have to stand it said the lonesome duck  praps youve enough magic to give us a couple of stools suggested capn bill  a duck isnt supposed to know what stools are was the reply  but youre diffrent from all other ducks  that is true  the strange creature seemed to reflect for a moment looking at them sharply from its round black eyes  then it said sometimes when the sun is hot i grow a toadstool to shelter me from its rays  perhaps you could sit on toadstools  well if they were strong enough theyd do answered capn bill  then before i do ill give you a couple said the lonesome duck and began waddling about in a small circle  it went around the circle to the right three times and then it went around to the left three times then it hopped backward three times and forward three times  what are you doing asked trot  dont interrupt  this is an incantation replied the lonesome duck but now it began making a succession of soft noises that sounded like quacks and seemed to mean nothing at all  and it kept up these sounds so long that trot finally exclaimed  cant you hurry up and finish that cantation  if it takes all summer to make a couple of toadstools youre not much of a magician  i told you not to interrupt said the lonesome duck sternly  if you get too disagreeable youll drive me away before i finish this incantation  trot kept quiet after the rebuke and the duck resumed the quacky muttering  capn bill chuckled a little to himself and remarked to trot in a whisper for a bird that aint got anything to do this lonesome duck is makin considerble fuss  an i aint sure after all as toadstools would be worth sittin on  even as he spoke the sailorman felt something touch him from behind and turning his head he found a big toadstool in just the right place and of just the right size to sit upon  there was one behind trot too and with a cry of pleasure the little girl sank back upon it and found it a very comfortable seatsolid yet almost like a cushion even capn bills weight did not break his toadstool down and when both were seated they found that the lonesome duck had waddled away and was now at the waters edge  thank you ever so much cried trot and the sailor called out much obliged  but the lonesome duck paid no attention  without even looking in their direction again the gaudy fowl entered the water and swam gracefully away     16  the glass cat finds the black bag   when the six monkeys were transformed by kiki aru into six giant soldiers fifty feet tall their heads came above the top of the trees which in this part of the forest were not so high as in some other parts and although the trees were somewhat scattered the bodies of the giant soldiers were so big that they quite filled the spaces in which they stood and the branches pressed them on every side  of course kiki was foolish to have made his soldiers so big for now they could not get out of the forest  indeed they could not stir a step but were imprisoned by the trees  even had they been in the little clearing they could not have made their way out of it but they were a little beyond the clearing  at first the other monkeys who had not been enchanted were afraid of the soldiers and hastily quitted the place but soon finding that the great men stood stock still although grunting indignantly at their transformation the band of monkeys returned to the spot and looked at them curiously not guessing that they were really monkeys and their own friends  the soldiers couldnt see them their heads being above the trees they could not even raise their arms or draw their sharp swords so closely were they held by the leafy branches  so the monkeys finding the giants helpless began climbing up their bodies and presently all the band were perched on the shoulders of the giants and peering into their faces  im ebu your father cried one soldier to a monkey who had perched upon his left ear but some cruel person has enchanted me  im your uncle peeker said another soldier to another monkey  so very soon all the monkeys knew the truth and were sorry for their friends and relations and angry at the personwhoever it waswho had transformed them  there was a great chattering among the treetops and the noise attracted other monkeys so that the clearing and all the trees around were full of them  rango the gray ape who was the chief of all the monkey tribes of the forest heard the uproar and came to see what was wrong with his people  and rango being wiser and more experienced at once knew that the strange magician who looked like a mixedup beast was responsible for the transformations  he realized that the six giant soldiers were helpless prisoners because of their size and knew he was powerless to release them  so although he feared to meet the terrible magician he hurried away to the great clearing to tell gugu the king what had happened and to try to find the wizard of oz and get him to save his six enchanted subjects  rango darted into the great clearing just as the wizard had restored all the enchanted ones around him to their proper shapes and the gray ape was glad to hear that the wicked magicianbeast had been conquered  but now o mighty wizard you must come with me to where six of my people are transformed into six great giant men he said for if they are allowed to remain there their happiness and their future lives will be ruined  the wizard did not reply at once for he was thinking this a good opportunity to win rangos consent to his taking some monkeys to the emerald city for ozmas birthday cake  it is a great thing you ask of me o rango the gray ape said he for the bigger the giants are the more powerful their enchantment and the more difficult it will be to restore them to their natural forms however i will think it over  then the wizard went to another part of the clearing and sat on a log and appeared to be in deep thought  the glass cat had been greatly interested in the gray apes story and was curious to see what the giant soldiers looked like  hearing that their heads extended above the treetops the glass cat decided that if it climbed the tall avocado tree that stood at the side of the clearing it might be able to see the giants heads  so without mentioning her errand the crystal creature went to the tree and by sticking her sharp glass claws in the bark easily climbed the tree to its very top and looking over the forest saw the six giant heads although they were now a long way off  it was indeed a remarkable sight for the huge heads had immense soldier caps on them with red and yellow plumes and looked very fierce and terrible although the monkey hearts of the giants were at that moment filled with fear  having satisfied her curiosity the glass cat began to climb down from the tree more slowly  suddenly she discerned the wizards black bag hanging from a limb of the tree  she grasped the black bag in her glass teeth and although it was rather heavy for so small an animal managed to get it free and to carry it safely down to the ground  then she looked around for the wizard and seeing him seated upon the stump she hid the black bag among some leaves and then went over to where the wizard sat  i forgot to tell you said the glass cat that trot and capn bill are in trouble and i came here to hunt you up and get you to go and rescue them  good gracious cat  why didnt you tell me before exclaimed the wizard  for the reason that i found so much excitement here that i forgot trot and capn bill  whats wrong with them asked the wizard  then the glass cat explained how they had gone to get the magic flower for ozmas birthday gift and had been trapped by the magic of the queer island  the wizard was really alarmed but he shook his head and said sadly  im afraid i cant help my dear friends because ive lost my black bag  if i find it will you go to them asked the creature  of course replied the wizard  but i do not think that a glass cat with nothing but pink brains can succeed when all the rest of us have failed  dont you admire my pink brains demanded the cat  theyre pretty admitted the wizard but theyre not regular brains you know and so we dont expect them to amount to much  but if i find your black bagand find it inside of five minuteswill you admit my pink brains are better than your common human brains  well ill admit theyre better hunters said the wizard reluctantly but you cant do it  weve searched everywhere and the black bag isnt to be found  that shows how much you know retorted the glass cat scornfully watch my brains a minute and see them whirl around  the wizard watched for he was anxious to regain his black bag and the pink brains really did whirl around in a remarkable manner  now come with me commanded the glass cat and led the wizard straight to the spot where it had covered the bag with leaves according to my brains said the creature your black bag ought to be here  then it scratched at the leaves and uncovered the bag which the wizard promptly seized with a cry of delight  now that he had regained his magic tools he felt confident he could rescue trot and capn bill  rango the gray ape was getting impatient  he now approached the wizard and said  well what do you intend to do about those poor enchanted monkeys  ill make a bargain with you rango replied the little man  if you will let me take a dozen of your monkeys to the emerald city and keep them until after ozmas birthday ill break the enchantment of the six giant soldiers and return them to their natural forms  but the gray ape shook his head  i cant do it he declared  the monkeys would be very lonesome and unhappy in the emerald city and your people would tease them and throw stones at them which would cause them to fight and bite  the people wont see them till ozmas birthday dinner promised the wizard  ill make them very smallabout four inches high and ill keep them in a pretty cage in my own room where they will be safe from harm  ill feed them the nicest kind of food train them to do some clever tricks and on ozmas birthday ill hide the twelve little monkeys inside a cake  when ozma cuts the cake the monkeys will jump out on to the table and do their tricks  the next day i will bring them back to the forest and make them big as ever and theyll have some exciting stories to tell their friends  what do you say rango  i say no answered the gray ape  i wont have my monkeys enchanted and made to do tricks for the oz people  very well said the wizard calmly then ill go  come dorothy he called to the little girl lets start on our journey  arent you going to save those six monkeys who are giant soldiers asked rango anxiously  why should i returned the wizard  if you will not do me the favor i ask you cannot expect me to favor you  wait a minute said the gray ape  ive changed my mind  if you will treat the twelve monkeys nicely and bring them safely back to the forest ill let you take them  thank you replied the wizard cheerfully  well go at once and save those giant soldiers  so all the party left the clearing and proceeded to the place where the giants still stood among the trees  hundreds of monkeys apes baboons and orangoutangs had gathered round and their wild chatter could be heard a mile away  but the gray ape soon hushed the babel of sounds and the wizard lost no time in breaking the enchantments  first one and then another giant soldier disappeared and became an ordinary monkey again and the six were shortly returned to their friends in their proper forms  this action made the wizard very popular with the great army of monkeys and when the gray ape announced that the wizard wanted to borrow twelve monkeys to take to the emerald city for a couple of weeks and asked for volunteers nearly a hundred offered to go so great was their confidence in the little man who had saved their comrades  the wizard selected a dozen that  seemed intelligent and goodtempered and then he opened his black bag and took out a queerly shaped dish that was silver on the outside and gold on the inside  into this dish he poured a powder and set fire to it  it made a thick smoke that quite enveloped the twelve monkeys as well as the form of the wizard but when the smoke cleared away the dish had been changed to a golden cage with silver bars and the twelve monkeys had become about three inches high and were all seated comfortably inside the cage  the thousands of hairy animals who had witnessed this act of magic were much astonished and applauded the wizard by barking aloud and shaking the limbs of the trees in which they sat  dorothy said that was a fine trick wizard and the gray ape remarked you are certainly the most wonderful magician in all the land of oz  oh no modestly replied the little man  glindas magic is better than mine but mine seems good enough to use on ordinary occasions and now rango we will say goodbye and i promise to return your monkeys as happy and safe as they are now  the wizard rode on the back of the hungry tiger and carried the cage of monkeys very carefully so as not to joggle them  dorothy rode on the back of the cowardly lion and the glass cat trotted as before to show them the way  gugu the king crouched upon a log and watched them go but as he bade them farewell the enormous leopard said  i know now that you are the friends of beasts and that the forest people may trust you  whenever the wizard of oz and princess dorothy enter the forest of gugu hereafter they will be as welcome and as safe with us as ever they are in the emerald city     17  a remarkable journey   you see explained the glass cat that magic isle where trot and capn bill are stuck is also in this gillikin countryover at the east side of it and its no farther to go acrosslots from here than it is from here to the emerald city  so well save time by cutting across the mountains  are you sure you know the way asked dorothy  i know all the land of oz better than any other living creature knows it asserted the glass cat  go ahead then and guide us said the wizard  weve left our poor friends helpless too long already and the sooner we rescue them the happier theyll be  are you sure you can get em out of their fix the little girl inquired  ive no doubt of it the wizard assured her  but i cant tell what sort of magic i must use until i get to the place and discover just how they are enchanted  ive heard of that magic isle where the wonderful flower grows remarked the cowardly lion  long ago when i used to live in the forests the beasts told stories about the isle and how the magic flower was placed there to entrap strangersmen or beasts  is the flower really wonderful questioned dorothy  i have heard it is the most beautiful plant in the world answered the lion  i have never seen it myself but friendly beasts have told me that they have stood on the shore of the river and looked across at the plant in the gold flowerpot and seen hundreds of flowers of all sorts and sizes blossom upon it in quick succession  it is said that if one picks the flowers while they are in bloom they will remain perfect for a long time but if they are not picked they soon disappear and are replaced by other flowers  that in my opinion make the magic plant the most wonderful in existence  but these are only stories said the girl  has any of your friends ever picked a flower from the wonderful plant  no admitted the cowardly lion for if any living thing ventures upon the magic isle where the golden flowerpot stands that man or beast takes root in the soil and cannot get away again  what happens to them then asked dorothy  they grow smaller hour by hour and day by day and finally disappear entirely  then said the girl anxiously we must hurry up or capn bill an trot will get too small to be comftable  they were proceeding at a rapid pace during this conversation for the hungry tiger and the cowardly lion were obliged to move swiftly in order to keep pace with the glass cat  after leaving the forest of gugu they crossed a mountain range and then a broad plain after which they reached another forest much smaller than that where gugu ruled  the magic isle is in this forest said the glass cat but the river is at the other side of the forest  there is no path through the trees but if we keep going east we will find the river and then it will be easy to find the magic isle  have you ever traveled this way before inquired the wizard  not exactly admitted the cat but i know we shall reach the river if we go east through the forest  lead on then said the wizard  the glass cat started away and at first it was easy to pass between the trees but before long the underbrush and vines became thick and tangled and after pushing their way through these obstacles for a time our travelers came to a place where even the glass cat could not push through  wed better go back and find a path suggested the hungry tiger  im sprised at you said dorothy eyeing the glass cat severely  im surprised myself replied the cat  but its a long way around the forest to where the river enters it and i thought we could save time by going straight through  no one can blame you said the wizard and i think instead of turning back i can make a path that will allow us to proceed  he opened his black bag and after searching among his magic tools drew out a small axe made of some metal so highly polished that it glittered brightly even in the dark forest  the wizard laid the little axe on the ground and said in a commanding voice    chop little axe chop clean and true   a path for our feet you must quickly hew   chop till this tangle of jungle is passed   chop to the east little axechop fast   then the little axe began to move and flashed its bright blade right and left clearing a way through vine and brush and scattering the tangled barrier so quickly that the lion and the tiger carrying dorothy and the wizard and the cage of monkeys on their backs were able to stride through the forest at a fast walk  the brush seemed to melt away before them and the little axe chopped so fast that their eyes only saw a twinkling of the blade  then suddenly the forest was open again and the little axe having obeyed its orders lay still upon the ground  the wizard picked up the magic axe and after carefully wiping it with his silk handkerchief put it away in his black bag  then they went on and in a short time reached the river  let me see said the glass cat looking up and down the stream i think we are below the magic isle so we must go up the stream until we come to it  so up the stream they traveled walking comfortably on the river bank and after a while the water broadened and a sharp bend appeared in the river hiding all below from their view  they walked briskly along however and had nearly reached the bend when a voice cried warningly look out  the travelers halted abruptly and the wizard said look out for what  you almost stepped on my diamond palace replied the voice and a duck with gorgeously colored feathers appeared before them  beasts and men are terribly clumsy continued the duck in an irritated tone and youve no business on this side of the river anyway  what are you doing here  weve come to rescue some friends of ours who are stuck fast on the magic isle in this river explained dorothy  i know em said the duck  ive been to see em and theyre stuck fast all right  you may as well go back home for no power can save them  this is the wonderful wizard of oz said dorothy pointing to the little man  well im the lonesome duck was the reply as the fowl strutted up and down to show its feathers to best advantage  im the great forest magician as any beast can tell you but even i have no power to destroy the dreadful charm of the magic isle  are you lonesome because youre a magician inquired dorothy  no im lonesome because i have no family and no friends  but i like to be lonesome so please dont offer to be friendly with me  go away and try not to step on my diamond palace  where is it asked the girl  behind this bush  dorothy hopped off the lions back and ran around the bush to see the diamond palace of the lonesome duck although the gaudy fowl protested in a series of low quacks  the girl found indeed a glistening dome formed of clearest diamonds neatly cemented together with a doorway at the side just big enough to admit the duck  where did you find so many diamonds asked dorothy wonderingly  i know a place in the mountains where they are thick as pebbles said the lonesome duck and i brought them here in my bill one by one and put them in the river and let the water run over them until they were brightly polished  then i built this palace and im positive its the only diamond palace in all the world  its the only one i know of said the little girl but if you live in it all alone i dont see why its any better than a wooden palace or one of bricks or cobblestones  youre not supposed to understand that retorted the lonesome duck but i might tell you as a matter of education that a home of any sort should be beautiful to those who live in it and should not be intended to please strangers  the diamond palace is my home and i like it  so i dont care a quack whether you like it or not  oh but i do exclaimed dorothy  its lovely on the outside but then she stopped speaking for the lonesome duck had entered his palace through the little door without even saying goodbye  so dorothy returned to her friends and they resumed their journey  do you think wizard the duck was right in saying no magic can rescue trot and capn bill asked the girl in a worried tone of voice  no i dont think the lonesome duck was right in saying that answered the wizard gravely but it is possible that their enchantment will be harder to overcome than i expected  ill do my best of course and no one can do more than his best  that didnt entirely relieve dorothys anxiety but she said nothing more and soon on turning the bend in the river they came in sight of the magic isle  there they are exclaimed dorothy eagerly  yes i see them replied the wizard nodding  they are sitting on two big toadstools  thats queer remarked the glass cat  there were no toadstools there when i left them  what a lovely flower cried dorothy in rapture as her gaze fell on the magic plant  never mind the flower just now advised the wizard  the most important thing is to rescue our friends  by this time they had arrived at a place just opposite the magic isle and now both trot and capn bill saw the arrival of their friends and called to them for help  how are you shouted the wizard putting his hands to his mouth so they could hear him better across the water  were in hard luck shouted capn bill in reply  were anchored here and cant move till you find a way to cut the hawser  what does he mean by that asked dorothy  we cant move our feet a bit called trot speaking as loud as she could  why not inquired dorothy  theyve got roots on em explained trot  it was hard to talk from so great a distance so the wizard said to the glass cat  go to the island and tell our friends to be patient for we have come to save them  it may take a little time to release them for the magic of the isle is new to me and i shall have to experiment  but tell them ill hurry as fast as i can  so the glass cat walked across the river under the water to tell trot and capn bill not to worry and the wizard at once opened his black bag and began to make his preparations     18  the magic of the wizard   he first set up a small silver tripod and placed a gold basin at the top of it  into this basin he put two powdersa pink one and a skyblue oneand poured over them a yellow liquid from a crystal vial then he mumbled some magic words and the powders began to sizzle and burn and send out a cloud of violet smoke that floated across the river and completely enveloped both trot and capn bill as well as the toadstools on which they sat and even the magic plant in the gold flowerpot  then after the smoke had disappeared into air the wizard called out to the prisoners  are you free  both trot and capn bill tried to move their feet and failed  no they shouted in answer  the wizard rubbed his bald head thoughtfully and then took some other magic tools from the bag  first he placed a little black ball in a silver pistol and shot it toward the magic isle  the ball exploded just over the head of trot and scattered a thousand sparks over the little girl  oh said the wizard i guess that will set her free  but trots feet were still rooted in the ground of the magic isle and the disappointed wizard had to try something else  for almost an hour he worked hard using almost every magic tool in his black bag and still capn bill and trot were not rescued  dear me exclaimed dorothy im fraid well have to go to glinda after all  that made the little wizard blush for it shamed him to think that his magic was not equal to that of the magic isle  i wont give up yet dorothy he said for i know a lot of wizardry that i havent yet tried  i dont know what magician enchanted this little island or what his powers were but i do know that i can break any enchantment known to the ordinary witches and magicians that used to inhabit the land of oz  its like unlocking a door all you need is to find the right key  but spose you havent the right key with you suggested dorothy what then  then well have to make the key he answered  the glass cat now came back to their side of the river walking under the water and said to the wizard theyre getting frightened over there on the island because theyre both growing smaller every minute just now when i left them both trot and capn bill were only about half their natural sizes  i think said the wizard reflectively that id better go to the shore of the island where i can talk to them and work to better advantage  how did trot and capn bill get to the island  on a raft answered the glass cat  its over there now on the beach  i suppose youre not strong enough to bring the raft to this side are you  no i couldnt move it an inch said the cat  ill try to get it for you volunteered the cowardly lion  im dreadfully scared for fear the magic isle will capture me too but ill try to get the raft and bring it to this side for you  thank you my friend said the wizard  so the lion plunged into the river and swam with powerful strokes across to where the raft was beached upon the island  placing one paw on the raft he turned and struck out with his other three legs and so strong was the great beast that he managed to drag the raft from off the beach and propel it slowly to where the wizard stood on the river bank  good exclaimed the little man well pleased  may i go across with you asked dorothy  the wizard hesitated  if youll take care not to leave the raft or step foot on the island youll be quite safe he decided  so the wizard told the hungry tiger and the cowardly lion to guard the cage of monkeys until he returned and then he and dorothy got upon the raft  the paddle which capn bill had made was still there so the little wizard paddled the clumsy raft across the water and ran it upon the beach of the magic isle as close to the place where capn bill and trot were rooted as he could  dorothy was shocked to see how small the prisoners had become and trot said to her friends if you cant save us soon therell be nothing left of us  be patient my dear counseled the wizard and took the little axe from his black bag  what are you going to do with that asked capn bill  its a magic axe replied the wizard and when i tell it to chop it will chop those roots from your feet and you can run to the raft before they grow again  dont shouted the sailor in alarm  dont do it  those roots are all flesh roots and our bodies are feeding em while theyre growing into the ground  to cut off the roots said trot would be like cutting off our fingers and toes  the wizard put the little axe back in the black bag and took out a pair of silver pincers  growgrowgrow he said to the pincers and at once they grew and extended until they reached from the raft to the prisoners  what are you going to do now demanded capn bill fearfully eyeing the pincers  this magic tool will pull you up roots and all and land you on this raft declared the wizard  dont do it pleaded the sailor with a shudder  it would hurt us awfully  it would be just like pulling teeth to pull us up by the roots explained trot  grow small said the wizard to the pincers and at once they became small and he threw them into the black bag  i guess friends its all up with us this time remarked capn bill with a dismal sigh  please tell ozma dorothy said trot that we got into trouble trying to get her a nice birthday present  then shell forgive us the magic flower is lovely and wonderful but its just a lure to catch folks on this dreadful island and then destroy them  youll have a nice birthday party without us im sure and i hope dorothy that none of you in the emerald city will forget meor dear ol capn bill     19  dorothy and the bumble bees   dorothy was greatly distressed and had hard work to keep the tears from her eyes  is that all you can do wizard she asked the little man  its all i can think of just now he replied sadly  but i intend to keep on thinking as longas longwell as long as thinking will do any good  they were all silent for a time dorothy and the wizard sitting thoughtfully on the raft and trot and capn bill sitting thoughtfully on the toadstools and growing gradually smaller and smaller in size  suddenly dorothy said wizard ive thought of something  what have you thought of he asked looking at the little girl with interest  can you remember the magic word that transforms people she asked  of course said he  then you can transform trot and capn bill into birds or bumblebees and they can fly away to the other shore  when theyre there you can transform em into their reglar shapes again  can you do that wizard asked capn bill eagerly  i think so  roots an all inquired trot  why the roots are now a part of you and if you were transformed to a bumblebee the whole of you would be transformed of course and youd be free of this awful island  all right do it cried the sailorman  so the wizard said slowly and distinctly  i want trot and capn bill to become bumblebeespyrzqxgl  fortunately he pronounced the magic word in the right way and instantly trot and capn bill vanished from view and up from the places where they had been flew two bumblebees  hooray shouted dorothy in delight theyre saved  i guess they are agreed the wizard equally delighted  the bees hovered over the raft an instant and then flew across the river to where the lion and the tiger waited  the wizard picked up the paddle and paddled the raft across as fast as he could  when it reached the river bank both dorothy and the wizard leaped ashore and the little man asked excitedly  where are the bees  the bees inquired the lion who was half asleep and did not know what had happened on the magic isle  yes there were two of them  two bees said the hungry tiger yawning  why i ate one of them and the cowardly lion ate the other  goodness gracious cried dorothy horrified  it was little enough for our lunch remarked the tiger but the bees were the only things we could find  how dreadful wailed dorothy wringing her hands in despair  youve eaten trot and capn bill  but just then she heard a buzzing overhead and two bees alighted on her shoulder  here we are said a small voice in her ear  im trot dorothy  and im capn bill said the other bee  dorothy almost fainted with relief and the wizard who was close by and had heard the tiny voices gave a laugh and said  you are not the only two bees in the forest it seems but i advise you to keep away from the lion and the tiger until you regain your proper forms  do it now wizard advised dorothy  theyre so small that you never can tell what might happen to em  so the wizard gave the command and pronounced the magic word and in the instant trot and capn bill stood beside them as natural as before they had met their fearful adventure  for they were no longer small in size because the wizard had transformed them from bumblebees into the shapes and sizes that nature had formerly given them  the ugly roots on their feet had disappeared with the transformation  while dorothy was hugging trot and trot was softly crying because she was so happy the wizard shook hands with capn bill and congratulated him on his escape  the old sailorman was so pleased that he also shook the lions paw and took off his hat and bowed politely to the cage of monkeys  then capn bill did a curious thing  he went to a big tree and taking out his knife cut away a big broad piece of thick bark  then he sat down on the ground and after taking a roll of stout cord from his pocketwhich seemed to be full of all sorts of thingshe proceeded to bind the flat piece of bark to the bottom of his good foot over the leather sole  whats that for inquired the wizard  i hate to be stumped replied the sailorman so im goin back to that island  and get enchanted again exclaimed trot with evident disapproval  no this time ill dodge the magic of the island  i noticed that my wooden leg didnt get stuck or take root an neither did the glass feet of the glass cat  its only a thing thats made of meatlike man an beaststhat the magic can hold an root to the ground  our shoes are leather an leather comes from a beasts hide  our stockins are wool an wool comes from a sheeps back  so when we walked on the magic isle our feet took root there an held us fast  but not my wooden leg  so now ill put a wooden bottom on my other foot an the magic cant stop me  but why do you wish to go back to the island asked dorothy  didnt you see the magic flower in the gold flowerpot returned capn bill  of course i saw it and its lovely and wonderful  well trot an i set out to get the magic plant for a present to ozma on her birthday and i mean to get it an take it back with us to the emerald city  that would be fine cried trot eagerly if you think you can do it and it would be safe to try  im pretty sure it is safe the way ive fixed my foot said the sailor an if i should happen to get caught i spose the wizard could save me again  i suppose i could agreed the wizard  anyhow if you wish to try it capn bill go ahead and well stand by and watch what happens  so the sailorman got upon the raft again and paddled over to the magic isle landing as close to the golden flowerpot as he could  they watched him walk across the land put both arms around the flowerpot and lift it easily from its place  then he carried it to the raft and set it down very gently  the removal did not seem to affect the magic flower in any way for it was growing daffodils when capn bill picked it up and on the way to the raft it grew tulips and gladioli  during the time the sailor was paddling across the river to where his friends awaited him seven different varieties of flowers bloomed in succession on the plant  i guess the magician who put it on the island never thought that any one would carry it off said dorothy  he figured that only men would want the plant and any man who went upon the island to get it would be caught by the enchantment added the wizard  after this remarked trot no one will care to go on the island so it wont be a trap any more  there exclaimed capn bill setting down the magic plant in triumph upon the river bank if ozma gets a better birthday present than that id like to know what it can be  itll sprise her all right declared dorothy standing in awed wonder before the gorgeous blossoms and watching them change from yellow roses to violets  itll sprise evrybody in the emrald city trot asserted in glee and itll be ozmas present from capn bill and me  i think i ought to have a little credit objected the glass cat  i discovered the thing and led you to it and brought the wizard here to save you when you got caught  thats true admitted trot and ill tell ozma the whole story so shell know how good youve been     20  the monkeys have trouble   now said the wizard we must start for home  but how are we going to carry that big gold flowerpot  capn bill cant lug it all the way thats certain  no acknowledged the sailorman its pretty heavy  i could carry it for a little while but id have to stop to rest every few minutes  couldnt we put it on your back dorothy asked the cowardly lion with a goodnatured yawn  i dont object to carrying it if you can fasten it on answered the lion  if it falls off said trot it might get smashed an be ruined  ill fix it promised capn bill  ill make a flat board out of one of these tree trunks an tie the board on the lions back an set the flowerpot on the board  he set to work at once to do this but as he only had his big knife for a tool his progress was slow  so the wizard took from his black bag a tiny saw that shone like silver and said to it    saw little saw come show your power   make us a board for the magic flower   and at once the little saw began to move and it sawed the log so fast that those who watched it work were astonished  it seemed to understand too just what the board was to be used for for when it was completed it was flat on top and hollowed beneath in such a manner that it exactly fitted the lions back  that beats whittlin exclaimed capn bill admiringly  you dont happen to have two o them saws do you wizard  no replied the wizard wiping the magic saw carefully with his silk handkerchief and putting it back in the black bag  its the only saw of its kind in the world and if there were more like it it wouldnt be so wonderful  they now tied the board on the lions back flat side up and capn bill carefully placed the magic flower on the board  for fear o accidents he said ill walk beside the lion and hold onto the flowerpot  trot and dorothy could both ride on the back of the hungry tiger and between them they carried the cage of monkeys  but this arrangement left the wizard as well as the sailor to make the journey on foot and so the procession moved slowly and the glass cat grumbled because it would take so long to get to the emerald city  the cat was sourtempered and grumpy at first but before they had journeyed far the crystal creature had discovered a fine amusement the long tails of the monkeys were constantly sticking through the bars of their cage and when they did the glass cat would slyly seize the tails in her paws and pull them  that made the monkeys scream and their screams pleased the glass cat immensely  trot and dorothy tried to stop this naughty amusement but when they were not looking the cat would pull the tails again and the creature was so sly and quick that the monkeys could seldom escape  they scolded the cat angrily and shook the bars of their cage but they could not get out and the cat only laughed at them  after the party had left the forest and were on the plains of the munchkin country it grew dark and they were obliged to make camp for the night choosing a pretty place beside a brook  by means of his magic the wizard created three tents pitched in a row on the grass and nicely fitted with all that was needful for the comfort of his comrades  the middle tent was for dorothy and trot and had in it two cosy white beds and two chairs  another tent also with beds and chairs was for the wizard and capn bill while the third tent was for the hungry tiger the cowardly lion the cage of monkeys and the glass cat  outside the tents the wizard made a fire and placed over it a magic kettle from which he presently drew all sorts of nice things for their supper smoking hot  after they had eaten and talked together for a while under the twinkling stars they all went to bed and the people were soon asleep the lion and the tiger had almost fallen asleep too when they were roused by the screams of the monkeys for the glass cat was pulling their tails again  annoyed by the uproar the hungry tiger cried stop that racket and getting sight of the glass cat he raised his big paw and struck at the creature  the cat was quick enough to dodge the blow but the claws of the hungry tiger scraped the monkeys cage and bent two of the bars  then the tiger lay down again to sleep but the monkeys soon discovered that the bending of the bars would allow them to squeeze through  they did not leave the cage however but after whispering together they let their tails stick out and all remained quiet  presently the glass cat stole near the cage again and gave a yank to one of the tails instantly the monkeys leaped through the bars one after another and although they were so small the entire dozen of them surrounded the glass cat and clung to her claws and tail and ears and made her a prisoner  then they forced her out of the tent and down to the banks of the stream  the monkeys had noticed that these banks were covered with thick slimy mud of a dark blue color and when they had taken the cat to the stream they smeared this mud all over the glass body of the cat filling the creatures ears and eyes with it so that she could neither see nor hear  she was no longer transparent and so thick was the mud upon her that no one could see her pink brains or her ruby heart  in this condition they led the pussy back to the tent and then got inside their cage again  by morning the mud had dried hard on the glass cat and it was a dull blue color throughout  dorothy and trot were horrified but the wizard shook his head and said it served the glass cat right for teasing the monkeys  capn bill with his strong hands soon bent the golden wires of the monkeys cage into the proper position and then he asked the wizard if he should wash the glass cat in the water of the brook  not just yet answered the wizard  the cat deserves to be punished so i think ill leave that blue mudwhich is as bad as paintupon her body until she gets to the emerald city  the silly creature is so vain that she will be greatly shamed when the oz people see her in this condition and perhaps shell take the lesson to heart and leave the monkeys alone hereafter  however the glass cat could not see or hear and to avoid carrying her on the journey the wizard picked the mud out of her eyes and ears and dorothy dampened her handkerchief and washed both the eyes and ears clean  as soon as she could speak the glass cat asked indignantly arent you going to punish those monkeys for playing such a trick on me  no answered the wizard  you played a trick on them by pulling their tails so this is only titfortat and im glad the monkeys had their revenge  he wouldnt allow the glass cat to go near the water to wash herself but made her follow them when they resumed their journey toward the emerald city  this is only part of your punishment said the wizard severely ozma will laugh at you when we get to her palace and so will the scarecrow and the tin woodman and tiktok and the shaggy man and buttonbright and the patchwork girl and  and the pink kitten added dorothy  that suggestion hurt the glass cat more than anything else  the pink kitten always quarreled with the glass cat and insisted that flesh was superior to glass while the glass cat would jeer at the pink kitten because it had no pink brains  but the pink brains were all daubed with blue mud just now and if the pink kitten should see the glass cat in such a condition it would be dreadfully humiliating  for several hours the glass cat walked along very meekly but toward noon it seized an opportunity when no one was looking and darted away through the long grass  it remembered that there was a tiny lake of pure water near by and to this lake the cat sped as fast as it could go  the others never missed her until they stopped for lunch and then it was too late to hunt for her  i spect shes gone somewhere to clean herself said dorothy  never mind replied the wizard  perhaps this glass creature has been punished enough and we must not forget she saved both trot and capn bill  after first leading em onto an enchanted island added dorothy but i think as you do that the glass cat is punished enough and praps she wont try to pull the monkeys tails again  the glass cat did not rejoin the party of travelers  she was still resentful and they moved too slowly to suit her besides  when they arrived at the royal palace one of the first things they saw was the glass cat curled up on a bench as bright and clean and transparent as ever  but she pretended not to notice them and they passed her by without remark     21  the college of athletic arts   dorothy and her friends arrived at the royal palace at an opportune time for ozma was holding high court in her throne room where professor h m wogglebug te was appealing to her to punish some of the students of the royal athletic college of which he was the principal  this college is located in the munchkin country but not far from the emerald city  to enable the students to devote their entire time to athletic exercises such as boating football and the like professor wogglebug had invented an assortment of tablets of learning  one of these tablets eaten by a scholar after breakfast would instantly enable him to understand arithmetic or algebra or any other branch of mathematics  another tablet eaten after lunch gave a student a complete knowledge of geography  another tablet made it possible for the eater to spell the most difficult words and still another enabled him to write a beautiful hand  there were tablets for history mechanics home cooking and agriculture and it mattered not whether a boy or a girl was stupid or bright for the tablets taught them everything in the twinkling of an eye  this method which is patented in the land of oz by professor wogglebug saves paper and books as well as the tedious hours devoted to study in some of our less favored schools and it also allows the students to devote all their time to racing baseball tennis and other manly and womanly sports which are greatly interfered with by study in those temples of learning where tablets of learning are unknown  but it so happened that professor wogglebug who had invented so much that he had acquired the habit carelessly invented a squaremeal tablet which was no bigger than your little fingernail but contained in condensed form the equal of a bowl of soup a portion of fried fish a roast a salad and a dessert all of which gave the same nourishment as a square meal  the professor was so proud of these squaremeal tablets that he began to feed them to the students at his college instead of other food but the boys and girls objected because they wanted food that they could enjoy the taste of  it was no fun at all to swallow a tablet with a glass of water and call it a dinner so they refused to eat the squaremeal tablets  professor wogglebug insisted and the result was that the senior class seized the learned professor one day and threw him into the riverclothes and all  everyone knows that a wogglebug cannot swim and so the inventor of the wonderful squaremeal tablets lay helpless on the bottom of the river for three days before a fisherman caught one of his legs on a fishhook and dragged him out upon the bank  the learned professor was naturally indignant at such treatment and so he brought the entire senior class to the emerald city and appealed to ozma of oz to punish them for their rebellion  i do not suppose the girl ruler was very severe with the rebellious boys and girls because she had herself refused to eat the squaremeal tablets in place of food but while she was listening to the interesting case in her throne room capn bill managed to carry the golden flowerpot containing the magic flower up to trots room without it being seen by anyone except jellia jamb ozmas chief maid of honor and jellia promised not to tell  also the wizard was able to carry the cage of monkeys up to one of the top towers of the palace where he had a room of his own to which no one came unless invited  so trot and dorothy and capn bill and the wizard were all delighted at the successful end of their adventure the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger went to the marble stables behind the royal palace where they lived while at home and they too kept the secret even refusing to tell the wooden sawhorse and hank the mule and the yellow hen and the pink kitten where they had been  trot watered the magic flower every day and allowed no one in her room to see the beautiful blossoms except her friends betsy bobbin and dorothy  the wonderful plant did not seem to lose any of its magic by being removed from its island and trot was sure that ozma would prize it as one of her most delightful treasures  up in his tower the little wizard of oz began training his twelve tiny monkeys and the little creatures were so intelligent that they learned every trick the wizard tried to teach them  the wizard treated them with great kindness and gentleness and gave them the food that monkeys love best so they promised to do their best on the great occasion of ozmas birthday     22  ozmas birthday party   it seems odd that a fairy should have a birthday for fairies they say were born at the beginning of time and live forever  yet on the other hand it would be a shame to deprive a fairy who has so many other good things of the delights of a birthday  so we need not wonder that the fairies keep their birthdays just as other folks do and consider them occasions for feasting and rejoicing  ozma the beautiful girl ruler of the fairyland of oz was a real fairy and so sweet and gentle in caring for her people that she was greatly beloved by them all  she lived in the most magnificent palace in the most magnificent city in the world but that did not prevent her from being the friend of the most humble person in her dominions  she would mount her wooden sawhorse and ride out to a farm house and sit in the kitchen to talk with the good wife of the farmer while she did her family baking or she would play with the children and give them rides on her famous wooden steed or she would stop in a forest to speak to a charcoal burner and ask if he was happy or desired anything to make him more content or she would teach young girls how to sew and plan pretty dresses or enter the shops where the jewelers and craftsmen were busy and watch them at their work giving to each and all a cheering word or sunny smile  and then ozma would sit in her jeweled throne with her chosen courtiers all about her and listen patiently to any complaint brought to her by her subjects striving to accord equal justice to all knowing she was fair in her decisions the oz people never murmured at her judgments but agreed if ozma decided against them she was right and they wrong  when dorothy and trot and betsy bobbin and ozma were together one would think they were all about of an age and the fairy ruler no older and no more grown up than the other three  she would laugh and romp with them in regular girlish fashion yet there was an air of quiet dignity about ozma even in her merriest moods that in a manner distinguished her from the others  the three girls loved her devotedly but they were never able to quite forget that ozma was the royal ruler of the wonderful fairyland of oz and by birth belonged to a powerful race  ozmas palace stood in the center of a delightful and extensive garden where splendid trees and flowering shrubs and statuary and fountains abounded  one could walk for hours in this fascinating park and see something interesting at every step  in one place was an aquarium where strange and beautiful fish swam at another spot all the birds of the air gathered daily to a great feast which ozmas servants provided for them and were so fearless of harm that they would alight upon ones shoulders and eat from ones hand  there was also the fountain of the water of oblivion but it was dangerous to drink of this water because it made one forget everything he had ever before known even to his own name and therefore ozma had placed a sign of warning upon the fountain  but there were also fountains that were delightfully perfumed and fountains of delicious nectar cool and richly flavored where all were welcome to refresh themselves  around the palace grounds was a great wall thickly encrusted with glittering emeralds but the gates stood open and no one was forbidden entrance  on holidays the people of the emerald city often took their children to see the wonders of ozmas gardens and even entered the royal palace if they felt so inclined for they knew that they and their ruler were friends and that ozma delighted to give them pleasure  when all this is considered you will not be surprised that the people throughout the land of oz as well as ozmas most intimate friends and her royal courtiers were eager to celebrate her birthday and made preparations for the festival weeks in advance  all the brass bands practiced their nicest tunes for they were to march in the numerous processions to be made in the winkie country the gillikin country the munchkin country and the quadling country as well as in the emerald city  not all the people could go to congratulate their ruler but all could celebrate her birthday in one way or another however far distant from her palace they might be  every home and building throughout the land of oz was to be decorated with banners and bunting and there were to be games and plays and a general good time for every one  it was ozmas custom on her birthday to give a grand feast at the palace to which all her closest friends were invited  it was a queerly assorted company indeed for there are more quaint and unusual characters in oz than in all the rest of the world and ozma was more interested in unusual people than in ordinary onesjust as you and i are  on this especial birthday of the lovely girl ruler a long table was set in the royal banquet hall of the palace at which were placecards for the invited guests and at one end of the great room was a smaller table not so high for ozmas animal friends whom she never forgot and at the other end was a big table where all of the birthday gifts were to be arranged  when the guests arrived they placed their gifts on this table and then found their places at the banquet table  and after the guests were all placed the animals entered in a solemn procession and were placed at their table by jellia jamb  then while an orchestra hidden by a bank of roses and ferns played a march composed for the occasion the royal ozma entered the banquet hall attended by her maids of honor and took her seat at the head of the table  she was greeted by a cheer from all the assembled company the animals adding their roars and growls and barks and mewing and cackling to swell the glad tumult and then all seated themselves at their tables  at ozmas right sat the famous scarecrow of oz whose strawstuffed body was not beautiful but whose happy nature and shrewd wit had made him a general favorite  on the left of the ruler was placed the tin woodman whose metal body had been brightly polished for this event the tin woodman was the emperor of the winkie country and one of the most important persons in oz  next to the scarecrow dorothy was seated and next to her was tiktok the clockwork man who had been wound up as tightly as his clockwork would permit so he wouldnt interrupt the festivities by running down then came aunt em and uncle henry dorothys own relations two kindly old people who had a cozy home in the emerald city and were very happy and contented there  then betsy bobbin was seated and next to her the droll and delightful shaggy man who was a favorite wherever he went  on the other side of the table opposite the tin woodman was placed trot and next to her capn bill  then was seated buttonbright and ojo the lucky and dr pipt and his good wife margalot and the astonishing frogman who had come from the yip country to be present at ozmas birthday feast  at the foot of the table facing ozma was seated the queenly glinda the good sorceress of oz for this was really the place of honor next to the head of the table where ozma herself sat  on glindas right was the little wizard of oz who owed to glinda all of the magical arts he knew  then came jinjur a pretty girl farmer of whom ozma and dorothy were quite fond  the adjoining seat was occupied by the tin soldier and next to him was professor h m  wogglebug te of the royal athletic college  on glindas left was placed the jolly patchwork girl who was a little afraid of the sorceress and so was likely to behave herself pretty well  the shaggy mans brother was beside the patchwork girl and then came that interesting personage jack pumpkinhead who had grown a splendid big pumpkin for a new head to be worn on ozmas birthday and had carved a face on it that was even jollier in expression than the one he had last worn  new heads were not unusual with jack for the pumpkins did not keep long and when the seedswhich served him as brainsbegan to get soft and mushy he realized his head would soon spoil and so he procured a new one from his great field of pumpkinsgrown by him so that he need never lack a head  you will have noticed that the company at ozmas banquet table was somewhat mixed but every one invited was a tried and trusted friend of the girl ruler and their presence made her quite happy  no sooner had ozma seated herself with her back to the birthday table than she noticed that all present were eyeing with curiosity and pleasure something behind her for the gorgeous magic flower was blooming gloriously and the mammoth blossoms that quickly succeeded one another on the plant were beautiful to view and filled the entire room with their delicate fragrance  ozma wanted to look too to see what all were staring at but she controlled her curiosity because it was not proper that she should yet view her birthday gifts  so the sweet and lovely ruler devoted herself to her guests several of whom such as the scarecrow the tin woodman the patchwork girl tiktok jack pumpkinhead and the tin soldier never ate anything but sat very politely in their places and tried to entertain those of the guests who did eat  and at the animal table there was another interesting group consisting of the cowardly lion the hungry tiger totodorothys little shaggy black doghank the mule the pink kitten the wooden sawhorse the yellow hen and the glass cat  all of these had good appetites except the sawhorse and the glass cat and each was given a plentiful supply of the food it liked best  finally when the banquet was nearly over and the icecream was to be served four servants entered bearing a huge cake all frosted and decorated with candy flowers  around the edge of the cake was a row of lighted candles and in the center were raised candy letters that spelled the words            ozmas        birthday cake            from   dorothy and the wizard   oh how beautiful cried ozma greatly delighted and dorothy said eagerly now you must cut the cake ozma and each of us will eat a piece with our icecream  jellia jamb brought a large golden knife with a jeweled handle and ozma stood up in her place and attempted to cut the cake  but as soon as the frosting in the center broke under the pressure of the knife there leaped from the cake a tiny monkey three inches high and he was followed by another and another until twelve monkeys stood on the tablecloth and bowed low to ozma  congratulations to our gracious ruler they exclaimed in a chorus and then they began a dance so droll and amusing that all the company roared with laughter and even ozma joined in the merriment  but after the dance the monkeys performed some wonderful acrobatic feats and then they ran to the hollow of the cake and took out some band instruments of burnished goldcornets horns drums and the likeand forming into a procession the monkeys marched up and down the table playing a jolly tune with the ease of skilled musicians  dorothy was delighted with the success of her surprise cake and after the monkeys had finished their performance the banquet came to an end  now was the time for ozma to see her other presents so glinda the good rose and taking the girl ruler by her hand led her to the table where all her gifts were placed in magnificent array  the magic flower of course attracted her attention first and trot had to tell her the whole story of their adventures in getting it  the little girl did not forget to give due credit to the glass cat and the little wizard but it was really capn bill who had bravely carried the golden flowerpot away from the enchanted isle  ozma thanked them all and said she would place the magic flower in her boudoir where she might enjoy its beauty and fragrance continually but now she discovered the marvelous gown woven by glinda and her maidens from strands drawn from pure emeralds and being a girl who loved pretty clothes ozmas ecstasy at being presented with this exquisite gown may well be imagined  she could hardly wait to put it on but the table was loaded with other pretty gifts and the night was far spent before the happy girl ruler had examined all her presents and thanked those who had lovingly donated them     23  the fountain of oblivion   the morning after the birthday fete as the wizard and dorothy were walking in the grounds of the palace ozma came out and joined them saying  i want to hear more of your adventures in the forest of gugu and how you were able to get those dear little monkeys to use in dorothys surprise cake  so they sat down on a marble bench near to the fountain of the water of oblivion and between them dorothy and the wizard related their adventures  i was dreadfully fussy while i was a woolly lamb said dorothy for it didnt feel good a bit  and i wasnt quite sure you know that id ever get to be a girl again  you might have been a woolly lamb yet if i hadnt happened to have discovered that magic transformation word declared the wizard  but what became of the walnut and the hickorynut into which you transformed those dreadful beast magicians inquired ozma  why id almost forgotten them was the reply but i believe they are still here in my pocket  then he searched in his pockets and brought out the two nuts and showed them to her  ozma regarded them thoughtfully  it isnt right to leave any living creatures in such helpless forms said she  i think wizard you ought to transform them into their natural shapes again  but i dont know what their natural shapes are he objected for of course the forms of mixed animals which they had assumed were not natural to them  and you must not forget ozma that their natures were cruel and mischievous so if i bring them back to life they might cause us a great deal of trouble  nevertheless said the ruler of oz we must free them from their present enchantments  when you restore them to their natural forms we will discover who they really are and surely we need not fear any two people even though they prove to be magicians and our enemies  i am not so sure of that protested the wizard with a shake of his bald head  the one bit of magic i robbed them ofwhich was the word of transformationis so simple yet so powerful that neither glinda nor i can equal it  it isnt all in the word you know its the way the word is pronounced  so if the two strange magicians have other magic of the same sort they might prove very dangerous to us if we liberated them  ive an idea exclaimed dorothy  im no wizard and no fairy but if you do as i say we neednt fear these people at all  what is your thought my dear asked ozma  well replied the girl here is this fountain of the water of oblivion and thats what put the notion into my head  when the wizard speaks that terble word that will change em back to their real forms he can make em dreadful thirsty too and well put a cup right here by the fountain so itll be handy  then theyll drink the water and forget all the magic they ever knewand everything else too  thats not a bad idea said the wizard looking at dorothy approvingly  its a very good idea declared ozma  run for a cup dorothy  so dorothy ran to get a cup and while she was gone the wizard said  i dont know whether the real forms of these magicians are those of men or beasts  if theyre beasts they would not drink from a cup but might attack us at once and drink afterward  so it might be safer for us to have the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger here to protect us if necessary  ozma drew out a silver whistle which was attached to a slender gold chain and blew upon the whistle two shrill blasts  the sound though not harsh was very penetrating and as soon as it reached the ears of the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger the two huge beasts quickly came bounding toward them  ozma explained to them what the wizard was about to do and told them to keep quiet unless danger threatened  so the two powerful guardians of the ruler of oz crouched beside the fountain and waited  dorothy returned and set the cup on the edge of the fountain  then the wizard placed the hickorynut beside the fountain and said in a solemn voice  i want you to resume your natural form and to be very thirstypyrzqxgl  in an instant there appeared in the place of the hickorynut the form of kiki aru the hyup boy  he seemed bewildered at first as if trying to remember what had happened to him and why he was in this strange place  but he was facing the fountain and the bubbling water reminded him that he was thirsty  without noticing ozma the wizard and dorothy who were behind him he picked up the cup filled it with the water of oblivion and drank it to the last drop  he was now no longer thirsty but he felt more bewildered than ever for now he could remember nothing at allnot even his name or where he came from  he looked around the beautiful garden with a pleased expression and then turning he beheld ozma and the wizard and dorothy regarding him curiously and the two great beasts crouching behind them  kiki aru did not know who they were but he thought ozma very lovely and dorothy very pleasant  so he smiled at themthe same innocent happy smile that a baby might have indulged in and that pleased dorothy who seized his hand and led him to a seat beside her on the bench  why i thought you were a dreadful magician she exclaimed and youre only a boy  what is a magician he asked and what is a boy  dont you know inquired the girl  kiki shook his head  then he laughed  i do not seem to know anything he replied  its very curious remarked the wizard  he wears the dress of the munchkins so he must have lived at one time in the munchkin country of course the boy can tell us nothing of his history or his family for he has forgotten all that he ever knew  he seems a nice boy now that all the wickedness has gone from him said ozma  so we will keep him here with us and teach him our waysto be true and considerate of others  why in that case its lucky for him he drank the water of oblivion said dorothy  it is indeed agreed the wizard  but the remarkable thing to me is how such a young boy ever learned the secret of the magic word of transformation  perhaps his companion who is at present this walnut was the real magician although i seem to remember that it was this boy in the beasts form who whispered the magic word into the hollow tree where i overheard it  well we will soon know who the other is suggested ozma  he may prove to be another munchkin boy  the wizard placed the walnut near the fountain and said as slowly and solemnly as before  i want you to resume your natural form and to be very thirstypyrzqxgl  then the walnut disappeared and ruggedo the nome stood in its place he also was facing the fountain and he reached for the cup filled it and was about to drink when dorothy exclaimed  why its the old nome king  ruggedo swung around and faced them the cup still in his hand  yes he said in an angry voice its the old nome king and im going to conquer all oz and be revenged on you for kicking me out of my throne  he looked around a moment and then continued there isnt an egg in sight and im stronger than all of you people put together i dont know how i came here but im going to fight the fight of my lifeand ill win  his long white hair and beard waved in the breeze his eyes flashed hate and vengeance and so astonished and shocked were they by the sudden appearance of this old enemy of the oz people that they could only stare at him in silence and shrink away from his wild glare  ruggedo laughed  he drank the water threw the cup on the ground and said fiercely  and nowand nowand  his voice grew gentle  he rubbed his forehead with a puzzled air and stroked his long beard  what was i going to say he asked pleadingly  dont you remember said the wizard  no ive forgotten  who are you asked dorothy  he tried to think  iim sure i dont know he stammered  dont you know who we are either questioned the girl  i havent the slightest idea said the nome  tell us who this munchkin boy is suggested ozma  ruggedo looked at the boy and shook his head  hes a stranger to me  you are all strangers  iim a stranger to myself he said  then he patted the lions head and murmured good doggie and the lion growled indignantly  what shall we do with him asked the wizard perplexed  once before the wicked old nome came here to conquer us and then as now he drank of the water of oblivion and became harmless  but we sent him back to the nome kingdom where he soon learned the old evil ways again  for that reason said ozma we must find a place for him in the land of oz and keep him here  for here he can learn no evil and will always be as innocent of guile as our own people  and so the wandering exking of the nomes found a new home a peaceful and happy home where he was quite content and passed his days in innocent enjoyment
