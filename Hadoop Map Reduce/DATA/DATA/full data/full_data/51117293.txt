though to ear em talk of saving when theyre at sea and there isnt a pub within a thousand miles of em you might think different  illustration sailormen are not good ands at saving money as a rule  it aint for the want of trying either with some of em and ive known men do all sorts o things as soon as they was paid off with a view to saving  i knew one man as used to keep all but a shilling or two in a belt next to is skin so that he couldnt get at it easy but it was all no good  he was always running short in the most inconvenient places ive seen im wriggle for five minutes right off with a tramcar conductor standing over im and the other people in the tram reading their papers with one eye and watching him with the other  ginger dick and peter russettwo men ive spoke of to you aforetried to save their money once  theyd got so sick and tired of spending it all in praps a week or ten days arter coming ashore and aving to go to sea agin sooner than they ad intended that they determined some way or other to ave things different  they was homeward bound on a steamer from melbourne when they made their minds up and isaac lunn the oldest fireman aboarda very steady old teetotalergave them a lot of good advice about it  they all wanted to rejoin the ship when she sailed agin and e offered to take a room ashore with them and mind their money giving em what e called a moderate amount each day  they would ha laughed at any other man but they knew that old isaac was as honest as could be and that their money would be safe with im and at last after a lot of palaver they wrote out a paper saying as they were willing for im to ave their money and give it to em bit by bit till they went to sea agin  anybody but ginger dick and peter russet or a fool would ha known better than to do such a thing but old isaac ad got such a oily tongue and seemed so fairminded about wot e called moderate drinking that they never thought wot they was letting themselves in for and when they took their payclose on sixteen pounds eachthey put the odd change in their pockets and anded the rest over to him  the first day they was as pleased as punch  old isaac got a nice respectable bedroom for them all and arter theyd ad a few drinks they humoured im by aving a nice ot cup o tea and then goin off with im to see a magiclantern performance  it was called the drunkards downfall and it begun with a young man going into a nicelooking pub and being served by a nicelooking barmaid with a glass of ale  then it got on to arf pints and pints in the next picture and arter ginger ad seen the lost young man put away six pints in about arf a minute e got such a raging thirst on im that e couldnt sit still and e whispered to peter russet to go out with im  youll lose the best of it if you go now ses old isaac in a whisper in the next picture theres little frogs and devils sitting on the edge of the pot as e goes to drink  ginger dick got up and nodded to peter  arter that e kills is mother with a razor ses old isaac pleading with im and olding on to is coat  ginger dick sat down agin and when the murder was over e said it made im feel faint and im and peter russet went out for a breath of fresh air  they ad three at the first place and then they moved on to another and forgot all about isaac and the dissolving views until ten oclock when ginger who ad been very liberal to some friends ed made in a pub found ed spent is last penny  this comes o listening to a parcel o teetotalers e ses very cross when e found that peter ad spent all is money too  here we are just beginning the evening and not a farthing in our pockets  they went off ome in a very bad temper  old isaac was asleep in is bed and when they woke im up and said that they was going to take charge of their money themselves e kept dropping off to sleep agin and snoring that ard they could scarcely hear themselves speak  then peter tipped ginger a wink and pointed to isaacs trousers which were anging over the foot of the bed  ginger dick smiled and took em up softly and peter russet smiled too but e wasnt best pleased to see old isaac asmiling in is sleep as though e was aving amusing dreams  all ginger found was a hapenny a bunch o keys and a cough lozenge  in the coat and waistcoat e found a few tracks folded up a broken penknife a ball of string and some other rubbish  then e set down on the foot o their bed and made eyes over at peter  wake im up agin ses peter in a temper  ginger dick got up and leaning over the bed took old isaac by the shoulders and shook im as if ed been a bottle o medicine  time to get up lads  ses old isaac putting one leg out o bed  no it aint ses ginger very rough we aint been to bed yet  we want our money back  isaac drew is leg back into bed agin  goo night he ses and fell fast asleep  hes shamming thats wot e is ses peter russet  lets look for it it must be in the room somewhere  they turned the room upside down pretty near and then ginger dick struck a match and looked up the chimney but all e found was that it adnt been swept for about twenty years and wot with temper and soot e looked so frightful that peter was arf afraid of im  ive ad enough of this ses ginger running up to the bed and olding his sooty fist under old isaacs nose  now then wheres that money if you dont give us our money our ardearned money inside o two minutes ill break every bone in your body  this is wot comes o trying to do you a favour ginger ses the old man reproachfully  dont talk to me ses ginger cos i wont have it  come on where is it  old isaac looked at im and then he gave a sigh and got up and put on is boots and is trousers  i thought i should ave a little trouble with you he ses slowly but i was prepared for that  youll ave more if you dont hurry up ses ginger glaring at im  we dont want to urt you isaac ses peter russet we ony want our money  i know that ses isaac you keep still peter and see fairplay and ill knock you silly arterwards  he pushed some o the things into a corner and then e spat on is ands and began to prance up and down and duck is ead about and hit the air in a way that surprised em  i aint hit a man for five years e ses still dancing up and down fightings sinful except in a good causebut afore i got a new art ginger id lick three men like you afore breakfast just to git up a appetite  illustration i aint hit a man for five years e ses still dancing up and down  look ere ses ginger youre an old man and i dont want to urt you tell us where our money is our ardearned money and i wont lay a finger on you  im taking care of it for you ses the old man  ginger dick gave a howl and rushed at him and the next moment isaacs fist shot out and give im a drive that sent im spinning across the room until e fell in a heap in the fireplace  it was like a kick from a orse and peter looked very serious as e picked im up and dusted im down  you should keep your eye on is fist he ses sharply  it was a silly thing to say seeing that that was just wot ad appened and ginger told im wot ed do for im when ed finished with isaac he went at the old man agin but e never ad a chance and in about three minutes e was very glad to let peter elp im into bed  its your turn to fight him now peter he ses  just move this piller so as i can see  come on lad ses the old man  peter shook is ead  i have no wish to urt you isaac he ses kindly excitement like fighting is dangerous for an old man  give us our money and well say no more about it  no my lads ses isaac  ive undertook to take charge o this money and im going to do it and i ope that when we all sign on aboard the planet therell be a matter o twelve pounds each left  now i dont want to be arsh with you but im going back to bed and if i ave to get up and dress agin youll wish yourselves dead  he went back to bed agin and peter taking no notice of ginger dick who kept calling im a coward got into bed alongside of ginger and fell fast asleep  they all ad breakfast in a coffeeshop next morning and arter it was over ginger who adnt spoke a word till then said that e and peter russet wanted a little money to go on with  he said they preferred to get their meals alone as isaacs face took their appetite away  very good ses the old man  i dont want to force my company on nobody and after thinking ard for a minute or two he put is and in is trouserpocket and gave them eighteenpence each  illustration wots this for ses ginger  wots this for  ses ginger staring at the money  matches  thats your days allowance ses isaac and its plenty  theres ninepence for your dinner fourpence for your tea and twopence for a crust o bread and cheese for supper  and if you must go and drown yourselves in beer that leaves threepence each to go and do it with  ginger tried to speak to im but is feelings was too much for im and e couldnt  then peter russet swallered something e was going to say and asked old isaac very perlite to make it a quid for im because he was going down to colchester to see is mother and e didnt want to go emptyanded  youre a good son peter ses old isaac and i wish there was more like you  ill come down with you if you like ive got nothing to do  peter said it was very kind of im but ed sooner go alone owing to his mother being very shy afore strangers  well ill come down to the station and take a ticket for you ses isaac  then peter lost is temper altogether and banged is fist on the table and smashed arf the crockery  he asked isaac whether e thought im and ginger dick was a couple o children and e said if e didnt give em all their money right away ed give im in charge to the first policeman they met  im afraid you didnt intend for to go and see your mother peter ses the old man  look ere ses peter are you going to give us that money  not if you went down on your bended knees ses the old man  very good says peter getting up and walking outside then come along o me to find a policeman  im agreeable ses isaac but ive got the paper you signed  peter said e didnt care twopence if ed got fifty papers and they walked along looking for a policeman which was a very unusual thing for them to do  i ope for your sakes it wont be the same policeman that you and ginger dick set on in gun alley the night afore you shipped on the planet ses isaac pursing up is lips  taint likely to be ses peter beginning to wish e adnt been so free with is tongue  still if i tell im i dessay hell soon find im ses isaac theres one coming along now peter shall i stop im  peter russet looked at im and then he looked at ginger and they walked by grinding their teeth  they stuck to isaac all day trying to get their money out of im and the names they called im was a surprise even to themselves  and at night they turned the room topsyturvy agin looking for their money and ad more unpleasantness when they wanted isaac to get up and let em search the bed  they ad breakfast together agin next morning and ginger tried another tack  he spoke quite nice to isaac and ad three large cups o tea to show im ow e was beginning to like it and when the old man gave em their eighteenpences e smiled and said ed like a few shillings extra that day  itll be all right isaac he ses  i wouldnt ave a drink if you asked me to  dont seem to care for it now  i was saying so to you ony last night wasnt i peter  you was ses peter so was i  then ive done you good ginger ses isaac clapping im on the back  you ave ses ginger speaking between his teeth and i thank you for it  i dont want drink but i thought o going to a musicall this evening  going to wot ses old isaac drawing imself up and looking very shocked  a musicall ses ginger trying to keep is temper  a musicall ses isaac why its worse than a pub ginger  i should be a very poor friend o yours if i let you go therei couldnt think of it  wots it got to do with you you graywhiskered serpent  screams ginger arf mad with rage  why dont you leave us alone  why dont you mind your own business  its our money  isaac tried to talk to im but e wouldnt listen and he made such a fuss that at last the coffeeshop keeper told im to go outside  peter follered im out and being very upset they went and spent their days allowance in the first hour and then they walked about the streets quarrelling as to the death theyd like old isaac to ave when is time came  they went back to their lodgings at dinnertime but there was no sign of the old man and being ungry and thirsty they took all their spare clothes to a pawnbroker and got enough money to go on with  just to show their independence they went to two musicails and with a sort of idea that they was doing isaac a bad turn they spent every farthing afore they got ome and sat up in bed telling im about the spree theyd ad  at five oclock in the morning peter woke up and saw to is surprise that ginger dick was dressed and carefully folding up old isaacs clothes  at first e thought that ginger ad gone mad taking care of the old mans things like that but afore e could speak ginger noticed that e was awake and stepped over to im and whispered to im to dress without making a noise  peter did as e was told and more puzzled than ever saw ginger make up all the old mans clothes in a bundle and creep out of the room on tiptoe  going to ide is clothes e ses  yes ses ginger leading the way downstairs in a pawnshop  well make the old man pay for todays amusements  then peter see the joke and e begun to laugh so ard that ginger ad to threaten to knock is head off to quiet im  ginger laughed imself when they got outside and at last arter walking about till the shops opened they got into a pawnbrokers and put old isaacs clothes up for fifteen shillings  illustration they put old isaacs clothes up for fifteen shillings  first thing they did was to ave a good breakfast and after that they came out smiling all over and began to spend a appy day  ginger was in tiptop spirits and so was peter and the idea that old isaac was in bed while they was drinking is clothes pleased them more than anything twice that evening policemen spoke to ginger for dancing on the pavement and by the time the money was spent it took peter all is time to get im ome  old isaac was in bed when they got there and the temper e was in was shocking but ginger sat on is bed and smiled at im as if e was saying compliments to im  wheres my clothes  ses the old man shaking is fist at the two of em  ginger smiled at im then e shut is eyes and dropped off to sleep  wheres my clothes ses isaac turning to peter  closhe ses peter staring at im  where are they  ses isaac  it was a long time afore peter could understand wot e meant but as soon as e did e started to look for em  drink takes people in different ways and the way it always took peter was to make im one o the most obliging men that ever lived  he spent arf the night crawling about on all fours looking for the clothes and four or five times old isaac woke up from dreams of earthquakes to find peter ad got jammed under is bed and was wondering what ad appened to im  none of em was in the best o tempers when they woke up next morning and ginger ad ardly got is eyes open before isaac was asking im about is clothes agin  dont bother me about your clothes ses ginger talk about something else for a change  where are they  ses isaac sitting on the edge of is bed  ginger yawned and felt in is waistcoat pocketfor neither of em ad undressedand then e took the pawnticket out and threw it on the floor  isaac picked it up and then e began to dance about the room as if ed gone mad  do you mean to tell me youve pawned my clothes he shouts  me and peter did ses ginger sitting up in bed and getting ready for a row  isaac dropped on the bed agin all of a cap  and wot am i to do he ses  if you beave yourself ses ginger and give us our money me and peterll go and get em out agin  when weve ad breakfast that is theres no hurry  but i avent got the money ses isaac it was all sewn up in the lining of the coat  ive ony got about five shillings  youve made a nice mess of it ginger you ave  youre a silly fool ginger thats wot you are ses peter  sewn up in the lining of the coat  ses ginger staring  the banknotes was ses isaac and three pounds in gold idden in the cap  did you pawn that too  ginger got up in is excitement and walked up and down the room  we must go and get em out at once he ses  and wheres the money to do it with  ses peter  ginger adnt thought of that and it struck im all of a heap  none of em seemed to be able to think of a way of getting the other ten shillings wot was wanted and ginger was so upset that e took no notice of the things peter kept saying to im  lets go and ask to see em and say we left a railwayticket in the pocket ses peter  isaac shook is ead  theres ony one way to do it he ses  we shall ave to pawn your clothes ginger to get mine out with  thats the ony way ginger ses peter brightening up  now wots the good o carrying on like that  its no worse for you to be without your clothes for a little while than it was for pore old isaac  it took em quite arf an hour afore they could get ginger to see it first of all e wanted peters clothes to be took instead of is and when peter pointed out that they was too shabby to fetch ten shillings e ad a lot o nasty things to say about wearing such old rags and at last in a terrible temper e took is clothes off and pitched em in a eap on the floor  if you aint back in arf an hour peter e ses scowling at im youll ear from me i can tell you  dont you worry about that ses isaac with a smile  im going to take em  you ses ginger but you cant  you aint got no clothes  im going to wear peters ses isaac with a smile  peter asked im to listen to reason but it was all no good  hed got the pawnticket and at last peter forgetting all hed said to ginger dick about using bad langwidge took is clothes off one by one and dashed em on the floor and told isaac some of the things e thought of im  the old man didnt take any notice of im  he dressed imself up very slow and careful in peters clothes and then e drove em nearly crazy by wasting time making is bed  be as quick as you can isaac ses ginger at last think of us two asitting ere waiting for you  i shant forget it ses isaac and e came back to the door after ed gone arfway down the stairs to ask em not to go out on the drink while e was away  it was nine oclock when he went and at hapast nine ginger began to get impatient and wondered wot ad appened to im and when ten oclock came and no isaac they was both leaning out of the winder with blankets over their shoulders looking up the road  by eleven oclock peter was in very low spirits and ginger was so mad e was afraid to speak to im  they spent the rest o that day anging out of the winder but it was not till hapast four in the afternoon that isaac still wearing peters clothes and carrying a couple of large green plants under is arm turned into the road and from the way e was smiling they thought it must be all right  wot ave you been such a long time for  ses ginger in a low fierce voice as isaac stopped underneath the winder and nodded up to em  i met a old friend ses isaac  met a old friend  ses ginger in a passion  wot dye mean wasting time like that while we was sitting up ere waiting and starving  i adnt seen im for years ses isaac and time slipped away afore i noticed it  i dessay ses ginger in a bitter voice  well is the money all right  i dont know ses isaac i aint got the clothes  wot  ses ginger nearly falling out of the winder  well wot ave you done with mine then  where are they  come upstairs  i wont come upstairs ginger ses isaac because im not quite sure whether ive done right  but im not used to going into pawnshops and i walked about trying to make up my mind to go in and couldnt  well wot did you do then  ses ginger ardly able to contain hisself  while i was trying to make up my mind ses old isaac i see a man with a barrer of lovely plants  e wasnt asking money for em only old clothes  old clothes ses ginger in a voice as if e was being suffocated  i thought theyd be a bit o green for you to look at ses the old man olding the plants up theres no knowing ow long youll be up there the big one is yours ginger and the other is for peter  ave you gone mad isaac  ses peter in a trembling voice arter ginger ad tried to speak and couldnt  isaac shook is ead and smiled up at em and then arter telling peter to put gingers blanket a little more round is shoulders for fear e should catch cold e said ed ask the landlady to send em up some bread and butter and a cup o tea  they eard im talking to the landlady at the door and then e went off in a hurry without looking behind im and the landlady walked up and down on the other side of the road with er apron stuffed in er mouth pretending to be looking at er chimneypots  isaac didnt turn up at all that night and by next morning those two unfortunate men see ow theyd been done  it was quite plain to them that isaac ad been deceiving them and peter was pretty certain that e took the money out of the bed while e was fussing about making it  old isaac kept em there for three days sending em in their clothes bit by bit and two shillings a day to live on but they didnt set eyes on im agin until they all signed on aboard the planet and they didnt set eyes on their money until they was two miles below gravesend  illustration old isaac kept em there for three days
