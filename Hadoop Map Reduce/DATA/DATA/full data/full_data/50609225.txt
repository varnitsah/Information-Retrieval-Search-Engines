50609225	the zeppelins passenger  by e phillips oppenheim     chapter i   never heard a sound the younger of the afternoon callers admitted getting rid of his empty cup and leaning forward in his low chair no more tea thank you miss fairclough done splendidly thanks no i went to bed last night soon after eleventhe colonel had been route marching us all off our legsand i never awoke until reveille this morning sleep of the just and all that sort of thing but a jolly sell all the same you hear anything of it sir he asked turning to his companion who was seated a few feet away  captain griffiths shook his head he was a man considerably older than his questioner with long nervous face and thick black hair streaked with grey his fingers were bony his complexion for a soldier curiously sallow and notwithstanding his height which was considerable he was awkward at times almost uncouth his voice was hard and unsympathetic and his contributions to the teatable talk had been almost negligible  i was up until two oclock as it happened he replied but i knew nothing about the matter until it was brought to my notice officially  helen fairclough who was doing the honours for lady cranston her absent hostess assumed the slight air of superiority to which the circumstances of the case entitled her  i heard it distinctly she declared in fact it woke me up i hung out of the window and i could hear the engine just as plainly as though it were over the golf links  the young subaltern sighed  rotten luck i have with these things he confided thats three times theyve been over and ive neither heard nor seen one this time they say that it had the narrowest shave on earth of coming down of course youve heard of the observation car found on dutchmans common this morning  the girl assented  did you see it she enquired  not a chance was the gloomy reply it was put on two covered trucks and sent up to london by the first train captain griffiths can tell you what it was like i dare say you were down there werent you sir  i superintended its removal the latter informed them it was a very uninteresting affair  any bombs in it helen asked  not a sign of one just a hard seat two sets of fieldglasses and a telephone it seems to have got caught in some trees and been dragged off  how exciting the girl murmured i suppose there wasnt any one in it  griffiths shook his head  i believe he explained that these observation cars although they are attached to most of the zeppelins are seldom used in night raids  i should like to have seen it all the same helen confessed  you would have been disappointed her informant assured her bytheby he added a little awkwardly are you not expecting lady cranston back this evening  i am expecting her every moment the car has gone down to the station to meet her  captain griffiths appeared to receive the news with a certain undemonstrative satisfaction he leaned back in his chair with the air of one who is content to wait  have you heard miss fairclough his younger companion enquired a little diffidently whether lady cranston had any luck in town  helen fairclough looked away there was a slight mist before her eyes  i had a letter this morning she replied she seems to have heard nothing at all encouraging so far  and you havent heard from major felstead himself i suppose  the girl shook her head  not a line she sighed its two months now since we last had a letter  jolly bad luck to get nipped just as he was doing so well the young man observed sympathetically  it all seems very cruel helen agreed he wasnt really fit to go back but the board passed him because they were so short of officers and he kept worrying them he was so afraid hed get moved to another battalion then he was taken prisoner in that horrible pervais affair and sent to the worst camp in germany since then of course philippa and i have had a wretched time worrying  major felstead is lady cranstons only brother is he not griffiths enquired  and my only fiancé she replied with a little grimace however dont let us talk about our troubles any more she continued with an effort at a lighter tone youll find some cigarettes on that table mr harrison i cant think where nora is i expect she has persuaded some one to take her out trophyhunting to dutchmans common  the road all the way is like a circus the young soldier observed and there isnt a thing to be seen when you get there the naval airmen were all over the place at daybreak and captain griffiths wasnt far behind them you didnt leave much for the sightseers sir he concluded turning to his neighbour  as commandant of the place captain griffiths replied i naturally had to have the common searched with the exception of the observation car however i think that i am betraying no confidences in telling you that we discovered nothing of interest  do you suppose that the zeppelin was in difficulties as she was flying so low helen enquired  it is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis the commandant assented two patrol boats were sent out early this morning in search of her an old man whom i saw at waburne declares that she passed like a long black cloud just over his head and that he was almost deafened by the noise of the engines personally i cannot believe that they would come down so low unless she was in some trouble  the door of the comfortable library in which they were seated was suddenly thrown open an exceedingly alertlooking young lady very much befreckled and as yet unemancipated from the long plaits of the schoolroom came in like a whirlwind in her hand she carried a mans homburg hat which she waved aloft in triumph  come in arthur she shouted to a young subaltern who was hovering in the background look what ive got helen a trophy just look mr harrison and captain griffiths i found it in a bush not twenty yards from where the observation car came down  helen turned the hat around in amused bewilderment  but my dear child she exclaimed this is nothing but an ordinary hat people who travel in zeppelins dont wear things like that how do you do mr somerfield she added smiling at the young man who had followed nora into the room  dont they the latter retorted with an air of superior knowledge just look here  she turned down the lining and showed it to them what do you make of that she asked triumphantly  helen gazed at the goldprinted letters a little incredulously  read it out nora insisted  helen obeyed                 schmidt                     berlin                          unter den linden 127  that sounds german she admitted  its a trophy all right nora declared one of the crewprobably the commandermust have come on board in a hurry and changed into uniform after they had started  it is my painful duty miss nora harrison announced solemnly to inform you on behalf of captain griffiths that all articles of whatsoever description found in the vicinity of dutchmans common which might possibly have belonged to any one in the zeppelin must be sent at once to the war office  rubbish nora scoffed the war office arent going to have my hat  duty the young man began  you can go back to the depot and do your duty then mr harrison nora interrupted but youre not going to have my hat id throw it into the fire sooner than give it up  military regulations must be obeyed miss nora captain griffiths ventured thoughtfully  nothing so important as hats harrison put in you see they fitsomebody  the girls gesture was irreverent but convincing id listen to anything captain griffiths had to say she declared but you boys who are learning to be soldiers are simply eaten up with conceit theres nothing in your textbook about hats if youre going to make yourselves disagreeable about this i shall simply ignore the regiment  the two young men fell into attitudes of mock dismay nora took a chocolate from a box  be merciful miss nora harrison pleaded tearfully  dont break the regiment up altogether somerfield begged with a little catch in his voice  all very well for you two to be funny nora went on revisiting the chocolate box but youve heard about the seaforths coming havent you i adore kilts and so does helen dont you helen  every woman does helen admitted smiling i suppose the child really can keep the hat cant she she added turning to the commandant  officially the matter is outside my cognizance he declared i shall have nothing to say  the two young men exchanged glances  a hat somerfield ruminated especially a homburg hat is scarcely an appurtenance of warfare  his brother officer stood for a moment looking gravely at the object in question then he winked at somerfield and sighed  i shall take the whole responsibility he decided magnanimously of saying nothing about the matter we cant afford to quarrel with miss nora can we somerfield  not on your life that young man agreed  sensible boys nora pronounced graciously  thank you very much captain griffiths for not encouraging them in their folly you can take me as far as the postoffice when you go arthur she continued turning to the fortunate possessor of the sidecar and well have some golf tomorrow afternoon if you like  wont mr somerfield have some tea helen invited  thank you very much miss fairclough the man replied we had tea some time ago at watsons where i found miss nora  nora suddenly held up her finger isnt that the car she asked why it must be mummy here already yes i can hear her voice  griffiths who had moved eagerly towards the window looked back  it is lady cranston he announced solemnly    chapter ii   the woman who paused for a moment upon the threshold of the library looking in upon the little company was undeniably beautiful she had masses of redgold hair a little disordered by her long railway journey deepset hazel eyes a delicate almost porcelainlike complexion and a sensitive delightfully shaped mouth her figure was small and dainty and just at that moment she had an appearance of helplessness which was almost childlike nora after a vigorous embrace led her stepmother towards a chair  come and sit by the fire mummy she begged you look tired and cold  philippa exchanged a general salutation with her guests she was still wearing her travelling coat and her air of fatigue was unmistakable griffiths who had not taken his eyes off her since her entrance wheeled an easychair towards the hearthrug into which she sank with a murmured word of thanks  youll have some tea wont you dear helen enquired  philippa shook her head her eyes met her friends for a momentit was only a very brief glance but the tragedy of some mutual sorrow seemed curiously revealed in that unspoken question and answer the two young subalterns prepared to take their leave nora kneeling down stroked her stepmothers hand  no news at all then helen faltered  none was the weary reply  any amount of news here mummy nora intervened cheerfully and heaps of excitement we had a zeppelin over dutchmans common last night and she lost her observation car mr somerfield took me up there this afternoon and i found a german hat no one else got a thing and would you believe it those children over there tried to take it away from me  her stepmother smiled faintly  i expect you are keeping the hat dear she observed  i should say so nora assented  philippa held out her hand to the two young men who had been waiting to take their leave  you must come and dine one night this week both of you she said my husband will be home by the later train this evening and im sure he will be glad to have you  very kind of you lady cranston we shall be delighted harrison declared  rather his companion echoed  nora led them away and helen with a word of excuse followed them griffiths who had also risen to his feet came a little nearer to philippas chair  and you too of course captain griffiths she said smiling pleasantly up at him must you hurry away  i will stay if i may until miss fairclough returns he answered resuming his seat  do philippa begged him i have had such a miserable time in town you cant think how restful it is to be back here  i am afraid he observed that your journey has not been successful  philippa shook her head  it has been completely unsuccessful she sighed i have not been able to hear a word about my brother i am so sorry for poor helen too they were only engaged you know a few days before he left for the front this last time  captain griffiths nodded sympathetically  i never met major felstead he remarked but every one who has seems to like him very much he was doing so well too up to that last unfortunate affair wasnt he  dick is a dear philippa declared i never knew any one with so many friends he would have been commanding his battalion now if only he were free his colonel wrote and told me so himself  i wish there were something i could do griffiths murmured a little awkwardly it hurts me lady cranston to see you so upset  she looked at him for a moment in faint surprise  nobody can do anything she bemoaned that is the unfortunate part of it all  he rose to his feet and was immediately conscious as he always was when he stood up that there was a foot or two of his figure which he had no idea what to do with  you wouldnt feel like a ride tomorrow morning lady cranston he asked with a wistfulness which seemed somehow stifled in his rather unpleasant voice she shook her head  perhaps one morning later she replied a little vaguely i havent any heart for anything just now  he took a sombre but agitated leave of his hostess and went out into the twilight cursing his lack of ease remembering the things which he had meant to say and hating himself for having forgotten them philippa to whom his departure had been as it always was a relief was already leaning forward in her chair with her arm around helens neck  i thought that extraordinary man would never go she exclaimed and i was longing to send for you helen london has been such a dreary chapter of disappointments  what a sickening time you must have had dear  it was horrid philippa assented sadly but you know henry is no use at all and i should have felt miserable unless i had gone i have been to every friend at the war office and every friend who has friends there i have made every sort of enquiry and i know just as much now as i did when i left herethat richard was a prisoner at wittenberg the last time they heard and that they have received no notification whatever concerning him for the last two months  helen glanced at the calendar  it is just two months today she said mournfully since we heard  and then philippa sighed he hadnt received a single one of our parcels  helen rose suddenly to her feet she was a tall fair girl of the best saxon type slim but not in the least angular with every promise indeed of a fuller and more gracious development in the years to come she was barely twentytwo years old and as is common with girls of her complexion seemed younger her bright intelligent face was above all goodhumoured just at that moment however there was a flush of passionate anger in her cheeks  it makes me feel almost beside myself she exclaimed this hideous incapacity for doing anything here we are living in luxury without a single privation whilst dick the dearest thing on earth to both of us is being starved and goaded to death in a foul german prison  we mustnt believe that its quite so bad as that dear philippa remonstrated what is it mills  the elderly manservant who had entered with a tray in his band bowed as he arranged it upon a side table  i have taken the liberty of bringing in a little fresh tea your ladyship he announced and some hot buttered toast cook has sent some of the sandwiches too which your ladyship generally fancies  it is very kind of you mills philippa said with rather a wan little smile i had some tea at south lynn but it was very bad you might take my coat please  she stood up and the heavy fur coat slipped easily away from her slim elegant little body  shall i light up your ladyship mills enquired  you might light a lamp philippa directed but dont draw the blinds until lightingup time after the noise of london she went on turning to helen i always think that the faint sound of the sea is so restful  the man moved noiselessly about the room and returned once more to his mistress  we should be glad to hear your ladyship he said if there is any news of major felstead philippa shook her head  none at all i am sorry to say mills still we must hope for the best i dare say that some of these camps are not so bad as we imagine  we must hope not your ladyship was the somewhat dismal reply shall i fasten the windows  you can leave them until you draw the blinds mills philippa directed i am not at home if any one should call see that we are undisturbed for a little time  very good your ladyship  the door was closed and the two women were once more alone philippa held out her arms  helen darling come and be nice to me she begged let us both pretend that no news is good news oh i know what you are suffering but remember that even if dick is your lover he is my dear only brothermy twin brother too we have been so much to each other all our lives hell stick it out dear if any human being can we shall have him back with us some day  but he is hungry helen sobbed i cant bear to think of his being hungry every time i sit down to eat it almost chokes me  i suppose he has forgotten what a whisky and soda is like philippa murmured with a little catch in her own throat  he always used to love one about this time helen faltered glancing at the clock  and cigarettes philippa exclaimed i wonder whether they give him anything to smoke  nasty german tobacco if they do helen rejoined indignantly and to think that i have sent him at least six hundred of his favourite egyptians  she fell once more on her knees by her friends side their arms were intertwined their cheeks touching one of those strange feminine silences of acute sympathy seemed to hold them for a while under its thrall then almost at the same moment a queer awakening came for both of them helens arm was stiffened philippa turned her head but her eyes were filled with incredulous fear a little current of cool air was blowing through the room the french windows stood half open and with his back to them a man who had apparently entered the room from the gardens and passed noiselessly across the soft carpet was standing by the door listening they heard him turn the key then in a businesslike manner he returned to the windows and closed them the eyes of the two women following him all the time satisfied apparently with his precautions he turned towards them just as an expression of indignant enquiry broke from philippas lips helen sprang to her feet and philippa gripped the sides of her chair the newcomer advanced a few steps nearer to them    chapter iii   it seemed to the two women brief though the period of actual silence was that in those few seconds they jointly conceived definite and lasting impressions of the man who was to become during the next few weeks an object of the deepest concern to both of them the intruder was slightly built of little more than medium height of dark complexion with an almost imperceptible moustache of military pattern black hair dishevelled with the wind and eyes of almost peculiar brightness he carried himself with an assurance which was somewhat remarkable considering the condition of his torn and mud stained clothes the very quality of which was almost undistinguishable they both curiously enough formed the same instinctive conviction that notwithstanding his tramplike appearance and his burglarious entrance this was not a person to be greatly feared  the stranger brushed aside philippas incoherent exclamation and opened the conversation with some ceremony  ladies he began with a low bow in the first place let me offer my most profound apologies for this unusual form of entrance to your house  philippa rose from her easychair and confronted him the firelight played upon her redgold hair and surprise had driven the weariness from her face against the black oak of the chimneypiece she had almost the appearance of a framed cameo her voice was quite steady although its inflection betrayed some indignation  will you kindly explain who you are and what you mean by this extraordinary behaviour she demanded  it is my earnest intention to do so without delay he assured her his eyes apparently rivetted upon philippa kindly pardon me  he held out his arm to stop helen who with her eye upon the bell had made a stealthy attempt to slip past him her eyes flashed as she felt his fingers upon her arm  how dare you attempt to stop me she exclaimed  my dear miss fairclough he remonstrated in the interests of all of us it is better that we should have a few moments of undisturbed conversation i am taking it for granted that i have the pleasure of addressing miss fairclough  there was something about the mans easy confidence which was in its way impressive yet irritating helen appeared bereft of words and retreated to her place almost mildly philippas very delicate eyebrows were drawn together in a slight frown  you are acquainted with our names then  perfectly was the suave reply you i presume are lady cranston i may be permitted to add he went on looking at her steadfastly that the description from which i recognise you does you less than justice  i find that remark under the circumstances impertinent philippa told him coldly  he shrugged his shoulders there was a slight smile upon his lips and his eyes twinkled  alas he murmured for the moment i forgot the somewhat unusual circumstances of our meeting permit me to offer you what i trust you will accept as the equivalent of a letter of introduction  a letter of introduction philippa repeated glancing at his disordered clothes and you come in through the window  believe me the intruder assured her it was the only way  perhaps you will tell me then philippa demanded her anger gradually giving way to bewilderment what is wrong with my front door  for all i know dear lady the newcomer confessed yours may be an excellent front door i would ask you however to consider my appearance i have been obliged to conclude the last few miles of my journey in somewhat ignominious fashion my clothesthey were quite nice clothes too when i started he added looking down at himself ruefullyhave suffered and as you perceive i have lost my hat  your hat helen exclaimed with a sudden glance at noras trophy  precisely i might have posed before your butler perhaps as belonging to what you call the hatless brigade but the mud upon my clothes and these unfortunate rents in my garments would have necessitated an explanation which i thought better avoided i make myself quite clear i trust  clear philippa murmured helplessly  clear helen echoed with a puzzled frown  i mean of course their visitor explained so far as regards my choosing this somewhat surreptitious form of entrance into your house  philippa shrugged her shoulders and made a determined move towards the bell the intruder however barred her way she looked up into his face and found it difficult to maintain her indignation his expression besides being distinctly pleasant was full of a respectful admiration  will you please let me pass she insisted  madam he replied i am afraid that it is your intention to ring the bell  of course it is she admitted dont dare to prevent me  madam i do not wish to prevent you he assured her a few moments delaythat is all i plead for  will you explain at once sir philippa demanded what you mean by forcing your way into my house in this extraordinary fashion and by locking that door  i am most anxious to do so was the prompt reply i am correct of course in my first surmise that you are lady cranstonand you miss fairclough he added bowing ceremoniously to both of them a very great pleasure i recognised you both quite easily you see from your descriptions  from our descriptions philippa repeated  the newcomer bowed  the descriptions glowing indeed but by no means exaggerated of your brother richard lady cranston and your fiancé miss fairclough  richard philippa almost shrieked  you have seen dick helen gasped  the intruder dived in his pockets and produced two sealed envelopes he handed one each simultaneously to helen and to philippa  my letters of introduction he explained with a little sigh of relief i trust that during their perusal you will invite me to have some tea i am almost starving  the two women hastened towards the lamp  one moment i beg their visitor interposed i have established i trust my credentials may i remind you that i was compelled to ensure the safety of these few minutes conversation with you by locking that door are you likely to be disturbed  no no no chance at all philippa assured him  if we are well explain helen promised  in that case the intruder begged perhaps you will excuse me  he moved towards the door and softly turned the key then he drew the curtains carefully across the french windows afterwards he made his way towards the teatable a little throbbing cry had broken from helens lips  philippa she exclaimed its from dick its dicks handwriting  philippas reply was incoherent she was tearing open her own envelope with a wellsatisfied smile the bearer of these communications seized a sandwich in one hand and poured himself out some tea with the other he ate and drank with the restraint of goodbreeding but with a voracity which gave point to his plea of starvation a few yards away the breathless silence between the two women had given place to an almost hysterical series of disjointed exclamations  its from dick helen repeated its his own dear handwriting how shaky it is hes alive and well philippa and hes found a friend  i knowi know philippa murmured tremulously our parcels have been discovered and he got them all at once just fancy helen hes really not so ill after all  they drew a little closer together  you read yours out first helen proposed and then ill read mine  philippa nodded her voice here and there was a little uncertain    my dearest sister    i have heard nothing from you or helen for so long that i was   really getting desperate  i have had a very rough time here   but by the grace of providence i stumbled up against an old   friend the other day bertram maderstrom whom you must have   heard me speak of in my college days  it isnt too much to say   that he has saved my life  he has unearthed your parcels found   me decent quarters and i am getting double rations  he has   promised too to get this letter through to you    you neednt worry about me now dear  i am feeling twice the   man i was a month ago and i shall stick it out now quite easily    write me as often as ever you can  your letters and helens make   all the difference    my love to you and to henry                                  your affectionate brother richard    ps  is henry an admiral yet  i suppose he was in the jutland   scrap which they all tell us here was a great german victory  i   hope he came out all right  philippa read the postscript with a little shiver then she set her teeth as though determined to ignore it  isnt it wonderful she exclaimed turning towards helen with glowing eyes now yours dear  helens voice trembled as she read her eyes too at times were misty    dearest    i am writing to you so differently because i feel that you will   really get this letter  i have bad an astonishing stroke of luck   as you will gather from philippas note  you cant imagine the   difference  a month ago i really thought i should have to chuck   it in  now i am putting on flesh every day and beginning to feel   myself again  i owe my life to a pal with whom i was at college   and whom you and i dearest will have to remember all our lives    i think of you always and my thoughts are like the flowers of   which we see nothing in these hideous huts  my greatest joy is   in dreaming of the day when we shall meet again    write to me often sweetheart  your letters and my thoughts of   you are the one joy of my life                                                 always your lover                                                        dick  there were a few moments of significant silence the girls were leaning together their arms around one anothers necks their heads almost touching behind them their visitor continued to eat and drink he rose at last however reluctantly to his feet and coughed they started suddenly remembering his presence philippa turned impulsively towards him with outstretched hands  i cant tell you how thankful we are to you she declared  both of us helen echoed  he touched with his fingers a box of cigarettes which stood upon the teatable  you permit he asked  of course philippa assented eagerly you will find some matches on the tray there do please help yourself i am afraid that i must have seemed very discourteous but this has all been so amazing wont you have some fresh tea and some toast or wouldnt you like some more sandwiches  nothing more at present thank you he replied if you do not mind i would rather continue our conversation  these letters are wonderful philippa told him gratefully you know from whom they come of course dick is my twin brother and until the war we had scarcely ever been parted miss fairclough here is engaged to be married to him it is quite two months since we had a line and i myself have been in london for the last three days three very weary days making enquiries everywhere  i am very happy he said to have brought you such good news  once more the normal aspect of the situation began to reimpose itself upon the two women they remembered the locked door the secrecy of their visitors entrance and his disordered condition  may i ask to whom we are indebted for this great service philippa enquired  my name for the present is hamar lessingham was the suave reply  for the present philippa repeated you have perhaps some explanations to make she went on with some hesitation the condition of your clothes your somewhat curious form of entrance  with your permission  one moment helen intervened eagerly is it possible mr lessingham that you have seen major felstead lately  a matter of fiftysix hours ago miss fairclough i am happy to tell you that he was looking under the circumstances quite reasonably well  helen caught up a photograph from the table by her side and came over to their visitors side  this was taken just before he went out the first time she continued is he anything like that now  mr hamar lessingham sighed and shook his head  you must expect he warned her that prison and hospital have had their effect upon him he was gaining strength every day however when i left  philippa held out her hand she had been looking curiously at their visitor  helen dear afterwards we will get mr lessingham to talk to us about dick she insisted first there are some questions which i must ask  he bowed slightly and drew himself up for a moment it seemed as though they were entering upon a duelthe slight beautiful woman and the man in rags  just now she began you told us that you saw major felstead my brother fiftysix hours ago  that is so he assented  but it is impossible she pointed out my brother is a prisoner of war in germany  precisely he replied and not i am afraid under the happiest conditions he has been unfortunate in his camp let us talk about him shall we  are you mad helen demanded or are you trying to confuse us  my dear young lady he protested why suppose such a thing i was flattering myself that my conversation and deportment were under the circumstances perfectly rational  but you are talking nonsense philippa insisted you say that you saw major felstead fiftysix hours ago you cannot mean us to believe that fiftysix hours ago you were at wittenberg  that is precisely what i have been trying to tell you he agreed  but it isnt possible helen gasped  quite i assure you he continued in fact we should have been here before but for a little uncertainty as to your armaments along the coast there was a gun we were told somewhere near here which we were credibly informed had once been fired without the slightest accident  philippas eyes seemed to grow larger and rounder  hes raving she decided  he isnt helen cried with sudden divination is that your hat she asked pointing to the table where nora had left her trophy  it is he admitted with a smile but i do not think that i will claim it  you were in the observation car of that zeppelin  lessingham extended his hand  softly please he begged you have i gather arrived at the truth but for the moment shall it be our secret i made an exceedingly uncomfortable not to say undignified descent from the zeppelin which passed over dutchmans common last night  then philippa cried you are a german  my dear lady i have escaped that misfortune lessingham confessed do you think that none other than germans ride in zeppelins    chapter iv   a new tenseness seemed to have crept into the situation the conversation never without its emotional tendencies at once changed its character philippa cold and reserved with a threat lurking all the time in her tone and manner became its guiding spirit  we may enquire your name she asked  i am the baron maderstrom was the prompt reply for the purpose of my brief residence in this country however i fancy that the name of mr hamar lessingham might provoke less comment  maderstrom philippa repeated you were at magdalen with my brother  for three terms he assented  you have visited at wood norton it was only an accident then that i did not meet you  it is true he answered with a bow i received the most charming hospitality there from your father and mother  why you are the friend helen exclaimed suddenly seizing his hands of whom dick speaks in his letter  it has been my great privilege to have been of service to major felstead was the grave admission he and i during our college days were more than ordinarily intimate i saw his name in one of the lists of prisoners and i went at once to wittenberg  a fresh flood of questions was upon helens lips but philippa brushed her away  please let me speak she said you have brought us these letters from richard for which we offer you our heartfelt thanks but you did not risk your liberty perhaps your life to come here simply as his ambassador there is something beyond this in your visit to this country you may be a swede but is it not true that at the present moment you are in the service of an enemy  lessingham bowed acquiescence  you are entirely right he murmured  am i also right in concluding that you have some service to ask of us  your directness dear lady moves me to admiration lessingham assured her i am here to ask a trifling favour in return for those which i have rendered and those which i may yet render to your brother  and that favour  their visitor looked down at his torn attire  a suit of your brothers clothes he replied and a room in which to change the disposal of these rags i may leave i presume to your ingenuity  anything else  it is my wish he continued to remain in this neighbourhood for a short timeperhaps a fortnight and perhaps a month i should value your introduction to the hotel here and the extension of such hospitality as may seem fitting to you under the circumstances  as mr hamar lessingham  beyond a doubt  there was a moments silence philippas face had become almost stony she took a step towards the telephone lessingham however held out his hand  your purpose he enquired  i am going to ring up the commandant here she told him and explain your presence in this house  an heroic impulse he observed but too impulsive  we shall see she retorted will you let me pass  his fingers restrained her as gently as possible  let me make a reasonable appeal to both of you he suggested i am here at your mercy i promise you that under no circumstances will i attempt any measure of violence from any fear of that i trust my name and my friendship with your brother will be sufficient guarantee  continue then philippa assented  you will give me ten minutes in which to state my case he begged  we must helen exclaimed we must philippa please  you shall have your ten minutes philippa conceded  he abandoned his attitude of watchfulness and moved back on to the hearthrug his hands behind him he addressed himself to philippa it was philippa who had become his judge  i will claim nothing from you he began for the services which i have rendered to richard our friendship was a real thing and finding him in such straits i would gladly under any circumstances have done all that i have done i am well paid for this by the thanks which you have already proffered me  no thanksnothing that we could do for you would be sufficient recompense helen declared energetically  let me speak for a moment of the future he continued supposing you ring that telephone and hand me over to the authorities here well that will be the end of me without a doubt you will have done what seemed to you to be the right thing and i hope that that consciousness will sustain you for believe me though it may not be at my will your brothers life will most certainly answer for mine  there was a slight pause a sob broke from helens throat even philippas lip quivered  forgive me he went on if that sounds like a threat it was not so meant it is the simple truth let me hurry on to the future i ask so little of you it is my duty to live in this spot for one month what harm can i do you have no great concentration of soldiers here no docks no fortifications no industry and in return for the slight service of allowing me to remain here unmolested i pledge my word that richard shall be set at liberty and shall be here with you within two months  helens face was transformed her eyes glowed her lips were parted with eagerness she turned towards philippa her expression her whole attitude an epitome of eloquent pleading  philippa you will not hesitate you cannot  i must philippa answered struggling with her agitation i love dick more dearly than anything else on earth but just now helen we have to remember before everything that we are english women we have to put our human feelings behind us we are learning every day to make sacrifices you too must learn dear my answer to you baron maderstromor mr lessingham as you choose to call yourselfis no  philippa you are mad helen exclaimed passionately didnt i have to realise all that you say when i let dick go cheerfully the day after we were engaged havent i realised the duty of cheerfulness and sacrifice through all these weary months but there is a limit to these things philippa a sense of proportion which must be taken into account its dicks life which is in the balance against some intangible thing nothing that we could ever reproach ourselves with nothing that could bring real harm upon any one oh i love my country too but i want dick i should feel like his murderess all my life if i didnt consent  it occurs to me lessingham remarked turning towards philippa that miss faircloughs point of view is one to be considered  doesnt all that miss fairclough has said apply to me philippa demanded with a little break in her voice richard is my twin brother he is the dearest thing in life to me cant you realise though that what you ask of us is treason  it really doesnt amount to that lessingham assured her in my own heart i feel convinced that i have come here on a fools errand no object that i could possibly attain in this neighbourhood is worth the life of a man like richard felstead  oh hes right helen exclaimed think philippa what is there here which the whole world might not know there are no secrets in dreymarsh we are miles away from everywhere for my sake philippa i implore you not to be unreasonable  in plain words lessingham intervened do not be quixotic lady cranston there is just an idea on one side your brothers life on the other you see the scales do not balance  cant you realise though philippa answered what that idea means it is part of ones soul that one gives when one departs from a principle  what are principles against love helen demanded almost fiercely a sister may prate about them philippa a wife couldnt id sacrifice every principle i ever had every scrap of selfrespect myself and all that belongs to me to save dicks life  there was a brief throbbing silence helen was feverishly clutching philippas hand lessinghams eyes were fixed upon the tortured face into which he gazed there were no women like this in his own country  dear lady he said and for the first time his own voice shook i abandon my arguments i beg you to act as you think best for your own future happiness the chances of life or death are not great things for either men like your brother or for me i would not purchase my end nor he his life at the expense of your suffering you see i stand on one side the telephone is there for your use  you shant use it helen cried passionately phillipa you shant  philippa turned towards her and all the stubborn pride had gone out of her face her great eyes were misty with tears her mouth was twitching with emotion she threw her arms around helens neck  my dear i cant i cant she sobbed    chapter v   philippas breakdown was only momentary with a few brusque words she brought the other two down to the level of her newly recovered equanimity  to be practical she began we have no time to lose i will go and get a suit of dicks clothes and helen you had better take mr lessingham into the gun room afterwards perhaps you will have time to ring up the hotel  lessingham took a quick step towards heralmost as though he were about to make some impetuous withdrawal philippa turned and met his almost pleading gaze perhaps she read there his instinct of selfabnegation  i am in command of the situation she continued a little more lightly every one must please obey me i shant be more than five minutes  she left the room waving back lessinghams attempt to open the door for her he stood for a moment looking at the place where she had vanished then he turned round  major felsteads description he said quietly did not do his sister justice  philippa is a dear helen declared enthusiastically just for a moment though i was terrified she has a wonderful will  how long has she been married  about six years  are thereany children  helen shook her head  sir henry had a daughter by his first wife who lives with us  six years lessingham repeated why she seems no more than a child sir henry must be a great deal her senior  sixteen years helen told him philippa is twentynine and now dont be inquisitive any more please and come with me i want to show you where to change your clothes  she opened a door on the other side of the room and pointed to a small apartment across the passage  if youll wait in there she begged ill bring the clothes to you directly they come i am going to telephone now  so many thanks he answered i should like a pleasant bedroom and sitting room and a bathroom if possible my luggage you will find already there a friend in london has seen to that  she looked at him curiously  you are very thorough arent you she remarked  the people of the country whom it is my destiny to serve all are he replied one weak link you know may sometimes spoil the mightiest chain  she closed the door and took up the telephone  number three please she began are you the hotel the manager good i am speaking for lady cranston she wishes a sittingroom bedroom and bathroom reserved for a friend of ours who is arriving todaya mr hamar lessingham you have his luggage already i believe please do the best you can for himcertainlythank you very much  she set down the receiver the door was quickly opened and shut philippa reappeared carrying an armful of clothes  why youve brought his grey suit helen cried in dismay the one he looks so well in  dont be an idiot philippa scoffed i had to bring the first i could find take them in to mr lessingham and for heavens sake see that he hurries henrys train is due and he may be here at any moment  ill tell him helen promised ill smuggle him out of the back way if you like  philippa laughed a little drearily  a nice start that would be if any one ever traced his arrival she observed no we must try and get him away before henry comes but if the worst comes to the worst well have him in and introduce him henry isnt likely to notice anything she added a little bitterly  helen disappeared with the clothes and returned almost immediately philippa was sitting in her old position by the fire  youre not worrying about this dear are you the former asked anxiously  i dont know philippa replied without turning her head i dont know what may come of it helen i have a queer sort of feeling about that man  helen sighed i suppose she confessed i am the narrowest person on earth i can think of one thing and one thing only if mr lessingham keeps his word dick will be here perhaps in a month perhaps six weekscertainly soon  he will keep his word philippa said quietly he is that sort of man  the door on the other side of the room was softly opened lessinghams head appeared  could i have a necktie he asked diffidently philippa stretched out her hand and took one from the basket by her side  better give him this she said handing it over to helen it is one of henrys which i was mendingstop  she put up her finger they all listened  the car philippa exclaimed rising hastily to her feet that is henry go out with mr lessingham helen she continued and wait until he is ready dont forget that he is an ordinary caller and bring him in presently  helen nodded understandingly and hurried out  philippa moved a few steps towards the other door in a moment it was thrown open nora appeared with her arm through her fathers  i went to meet him mummy she explained no uniformisnt it a shame  sir henry patted her cheek and turned to greet his wife there was a shadow upon his bronzed handsome face as he watched her rather hesitating approach  sorry i couldnt catch your train phil he told her i had to make a call in the city so i came down from liverpool street any luck  she held his hands resisting for the moment his proffered embrace  henry she said earnestly do you know i am so much more anxious to hear your news  mine will keep he replied what about richard  she shook her head  i spent the whole of my time making enquiries she sighed and every one was fruitless i failed to get the least satisfaction from any one at the war office they know nothing have heard nothing  im ever so sorry to hear it sir henry declared sympathetically you mustnt worry too much though dear wheres helen  she is in the gun room with a caller  with a caller nora exclaimed is it any one from the depot i must go and see  you neednt trouble her stepmother replied here they are coming in  the door on the opposite side of the room was suddenly opened and hamar lessingham and helen entered together lessingham was entirely at his easetheir conversation indeed seemed almost engrossing he came at once across the room on realising sir henrys presence  this is mr hamar lessinghammy husband philippa said mr lessingham was at college with dick henry so of course helen and he have been indulging in all sorts of reminiscences  the two men shook hands  i found time also to examine your leech prints lessingham remarked you have some very admirable examples  quite a hobby of mine in my younger days sir henry admitted one or two of them are very good i believe are you staying in these parts long mr lessingham  perhaps for a week or two was the somewhat indifferent reply i am told that this is the most wonderful air in the world so i have come down here to pull up again after a slight illness  a dreary spot just now sir henry observed but the airs all right are you a seafisherman by any chance mr lessingham  i have done a little of it the visitor confessed sir henrys face lit up he drew from his pocket a small brown paper parcel  i dont mind telling you he confided as he cut the string that i dont think theres another sport like it in the world i have tried most of them too when i was a boy i was all for shooting perhaps because i could never get enough then i had a season or two at melton though i was never much of a horseman but for real unadulterated excitement for sport that licks everything else into a cocked hat give me a strong sea rod a couple of traces just enough sea to keep on the bottom all the time and the codling biting look here did you ever see a mackerel spinner like that he added drawing one out of the parcel which he had untied look at it all of you  lessingham took it gingerly in his fingers philippa a little ostentatiously turned her back upon the two men and took up a newspaper  lady cranston does not sympathize with my interest in any sort of sport just now sir henry explained goodhumouredly all the same i argue that one must keep ones mind occupied somehow or other  quite right dad nora agreed we must carry on as the colonel says all the same i did hope youd come down in a new naval uniform with lots of gold braid on your sleeve i think they might have made you an admiral daddy youd look so nice on the bridge  i am afraid her father replied with his eyes glued upon the spinner which lessingham was holding that that is a consideration which didnt seem to weigh with them much look at the glitter of it he went on taking up another of the spinners you see its got a double swivel and they guarantee six hundred revolutions a minute  i must plead ignorance lessingham regretted of everything connected with mackerel spinning  its fine sport for a change sir henry declared the only thing is that if you strike a shoal one gets tired of hauling the beggars in bytheby has jimmy been up for me philippa have you heard whether there are any mackerel in  philippa raised her eyebrows  mackerel she repeated sarcastically  have you any objection to the fish dear sir henry enquired blandly  philippa made no reply her husband frowned and turned towards lessingham  you see he complained a little irritably my wife doesnt approve of my taking an interest even in fishing while the wars on but hang it all what are you to do when you reach my age thinks i ought to be a special constable dont you philippa  need we discuss this before mr lessingham she asked without looking up from her paper  lessingham promptly prepared to take his departure  see something more of you i hope sir henry remarked hospitably as he conducted his guest to the door where are you staying here  at the hotel  which  i did not understand that there was more than one lessingham replied i simply wrote to the hotel dreymarsh  there is only one hotel open of course mr lessingham philippa observed turning towards him why do you ask such an absurd question henry the grand is full of soldiers come and see us whenever you feel inclined mr lessingham  i shall certainly take advantage of your permission lady cranston were the farewell words of this unusual visitor as he bowed himself out  sir henry moved to the sideboard and helped himself to a whisky and soda philippa laid down her newspaper and watched him as though waiting patiently for his return helen and nora had already obeyed the summons of the dressing bell  henry i want to hear your news she insisted he threw himself into an easychair and turned over the contents of philippas workbasket  wheres that tie of mine you were mending he asked is it finished yet  it is upstairs somewhere she replied no i have not finished it why do you ask you have plenty havent you  drawers full he admitted cheerfully half of them i can never wear though i like that black and white fellow your friend lessingham was wearing one exactly like it  it isnt exactly an uncommon pattern philippa reminded him  seems to have the family taste in clothes sir henry continued stroking his chin that grey tweed suit of his was exactly the same pattern as the suit richard was wearing the last time i saw him in mufti  they probably go to the same tailor philippa remarked equably  sir henry abandoned the subject he was once more engrossed in an examination of the mackerel spinners  you didnt answer my question about jimmy dumble he ventured presently  philippa turned and looked at him her eyes were usually very sweet and soft and her mouth delightful just at that moment however there were new and very firm lines in her face  henry she said sternly you are purposely fencing with me mr lessinghams taste in clothes or jimmy dumbles comings and goings are not what i want to hear or talk about you went to london unwillingly enough to keep your promise to me i want to know whether you have succeeded in getting anything from the admiralty  nothing but the cold shoulder my dear he answered with a little chuckle  do you mean to say that they offered you nothing at all she persisted you may have been out of the service too long for them to start you with a modern ship but surely they could have given you an auxiliary cruiser or a secondary command of some sort  they didnt even offer me a washtub dear he confessed my names on a list they said  oh that list philippa interrupted angrily henry i really cant bear it couldnt they find you anything on land  my dear girl he replied a little testily what sort of a figure should i cut in an office no one can read my writing and i couldnt add up a column of figures to save my life what is it he added as the door opened and mills made his appearance  dumble is here to see you sir  show him in at once his master directed with alacrity come in jimmy he went on raising his voice ive got something to show you here  philippas lips were drawn a little closer together she swept past her husband on her way to the door  i hope you will be so good she said looking back as to spare me half an hour of your valuable time this evening this is a subject which i must discuss with you further at once  as urgent as all that eh sir henry replied stopping to light a cigarette righto you can have the whole of my evening dear with the greatest of pleasurenow then jimmy    chapter vi   jimmy dumble possessed a very red face and an extraordinary capacity for silence he stood a yard or two inside the room twirling his hat in his hand sir henry after the closing of the door did not for a moment address his visitor there was a subtle but unmistakable change in his appearance as he stood with his hands in his pockets and a frown on his forehead whistling softly to himself his eyes fixed upon the door through which his wife had vanished he swung round at last towards the telephone  stand by for a moment jimmy will you he directed  aye aye sir  sir henry took up the receiver he dropped his voice a little although it was none the less distinct  number onepolicestation pleasehullo there the inspector aboutthat you inspectorsir henry cranston speaking could you just step roundgood tell them to show you straight into the library you might just drop a hint to mills about the lights eh thank you  he laid down the receiver and turned towards the fisherman  well jimmy he enquired all serene down in the village eh  so far as ive seen or heard sir there aint been a word spoke as shouldnt be  a lazy lot they are sir henry observed  they dont look far beyond the end of their noses  maybe its as well for us sir as they dont was the cautious reply  sir henry strolled to the further end of the room  perhaps you are right jimmy he admitted  that fellow ben oates seems to be the only one with ideas  he dont keep sober long enough to give us any trouble dumble declared he began asking me questions a few days ago and i know he put grices lad on to find out which way we went last saturday week but that dont amount to anything he was dead drunk for three days afterwards  sir henry nodded  im not very frightened of ben oates jimmy he confided as he threw open the door of a large cabinet which stood against the further wall no strangers about eh  not a sign of one sir  sir henry glanced towards the door and listened  shall i just give the key a turn sir his visitor asked  i dont think it is necessary sir henry replied theyve all gone up to change now listen to me jimmy  he leaned forward and touched a spring the false back of the cabinet with its little array of flies spinners fishing hooks and tackle slowly rolled back before them stood a huge chart wonderfully executed in red white and yellow  thats a marvellous piece of work sir the fisherman observed admiringly  best thing i ever did in my life sir henry agreed now see here jimmy well sail out tomorrow or take the motor boat according to the wind well enter langley shallows there and pass dead mans rock on the left side of the waterway and keep straight on until we get budden wood on the church tower you follow me  aye aye sir  we make for the headland from there you see we shall be outside the gidney shallows and number twelve will pick us up put all the fishing tackle in the boat and dont forget the bait we must never lose sight of the fact jimmy that the main object of our lives is to catch fish  thats right sir was the hearty assent  well be off at seven oclock sharp then sir henry decided  the tidell be on the flow by that time jimmy observed and well get off from the staith breakwater that do be a fine piece of work and no mistake he added as the false back of the cabinet glided slowly to its place  sir henry chuckled  its nothing to the one ive got on number twelve jimmy he said ive got the seaweed on that pretty well youll take a drop of whisky on your way out he added mills will look after you  i thank you kindly sir  mills answered the bell with some concern in his face  the inspector is here to see you sir he announced he did mention something about the lights im sure weve all been most careful even her ladyship has only used a candle in her bedroom  show the inspector in sir henry directed and ill hear what he has to say and give dumble some whisky as he goes out and a cigar  wishing you good night sir the latter said as he followed mills ill be punctual in the morning looks to me as though we might have good sport  well hope for it anyway jimmy his employer replied cheerfully come in inspector  the inspector a tall broadshouldered man saluted and stood at attention sir henry nodded affably and glanced towards the door he remained silent until mills and dumble had disappeared  glad i happened to catch you inspector he observed sitting on the edge of the table and helping himself to another cigarette any fresh arrivals  none sir the man reported of any consequence that i can see there are two more young officers for the depot and the young lady for the grange and mr and mrs silvester returned home last night there was a commercial traveller came in the first train this morning but he went on during the afternoon  hm what about a mr lessinghama mr hamar lessingham  i havent heard of him sir  have you had the registration papers down from the hotel yet  not this evening sir i met the midland and great northern train in myself her ladyship was the only passenger to alight here  and i came the other way myself sir henry reflected  now you come to mention the matter sir the inspector continued i was up at the hotel this afternoon and i saw some luggage about addressed to a name somewhat similar to that  probably sent on in advance eh  there could be no other way sir the inspector replied unless the registration paper has been mislaid ill step up to the hotel this evening and make sure  youll oblige me very much if you will by jove sir henry added looking towards the door id no idea it was so late  philippa who had changed her travelling dress for a plain black net gown was standing in the doorway she looked at the inspector and for a moment the little colour which she had seemed to disappear  is anything the matter she asked breathlessly  nothing in the world my dear her husband assured her i am frightfully sorry im so late jimmy stayed some time and then the inspector here looked in about our lights just a little more care in this room at night he thinks well see to it inspector  i am very much obliged sir the man replied sorry to be under the necessity of mentioning it  sir henry opened the door  youll find your own way out wont you he begged im a little late  the inspector saluted and withdrew sir henry glanced round  i wont be ten minutes philippa he promised i had no idea it was so late  come here one moment please she insisted  he came back into the room and stood on the other side of the small table near which she had paused  what is it dear he enquired we are going to leave our talk till after dinner arent we  she looked him in the face there was an anxious light in her eyes and she was certainly not herself of course i only wanted to knowit seemed to me that you broke off in what you were saying to the inspector as i came into the room are you sure that it was the lights he came around about there isnt anything else wrong is there  what else could there be he asked wonderingly  i have no idea she replied with wellsimulated indifference i was only asking you whether there was anything else  he shook his head  nothing  she threw herself into an easychair and picked up a magazine  thank you she said do hurry please i have a new cook and she asked particularly whether we were punctual people  six minutes will see me through it sir henry promised making for the door come to think of it i missed my lunch i think ill manage it in five    chapter vii   sir henry was in a pleasant and expansive humour that evening the new cook was an unqualified success and he was conscious of having dined exceedingly well he sat in a comfortable easychair before a blazing wood fire he had just lit one of his favourite brand of cigarettes and his wife whom he adored was seated only a few feet away  quite a remarkable change in helen he observed she was in the depths of depression when i went away and tonight she seems positively cheerful  helen varies a great deal philippa reminded him  still tonight i must say i should have expected to have found her more depressed than ever sir henry went on she hoped so much from your trip to london and you apparently accomplished nothing  nothing at all  and you have had no letters  none  then helens high spirits i suppose are only part of womans natural inconsistencyphilippa dear  yes  i am glad to be at home i am glad to see you sitting there i know you are nursing up something some little thunderbolt to launch at me wont you launch it and lets get it over  philippa laid down the book which she had been reading and turned to face her husband he made a little grimace  dont look so severe he begged you frighten me before you begin  im sorry she said but my face probably reflects my feelings i am hurt and grieved and disappointed in you henry  thats a good start anyway he groaned  we have been married six years philippa went on and i admit at once that i have been very happy then the war came you know quite well henry that especially at that time i was very very fond of you yet it never occurred to me for a moment but that like every other woman i should have to lose my husband for a timestop please she insisted as he showed signs of interrupting i know quite well that it was through my persuasions you retired so early but in those days there was no thought of war and i always had it in my mind that if trouble came you would find your way back to where you belonged  but my dear child that is all very well sir henry protested but its not so easy to get back again you know very well that i went up to the admiralty and offered my services directly the war started  yes and what happened philippa demanded you were in a measure shelved you were put on a list and told that you would hear from thema sort of micawberlike situation with which you were perfectly satisfied then you took that moor up in scotland and disappeared for nearly six months  i was supplying the starving population with food he reminded her genially we sent about four hundred brace of grouse to market not to speak of the salmon we had some very fair golf too some of the time  oh i have not troubled to keep any exact account of your diversions philippa said scornfully sometimes she continued i wonder whether you are quite responsible henry how you can even talk of these things when every man of your age and strength is fighting one way or another for his country seems marvellous to me do you realise that we are fighting for our very existence do you realise that my own father who is fifteen years older than you is in the firing line this is a small place of course but there isnt a man left in it of your age with your physique who has had the slightest experience in either service who isnt doing something  i cant do more than send in applications he grumbled be reasonable my dear philippa it isnt the easiest thing in the world to find a job for a sailor who has been out of it as long as i have  so you say but when they ask me what you are doing as they all did in london this time and i reply that you cant get a job there is generally a polite little silence no one believes it i dont believe it  philippa  sir henry turned in his chair his cigar was burning now idly between his fingers his heavy eyebrows were drawn together  well i dont she reiterated you can be angry if you willin fact i think i should prefer you to be angry you take no pains at the admiralty you just go there and come away again once a year or something like that why if i were you i wouldnt leave the place until theyd found me somethingindoors or outdoors what does it matter so long as your hand is on the wheel and you are doing your little for your country but youwhat do you care you went to town to get a joband you come back with new mackerel spinners you are off fishing tomorrow morning with jimmy dumble somewhere up in the north sea today and tomorrow and the next day men are giving their lives for their country what do you care you will sit there smoking your pipe and catching dabs  do you know you are almost offensive philippa her husband said quietly  i want to be she retorted i should like you to feel that i am in any case this will probably be the last conversation i shall hold with you on the subject  well thank god for that anyway he observed strolling to the chimneypiece and selecting a pipe from a rack i think youve said about enough  i havent finished she told him ominously  then for heavens sake get on with it and lets have it over he begged  oh youre impossible philippa exclaimed bitterly listen i give you one chance more tell me the truth is there anything in your health of which i do not know is there any possible explanation of your extraordinary behaviour which for some reason or other you have kept to yourself give me your whole confidence  sir henry for a moment was serious enough he stood looking down at her a little wistfully  my dear he told her i have nothing to say except this you are my very precious wife i have loved you and trusted you since the day of our marriage i am content to go on loving and trusting you even though things should come under my notice which i do not understand cant you accept me the same way  philippa momentarily uneasy was nevertheless rebellious  accept you the same way how can i there is nothing in my life to compare in any way with the tragedy of your  she paused as though unwilling to finish the sentence he waited patiently however for her to proceed  of my what  philippa compromised  lethargy she pronounced triumphantly  an excellent word he murmured  it is too mild a one but you are my husband she remarked  that reminds me he said quietly you are my wife  i know it she admitted but i am also a woman and there are limits to my endurance if you can give me no explanation of your behaviour henry if you really have no intention of changing it then there is only one course left open for me  that sounds rather alarmingwhat is it he demanded  philippa lifted her head a little this was the pronouncement towards which she had been leading  from today she declared i cease to be your wife  his fingers paused in the manipulation of the tobacco with which he was filling his pipe he turned and looked at her  you what  i cease to be your wife  how do you manage that he asked  dont jest she begged it hurts me so what i mean is surely plain enough i will continue to live under your roof if you wish it or i am perfectly willing to go back to wood norton i will continue to bear your name because i must but the other ties between us are finished  you dont mean this philippa he said gravely  but i do mean it she insisted i mean every word i have spoken so far as i am concerned henry this is your last chance  there was a knock at the door mills entered with a note upon a salver sir henry took it up glanced questioningly at his wife and tore open the envelope  there will be no answer mills he said  the man withdrew sir henry read the few lines thoughtfully                                         policestation dreymarsh   sir    according to enquiries made i find that mr hamar lessingham   arrived at the hotel this evening in time for dinner  his   luggage arrived by rail yesterday  it is presumed that he came   by motorcar but there is no car in the garage nor any mention   of one  his room was taken for him by miss fairclough ringing   up for lady cranston about seven oclock                                             respectfully yours                                               john haylock  is your note of interest philippa enquired  in a sense yes he replied thrusting it into his waistcoat pocket i presume we can consider our late subject of conversation finished with  i have nothing more to say she pronounced  very well then her husband agreed let us select another topic this time supposing i choose  you are welcome  let us converse then about mr hamar lessingham  philippa had taken up her work her fingers ceased their labours but she did not look up  about mr hamar lessingham she repeated rather a limited subject i am afraid  i am not so sure he said thoughtfully for instance who is he  i have no idea she replied does it matter he was at college with richard and he has been a visitor at wood norton that is all that we know surely it is sufficient for us to offer him any reasonable hospitality  i am not disputing it sir henry assured her on the face of it it seems perfectly reasonable that you should be civil to him on the other hand there are one or two rather curious points about his coming here just now  really philippa murmured indifferently bending a little lower over her work  in the first place her husband continued how did he arrive here  for all i know she replied he may have walked  a little unlikely still he didnt come from london by either of the evening trains and it seems that you didnt take his rooms for him until about seven oclock before which time he hadnt been to the hotel so you see one is driven to wonder how the mischief he did get here  i took his rooms philippa repeated with a sudden little catch at her heart  some one from here rang up didnt they sir henry went on carelessly i gathered that we were introducing him at the hotel  where did you hear that she demanded  he shrugged his shoulders but avoided answering the question  i have no doubt he continued that the whole subject of mr hamar lessingham is scarcely worth discussing yet he does seem to have arrived here under a little halo of coincidence  i am afraid i have scarcely appreciated that philippa remarked in fact his coming here has seemed to me the most ordinary thing in the world after all although one scarcely remembers that since the war this is a health resort and the man has been ill  quite right sir henry agreed you are not going to bed dear  philippa had folded up her work she stood for a moment upon the hearthrug the little hardness which had tightened her mouth had disappeared her eyes had softened  may i say just one word more she begged about our previousour only serious subject of conversation i have tried my best since we were married henry to make you happy  you know quite well he assured her that you have succeeded  grant me one favour then she pleaded give up your fishing expedition tomorrow go back to london by the first train and let me write to lord rayton i am sure he would do something for you  of course hed do something her husband groaned i should get a censorship in ireland or a post as instructor at portsmouth  wouldnt you rather take either of those than nothing she asked than go on living the life you are living now  to be perfectly frank with you philippa i wouldnt he declared bluntly what on earth use should i be in a land appointment why no one could read my writing and my nautical science is entirely out of date why a cadet at osborne could floor me in no time  you refuse to let me write then she persisted  absolutely  you intend to go on that fishing expedition with jimmy dumble tomorrow  wouldnt miss it for anything he confessed  philippa was suddenly white with anger  henry ive finished she declared holding out her hand to keep him away from her ive finished with you entirely i would rather be married to an enemy who was fighting honourably for his country than to you what i have said i mean dont come near me dont try to touch me  she swept past him on her way to the door  not even a goodnight kiss he asked stooping down  she looked him in the eyes  i am not a child she said scornfully  he closed the door after her for a moment he remained as though undecided whether to follow or not his face had softened with her absence finally however he turned away with a little shrug of the shoulders threw himself into his easychair and began to smoke furiously  the telephone bell disturbed his reflection he rose at once and took up the receiver  yes this is 19 dreymarsh trunk call all right i am here  he waited until another voice came to him faintly  cranston  speaking  thats right the message is odino berry you understand odino berry  ive got it sir henry replied good night he hung up the receiver crossed the room to his desk unlocked one of the drawers and produced a black memorandum book secured with a brass lock he drew a key from his watch chain opened the book and ran his fingers down the os  odino he muttered to himself here it is we have trustworthy information from berlin now berry he turned back you are being watched by an enemy secret service agent  he relocked the cipher book and replaced it in the desk then he strolled over to his easychair and helped himself to a whisky and soda from the tray which mills had just arranged upon the sideboard  we have trustworthy information from berlin he repeated to himself that you are being watched by an enemy secret service agent    chapter viii   tell me mr lessingham philippa insisted exactly what are you thinking of you looked so dark and mysterious from the ridge below that ive climbed up on purpose to ask you  lessingham held out his hand to steady her they were standing on a sharp spur of the cliffs the north wind blowing in their faces thrashing into little flecks of white foam the sea below on which the twilight was already resting for a moment or two neither of them could speak  i was thinking of my country he confessed i was looking through the shadows there right across the north sea  to germany  he shook his head  further awayto sweden  i forgot she murmured you looked as though you were posing for a statue of some one in exile she observed come let us go a little lower downunless you want to stay here and be blown to pieces  i was on my way back to the hotel he answered quickly as he followed her lead but to tell you the truth i was feeling a little lonely  that she declared is your own fault i asked you to come to mainsail haul whenever you felt inclined  as i have felt inclined ever since the evening i arrived he remarked with a smile you might perhaps by this time have had a little too much of me  on the contrary she told him i quite expected you yesterday afternoon to tell me how you like the place and what you have been doing so you were thinking aboutover there she added moving her head seawards  over there absorbs a great deal of ones thoughts he confessed and the rest of them have been playing me queer tricks  well i should like to hear about the first half she insisted  do you know he replied there are times when even now this war seems to me like an unreal thing like something i have been reading about some wild imagining of shelley or one of the unrestrainable poets i cant believe that millions of the flower of germanys manhood and yours have perished helplessly hopelessly cruelly and francepoor decimated france  well germany started the war you know she reminded him  did she he answered i sometimes wonder even now i fancy if the official papers of every one of the nations lay side by side with their own case stated from their own point of view even you might feel a little confused about that still i am going to be very honest with you i think myself that germany wanted war  there you are then she declared triumphantly the whole thing is her responsibility  i do not quite go so far as that he protested you see the world is governed by great natural laws as a snowball grows larger with rolling so it takes up more room as a child grows out of its infant clothes it needs the vestments of a youth and then a man and so with germany she grew and grew until the country could not hold her children until her banks could not contain her money until she stretched her arms out on every side and felt herself stifled germany came late into the world and found it parcelled out but had she not a right to her place she made herself great she needed space  well philippa observed you couldnt suppose that other nations were going to give up what they had just because she wanted their possessions could you  perhaps not he admitted and yet you see the immutable law comes in here the stronger must possessnot only the stronger by arms mind but by intellect by learning by proficiency in science by utilitarianism the really cruel part the part i was thinking of then as i looked out across the sea is that this crude and miserable resort to arms should be necessary  if only germans themselves were as broadminded and reasonable as you philippa sighed one feels that there might be some hope for the future  i am not alone he assured her but you see all over germany there is spread like a spiders web the lay religion of the citizendevotion to the government blind obedience to the kaiser independent thought has made germany great in science in political economy in economics but independent thought is never turned towards her political destinies those are shaped for her for good or for evil her children have learnt obedience  they were descending the hillside now at their feet lay the little town black and silent  you have helped me to understand a little philippa said you put things so gently and yet so clearly now tell me will you not how it is that you who are a swede by birth are bearing arms for germany  that is very simple he confessed my mother was a german and when she died she bequeathed to me large estates in bavaria and a very considerable fortune these i could never have inherited unless i had chosen to do my military service in germany my family is an impoverished one and i have brothers and sisters dependent upon me under the circumstances hesitation on my part was impossible  but when the war came she queried  he looked at her in surprise  what was there left for me then he demanded naturally i heard nothing but the voice of those whom i had sworn to obey i was in that mad rush through belgium i was wounded at maubeuge or else i should have followed hard on the heels of that wonderful retreat of yours as it was i lay for many months in hospital i joined againshall i confess italmost unwillingly the bloodthirstiness of it all sickened me i fought at ypres but i think that it was something of the courage of despair of black misery i was wounded again and decorated i suppose i shall never be fit for the front again i tried to turn to account some of my knowledge of england and english life then they sent me here  here of all places in the world philippa repeated wonderingly just look at us we have a single line of railway a perfectly straightforward system of roads the ordinary number of soldiers being trained no mysteries no industriesnothing what terrible scheme are you at work upon mr lessingham  he smiled  between you and me he confided i am not at all sure that i am not here on a fools errandat least i thought so when i arrived  she glanced up at him  and why not now  he made no answer but their eyes met and philippa looked hurriedly away there was a moments queer strained silence before them loomed up the outline of mainsail haul  you will come in and have some tea wont you she invited  if i may believe me he added it has only been a certain diffidence that has kept me away so long  she made no reply and they entered the house together they found helen and nora with three or four young men from the depot having tea in the drawingroom lessingham slipped very easily into the pleasant little circle if a trifle subdued his quiet manners and a sense of humour which every now and then displayed itself were most attractive  wish youd come and dine with us and meet our colonel sir harrison asked him he was at magdalen a few years after major felstead and i am sure youd find plenty to talk about  i am quite sure that we should lessingham replied may i come perhaps towards the end of next week i am making most strenuous efforts to lead an absolutely quiet life here  whenever you like sir we shant be able to show you anything very wild in the way of dissipation vintage port and a decent cigar are the only changes we can make for guests  philippa drew her visitor on one side presently and made him sit with her in a distant corner of the room  i knew there was something i wanted to say to you she began but somehow or other i forgot when i met you my husband was very much struck with helens improved spirits dont you think that we had better tell him when he returns that we had heard from major felstead  lessingham agreed  just let him think that your letters came by post in the ordinary way he advised i shouldnt imagine from what i have seen of your husband that he is a suspicious person but it is just possible that he might have associated them with me if you had mentioned them the other night when is he coming back  i never know philippa answered with a sigh perhaps tonight perhaps in a week it depends upon what sport he is having you are not smoking  lessingham lit a cigarette  i find your husband he said quietly rather an interesting type we have no one like that in germany he almost puzzles me  philippa glanced up to find her companions dark eyes fixed upon her  there is very little about henry that need puzzle any one she complained bitterly he is just an overgrown spoilt child devoted to amusements and following his fancy wherever it leads him why do you look at me mr lessingham as though you thought i was keeping something back i am not i can assure you  perhaps i was wondering he confessed how you really felt towards a husband whose outlook was so unnatural  she looked down at her intertwined fingers  do you know she said softly i feel somehow or other although we have known one another such a short time as though we were friends and yet that is a question which i could not answer a woman must always have some secrets you know  a man may try sometimes to preserve his he sighed but a woman is clever enough as a rule to dig them out  a faint tinge of colour stole into her cheeks she welcomed helens approach almost eagerly  a woman must first feel the will she murmured without glancing at him helen do you think we dare ask mr lessingham to come and dine  please do not discourage such a delightful suggestion lessingham begged eagerly  i havent the least idea of doing so helen laughed so long as i may havesay just ten minutes to talk about dick  it is a bargain he promised  we shall be quite alone philippa warned him unless henry arrives  it is the great attraction of your invitation he confessed  at eight oclock then    chapter ix   captain griffiths to see your ladyship  philippas fingers rested for a moment upon the keyboard of the piano before which she was seated awaiting lessinghams arrival then she glanced at the clock it was ten minutes to eight  you can show him in mills if he wishes to see me  captain griffiths was ushered into the roomawkward unwieldly nervous as usual he entered as though in a hurry and there was nothing in his manner to denote that he had spent the last few hours making up his mind to this visit  i must apologise for this most untimely call lady cranston he said watching the closing of the door i will not take up more than five minutes of your time  we are very pleased to see you at any time captain griffiths philippa said hospitably do sit down please  captain griffiths bowed but remained standing  it is very near your dinnertime i know lady cranston he continued apologetically the fact of it is however that as commandant here it is my duty to examine the bona fides of any strangers in the place there is a gentleman named lessingham staying at the hotel who i understand gave your name as reference  philippas eyes looked larger than ever and her face more innocent as she gazed up at her visitor  why of course captain griffiths she said mr lessingham was at college with my brother and one of his best friends he has shot down at my fathers place in cheshire  you are speaking of your brother major felstead  my only brother  i am very much obliged to you lady cranston captain griffiths declared i can see that we need not worry any more about mr lessingham  philippa laughed  it seems rather oldfashioned to think of you having to worry about any one down here she observed it really is a very harmless neighbourhood isnt it  there isnt much going on certainly the commandant admitted very dull the place seems at times  now be perfectly frank philippa begged him is there a single fact of importance which could be learnt in this place worth communicating to the enemy is the danger of espionage here worth a moments consideration  that captain griffiths replied in somewhat stilted fashion is not a question which i should be prepared to answer offhand  philippa shrugged her shoulders and appealed almost feverishly to helen who had just entered the room  helen do come and listen to captain griffiths he is making me feel quite creepy there are secrets about it seems and he wants to know all about mr lessingham  helen smiled with complete selfpossession  well we can set his mind at rest about mr lessingham cant we she observed as she shook hands  we can do more philippa declared we can help him to judge for himself we are expecting mr lessingham for dinner captain griffiths do stay  i couldnt think of taking you by storm like this captain griffiths replied with a wistfulness which only made his voice sound hoarser and more unpleasant it is most kind of you lady cranston perhaps you will give me another opportunity  i shant think of it philippa insisted you must stay and dine tonight we shall be a partie carríe for nora goes to bed directly after dinner i am ringing the bell to tell mills to set an extra place she added  captain griffiths abandoned himself to fate with a little shiver of complacency he welcomed lessingham who was presently announced with very much less than his usual reserve and the dinner was in every way a success towards its close philippa became a little thoughtful she glanced more than once at lessingham who was sitting by her side almost in admiration his conversation gay at times always polished was interlarded continually with those little social reminiscences inevitable amongst men moving in a certain circle of english society apparently richard felstead was not the only one of his college friends with whom he had kept in touch the last remnants of captain griffiths suspicions seemed to vanish with their second glass of port although his manner became in no way more genial  dont you think you are almost a little too daring philippa asked her favoured guest as he helped her afterwards to set out a bridge table  one adapts ones methods to ones adversary he murmured with a smile your friend captain griffiths had only the very conventional suspicions the mention of a few good english names acquaintance with the ordinary english sports is quite sufficient with a man like that  helen and griffiths were talking at the other end of the room philippa raised her eyes to her companions  you become more of a mystery than ever she declared you are making me even curious tell me really why you have paid us this visit from the clouds  she was sorry almost as soon as she had asked the question for a moment the calm insouciance of his manner seemed to have departed his eyes glowed  in search of new things he answered  guns fortifications  neither  a spirit of mischief possessed her lessinghams manner was baffling and yet provocative for a moment the political possibilities of his presence faded away from her mind she had an intense desire to break through his reserve  wont you tell mewhy you came  i could tell you more easily he answered in a low tone why it will be the most miserable day of my life when i leave  she laughed at him with perfect heartiness  how delightful to be flirted with again she sighed and i thought all german men were so heavy and paid elaborate underdone compliments still your secret sir please that is what i want to know  if you will have just a little patience he begged leaning so close to her that their heads almost touched i promise that i will not leave this place before i tell it to you  philippas eyes for the first time dropped before his she knew perfectly well what she ought to have done and she was singularly indisposed to do it it was a most piquant adventure after all and it almost helped her to forget the trouble which had been sitting so heavily in her heart still avoiding his eyes she called the others  we are quite ready for bridge she announced  they played four or five rubbers lessingham was by far the most expert player and he and philippa in the end were the winners the two men stood together for a moment or two at the sideboard helping themselves to whisky and soda griffiths had become more taciturn than ever and even philippa was forced to admit that the latter part of the evening had scarcely been a success  do you play club bridge in town mr lessingham griffiths asked  never was the calm reply  you are head and shoulders above our class down here  very good of you to say so lessingham replied courteously i held good cards tonight  i wonder griffiths went on dropping his voice a little and keeping his eyes fixed upon his companion what the german substitute for bridge is  i wonder lessingham echoed  as a nation his questioner proceeded they probably dont waste as much time on cards as we do  lessinghams interest in the subject appeared to be nonexistent he strolled away from the sideboard towards philippa she for her part was watching captain griffiths  so many thanks lady cranston lessingham murmured for your hospitality  and what about that secret she asked  you see there are two he answered looking down at her one i shall most surely tell you before i leave here because it is the one secret which no man has ever succeeded in keeping to himself as for the other  he hesitated there was something almost like pain in his face she broke in hastily  i did not call you away to ask about either i happened to notice captain griffiths just now do you know that he is watching you very closely  i had an idea of it lessingham admitted indifferently he is rather a clumsy person is he not  you will be careful she begged earnestly remember wont you that helen and i are really in a most disgraceful position if anything should come out  nothing shall he promised her i think you know do you not that whatever might happen to me i should find some means to protect you  for the second time she felt a curious lack of will to fittingly reprove his boldness she had even to struggle to keep her tone as careless as her words  you really are a delightful person she exclaimed how long is it since you descended from the clouds  sometimes i think that i am there still he answered but i have known you about seventysix hours  what precision she laughed its a national characteristic isnt it captain griffiths she continued as she observed his approach if you really must go please take mr lessingham with you he is making fun of me i dont allow even dicks friends to do that  lessinghams disclaimer was in quite the correct vein  you must both come again very soon their hostess concluded as she shook hands i enjoyed our bridge immensely  the two men were already on their way to the door when a sudden idea seemed to occur to captain griffiths he turned back  bytheby lady cranston he asked have you heard anything from your brother  philippa shook her head sadly helen who unlike her friend had not had the advantage of a distinguished career upon the amateur dramatic stage turned away and held a handkerchief to her eyes  not a word was philippas sorrowful reply  captain griffiths offered a clumsy expression of his sympathy  bad luck he said im so sorry lady cranston good night once more  this time their departure was uninterrupted helen removed her handkerchief from her eyes and philippa made a little grimace at the closed door  do you believe helen asked seriously that captain griffiths has any suspicions  philippa shrugged her shoulders  if he has who cares she replied a little defiantly the very idea of a duel of wits between those two men is laughable  perhaps so helen agreed with a shade of doubt in her tone    chapter x   philippa and helen started a few mornings later for one of their customary walks the crystalline october sunshine in which every distant tree and seaward each slowly travelling steamer seemed to gain a new clearness of outline lay upon the deepploughed fields the yellowing bracken and the redgold of the bending trees while the west wind which had strewn the sea with whiteflecked waves brought down the leaves to form a carpet for their feet and played strange music along the woodcrested slope in the broken land through which they made their way a land of trees and moorland with here and there a cultivated patch the yellow gorse still glowed in unexpected corners queer scentless flowers made splashes of colour in the hedgerows a rabbit scurried sometimes across their path a cock pheasant after a moments amazed stare lowered his head and rushed for unnecessary shelter the longer they looked upwards the bluer seemed the sky the grass beneath their feet was as green and soft as in springtime driven by the wind here and there a whitewinged gull sailed over their headsa cloud of them rested upon a freshly turned little square of ploughed land between two woods a flight of pigeons like torn leaves tossed about by the wind circled and drifted above them philippa seated herself upon the trunk of a fallen tree and gazed contentedly about her  if i had a lookingglass and a few more hairpins i should be perfectly happy she sighed i am sure my hair must look awful  helen glanced at it admiringly  i decline to say the correct thing she declared i will only remind you that there will be no one here to look at it  i am not so sure philippa replied these are the woods which the special constables haunt by day and by night they gaze up every tree trunk for a wireless installation and they lie behind hedges and watch for mysterious flashes  are you suggesting that we may meet mr lessingham helen enquired lazily i am perfectly certain that he knows nothing of the equipment of the melodramatic spy as to zeppelins dont you remember he told us that he hated them and was terrified of bombs  my dear philippa remonstrated mr lessingham does nothing crude  and yet helen began  yet i suppose the man has something at the back of his head philippa interrupted sometimes i think that he has sometimes i believe that richard must have shown him my picture and he has come over here to see if i am really like it  he does behave rather like that her companion admitted drily  phillipa turned and looked at her  helen she said severely dont be a cat  if i were to express my opinion of your behaviour helen went on picking up a pine cone and examining it i might astonish you  you have an evil mind philippa yawned producing her cigarette case what you really resent is that mr lessingham sometimes forgets to talk about dick  the poor man doesnt get much chance helen retorted watching the blue smoke from her cigarette and leaning back with an air of content whatever do you and he find to talk about philippa  literatureenglish and german philippa murmured demurely mr lessingham is remarkably well read and he knows more about our english poets than any man i have met for years  i forgot that you enjoyed that sort of thing  once more dont be a cat philippa enjoined if you want me to confess it i will own up at once you know what a simple little thing i am i admire mr lessingham exceedingly and i find him a most interesting companion  you mean her friend observed drily the baron maderstrom philippa looked around and frowned  you are most indiscreet helen she declared i have learnt something of the science of espionage lately and i can assure you that all spoken or written words are dangerous there is a thoroughly british squirrel in that tree overhead and i am sure he heard  i suppose the sunshine has got into your head helen groaned  if you mean that i am finding it a relief to talk nonsense you are right philippa assented as a matter of fact i am feeling most depressed henry telephoned from somewhere or other before breakfast this morning to say that he should probably be home tonight or tomorrow they must have landed somewhere down the coast  you are a most undutiful wife helen pronounced severely i am sure henry is a delightful person even if he is a little irresponsible and it is almost pathetic to remember how much you were in love with him a year or two ago  some of the lightness vanished from philippas face  that was before the war she sighed  i still think henry is a dear though i dont altogether understand him helen said thoughtfully  no doubt philippa assented but youd find the not understanding him a little more galling if you were his wife you see i didnt know that i was marrying a sort of sporting mr skimpole  i wonder helen reflected how henry and mr lessingham will get on when they see more of one another  i really dont care philippa observed indifferently  i used to notice sometimesthat was soon after you were married helen continued that henry was just a little inclined to be jealous  philippa withdrew her eyes from the sea there was a queer little smile upon her lips  well if he still is she said ill give him something to be jealous about  poor mr lessingham helen murmured  philippas eyebrows were raised  poor mr lessingham she repeated i dont think youll find that hell be in the least sorry for himself  he may be in earnest helen reminded her friend you can be horribly attractive when you like you know philippa  philippa smiled sweetly  it is just possible she said that i may be in earnest myself ive quarrelled pretty desperately with henry you know and im a helpless creature without a little admiration  helen rose suddenly to her feet her eyes were fixed upon a figure approaching through the wood  you really arent respectable philippa she declared throw away your cigarette for heavens sake and sit up some one is coming  philippa only moved her head lazily the sunlight which came down in a thousand little zigzags through the windtossed trees fell straight upon her rather pale defiant little face with its unexpressed evasive charm and seemed to find a new depth of colour in the redgold of her disordered hair her slim perfect body was stretched almost at full length one leg drawn a little up her hands carelessly drooping towards the grass the cigarette was still burning in the corner of her lips  i decline she said to throw away my cigarette for any one  least of all i trust a familiar voice interposed for me  philippa sat upright at once smoothed her hair and looked a little resentfully at lessingham he was wearing a brown tweed knickerbocker suit and he carried a gun under his arm  whatever are you doing up here she demanded and do you know anything about our game laws you cant come out into the woods here and shoot things just because you feel like it  he disposed of his gun and seated himself between them  that is quite all right he assured her your neighbour mr windover to whom these woods apparently belong asked me to bring my gun out this morning and try and get a woodcock  gracious you dont mean that mr windover is here too philippa demanded looking around lessingham shook his head  his car came for him at the other side of the wood he explained he was wanted to go on the bench i elected to walk home  and the woodcock she asked i adore woodcock  he produced one from his pocket took up her felt hat which was lying amongst the bracken and busied himself insinuating the pin feathers under the silk band  there he said handing it to her the first woodcock of the season we got four and i really only accepted one in the hope that you would like it i shall leave it with the estimable mills on my return  you must come and share it philippa insisted those boys of noras are coming in to dinner your gift shall be the piece de resistance  then may i dine another night he begged this place encourages in me the grossest of appetites  have no fear she replied you will never see that woodcock again i shall have it for my luncheon tomorrow i ordered dinner before i came out and though it may be a simple feast i promise that you shall not go away hungry  will you promise that you will never send me away hungry he asked dropping his voice for a moment  she turned and studied him helen who had strolled a few yards away was kneedeep in the golden brown bracken picking some gorgeously coloured leaves from a solitary bramble bush lessingham had thrown his cap onto the ground and his windtossed hair and the unusual colour in his cheeks were both in their way becoming his loose but wellfitting country clothes his tie and soft collar were all wellchosen and suitable she admired his high forehead and his firm rather proud mouth his eyes as well as his tone were full of seriousness  you know that you ought to be saying that to some gretchen away across that terrible north sea she laughed  there is no gretchen who has ever made my heart shake as you do he whispered  she picked up her hat and sighed  really she said i think things are quite complicated enough as they are i am in a flutter all day long as it is about your mission here and your real identity i simply could not include a flirtation amongst my excitements  i have never flirted he assured her gravely  wise man she pronounced rising to her feet come let us go and help helen pick leaves she is scratching her fingers terribly and im sure you have a knife a dear economical creature helen she added as they strolled along i am perfectly certain that those are destined to adorn my diningtable and with chrysanthemums at sixpence each you cant imagine how welcome they are come produce the knife mr lessingham  the knife was forthcoming and presently they all turned their faces homeward philippa arrested both her companions on the outskirts of the wood and pointed to the redtiled little town to the sombre stormbeaten grey church on the edge of the cliff to the peaceful fields the stretch of gorsesprinkled common and the rolling stretch of green turf on the crown of the cliffs beyond was the foamflecked blue sea dotted all over with cargo steamers  would one believe she asked satirically that there should be scope here in this forgotten little spot for the brains of amr lessingham  remember that i was sent he protested the error if error there be is not mine  and after all helen reminded them both think how easily one may be misled by appearances you couldnt imagine anything more honest than the faces of the villagers and the fishermen one sees about yet do you know mr lessingham that we were visited by burglars last night  seriously he asked  without a doubt of course mainsail haul is an invitation to thieves they could get in anywhere last night they chose the french windows and seem to have made themselves at home in the library  i trust lessingham said that they did not take anything of value  they took nothing at all philippa sighed that is the humiliating part of it they evidently didnt like our things  how do you know that you had burglars if they took nothing away lessingham enquired  so practical philippa murmured as a matter of fact i heard some one moving about and i rang the alarm bell mills was downstairs almost directly and we heard some one running down the drive the french windows were open a chair was overturned in the library and a drawer in my husbands desk was wide open  the proof lessingham admitted is overwhelming you were visited by a burglar does your husband keep anything of value in his desk  henry hasnt anything of value in the world philippa replied drily except his securities and they are at the bank  without going so far as to contradict you lessingham observed with a smile i still venture to disagree    chapter xi   sir henry stepped back from the scales and eyed the fish which they had been weighing admiringly  you see that mills you see that jimmy he pointed out six and threequarter pounds i was right almost to an ounce hes a fine fellow  a very extraordinary fish sir the butler observed will you allow me to take your oilskins dinner was served nearly an hour ago  sir henry slipped off his dripping overalls and handed them over  thats all right he replied listen dont say a word about my arrival to your mistress at present i have some writing to do bring me a glass of sherry at once or mix a cocktail if you can do so without being missed and take jimmy away and give him some whisky and soda  but what about your own dinner sir  ill have a tray in the gun room his master decided say in twenty minutes time and mills who did you say were dining  two of the young officers from the depot sirmr harrison and mr sinclairand mr hamar lessingham  lessingham eh sir henry repeated as he seated himself before his writingtable mills he added in a confidential whisper what port did you serve  the butlers expression was one of conscious rectitude  not the vintage sir he announced with emphasis some very excellent wood port which we procured for shooting luncheons the young gentlemen like it  youre a jewel mills his master declared now you understandan aperitif for me now some whisky for jimmy in your room and not a word about my being here good night jimmy sorry we were too late for the mackerel but we had some grand sport all the same youll have a day or twos rest ashore now  aye aye sir dumble replied we got in just in time theres something more than a squall coming up norards  sir henry listened for a moment the french windows shook the rain beat against the panes and a dull booming of wind was clearly audible from outside  we timed that excellently he agreed come up and have a chat tomorrow jimmy if your wife will spare you  ill be round before eleven sir the fisherman promised with a grin  sir henry waited for the closing of the door then he leaned forward for several moments he had scarcely the appearance of a man returned from a week or two of openair life and indulgence in the sport he loved best the healthy tan of his complexion was lessened rather than increased there were black lines under his eyes which seemed to speak of sleepless nights and a beard of several days growth was upon his chin he drank the cocktail which mills presently brought him at a gulp and watched with satisfaction while the mixer was vigorously shaken and a second one poured out  weve had a rough time mills he observed as he set down the glass until this morning it scarcely left off blowing  im sorry to hear it sir was the respectful reply if i may be allowed to say so sir youre looking tired  i am tired sir henry admitted i think if i tried i could go to sleep now for twentyfour hours  you will pardon my reminding you so far as regards your letters that there is no post out tonight sir mills proceeded i have prepared a warm bath and laid out your clothes for a change  capital sir henry exclaimed it isnt a letter thats bothering me though mills there are just a few geographical notes i want to make you know im trying to improve the fishermens chart of the coast round here that fellow groocockjimmy dumbles unclevery nearly lost his motor boat last week through trusting to the old one  just so sir mills replied deferentially placing the empty glass upon his tray if youll excuse me sir i must get back to the dining room  quite right his master assented they wont be out just yet will they  her ladyship will probably be rising in about ten minutes sirnot before that  sir henry nodded a little impatiently directly the door was closed he rose to his feet stood for a moment listening by the side of his fishing cabinet then opened the glass front and touched the spring with the aid of a little electric torch which he took from his pocket he studied particularly a certain portion of the giant chart made some measurements with a pencil some notes in the margin and closed it up again with an air of satisfaction then he resumed his seat drew a folded slip of paper from his breast pocket a chart from another turned up the lamp and began to write his face as he stooped low escaped the soft shade and was for a moment almost ghastly every now and then he turned and made some calculations on the blottingpaper by his side at last he leaned back with a little sigh of relief he had barely done so before the door behind him was opened  are we going to stay in here mummy or are we going into the drawingroom nora asked  in here i think he heard philippa reply  then they both came in followed by helen nora was the first to see him and rushed forward with a little cry of surprise  why heres dad she exclaimed flinging her arms around his neck daddy how dare you be sitting here all by yourself whilst we are having dinner when did you get back what a fish  sir henry closed down his desk embraced his daughter and came forward to meet his wife  fine fellow isnt he nora he agreed well philippa how are you pleased to see me i hope another new frock i believe and in war time  fancy your remembering that it was war time she answered standing very still while he leaned over and kissed her  nasty one for me sir henry observed goodhumouredly how well youre looking helen any news of dick yet  helen attempted an expression of extreme gravity with more or less success  nothing fresh she answered  well well no news may be good news sir henry remarked consolingly jove its good to feel a roof over ones head again this morning has been the only patch of decent weather weve had  this morning was lovely helen assented philippa and i went and sat up in the woods  philippa who was standing by the fire turned and looked at her husband critically  we have some men dining she said they will be out in a few minutes dont you think you had better go and make yourself presentable you smell of fish and you look as though you hadnt shaved for a week  guilty my dear sir henry admitted mills is just getting me something to eat in the gun room and then i am going to have a bath and change my clothes  and shave dad nora reminded him  and shave you young pest her father agreed patting her on the shoulder run away and play billiards with helen i want to talk to your mother until my dinners ready  nora acquiesced promptly  come along helen ill give you twentyfive up or perhaps youd like to play shell out she proposed arthur sinclair says i have improved in my potting more than any one he ever knew  sir henry opened the door and closed it after them then he returned and seated himself on the lounge by philippas side she glanced up at him as though in surprise and stretching out her hand towards her workbasket took up some knitting  i really think i should change at once if i were you she suggested  presently i had a sort of foolish idea that id like to have a word or two with you first ive been away for nearly a fortnight havent i  you have philippa assented perhaps that is the reason why i feel that i havent very much to say to you  that sounds just a trifle hard he said slowly  i am hard sometimes philippa confessed you know that quite well there are times when i just feel as though i had no heart at all nor any sympathy when every sensation i might have had seems shrivelled up inside me  is that how you are feeling at the present time towards me philippa he asked  her needles flashed through the wool for a moment in silence  you had every warning she told him i tried to make you understand exactly how your behaviour disgusted me before you went away  yes i remember he admitted im afraid dear you think i am a worthless sort of a fellow  philippa had apparently dropped a stitch she bent lower still over her knitting there was a distinct frown upon her forehead her mouth was unrecognisable  your friend lessingham is here still i understand her husband remarked presently  yes philippa assented he is dining tonight you will probably see him in a few minutes  sir henry looked thoughtful and studied for a moment the toe of a remarkably unprepossessing looking shoe  youre so keen about that sort of thing he said what about lessingham he is not soldiering or anything is he  i have no idea philippa replied he walks with a slight limp and admits that he is here as a convalescent but he hasnt told us very much about himself  i wonder you havent tackled him sir henry continued youre such an ardent recruiter you ought to make sure that he is doing his bit of butchery  philippa looked up at her husband for a moment and back at her work  mr lessingham she said is a very delightful friend whose stay here every one is enjoying very much but he is a comparative stranger i feel no responsibility as to his actions  and you do as to mine  naturally  sir henrys head was resting on his hand his elbow on the back of the lounge he seemed to be listening to the voices in the dining room beyond  hm he observed has he been here often while ive been away  as often as he chose philippa replied he has become very popular in the neighbourhood already and he is an exceedingly welcome guest here at any time  takes advantage of your hospitality pretty often doesnt he  he is here most days we are always rather disappointed when he doesnt come  sir henrys frown grew a little deeper  whats the attraction he demanded  philippa smiled it was the smile which those who knew her best feared  well she confided i used to imagine that it was helen but i think that he has become a little bored talking about nothing but dick and their college days i am rather inclined to fancy that it must be me  you indeed he grunted are you aware that you are a married woman  philippa glanced up from her work her eyebrows were raised and her expression was one of mild surprise  how queer that you should remind me of it she murmured i am afraid that the sea air disturbs your memory  sir henry rose abruptly to his feet  oh damn he exclaimed  he walked to the door his guests were still lingering over their wine he could hear their voices more distinctly than ever then he came back to the sofa and stood by philippas side  philippa old girl he pleaded dont let us quarrel i have had such a hard fortnight a noreaster blowing all the time and the dirtiest seas ive ever known at this time of the year for five days i hadnt a dry stitch on me and it was touch and go more than once we were all in the water together and there was a nasty green wave that looked like a mountain overhead and the side of our own boat bending over us as though it meant to squeeze our ribs in it looked like ten to one against us phil and i got a worse chill than the sea ever gave me when i thought that i shouldnt see you again  philippa laid down her knitting she looked searchingly into her husbands face she was very far from indifferent to his altered tone  henry she said that sounds very terrible but why do you run such risksunworthily do you think that i couldnt give you all that you want all that i have to give if you came home to me with a story like this and i knew that you had been facing death righteously and honourably for your countrys sake why henry there isnt a man in the world could have such a welcome as i could give you do you think i am cold of course you dont do you think i want to feel as i have done this last fortnight towards you why its misery it makes me feel inclined to commit any folly any madness to get rid of it all  her husband hesitated a frown had darkened his face he had the air of one who is on the eve of a confession  philippa he began you know that when i go out on these fishing expeditions i also put in some work at the new chart which i am so anxious to prepare for the fishermen  philippa shook her head impatiently  dont talk to me about your fishermen henry im as sick with them as i am with you you can see twenty or thirty of them any morning lounging about the quay strapping young fellows who shelter themselves behind the plea of privileged employment we are notorious down here for our skulkers and youyou who should be the one man to set them an example are as bad as they are you deliberately encourage them  sir henry abandoned his position by his wifes side his face darkened and his eyes flashed  skulkers he repeated furiously  philippa looked at him without flinching  yes dont you like the word  the angry flush faded from his cheeks as quickly as it had come he laughed a little unnaturally took up a cigarette from an open box and lit it  it isnt a pleasant one is it philippa he observed thrusting his hands into his jacket pockets strolling away if one doesnt feel the callwell there you are you see jove thats a fine fish  he stood admiring the codling upon the scales philippa continued her work  if you intend to spend the rest of the evening with us she told him calmly please let me remind you again that we have guests for dinner your present attire may be comfortable but it is scarcely becoming  he turned away and came back towards her as he passed the lamp she started  why youre wet she exclaimed wet through  of course i am he admitted feeling his sleeve but to tell you the truth in the interest of our conversation i had quite forgotten it here come our guests before i have had time to escape i can hear your friend lessinghams voice    chapter xii   the three dinner guests entered together lessingham in the middle sir henrys presence was obviously a surprise to all of them  no idea that you were back sir harrison observed shaking hands  sir henry greeted them all goodhumouredly i turned up about three quarters of an hour ago he explained just too late to join you at dinner  bad luck sir sinclair remarked i hope that you had good sport  not so bad sir henry admitted we had to go far enough for it though what do you think of that for an october codling  they all approached the scales and admired the fish sir henry stood with his hands in his pockets listening to their comments  you are enjoying your stay here i hope mr lessingham he enquired  one could scarcely fail to enjoy even the briefest holiday in so delightfully hospitable a place was the somewhat measured reply  youre by way of being a fisherman yourself i hear sir henry continued  in a very small way lessingham acknowledged i have been out once or twice  with ben oates eh  i believe that was the mans name  philippa glanced up from her work with a little exclamation of surprise  i had no idea of that mr lessingham whatever made you choose ben oates he is a most disgraceful person  it was entirely by accident lessingham explained i met him on the front it happened to be a fine morning and he was rather pressing in his invitation  im afraid he didnt show you much sport sir henry observed from what jimmy dumbles brother told him he seems to have taken you in entirely the wrong direction and on the wrong tide  we had a small catch lessingham replied i really went more for the sail than the sport so i was not disappointed  the coast itself sir henry remarked is rather an interesting one  i should imagine so lessingham assented mr ben oates indeed told me some wonderful stories about it he spoke of broad channels down which a dreadnought could approach within a hundred yards of the land  he is quite right too his host agreed  theres a lot of deep water about here the whole of the coast is very curious in that way what thewhat the dickens is this  sir henry who had been strolling about the room picked up a homburg hat from the far side of a table of curios philippa glanced up at his exclamation  thats noras trophy she explained i told her to take it up to her own room but shes always wanting to show it to her friends  noras trophy sir henry repeated why its nothing but an ordinary mans hat  nevertheless its a very travelled one sir harrison pointed out miss nora picked it up on dutchmans common the morning after the observation car was found there  sir henry held out the hat  but nora doesnt seriously suppose that the germans come over in this sort of headgear does she he demanded  if youll just look inside the lining sir sinclair suggested  sir henry turned it up and whistled softly by jove its a german hat all right he exclaimed doesnt look a bad shape either  he tried it on there was a little peal of laughter from the men philippa had ceased her knitting and was watching from the couch sir henry looked at himself in the lookingglass  well thats funny he observed i shouldnt have thought it would have been so much too small for me here just try how youd look in it mr lessingham he added handing it across to him  lessingham accepted the situation quite coolly and placed the hat carefully on his head  it doesnt feel particularly comfortable he remarked  that may be sir henry suggested because you have it on wrong side foremost if youd just turn it round i believe you would find it a very good fit  lessingham at once obeyed sir henry regarded him with admiration  excellent he exclaimed look at that philippa might have been made for him eh  lessingham looked at himself in the glass and removed the hat from his head with some casual observation he was entirely at his ease his host turned towards the door which mills was holding open  captain griffiths sir the latter announced  sir henry greeted his visitor briefly  how are you griffiths he said glad to see you excuse my costume but i am just back from a fishing expedition we are all admiring mr lessingham in his magic hat  captain griffiths shook hands with philippa nodded to the others and turned towards lessingham  put it on again theres a good fellow lessingham sir henry begged you see we have found a modern version of cinderellas slipper the hat which fell from the zeppelin on to dutchmans common fits our friend like a glove i never thought the germans made such good hats did you griffiths  i always thought they imported their felt hats captain griffiths acknowledged is that really the one with the german name inside which miss nora brought home  this is the genuine article lessingham assented taking it from his head and passing it on to the newcomer notwithstanding the name inside i should still believe that it was an english hat it feels too comfortable for anything else  the commandant took the hat to a lamp and examined it carefully he drew out the lining and looked all the way round suddenly he gave vent to a little exclamation  here are the owners initials he declared rather faint but still distinguishableb m hm theres no doubt about its being a german hat  b m sir henry muttered looking over his shoulder how very interesting b m he repeated turning to philippa who had recommenced her knitting is it my fancy or is there something a little familiar about that  i am sure that i have no idea philippa replied it conveys nothing to me  there was a brief but apparently pointless silence philippas needles flashed through her wool with easy regularity lessingham appeared to be sharing the mild curiosity which the others showed concerning the hat sir henry was standing with knitted brows in the obvious attitude of a man seeking to remember something  b m he murmured softly to himself there was some one ive known or heard of in englandwhats that mills  your dinner is served sir mills who had made a silent entrance announced  sir henry apparently thought no more of the hat or its possible owner he threw it upon a neighbouring table and his face expressed a new interest in life  jove im ravenous he confessed youll excuse me wont you mills see that these gentlemen have cigars and cigarettesin the billiard room i should think youll find the young people there ill come in and have a game of pills later  the two young soldiers with captain griffiths followed sir henry at once from the room lessingham however lingered he stood with his hands behind him looking at the closed door  are you going to stay and talk nonsense with me mr lessingham philippa asked  if i may he answered without changing his position  philippa looked at him curiously  do you see ghosts through that door  he shook his head  do you know he said as he seated himself by her side there are times when i find your husband quite interesting    chapter xiii   philippa leaned back in her place  exactly what do you mean by that mr lessingham she demanded  he shook himself free from a curious sense of unreality and turned towards her  i must confess he said that sometimes your husband puzzles me  not nearly so much as he puzzles me philippa retorted a little bitterly  has he always been so desperately interested in deepsea fishing  philippa shrugged her shoulders  more or less but never quite to this extent the thing has become an obsession with him lately if you are really going to stay and talk with me do you mind if we dont discuss my husband just now the subject is rather a painful one with me  i can quite understand that lessingham murmured sympathetically  what do you think of captain griffiths she asked a little abruptly  i have thought nothing more about him should i is he of any real importance  he is military commandant here  lessingham nodded thoughtfully  i suppose that means that he is the man who ought to be on my track he observed  i shouldnt be in the least surprised to hear that he was philippa said drily i have told you that he came and asked about you the other night when he dined here he seemed perfectly satisfied then but he is here again tonight to see henry and he never visits anywhere in an ordinary way  are you uneasy about me lessingham enquired  i am not sure she answered frankly sometimes i am almost terrified and would give anything to hear that you were on your way home and at other times i realise that you are really very clever that nothing is likely to happen to you and that the place will seem duller than ever when you do go  that is very kind of you he said in any case i fear that my holiday will soon be coming to an end  your holiday she repeated is that what you call it  it has been little else he replied indifferently there is nothing to be learnt here of the slightest military significance  we told you that when you arrived philippa reminded him  i was perhaps foolish not to believe you he acknowledged  so your very exciting journey through the clouds has ended in failure after all she went on a moment or two later  failure no i should not call it failure  you have really made some discoveries then she enquired dubiously  i have made the greatest discovery in the world  her eyebrows were gently raised the corners of her mouth quivered her eyes fell  dear me in this quiet spot she sighed  yes  is it helen or me  philippa he protested  her eyebrows were more raised than ever her mouth had lost its alluring curve  really mr lessingham she exclaimed have i ever given you the right to call me by my christian name  in my country he answered we do not wait to ask we take  rank prussianism she murmured i really think you had better go back there you are adopting their methods  i may have to at any moment he admitted or to some more distant country still i want something to take back with me  you want a keepsake of course philippa declared looking around the room you can have my photographthe one over there helen will give you one of hers too i am sure if you ask her she is just as grateful to you about richard as i am  but from you he said earnestly i want more than gratitude  dear me how persistent you are philippa murmured are you really determined to make love to me  ah dont mock me he begged what i am saying to you comes from my heart  philippa laughed at him quietly there was just a little break in her voice however  dont be absurd  there is nothing absurd about it he replied with a note of sadness in his tone i felt it from the moment we met i struggled against it but i have felt it growing day by day i came here with my mind filled with different purposes i had no thought of amusing myself no thought of seeking here the happiness which up till now i seem to have missed i came as a servant because i was sent a mechanical being you have changed everything for you i feel what i have never felt for any woman before i place before you my career my freedom my honour  philippa sighed very softly  do you mind ringing the bell she begged  the bell he repeated what for  i want helen to hear you she confided with a wonderful little smile  philippa dont mock me he pleaded if this is only amusement to you tell me so and let me go away it is the first time in my life that a woman has come between me and my work i am no longer master of myself i am obsessed with you i want nothing else in life but your love  there was an almost startling change in philippas face the banter which had served her with so much effect which she had relied upon as her defensive weapon was suddenly useless lessingham had created an atmosphere around him an atmosphere of sincerity  are you in earnest she faltered  god knows i am he insisted  youyou care for me  so much he answered passionately that for your sake i would sacrifice my honour my country my life  but ive only known you for such a short time philippa protested and youre an enemy  i discard my birth i renounce my adopted country he declared fiercely you have swept my life clear of every scrap of ambition and patriotism you have filled it with one thing onlya great consuming love  have you forgotten my husband  do you think that if he had been a different sort of man i should have dared to speak ask yourself how you can continue to live with him you can call him which you will both are equally disgraceful your heart knows the truth he is either a coward or a philanderer  philippas cheeks were suddenly white her eyes flashed his words had stung her to the quick  a coward she repeated furiously you dare to call henry that  lessingham rose abruptly to his feet he moved restlessly about the room his fists were clenched his tone thick with passion  i do he pronounced philippa look at this matter without prejudice do you believe that there is a single man of any country of your husbands age and rank who would be content to trawl the seas for fish whilst his countrys blood is being drained dry who would weigh a codling he added pointing scornfully to the scales whilst the funeral march of heroes is beating throughout the world the thing is insensate impossible  philippas head drooped her hands were nervously intertwined  dont she pleaded i have suffered so much  forgive me he begged with a sudden change of voice if i am mistaken in your husbandand there is always the chancei am sorry i will confess that i myself had a different opinion of him but i can only judge from what i have seen and from that there is no one in the world who would not agree with me that your husband is unworthy of you  oh please stop philippa cried stop at once  lessingham came back to his place by her side his voice was still shaking but it had grown very soft  philippa forgive me he repeated if you only knew how it hurts to see you like this yet i must speak there is just once in every mans lifetime when he must tell the truth that time has come with mei love you  so does my husband she murmured  i will only remind you then that he shows it in strange fashion lessingham continued he sets your wishes at defiance he who should be an example in a small place like this is only an object of contempt in the neighbourhood even i who have only lived here for so short a time have caught the burden of what people say  philippa wiped her eyes  please do you mind she begged not saying anything more about henry you are only reminding me of things which i try all the time to forget  believe me lessingham answered wistfully i am only too content to ignore him to forget that he exists to remember only that you are the woman who has changed my life  philippa looked at him in something like dismay rather like a child who has started an engine which she has no idea how to stop  but you must notyou must not talk to me like this  his hand closed upon hers it lay in his grasp unyielding cold yet passive  why not he whispered i have the one unalterable right and i am willing to pay the great price  right she faltered  the right of loving youthe right of loving you better than any woman in the world  there was a queer silence only partly due as she was instantly aware to the emotion of the moment a door behind them had opened philippas quicker senses had recognised her husbands footsteps lessingham rose deliberately to his feet in his heart he welcomed the interruption this might perhaps be the decisive moment sir henry was strolling towards them his manner and his tone however were alike goodnatured  i was to order you into the billiard room mr lessingham he announced sinclair has been sent fora night route march or some such horrorand they want you to make a four  lessingham hesitated he had a passionate inclination to face the situation to tell this man the truth sir henrys courteous indifference however was like a harrier he recognised the inevitable  i am afraid i am rather out of practice he said but i shall be delighted to do my best    chapter xiv   sir henry was obviously not in the best of tempers for a mildmannered and easygoing man his expression was scarcely normal  that fellow was making love to you he said bluntly as soon as the door was closed behind lessingham  philippa looked up at her husband with an air of pleasant candour  he was doing it very nicely too she admitted  you mean to say that you let him  i listened to what he had to say she confessed it didnt occur to you i suppose her husband remarked with somewhat strained sarcasm that you were another mans wife  i am doing my best to forget that fact philippa reminded him  i see and he is to help you  possibly  sir henrys irritation was fast merging into anger  i shall turn the fellow out of the house he declared  philippa shrugged her shoulders  why dont you  he seated himself on the couch by his wifes side look here philippa dont lets wrangle he begged im afraid youll have to make up your mind to see a good deal less of your friend lessingham anyway  philippas brows were knitted she was conscious of a vague uneasiness  really and why  for one thing her husband explained because i dont intend to have him hanging about my house during my absence  the best way to prevent that would be not to go away philippa suggested  well in all probability he announced guardedly i am not going away againat least not just yet  philippas manner suddenly changed she laid down her work her hand rested lightly upon her husbands shoulder  you mean that you are going to give up those horrible fishing excursions of yours  for the present i am he assured her  and are you going to do somethingsome work i mean she asked breathlessly  for the immediate present i am going to stay at home and look after you he replied  philippas face fell her manner became notably colder  you are very wise she declared mr lessingham is a most fascinating person we are all half in love with himeven helen  the fellow must have a way with him sir henry conceded grudgingly as a rule the people here are not overkeen on strangers unless they have immediate connections in the neighbourhood even griffiths who since they made him commandant is a man of many suspicions seems inclined to accept him  captain griffiths dined here the other night philippa remarked and i noticed that he and mr lessingham seemed to get on very well  the fellows all right in his way no doubt sir henry began  of course he is philippa interrupted helen likes him quite as much as i do  does he make love to helen too sir henry ventured  dont talk nonsense philippa retorted he isnt that sort of a man at all if he has made love to me he has done so because i have encouraged him and if i have encouraged him it is your fault  sir henry with an impatient exclamation rose from his place and took a cigarette from an open box  quite time i stayed at home i can see all the same the fellows rather a puzzle i cant help wondering how he succeeded in making such an easy conquest of a lady who has scarcely been notorious for her flirtations and a young woman who is madly in love with another man he hasnt  hasnt what  he hasnt sir henry continued blowing out the match which he had been holding to his cigarette and throwing it away been in the position of being able to render you or helen any service has he  i dont understand you philippa replied a little uneasily  theres nothing to understand sir henry went on i was simply trying to find some explanation for his veni vidi vici  i dont think you need go any further than the fact philippa observed that he is wellbred charming and companionable  incidentally sir henry queried do you happen to have come across any one here who ever heard of him before  i dont remember any one philippa replied he was at college with richard you know  sir henry nodded  of course thats a wonderful introduction to you and helen he admitted and bytheby that reminds me he went on i never saw such a change in two women in my life as in you and helen a few weeks ago you were fretting yourselves to death about dick now you dont seem to mention him you both of you look as though you hadnt a care in the world and yet you say you havent heard from him upon my word this is getting to be a house of mysteries  the only mystery in it that i can see is you henry she declared  me he protested im one of the simplestminded fellows alive what is there mysterious about me  your ignominious life was the cold reply  jove i got it that time he groanedgot it in the neck but didnt i tell you just now that i was turning over a new leaf  then prove it philippa pleaded let me write to rayton and beg him to use his influence to get you something to do i am sure you would be happier and i cant tell you what a difference it would make to me  its that indoor work i couldnt stick old thing he confided you know theyre saying all the time its a young mans war theyd make me take some ones place at home behind a desk  but even if they did she protested even if they put you in a coal cellar wouldnt you be happier to feel that you were helping your country wouldnt you be glad to know that i was happier  sir henry made a wry face  it seems to me that your outlook is a trifle superficial dear he grumbled howevernow what the dickens is the matter  the door had been opened by mills with his usual smoothness but jimmy dumble out of breath and excited pushed his way into the room  hullo what is it jimmy his patron demanded  beg your pardon sir was the almost incoherent reply ive run all the way up and theres a rare wind blowing theres one of ourour trawlers lying off the point and shes sent up three green and six yellow balls  whiting by god sir henry exclaimed  whiting philippa repeated in agonised disgust what does this mean henry  it must be a shoal her husband explained it means that weve got to get amongst them quick is the ida down on the beach jimmy  she there all right sir was the somewhat doubtful reply but usll have a rare job to get away sir that there noreaster is blowing great guns again and its a cruel tide  weve got to get out somehow sir henry declared mills my oilskins and flask at once i shant change a thing but you might bring a cardigan jacket and the whisky and soda  mills withdrew a little dazed philippa whose fingers were clenched together found her tongue at last  henry she exclaimed furiously  what is it my dear  do you mean to tell me that after your promise she continued after what you have just said you are starting out tonight for another fishing expedition  whiting my dear sir henry explained one cant possibly miss whiting where the devil are my keyshere they are now then  he sat down before his desk took some papers from the top drawer rummaged about for a moment or two in another and found what seemed to be a couple of charts in oilskin cases all the time the wind was shaking the windows and a storm of rain was beating against the panes  help yourself to whisky and soda jimmy sir henry invited as he buttoned up his coat youll need it all presently  i thank you kindly sir jimmy replied i am thinking that well both need a drink before were through this night  he helped himself to a whisky and soda on the generous principle of half and half philippa who was watching her husbands preparations indignantly once more found words  henry you are incorrigible she exclaimed listen to me if you please i insist upon it  sir henry turned a little impatiently towards her philippa i really cant stop now he protested but you must you shall she cried you shall hear this much from me at any rate before you go what i said the other day i repeat a thousandfold now  sir henry glanced at dumble and motioned his head towards the door the fisherman made an awkward exit  a thousandfold philippa repeated passionately you hear henry i do not consider myself any more your wife if i am here when you return it will be simply because i find it convenient your conduct is disgraceful and unmanly  my dear girl he remonstrated i may be back in twentyfourpossibly twelve hours  it is a matter of indifference to me when you return was the curt reply i have finished  the door was thrown open  your oilskins sir and flask mills announced hurrying in a little breathless youll forgive my mentioning it sir but it scarcely seems a fit night to leave home  got to be done this once mills his master replied struggling into his coat  the young people from the billiard room suddenly streamed in nora who was still carrying her cue gazed at her father in amazement  why wheres dad going she cried  it appears philippa explained sarcastically that a shoal of whiting has arrived  very uncertain fish whiting sir henry observed here today and gone tomorrow  you wont find it too easy getting off tonight sir harrison remarked doubtfully  jimmy will see to that was the confident reply i expect we shall be amongst them at daybreak goodby everybody goodby philippa  his eyes sought his wifes in vain she had turned towards lessingham  you are not hurrying off are you mr lessingham she asked i want you to show me that new patience  i shall be delighted  sir henry turned slowly away for a moment his face darkened as his eyes met lessinghams he seemed about to speak but changed his mind  well goodby every one he called out i shall be back before midnight if we dont get out  and if you do nora cried  if we do heaven help the whiting    chapter xv   of course were behaving shockingly all three of us philippa declared as she sipped her champagne and leaned back in her seat  you mean by coming to a place like this lessingham queried looking around the crowded restaurant we are not in that case the only sinners  i didnt mean the mere fact of being here philippa explained but being here with you  i forgot he said gloomily that i was such a black sheep  dont be silly she admonished youre nothing of the sort but of course we are skating on rather thin ice if i had henry to consider in any way if he had any sort of a career perhaps i should be more careful as it is i think i feel a little reckless lately dreymarsh has got upon my nerves the things that i thought most of in life seem to have crumbled away  ought i to be sorry he asked i am not  but why are you so unsympathetic  because i am waiting by your side to rebuild he whispered  a tall bronzed young soldier with his arm in a sling stopped before their table and helen after a moments protest and a glance at philippa moved away with him to the little space reserved for the dancers  what a chaperon i am philippa sighed i scarcely know anything about the young man except his name and that he was in dicks regiment  i did not hear it lessingham observed but i feel deeply grateful to him it is so seldom that i have a chance to talk to you alone like this  it seems incredible that we have talked so long philippa said glancing at the watch upon her wrist i really feel now that i know all about youyour school days your college days and your soldiering you have been very frank havent you  i have nothing to concealfrom you he replied if there is anything more you want to know  there is nothing she interrupted uneasily  perhaps you are wise he reflected and yet some day you know you will have to hear it all over and over again  i will not be made love to in a restaurant she declared firmly  you are so particular as to localities he complained you could not see your way clear i suppose to suggest what you would consider a suitable environment  philippa looked at him for a moment very earnestly  ah dont let us play at things we neither of us feel she begged and there is some one there who wants to speak to you  lessingham looked up into the face of the man who had paused before their table as one might look into the face of unexpected death he remained perfectly still but the slight colour seemed slowly to be drawn from his cheeks yet the newcomer himself seemed in no way terrifying he was tall and largely built cleanshaven and with the humourous mouth of an irishman or an american neither was there anything threatening in his speech  glad to run up against you lessingham he said holding out his hand gay crowd here tonight isnt it  very lessingham answered speaking very much like a man in a dream lady cranston will you permit me to introduce my friendmr hayter  philippa was immediately gracious and a few moments passed in trivial conversation then mr hayter prepared to depart  i must be joining my friends he observed look in and see me sometime lessinghamnumber 72 milan court you know what a nightbird i am perhaps you will call and have a final drink with me when you have finished here  i shall be very glad lessingham promised  mr hayter passed on a man apparently of many acquaintances to judge by his interrupted progress lady cranston looked at her companion she was puzzled  is that a recent acquaintance she asked as he addressed you by the name of lessingham  yes was the quiet reply  you dont wish to talk about him  no  helen and her partner returned a few moments later and the little party presently broke up lessingham drove the two women to their hotel in dover street  weve had a most delightful evening philippa assured him as they said good night you are coming round to see us in the morning arent you  if i may lessingham assented  helen found her way into philippas room later on that night she had nerved herself for a very thankless task  may i sit down for a few moments she asked a little nervously your fire is so much better than mine  philippa glanced at her friend through the lookingglass before which she was brushing her hair and made a little grimace she felt a forewarning of what was coming  of course dear she replied have you enjoyed your evening  very much in a way was the somewhat hesitating reply of course nothing really counts until dick comes back but it is nice to talk with some one who knows him  agreeable conversation philippa remarked didactically is one of the greatest pleasures in life  you find mr lessingham very interesting dont you helen asked  philippa finished arranging her hair to her satisfaction and drew up an easychair opposite her visitors  so you want to talk with me about mr lessingham do you  i suppose you know that hes in love with you helen began  i hope he is a little my dear was the smiling reply im sure ive tried my best  wont you talk seriously helen pleaded  i dont altogether see the necessity philippa protested  i do and ill tell you why helen answered i dont think mr lessingham is at all the type of man to which you are accustomed i think that he is in deadly earnest about you i think that he was in deadly earnest from the first you dont really care for him do you dear  very much and yet not perhaps quite in the way you are thinking of was the quiet reply  then please send him away helen begged  my dear how can i philippa objected he has done us an immense service and he cant disobey his orders  you dont want him to go away then  philippa was silent for several moments no she admitted i dont think that i do  you dont care for henry any more  just as much as ever was the somewhat bitter reply thats what i resent so much i should like henry to believe that he had killed every spark of love in me  helen moved across and sat on the arm of her friends chair she felt that she was going to be very daring  have you any idea at the hack of your mind dear she asked of making use of mr lessingham to punish henry  philippa moved a little uneasily  how hatefully downright you are she murmured i dont know  because helen continued if you have any such idea in your mind i think it is most unfair to mr lessingham you know perfectly well that anything else between you and him would be impossible  and why  dont be ridiculous helen exclaimed vigorously mr lessingham may have all the most delightful qualities in the world but he has attached himself to a country which no english man or woman will be able to think of without shuddering for many years to come you cant dream of cutting yourself adrift from your friends and your home and your country its too unnatural im not even arguing with you philippa you couldnt do it im wholly concerned with mr lessingham i cannot forget what we owe him i think it would be hatefully cruel of you to spoil his life  philippas flashes of seriousness were only momentary she made a little grimace she was once more her natural irresponsible self  you underrate my charm helen she declared i really believe that i could make his life instead of spoiling it  and you would pay the price  philippa slim and elflike in the firelight rose from her chair there was a momentary cruelty in her face  i sometimes think she said calmly that i would pay any price in the world to make henry understand how i feel there now run along dear youre full of good intentions and dont think it horrid of me but nothing that you could say would make any difference  you wouldnt do anything rash helen pleaded  well if i run away with mr lessingham i certainly cant promise that ill send cards out first whatever i do impulse will probably decide  impulse  why not i trust mine cant you philippa added with a little shrug of the shoulders  sometimes helen sighed they are such wild horses you know they lead one to such terrible places  and sometimes philippa replied they find their way into the heaven where our soberer thoughts could never take us good night dear    chapter xvi   mr william hayter in the solitude of his chambers at the milan court was a very altered personage he extended no welcoming salutation to his midnight visitor but simply motioned him to a chair  well he began is your task finished that you are in london  my task lessingham replied might just as well never have been entered upon the man you sent me to watch is nothing but an ordinary sportloving englishman  really you have lived as his neighbour for nearly a month and that is your impression of him  it is lessingham assented he has been away seafishing half the time but i have searched his house thoroughly  searched his papers eh  every one i could find and hated the job there are a good many charts of the coast but they are all for the use of the fishermen  wonderful hayter scoffed my young friend you may yet find distinction in some other walk of life our secret service i fancy will very soon be able to dispense with your energies  and i with your secret service lessingham agreed heartily i dare say there may be some branches of it in which existence is tolerable that however does not apply to the task upon which i have been engaged  you have been completely duped hayter told him calmly and the information you have sent us is valueless sir henry cranston instead of being the type of man whom you have described is one of the greatest experts upon coast defense and minelaying in the english admiralty  lessingham laughed shortly  that he declared is perfectly absurd  it is hayter repeated with emphasis the precise truth sir henry crantons fishing excursions are myths he is simply transferred from his fishing boat on to one of a little fleet of socalled mine sweepers from which he conducts his operations nearly every one of the most important towns on the east coast are protected by minefields of his design  lessingham was dumbfounded his companions manner was singularly convincing  but how could sir henry or any one else keep this a secret he protested even his wife is scarcely on speaking terms with him because she believes him to be an idler and the whole neighbourhood gossips over his slackness  the whole neighbourhood is easily fooled hayter retorted there are one or two who know however  there are one or two lessingham observed grimly who are beginning to suspect me  that is a pity hayter admitted because it will be necessary for you to return to dreymarsh at once  return to dreymarsh at once but cranston is away there is nothing for me to do there in his absence  he will be back on wednesday or thursday night was the confident reply he will bring with him the plan of his latest defenses of a town on the east coast which our cruiser squadron purpose to bombard we must have that chart  lessingham listened in mute distress  could you possibly get me relieved he begged the fact is  we could not and we will not hayter interrupted fiercely unless you wish me to denounce you at home as a renegade and a coward you will go through with the work which has been allotted to you your earlier mistakes will be forgiven if that chart is in my hands by friday  but how do you know that he will have it lessingham protested supposing you are right and he is really responsible for the minefields you speak of i should think the last thing he would do would be to bring the chart back to dreymarsh  as a matter of fact that is precisely what he will do hayter assured his listener he is bringing it back for the inspection of one of the commissioners for the east coast defense who is to meet him at his house and i wish to warn you too maderstrom that you will have very little time for some reason or other cranston is dissatisfied with the secrecy under which he has been compelled to work and has applied to the admiralty for recognition of his position immediately this is given i gather that his house will be inaccessible to you  lessingham sat his arms folded his eyes fixed upon the fire his thoughts were in a turmoil yet one thing was hatefully clear cranston was not the unworthy slacker he had believed him to be philippas whole point of view might well be changed by this discoveryespecially now that cranston had made up his mind to assert himself for his wifes sake there was an icy fear in his heart  you understand hayter persisted coldly what it is you have to do  perfectly i shall return by the afternoon train was the despairing reply  if you succeed hayter continued i shall see that you get the usual acknowledgment but i will if you wish it ask for your transfer to another branch of the service i am not questioning your patriotism or your honour maderstrom but you are not the man for this work  you are right lessingham said i am not  it is not my affair hayter proceeded to enquire too closely into the means used by our agents in carrying out our designs that i find you in london in company with the wife of the man whom you are appointed to watch may be a fact capable of the most complete and satisfactory explanation i ask no questions i only remind you that your country even though it be only your adopted country demands from you as from all others in her service unswerving loyalty a loyalty uninfluenced by the claims of personal sentiment duty or honour have i said enough  you have said as much as it is wise for you to say lessingham replied his voice trembling with suppressed passion  that is all then the other concluded you know where to send or bring the chart when you have it if you bring it yourself it is possible that something which you may regard as a reward will be offered to you  lessingham rose a little wearily to his feet his farewell to hayter was cold and lifeless  he left the hotel and started on his homeward way struggling with a sense of intolerable depression the streets through which he passed were sombre and unlit  a zeppelin warning a few hours before had driven the people to their homes there was not a chink of light to be seen anywhere an intense and gloomy stillness seemed to brood over the deserted thoroughfares nightbirds on their way home flitted by like shadows policemen lurked in the shadows of the houses the few vehicles left crawled about with insufficient lights even the warning horns of the taxicab men sounded furtive and repressed lessingham as he marched stolidly along felt curiously in sympathy with his environment hayters news brought him face to face with that inner problem which had so suddenly become the dominant factor in his life for the first time he knew what love was he felt the wonder of it the farreaching possibilities the strange idealism called so unexpectedly into being he recognized the vagaries of philippas disposition and yet during the last few days he had convinced himself that she was beginning to care her strained relations with her husband had been without a doubt her first incentive towards the acceptance of his proffered devotion now he told himself with eager hopefulness that some portion of it however minute must be for his own sake the relations between husband and wife he reminded himself must at any rate have been strained during the last few months or cranston would never have been able to keep his secret in his gloomy passage through this land of ill omens however he shivered a little as he thought of the other possibilitytortured himself with imagining what might happen during her revulsion of feeling if philippa discovered the truth a sense of something greater than he had yet known in life seemed to lift him into some lofty state of aloofness from which he could look down and despise himself the poor tired plodder wearing the heavy chains of duty there was a life so much more wonderful just the other side of the clouds a very short distance away a life of alluring and passionate happiness should he ever find the courage he wondered to escape from the treadmill and go in search of it duty for the last two years had taken him by the hand and led him along a pathway of shame he had never been a hypocrite about the war he was one of those who had acknowledged from the first that germany had set forth with the sword in her hand on a war of conquest his own inherited martial spirit had vaguely approved he too in those earlier days had felt the sunlight upon his rapier later had come the enlightenment the turbulent waves of doubt the nightmare of a nations awakening conscience mirrored in his own soul it was in a depression shared perhaps in a lesser degree by millions of those whose ranks he had joined that he felt this passionate craving for escape into a world which took count of other things    chapter xvii   punctually at 12 oclock the next morning lessingham presented himself at the hotel in dover street and was invited by the hall porter to take a seat in the lounge philippa entered a few minutes later her eyes and cheeks brilliant with the brisk exercise she had been taking her slim figure most becomingly arrayed in grey cloth and chinchilla  i lost helen in harrods she announced but i know shes lunching with friends so it really doesnt matter youll have to take care of me mr lessingham until the train goes if you will  for even longer than that if you will he murmured  she laughed more pretty speeches i dont think im equal to them before luncheon  this time i am literal he explained i am coming back to dreymarsh myself  he felt his heart beat quicker a sudden joy possessed him philippas expression was obviously one of satisfaction  im so glad she assured him do you know i was thinking only as i came back in the taxicab how i should miss you  she was standing with her foot upon the broad fender and her first little impulse of pleasure seemed to pass as she looked into the fire she turned towards him gravely  after all do you think you are wise she asked of course i dont think that any one at dreymarsh has the least suspicion but you know captain griffiths did ask questions andwell youre safely away now you have been so wonderful about dick so wonderful altogether she went on that i couldnt bear it if trouble were to come  he smiled at her  i think i know what is at the back of your mind he said you think that i am coming back entirely on your account as it happens this is not so  she looked at him with wideopen eyes  surely she exclaimed you have satisfied yourself that there is no field for your ingenuity in dreymarsh  i thought that i had he admitted it seems that i am wrong i have had orders to return  orders to return she repeated from whom  he shook his head  of course i ought not to have asked that she proceeded hastily but it does seem odd to realise that you can receive instructions and messages from germany here in london  very much the same sort of thing goes on in germany he reminded her  so they say she admitted but one doesnt come into contact with it so you are really coming back to dreymarsh  with you if i may  naturally she agreed  he glanced at the clock we might almost be starting for lunch he suggested  she nodded as soon as ive told grover about the luggage  she was absent only a few moments and then as it was a dry sunny morning they walked down st james street and along pall mall to the carlton philippa met several acquaintances but lessingham walked with his head erect looking neither to the right nor to the left  arent you sometimes afraid of being recognised she asked him there must be a great many men about of your time at magdalen for instance  nine years makes a lot of difference he reminded her and besides i have a theory that it is only when the eyes meet that recognition really takes place so long as i do not look into any ones face i feel quite safe  you are sure that you would not like to go to a smaller place than the carlton  it makes no difference he assured her my credentials have been wonderfully established for me  im so glad she confessed i know its most unfashionable but i do like these big places if ever i had my way i should like to live in london and have a cottage in the country instead of living in the country and being just an hotel dweller in london  i wonder if new york would not do he ventured  i expect i should like new york she murmured  i think he said in fact i am almost sure that when i leave here i shall go to the united states  she looked at him and turned suddenly away they arrived just then at their destination and the moment passed lessingham left his companion in the lounge while he went back into the restaurant to secure his table and order lunch when he came back he found philippa sitting very upright and with a significant glitter in her eyes  look over there she whispered by the palm  he followed the direction which she indicated a man was standing against one of the pillars talking to a tall dark woman obviously a foreigner wrapped in wonderful furs there was something familiar about his figure and the slight droop of his head  why its sir henry lessingham exclaimed as the man turned around  my husband philippa faltered  sir henry if indeed it were he seemed afflicted with a sudden shortsightedness he met the incredulous gaze both of lessingham and his wife without recognition or any sign of flinching at that distance it was impossible to see the tightening of his lips and the steely flash in his blue eyes  the whiting seem to have brought him a long way philippa said with an unnatural little laugh  shall i go and speak to him lessingham asked  for heavens sake no she insisted dont leave me i wouldnt have him come near me for anything in the world it is only a few weeks ago that i begged him to come to london with me and he said that he hated the place you dont knowthe woman  lessingham shook his head  she looks like a foreigner was all he could say  take me in to lunch at once philippa begged rising abruptly to her feet this is really the last straw  they passed up the stairway and within a few feet of where sir henry was standing he appeared absorbed however in conversation with his companion and did not even turn around philippas little face seemed to have hardened as she took her seat only her eyes were still unnaturally bright  i am so sorry if this has annoyed you lessingham regretted you would not care to go elsewhere  i go anywhere else she exclaimed scornfully thank you i am perfectly satisfied here and with my companion she added with a brilliant little smile now tell me about new york have you ever been there  twice he told her at present the dream of my life is to go there with you  she looked at him a little wonderingly  i wonder if you really care she said men get so much into the habit of saying that sort of thing to women sometimes it seems to me they must do a great deal of mischief but youis that really your wish  i would sacrifice everything that i have ever held dear in life he declared with his face aglow for its realization  but you would be a deserter from your country she pointed out you would never be able to return your estates would be confiscated you would be homeless  home he said softly is where ones heart takes one home is just where love is  her eyes as they met his were for a moment suspiciously soft then she began to talk very quickly of other things to compare notes of countries which they had both visited even of people whom they had met they were obliged to leave early to catch their train as they passed down the crowded restaurant they once more found themselves within a few feet of sir henry his back was turned to them and he was apparently ignorant of their near presence the party had become a partie carríe another man and a still younger and more beautiful woman having joined it  of course philippa said as they descended the stairs i am behaving like an idiot i ought to go and tell henry exactly what i think of him or pull him away in the approved whitechapel fashion we lose so much dont we by stifling our instincts  for the next few minutes he replied glancing at his watch i think we had better concentrate our attention upon catching our train  they reached kings cross with only a few minutes to spare grover however had already secured a carriage and helen was waiting for them ensconced in a corner she accepted the news of lessinghams return with resignation philippa became thoughtful as they drew towards the close of their journey and the slow frosty twilight began to creep down upon the land  i suppose we dont really know what war is she observed looking out of the window at a comfortable little village tucked away with a background of trees and guarded by a weatherbeaten old church the people are safe in their homes you must appreciate what that means mr lessingham  indeed i do he answered gravely i have seen the earth torn and dismembered as though by the plough of some destroying angel a few blackened ruins where an hour or so before a peaceful village stood men and women running about like lunatics stricken with a mortal fear and all the time a red glow on the horizon a bloodred glow and little specks of grey or brown lying all over the fields even the cattle racing round in terror and every now and then the cry of death you are fortunate in england  philippa leaned forward  do you believe that our turn will come she asked do you believe that the wave will break over our country  who can tell  ah no but answer me she begged is it possible for you to land an army here  i think he replied that all things are possible to the military genius of germany the only question is whether it is worth while germans are supposed to be sentimentalists you know i rather doubt it there is nothing would set the joybells of berlin clanging so much as the news of a german invasion of great britain on the other hand there is a great party in germany and a very farseeing one which is continually reminding the government that without great britain as a market germany would never recover from the financial strain of the war  this is all too impersonal philippa objected do you in your heart believe that the time might come when in the night we should hear the guns booming in dreymarsh bay and see your greyclad soldiers forming up on the beach and scaling our cliffs  that will not be yet he pronounced it has been thought of once it was almost attempted just at present no  philippa drew a sigh of relief  then your mission in dreymarsh has nothing to do with an attempted landing  nothing he assured her i can even go a little further i can tell you that if ever we do try to land it will be in an unsuspected place in an unexpected fashion  well its really very comforting to hear these things at firsthand philippa declared with some return to her usual manner i suppose we are really two disgraceful women helen and itraitors and all the rest of it here we sit talking to an enemy as though he were one of our best friends  i refuse to be called an enemy lessingham protested there are times when individuality is a far greater thing than nationality i am just a human being born into the same world and warmed by the same sun as you nothing can alter the fact that we are fellow creatures  dreymarsh once more philippa announced looking out of the window and youre a terribly plausible person mr lessingham come round and see us after dinnerif it doesnt interfere with your work  on the contrary he murmured under his breath thank you very much    chapter xviii   sir henry was standing with his hands in his pockets and a very blank expression upon his face looking out upon the admiralty square he was alone in a large barely furnished apartment the walls of which were so hung with charts that it had almost the appearance of a schoolroom prepared for an advanced geography class the table from which he had risen was covered with an amazing number of scientific appliances some samples of rock and sand two microscopes and several telephones  sir henry having apparently exhausted the possibilities of the outlook turned somewhat reluctantly away to find himself confronted by an elderly gentleman of cheerful appearance who at that moment had entered the room from the fact that he had done so without knocking it was obvious that he was an intimate  well my gloomy friend the newcomer demanded whats wrong with you  sir henry was apparently relieved to see his visitor he pushed a chair towards him and indicated with a gesture of invitation a box of cigars upon his desk   your little laranagas he observed try one  the visitor opened the box sniffed at its contents and helped himself  now then get at it henry he enjoined ive a board in halfanhour and three dispatches to read before i go in whats your trouble  look here rayton was the firm reply i want to chuck this infernal holeandcorner business i tell you ive worked it threadbare at dreymarsh and its getting jolly uncomfortable  the newcomer grinned  poor chap he observed watching his cigar smoke curl upwards youre in a nasty mess you know henry did i tell you that i had a letter from your wife the other day asking me if i couldnt find you a job  sir henry waited a little grimly whilst his friend enjoyed the joke  thats all very well he said but we are on the point of a separation or something of the sort ill admit it was all right at first to run the thing on the qt but thats pretty well busted up by now why according to your own reports they know all about me on the other side  not a doubt about it the other agreed im not sure that you havent got a spy fellow down at dreymarsh now  im quite sure of it sir henry replied grimly the brute was lunching with my wife at the carlton today and as luck would have it i was landed with that russian admirals wife and sisterinlaw youre breaking up the happy home thats what youre doing rayton  his lordship at any rate seemed to find the process amusing he laughed until the tears stood in his eyes  i should love to have seen philippas face he chuckled when she walked into the restaurant and saw you there youre supposed to be off on a fishing expedition arent you  i went out after whiting sir henry groaned and id just promised to chuck it for a time when i got the admirals message  well well see to your german spy anyway his visitor promised  dont be an ass sir henry exclaimed irritably i dont want the fellow touched at present why hes been a sort of persona grata at my house hangs around there all the time when im away  all the more reason for putting an end to his little game i should say was the cheerful reply  and have the whole neighbourhood either laughing at my wife and miss fairclough or talking scandal about them sir henry retorted  i forgot that his friend confessed ruminatively hes a gentlemanly sort of fellow from what i hear but a rotten spy what do you want done with him  leave him for me to deal with sir henry insisted i have a little scheme on hand in which he is concerned  rayton scratched his chin doubtfully  the fellow may not be such a fool as he seems he reminded his friend  i wont run any risks sir henry promised i just want him left there thats all and look here rayton you know what i want from you i quite agreed to your proposals as to my anonymity at the time when i was up in scotland but the things a secret no longer with the people who count every one in germany knows that im a minefield specialist so i dont see why the dickens i should pose any longer as a sort of halfbaked idiot  raytons eyes twinkled  you want to play the wilson barrett hero and make a theatrical disclosure of your greatness he laughed poor philippa will fall upon her knees you will be the hero of the village which will probably present you with some little article of plate youve a good time coming henry  talk sense theres a good fellow the other begged you go and see the chief and put it to him there isnt a single reason why i shouldnt own up now  ill see what i can do rayton promised but what about this fellow lessingham or whatever else he calls himself down there theres a chap named griffithscommandant isnt hebeen writing us about him  i wont have lessingham touched sir henry insisted he cant do any particular harm down there and there isnt a line or a drawing of mine down at dreymarsh which he isnt welcome to  lord rayton rose to his feet  look here henry old fellow he said i do sympathise with you up to a certain point i tell you what ill do i shall have to answer philippas letter and ill answer it in such a way that if she is as clever a little woman as i think she is shell get a hint of course he went on ruminatively it is rather a misfortune that the princess ollaneff and her sister are such jolly goodlooking women makes it look a little fishy doesnt it what i mean to say is its a far cry from fishing for whiting in the north sea to lunching with a beautiful princess at the carltonwhen you think your wifes down in norfolk  sir henry threw open the door  look here ive had enough of you rayton he declared you get back and do an hours work if you can bring your mind to it  the latter assumed a sudden dignity necessitated by the sound of voices in the corridor and departed the door had scarcely been closed when two younger men presented themselvesmiles ensol sir henrys secretary a typicallooking young sailor minus his left arm and a palefaced cleanshaven man of uncertain age in civilian clothes sir henry shook hands with the latter and pointed to the easychair which his previous visitor had just vacated  welcome back again horridge he said cordially miles ill ring when i want you  very good sir the secretary replied theres a fisherman from norfolk downstairs when youre at liberty  sir henry nodded  ill see him presently shut him up somewhere where he can smoke  the young man withdrew carefully closing the door around which sir henry with a word of apology arranged a screen  i dont think he explained that eavesdropping extends to these premises or that our voices could reach outside still a haporth of prevention eh have a cigar horridge  im not smoking for a day or two thank you sir  you look as though theyd put you through it sir henry remarked  his visitor smiled  ive travelled fourteen miles in a barrel he said and we were out for twentyfour hours in a danish sailing skiff you know what the weathers been like in the north sea before that the last word of writing i saw on german soil was a placard offering a reward of five thousand marks for my detention with a disgustingly lifelike photograph at the top i had about fifty yards of quay to walk in broad daylight and every other man i passed turned to stare after me it gives you the cold shivers down your back when you darent look round to see if youre being followed  sir henry groped in the cupboard of his desk and produced a bottle of whisky and a syphon of soda water his visitor nodded approvingly  ive touched nothing until ive reached what i consider sanctuary he observed my nerves have gone rotten for the first time in my life do you mind sir if i lock the door  go ahead sir henry assented  he brought the whisky and soda himself across the room horridge resumed his seat and held out his hand almost eagerly for a moment or two he shook as though he had an ague then just as suddenly as it had come upon him the fit passed he drained the contents of the tumbler at a gulp set it down empty by his side and stretched out his hand for a cigar  the end of my journey didnt help matters any he went on i darent even make for a dutch port and we were picked up eventually by a tramp steamer from newcastle to london with coals i hadnt been on board more than an hour before a submarine which had been following overhauled us i thought it was all up then but the fog lifted and we found ourselves almost in the midst of a squadron of destroyers from harwich i made another transfer and they landed me in time to catch the early morning train from felixstowe  did they get the submarine his listener asked eagerly  get it the other repeated with a smile they blew it into scrap metal  plenty of movement in your life  ive run the gauntlet over there once too often horridge said grimly just look at me now sir henry im twentynine years old and its only two years and a half since i was invalided out of the navy and took this job on the last person i asked to guess my age put me down at fifty what should you have said  somewhere near it was the candid admission never mind horridge youve done your bit you shall pass on your experience to a new hand take your pension and try the south coast of england for a few months now lets get on with it you know what i want to hear about  horridge produced from his pocket a long strip of paper  theyre there sir he announced coaled to the scuppers every man standing to stations and steam up theres the list  he handed the paper across to sir henry who glanced it down  the fast cruiser squadron he observed hm three new ships we havent any note of no transports then horridge  not a sign of one sir was the reply theyre after a bombardment  he rose to his feet walked to a giant map of england and touched a certain port on the east coast sir henrys eyes glistened  youre sure  it is a certainty horridge replied ive been on three of those ships ive dined with four of the officers theyre under sealed orders and the crew believes that theyre going to escort out half a dozen commerce destroyers but i have the truth thats their objective horridge repeated touching once more the spot upon the map and they are waiting just for one thing  sir henry smiled thoughtfully  i know what theyre waiting for he said perhaps if theyd a herr horridge to send over here for it theyd have got it before now as it iswell im not sure he went on it seems a pity to disappoint them doesnt it id love to give them a run for their money  horridge smiled faintly he knew a good deal about his companion  theyre spoiling for it sir he admitted sir henry spoke down a telephone and a few minutes later ensol reappeared  find mr horridge a comfortable room his chief directed and one of our confidential typists you can make out your report at your leisure he went on come in and see me when its all finished  certainly sir horridge replied rising  sir henry held out his hand he looked with something like wonder at the nerveshattered man who had risen to his feet with a certain air of briskness  horridge he said i wish i had your pluck  i dont know any one in the service from whom you need borrow any sir was the quiet reply    chapter xix   lessingham sat upon a fallen tree on dutchmans common near the scene of his romantic descent and looked rather ruefully over the moorland seawards above him the sky was covered with little masses of quickly scudding clouds a fugitive and watery sunshine shone feebly upon a windtossed sea and a rainsodden landscape he found a certain grim satisfaction in comparing the disorderliness of the day with the tumult in his own life he felt that he had embarked upon an enterprise greater than his capacity for which he was in many ways entirely unsuitable and behind him was the scourge of the telegram which he had received a few hours ago a telegram harmless enough to all appearance but which decoded was like a scourge to his back  your work is unsatisfactory and your slackness deserves reprobation great events wait upon you the object of your search is necessary for our imminent operations  the sound of a horses hoofs disturbed him captain griffiths on a great bay mare glanced curiously at the lonely figure by the roadside and then pulled up  back again mr lessingham he remarked  as you see  the commandant fidgeted with his horse for a moment then he approached a little nearer to lessinghams side  you are a good walker i perceive mr lessingham he remarked  when the fancy takes me was the equable reply  have you come out to see our new guns  i had no idea lessingham answered indifferently that you had any  griffiths smiled  we have a small battery of antiaircraft guns newly arrived from the south of england he said the secret of their coming and their locality has kept the neighbourhood in a state of ferment for the last week  lessingham remained profoundly uninterested  they most of them spotted the guns his companion continued but not many of them have found the searchlights yet  it seems a little late in the year lessingham observed to be making preparations against zeppelins  well they cross here pretty often you know griffiths reminded him its only a matter of a few weeks ago that one almost came to grief on this common we picked up their observation car not fifty yards from where you are sitting  i remember hearing about it lessingham acknowledged  bytheby the commandant continued smoothing his horses neck didnt you arrive that evening or the evening after  i believe i did  liverpool street or kings cross the kings cross train was very nearly held up  i didnt come by train at all lessingham replied glancing for a moment into the clouds and now i come to think of it it must have been the evening after  fine county for motoring griffiths continued stroking his horses head  the roads i have been on seem very good was the somewhat bored admission  you havent a car of your own here have you  not at present  captain griffiths glanced between his horses ears for a few moments then he turned once more towards his companion  mr lessingham he said you are aware that i am commandant here  i believe lessingham replied that lady cranston told me so  it is my duty therefore griffiths went on to take a little more than ordinary interest in casual visitors especially at this time of the year the fact that you are wellknown to lady cranston is of course an entirely satisfactory explanation of your presence here at the same time there is certain information concerning strangers of which we keep a record and in your case there is a line or two which we have not been able to fill up  if i can be of any service lessingham murmured  precisely the other interrupted i knew you would feel like that now your arrival herewe have the date i thinkoctober 6th as you have just remarked you didnt come by train how did you come  lessinghams surprise was apparently quite genuine  is that a question which you ask me to answerofficially he enquired  his interlocutor shrugged his shoulders  i am not putting official questions to you at all he replied nor am i crossexamining you as might be my duty under the circumstances simply because your friendship with the cranstons is of course a guarantee as to your position but on the other hand i think it would be reasonable if you were to answer my question  lessingham nodded  perhaps you are right he admitted as you can tell by finding me here this afternoon i am a great walker i arrivedon foot  i see griffiths reflected the other question which we usually ask is where was your last stopping place  stopping place lessingham murmured  yes where did you sleep the night before you came here griffiths persisted  lessingham shook his head as though oppressed by some distasteful memory  but i did not sleep at all he complained it was one of the worst nights which i have ever spent in my life  captain griffiths gathered up his reins  well he said with clumsy sarcasm i am much obliged to you mr lessingham for the straightforward way in which you have answered my questions i wont bother you any more just at present shall i see you tomorrow night at mainsail haul  lady cranston has asked me to dine was the somewhat reserved reply  his inquisitor nodded and cantered away lessingham looked after him until he had disappeared then he turned his face towards dreymarsh and walked steadily into the lowering afternoon twilight was falling as he reached mainsail haul where he found philippa entertaining some callers to whom she promptly introduced him lessingham gathered almost in the first few minutes that his presence in dreymarsh was becoming a subject of comment  my husband has played bridge with you at the club i think a lady by whose side he found himself observed you perhaps didnt hear my namemrs johnson  i congratulate you upon your husband lessingham replied i remember him perfectly well because he kept his temper when i revoked  dear me she exclaimed he must have taken a fancy to you then as a rule they rather complain about him at bridge  i formed the impression lessingham continued that he was rather a better player than the majority of the performers there  mrs johnson who was a dark and somewhat forbiddinglooking lady smiled  he thinks so at any rate she conceded didnt he tell me that you were invalided home from the front  lessingham shook his head  i am quite sure that it was not mentioned he said we walked home together as far as the hotel one evening but we spoke only of the golf and some shooting in the neighbourhood  philippa who had been maneuvering to attract lessinghams attention suddenly dropped the cake basket which she was passing there was a little commotion lessingham went down on his hands and knees to help collect the fragments and she found an opportunity to whisper in his ear  be careful that woman is a cat stay and talk to me please dont bother mr lessingham wont you ring the bell instead she continued raising her voice  lessingham did as he was asked and affected not to notice mrs johnsons inviting smile as he returned philippa made room for him by her side  helen and i were talking this afternoon mr lessingham she said of the days when you and dick were both in the magdalen eleven and both had just a chance of being chosen for the varsity you never played did you  he shook his head  no such luck in any case richard would have been in well before me i always maintained that he was the first of our googlie bowlers  so you were at magdalen with major felstead another caller remarked in mild wonder  mr lessingham and my brother were great friends philippa explained mr lessingham used to come down to shoot in cheshire  lady cranstons guests were all conscious of a little indefinable disappointment the gossip concerning this strangers appearance in dreymarsh was practically strangled mrs johnson however fired a parting shot as she rose to go  you were not in the same regiment as major felstead were you mr lessingham she asked no he answered calmly  philippa was busy with her adieux mrs johnson remained indomitable  what was your regiment mr lessingham she persisted you must forgive my seeming inquisitive but i am so interested in military affairs  lessingham bowed courteously  i do not remember alluding to my soldiering at all he said coolly but as a matter of fact i am in the guards  mrs johnson accepted philippas hand and the inevitable her goodby to lessingham was most affable she walked up the road with the vicar  i think vicar she said severely that for a small place dreymarsh is becoming one of the worst centres of gossip i ever knew every one has been saying all sorts of unkind things about that charming mr lessingham and there you aremajor felsteads friend and a guardsman somehow or other i felt that he belonged to one of the crack regiments i shall certainly ask him to dinner one night next week  the vicar nodded benignly he had the utmost respect for mrs johnsons cook and his own standard of social desirability to which the object of their discussion had attained  i should be happy to meet mr lessingham at any time he pronounced with ample condescension i noticed him in church last sunday morning    chapter xx   my dear man whatever shall i do with you philippa exclaimed pathetically as the door closed upon the last of her callers the guards indeed  lessingham smiled as he resumed his place by her side  well he said i told the dear lady the truth you will find my name well up in the list of the thirtyfirst battalion of the prussian guards  she threw herself back in her chair and laughed how amusing it would be if it werent all so terrible you really are a perfect political raffles do you know that this afternoon you have absolutely reestablished yourself mr johnson will probably call on you tomorrowthey may even ask you to dinethe vicar will write and ask for a subscription and dolly fenwick will invite you to play golf with her  do not turn my head he begged  all the same philippa continued more gravely i shall never have a moments peace whilst you are in the place i was thinking about you last night i dont believe i have ever realised before how terrible it would be if you really were discovered what would they do to you  whatever they might do he replied a little wearily i must obey orders my orders are to remain here but even if i were told that i might go i should find it hard  do you mean that she asked  i think you know he answered  you men are so strange she went on after a moments pause you give us so little time to know you you show us so little of yourselves and you expect so much  we offer everything he reminded her  i want to avoid platitudes she said thoughtfully but is love quite the same thing for a man as for a woman  sometimes it is more was the prompt reply sometimes love for a woman means only shelter often for a man love means the blending of all knowledge of all beauty all ambition of all that he has learned from books and from life sometimes a man can see no further and needs to look no further  philippa suddenly felt that she was in danger there was something in her heart of which she had never before been conscious some music some strange turn of sentiment in lessinghams voice or the words themselves it was madness she told herself breathlessly she was in love with her husband if any one she could not have lost all feeling for him so soon she clasped her hands tightly lessingham seemed conscious of his advantage and leaned towards her  if i were not offering you my whole life he pleaded believe me i would not open my lips if i were thinking of episodes i would throw myself into the sea before i asked you to give me even your fingers but you and you alone could fill the place in my life which i have always prayed might be filled not for a year or even a decade of years but for eternity  oh but you forget she faltered  i remember so much he replied that i know it is hard for you to speak there are bonds which you have made sacred and your fingers shrink from tearing them asunder if it were not for this philippahear the speech of a renegademy mandate should be torn in pieces my instructions should flutter into the wastepaper basket tomorrow should see us on our way to a new country and a new life but you must be very sure indeed  is it because of me that you are staying here she asked  upon my honour no he assured her i must stay here a little longer whatever it may mean for me and so i am content to remain what i am to you at this minute i ask from you only that you remain just what you are but when the moment of my freedom comes when my task here is finished and i turn to go then i must come to you  she rose suddenly to her feet crossed the floor and threw open the window the breeze swept through the room flapping the curtains blowing about loose articles into a strange confusion she stood there for several moments as though in search of some respite from the emotional atmosphere upon which she had turned her back when she finally closed the window her hair was in little strands about her face her eyes were soft and her lips quivering  you make me feel she said taking his hand for a moment and looking at him almost piteously you make me feel everything except one thing  except one thing he repeated  cant you understand she continued stretching out her hand with a quick impulsive little movement i am here in henrys house his wife the mistress of his household all the years weve been married i have never thought of another man i have never indulged in even the idlest flirtation and now suddenly my life seems upside down i feel as though if henry stood before me now i would strike him on the cheek i feel sore all over and ashamed but i dont know whether i have ceased to love him i cant tell nothing seems to help me i close my eyes and i try to think of that new world and that new life and i know that there is nothing repulsive in it i feel all the joy and the strength of being with you and then there is henry in the background he seems to have had so much of my love  he saw the tears gathering in her eyes and he smiled at her encouragingly  remember that at this moment i am asking you for nothing he said just think these things out it isnt really a matter for sorrow he continued love must always mean happinessfor the one who is loved  she leaned hack in the corner of the sofa to which he had led her her eyes dry now but still very soft and sweet he sat by her side fingering some of the things in her work basket once she held out her hand and seemed to find comfort in his clasp he raised her fingers to his lips without any protest from her she looked at him with a little smile  you know im not at all an ibsen heroine she declared i cant see my way like those wonderful emancipated women  yet he said thoughtfully the way to the simple things is so clear  confidences were at an end for a time broken up by the entrance of nora and helen and some young men from the depot who had looked in for a game of billiards lessingham rose to leave as soon as the latter had returned to their game his tone and manner now were completely changed he seemed ill at ease and unhappy  i am going to have a days fishing tomorrow he told philippa but i must admit that i have very little faith in this man oates they all tell me that your husband has any number of charts of the coast do you think i could borrow one  why of course she replied if we can find it  she took him over to her husbands desk opened such of the drawers as were not locked and searched amongst their contents ruthlessly by the time they had finished the last drawer lessingham had quite a little collection of charts more or less finished in his hand  i dont know where else to look she said you might go through those and see if they are of any use what is it mills she added turning to the door  mills had entered noiselessly and was watching the proceedings at sir henrys desk with a distinct lack of favour he looked away towards his mistress however as he replied  the young woman has called with reference to a situation as parlourmaid your ladyship he announced i have shown her into the sewing room lady cranston glanced at the clock  i shant be more than five or ten minutes she promised lessingham just look through those till i come back  she hurried away leaving lessingham alone in the room he stood for a moment listening on the lefthand side through the door which had been left ajar he could hear the click of billiard balls and occasional peals of laughter on the righthand side there was silence he moved swiftly across the room and closed the door leading into the billiard room deposited on the sofa the charts which he had been carrying and hurried back to the secretary with a sickening feeling of overwhelming guilt he drew from his pocket a key and opened one by one the drawers through which they had not searched it took him barely five minutes to discovernothing with an air of relief he rearranged everything when philippa returned he was sitting on the lounge going through the charts which they had looked out together  well she asked  there is nothing here he decided which will help me very much with your permission i will take this he added selecting one at random  she nodded and they replaced the others then she touched him on the arm  listen she said are you perfectly certain that there is no one coming  he listened for a moment  i cant hear any one he answered theyve started a fourhanded game of pool in the billiard room  she smiled  then i will disclose to you henrys dramatic secret see  she touched the spring in the side of the secretary the false back with its little collection of fishing flies rolled slowly up the large and very wonderful chart on which sir henry had bestowed so much of his time was revealed lessingham gazed at it eagerly  there she said that has been a great labour of love with henry it is the chart on a great scale from which he works i dont know a thing about it and for heavens sake never tell henry that you have seen it  he continued to examine the chart earnestly not a part of it escaped him then he turned back to philippa  is that supposed to be the coast on the other side of the point he asked  i dont exactly know where it is she replied every time henry finds out anything new he comes and works at it i believe that very soon it will be perfect then he will start on another part of the coast  this is not the only one that he has prepared then lessingham enquired  she shook her head  i believe it is the fifth she replied they all disappear when they are finished but i have no idea where to to me they seem to represent a shocking waste of time  lessingham was suddenly taciturn he held out his hand you are dining with us tomorrow night remember she said  i am not likely to forget he assured her  and dont get drowned she concluded i dont know any of these fishermeni hate them allbut im told that oates is the worst  i think that we shall be quite all right he assured her thanks very much for finding me the charts what i have seen will help me  helen came in for a moment and their farewell was more or less perfunctory lessingham was almost thankful to escape there was an unusual flush in his cheeks a sense of bitter humiliation in his heart all the fervour with which he had started on his perilous quest had faded away no sense of duty or patriotism could revive his drooping spirits he felt himself suddenly an unclean and dishonoured being    chapter xxi   towards three oclock on the following afternoon the boisterous wind of an uncertain morning settled down to worse things it tore the spray from the crest of the gathering waves dashed it even against the french windows of mainsail haul and came booming down the open spaces cliffwards like the rumble of some subterranean artillery a little group of fishermen in oilskins leaned over the railing and discussed the chances of ben oates bringing his boat in safely philippa also distracted by a curious anxiety stood before the blurred window gazing into what seemed almost a grey chaos captain griffiths your ladyship  she turned around quickly at the announcement even an unwelcome caller at that moment was almost a relief to her  how nice of you to come and see me on such an afternoon captain griffiths she exclaimed as they shook hands helen is over at the canteen nora is hard at work for once in her life and i seem most dolefully alone  her visitors reception of philippas greeting promised little in the way of enlivenment he seemed more awkward and ill at ease than ever and his tone was almost threatening  i am very glad to find you alone lady cranston he said i came specially to have a few words with you on a certain matter  her momentary impulse of relief at his visit passed away there seemed to her something sinister in his manner she was suddenly conscious that there was a new danger to be faced and that this mans attitude towards her was for some reason or other inimical after the first shock however she prepared herself to do battle  well you seem very mysterious she observed i havent broken any laws have i no lights flashing from any of my windows  so far as i am aware there are no complaints of the sort the commandant acknowledged still speaking with an unnatural restraint my call i hope may be termed to some extent at least a friendly one  how nice she sighed then youll have some tea wont you  not at present if you please he begged i have come to talk to you about mr hamar lessingham  really philippa exclaimed whatever has that poor man been doing now  dreymarsh her visitor proceeded having been constituted during the last few months a protected area it is my duty to examine and enquire into the business of any stranger who appears here mr hamar lessingham has been largely accepted without comment owing to his friendship with you i regret to state however that certain facts have come to my knowledge which make me wonder whether you yourself may not in some measure have been deceived  this sounds very ridiculous philippa interposed quietly  a few weeks ago captain griffith continued we received information that this neighbourhood would probably be visited by some person connected with the secret service of germany there is strong evidence that the person in question is mr hamar lessingham  a graduate of magdalen my brothers intimate friend and a frequent visitor at my fathers house in cheshire philippa observed with faint sarcasm  the possibility of your having made a mistake lady cranston captain griffiths rejoined has i must confess only just occurred to me the authorities at magdalen college have been appealed to and no one of the name of lessingham was there during any one of your brothers terms  philippa took the blow well she simply stared at her caller in a noncomprehending manner  we have also information he continued gravely from wood norton hallfrom your mother in fact lady cranstonthat no college friend of your brother of that name has ever visited wood norton  go on philippa begged a little faintly did i ever live there myself was richard ever at magdalen  captain griffiths proceeded with the air of a man who has a task to finish and intends to do so regardless of interruptions  i have had some conversation with mr lessingham in the course of which i asked him to explain his method of reaching here and his last habitation he simply fenced with me in the most barefaced fashion he practically declined to give me any account of himself  philippa rose and rang the bell  i suppose i must give you some tea she said although you seem to have come here on purpose to make my head ache  my object in coming here captain griffiths rejoined a little stiffly is to save you some measure of personal annoyance  oh please dont think that i am ungrateful philippa begged of course it is all some absurd mistake and im sure we shall get to the bottom of it presentlytell me what you think of the storm she added as mills entered with the tea tray do you think it will get any worse because i am terrified to death already  i am no judge of the weather here he confessed i believe the fishermen are preparing for something unusual  she seated herself before the tea tray and insisted upon performing her duties as hostess afterwards she laid her hand upon his arm and addressed him with an air of complete candour  now captain griffiths she began do listen to me just one moment of common sense if you please what do you suppose there could possibly be in our harmless seaside village to induce any one to risk his life by coming here on behalf of the secret service of germany  dreymarsh captain griffiths replied was not made a prohibited area for nothing  but my dear man be reasonable philippa persisted there are perhaps a thousand soldiers in the place the usual preparations along the cliff for coast defence a small battery of antiaircraft guns and a couple of searchlights there isnt a grocers boy in the place who doesnt know all this theres no concealment about it you must admit that germany doesnt need to send over a secret service agent to acquaint herself with these insignificant facts  her visitor smiled very faintly it was the first time he had relaxed even so far as this  i am not in possession of any information which i can impart to you lady cranston he said but i am not prepared to accept your statement that dreymarsh contains nothing of greater interest than the things which you have mentioned  there was no necessity for philippa to play a part now the suggestion contained in her visitors words had really left her in a state of wonder  you are making my flesh creep she exclaimed you dont mean to say that we have secrets here  i have said the last word which it is possible for me to say upon the subject he declared you will understand i am sure that i am not here in the character of an inquisitor i simply thought it my duty in view of the fact that you had made yourself the social sponsor for mr lessingham to place certain information before you and to ask unofficially of course if you have any explanation to give you may even he went on hesitatingly appreciate the motives which led me to do so  my dear man what explanation could i have philippa protested it is an absolute and undeniable fact that mr lessingham was at magdalen with my brother and also that he visited us at wood norton i know both these things of my own knowledge the only possible explanation therefore is that you have been misinformed  or captain griffiths ventured that mr hamar lessingham in those days passed under another name  another name philippa faltered  some such name perhaps he continued as bertram maderstrom  there was a short silence captain griffiths had leaned back in his chair and was caressing his upper lip his eyes were fixed upon philippa and philippa saw nothing her little heel dug hard into the carpet in a few seconds the room ceased to spin nevertheless her voice sounded to her pitifully inadequate  what an absurdity all this is she exclaimed  maderstrom captain griffiths said thoughtfully was curiously enough an intimate college friend of your brothers he was also a visitor at wood norton hall at neither place is there any trace of mr hamar lessingham perhaps you have made a mistake lady cranston perhaps you have recognised the man and failed to remember his name if so now is the moment to declare it  i am very much obliged to you philippa retorted but i have never met or heard of this mr maderstrom  baron maderstrom he interrupted  baron maderstrom then in my life whereas mr lessingham i remember perfectly  i am sorry captain griffiths said setting down his empty teacup and rising slowly to his feet we cannot help one another then  if you want me to transfer mr lessingham whom i remember perfectly into a german baron whom i never heard of philippa declared boldly i am afraid that we cant  baron maderstrom was a swedish nobleman captain griffiths observed  swedish or german i know nothing of him philippa persisted  there remains then nothing more to be said  i am afraid not philippa agreed sweetly  under the circumstances captain griffiths asked you will not i am sure expect me to dine tonight  not if you object to meeting mr hamar lessingham philippa replied  her visitors face suddenly darkened and philippa wondered vaguely whether anything more than professional suspicion was responsible for that little storm of passion which for a moment transformed his appearance he quickly recovered however  i may still he concluded moving towards the door be forced to present myself here in another capacity    chapter xxii   the confinement of the house after the departure of her unwelcome visitor stifled philippa attired in a mackintosh with a scarf around her head she made her way on to the quay and clinging to the railing dragged herself along to where the fishermen were gathered together in a little group the storm as yet showed no signs of abatement  has anything been heard of ben oates boat she enquired  an old fisherman pointed seawards  there she comes maam up on the crest of that wave look  will she get in philippa asked eagerly  there were varied opinions expressed in indistinct mutterings  shes weathering it grand the fisherman to whom she had first spoken declared weve a line ready yonder and were reckoning on getting em ashore all right lucky for ben that the gentleman along with him is a fine sailor look at that mum he added in excitement see the way he brought her head round to it just in time boys theyll come in on the next one  one by one the sailors made their way to the very edge of the wavesplashed beach there were a few more minutes of breathless anxiety then after the boat had disappeared completely from sight hidden by a huge grey wall of sea she seemed suddenly to climb to the top of it to hover there to become mixed up with the spray and the surf and a great green mass of waters and then finally with a harsh crash of timbers and a shout from the fishermen to be flung high and dry upon the stones philippa clutching the iron railing saw for a moment nothing but chaos her knees became weak she was unable to move there was a queer dizziness in her ears the sound of voices sounded like part of an unreal nightmare then she was aware of a single figure climbing the steps towards her there was blood trickling down his face from the wound in the forehead and he was limping slightly  mr lessingham she called out as he reached the topmost step  he took an eager step towards her  philippa he exclaimed why what are you doing here  i was frightened she faltered are you hurt  not in the least he assured her we had a rough sail home thats all and that fellow oates drank himself half unconscious come along let me help you up the steps and out of this  she clung to his arm and they struggled up the private path to the house mills let them in with many expressions of concern and helen came hurrying to them from the background  i went out to see the storm philippa explained weakly and i saw mr lessinghams boat brought in  and mr lessingham will come this way at once helen insisted i havent had a real case since i got my certificate and im going to bind his head up  philippa began to feel her strength returning the horror which lay behind those few minutes of nightmare rose up again in her mind mills had hurried on into the bathroom and the other two were preparing to follow she stopped them  mr lessingham she said listen captain griffiths has been here he knows or guesses everything  everything  philippa nodded  helen must bind your head up of course she continued after that think what can we do captain griffiths knows that there was no hamar lessingham at college with dick that he never visited wood norton that there is some mystery about your arrival here and he told me to my face that he believes you to be bertram maderstrom  what a meddlesome fellow lessingham grumbled holding his handkerchief to his forehead  oh please be serious helen begged looking up from the bandage which she was preparing this is horrible  dont i know it philippa groaned mr lessingham you must please try and escape from here you can have the car if you like there must be some place where you can go and hide until you can get away from the country  but im dining here tonight lessingham protested im not going to hide anywhere  the two women exchanged glances of despair  cant i make you understand philippa exclaimed pathetically youre in danger herereally in danger  lessinghams demeanour showed no appreciation of the situation  of course i can quite understand he said that griffiths is suspicious about me but after all no one can prove that i have broken the law here and i shall not make things any better by attempting an opera bouffe flight can i have my head tied up and come and talk to you about it later on  oh if you like philippa assented weakly i cant argue  she made her way up to her room and changed her wet clothes when she came down lessingham was standing on the hearth rug in the library with a piece of buttered toast in one hand and a cup of tea in the other his head was very neatly bound up and he seemed quite at his ease  you know he began as he wheeled a chair up to the fire for her that man griffiths doesnt like me he never took to me from the first i could see that if it comes to that i dont like griffiths he is one of those mean suspicious sort of characters we could very well do without  philippa who had rehearsed a little speech several times in her bedroom tried to be firm  mr lessingham she said you know that we are both your friends do listen please captain griffiths is commandant here and in a position of authority he has a very large power i honestly believe that it is his intention to have you arrestedif not tonight within a very few days  i do not see how he can lessingham objected helping himself to another piece of toast i have committed no crime here i have played golf with all the respectable old gentlemen in the place and i have given the committee some excellent advice as to the two new holes i have played bridge down at the clubwe will call it bridgeand i have kept my temper like an angel i have dined at mess and told them at least a dozen new stories i have kept my blinds drawn at night and i have not a wireless secreted up the chimney i really cannot see what they could do to me  philippa tried bluntness  you have served in the german army and you are living in a protected area under a false name she declared  well of course there is some truth in what you say he admitted but even if they have tumbled to that and can prove it i should do no good by running away to be perfectly serious he added setting his cup down there is only one thing at the present moment which would take me out of dreymarsh and that is if you believe that my presence here would further compromise you and miss fairclough  philippa was beginning to find her courage were in it already up to the neck she observed i really dont see that anything matters so far as we are concerned  in that case he decided i shall have the honour of presenting myself at the usual time    chapter xxiii   philippa and helen met in the drawingroom a few minutes before eight that evening philippa was wearing a new black dress a model of simplicity to the untutored eye but full of that undefinable appeal to the mysterious which even the greatest artist frequently fails to create out of any form of colour some fancy had induced her to strip off her jewels at the last moment and she wore no ornaments save a band of black velvet around her neck helen looked at her curiously  is this a fresh scheme for conquest philippa she asked as they stood together by the log fire  philippa unexpectedly flushed  i dont know what i was thinking about really she confessed is that the exact time i wonder  two minutes to eight helen replied  mr lessingham is always so punctual philippa murmured i wonder if captain griffiths would dare  weve done our best to warn him helen reminded her friend the man is simply pigheaded  i cant help feeling that hes right philippa declared when he argues that they couldnt really prove anything against him  does that matter helen asked anxiously so long as he is an enemy living under a false name here  you dont think theydtheyd  shoot him helen whispered lowering her voice they couldnt do that they couldnt do that  the clock began to chime suddenly philippa who had been listening gave a little exclamation of relief  i hear his voice she exclaimed thank goodness  helens relief was almost as great as her companions a moment later mills ushered in their guest he was still wearing his bandage but his colour had returned he seemed in fact almost gay  nothing has happened then philippa demanded anxiously as soon as the door was closed  nothing at all he assured them our friend griffiths is terribly afraid of making a mistake  so afraid that he wouldnt come and dine never mind youll have to take care of us both she added as mills announced dinner  ill do my best he promised offering his arm  if the sword of damocles were indeed suspended over their heads it seemed only to heighten the merriment of their little repast philippa had ordered champagne and the warmth of the pleasant dining room the many appurtenances of luxury by which they were surrounded the glow of the wine and the perfume of the hothouse flowers upon the table seemed in delicious contrast to the fury of the storm outside they all three appeared completely successful in a strenuous effort to dismiss all disconcerting subjects from their minds lessingham talked chiefly of the east he had travelled in russia persia afghanistan and india and he had the unusual but striking gift of painting little word pictures of some of the scenes of his wanderings it was halfpast nine before they rose from the table and lessingham accompanied them into the library with the advent of coffee they were for the first time really alone lessingham sat by philippas side and helen reclined in a low chair close at hand  i think he said that i can venture now to tell you some news  helen put down her work philippa looked at him in silence and her eyes seemed to dilate  i have hesitated to say anything about it lessingham went on because there is so much uncertainty about these things but i believe that it is now finally arranged i think that within the next week or ten daysperhaps a little before perhaps a little lateryour brother richard will be set at liberty  dick dick coming home philippa cried springing up from her reclining position  dick helen faltered her work lying unheeded in her lap mr lessingham do you mean it is it possible  it is not only possible lessingham assured them but i believe that it will come to pass i have had to exercise a little duplicity but i fancy that it has been successful i have insisted that without help from an influential person in dreymarsh i cannot bring my labours here to a satisfactory conclusion and i have named as the price of that help richards absolute and immediate freedom i heard only this morning that there would be no difficulty  helen snatched up her work and groped her way towards the door  i will come back in a few minutes she promised her voice a little broken  lessingham who had opened the door for her returned to his place there were no tears in philippas brilliant eyes but there was a faint patch of colour in her cheeks and her lips were not quite steady she caught at his hands  oh my dear dear friend she said if only that little nightmare part of you did not exist if only you could be just what you seem and one could feel that you were there in our lives for always i feel that i want to talk to you so much to you and not the sham you what shall i call you  bertram please he whispered  then bertram dear she went on for my sake because you have really become dear to me because my heart aches at the thought of your danger and becausesee how honest i ami am a little afraid of myselfwill you go away the thought of your danger is like a nightmare to me it all seems so absurd and unreasonablei mean that the danger which i fear should be hanging over you but i think that there is just a little something back of your brain of which you have never spoken which it was your duty to keep to yourself and it is just that something which brings the danger  i am not afraid for myself philippa he told her i took a false step in life when i came here what it was that attracted me i do not know i think it was the thought of that wild ride amongst the clouds and the starlight it seemed such a wonderful beginning to any enterprise and philippa for one part of my adventure the part which concerns you it was a gorgeous prelude and for the otherwell it just does not count because i have no fear i have faith in my fortune do you know that i believe that i shall leave this place unharmed but i believe that if i leave it without you i shall go back to the worst hell in which a man could ever  bertram she pleaded think of it all even if i cared enoughand i dontthere is something unnatural about it doesnt it strike you as horrible my brother my cousins my father are all fighting the men of the nation whose cause you have espoused there is a horrible eternal cloud of hatred which it will take generations to get rid of if ever it disappears how can we two speak of love what part of the world could we creep into where people would not shrink away from us i may have lost a little of my heart to you bertram i may miss you when you go away i may waste weary hours thinking but that is all oh you know that it must be all  i do not he answered stubbornly  oh you must be reasonable she begged with a little break in her voice you know very well that i ought not to listen to you i ought not to welcome you here i ought to be strong and close my ears  but you will not do that  no she faltered please dont come any nearer i  she broke off suddenly the struggle in her face was ended her expression transformed her finger was held up as though to bid him listen with her other hand she clutched the back of the couch her eyes were fixed upon the door the little patch of wonderful colour faded from her cheeks  listen she cried with a note of terror in her voice that was the front door some one has come cant you hear them  lessinghams hand stole suddenly to his pocket she caught the glitter of something half withdrawn and shrank back with a halfstifled moan  not before you dear he promised please do not be afraid if this is the end leave me alone with griffiths i shall not hurt him i shall not forget and if by any chance he added this is to be our farewell philippa you will remember that i love you as the flowers of the world love their sun courage  the door facing them was opened  captain griffiths mills announced  through the open door they caught a vision of two other soldiers and inspector fisher griffiths came into the room alone however and waited until the door was closed before he spoke he carried himself as awkwardly as ever but his long lean face seemed to have taken to itself a new expression he had the air of a man indulging in some strange pleasure  lady cranston he said i am very sorry to intrude but my visit here is official  what is it she asked hoarsely  i have received confirmatory evidence in the matter of which i spoke to you this afternoon he went on i am sorry to disturb you at such an hour but it is my duty to arrest this man on a charge of espionage  lessingham to all appearance remained unmoved  a most objectionable word he remarked  a most villainous profession captain griffiths retorted thank heaven that in this country we are learning the art of dealing with its disciples  this is all a hideous mistake philippa declared feverishly i assure you that mr lessingham has visited my fathers house that he was wellknown to me years ago  as the baron maderstrom what arguments he has used lady cranston to induce you to accept him here under his new identity i do not know but the facts are very clear  he seems quite convinced doesnt he lessingham remarked turning to philippa and as i gather that a portion of the british army assisted by the local constabulary is waiting for me outside perhaps i had better humour him  it would be as well sir captain griffiths assented grimly i am glad to find you in the humour for jesting  lessingham turned once more to philippa this time his tone was more serious  lady cranston he begged wont you please leave us  no she answered hysterically i know why you want me to and i wont go you have done no harm and nothing shall happen to you i will not leave the room and you shall not  his gesture of appeal coincided with the sob in her throat she broke down in her speech and captain griffiths moved a step nearer  if you have any weapon in your possession sir he said you had better hand it over to me  well do you know lessingham replied i scarcely see the necessity one thing i will promise you he added with a sudden flash in his eyes a single step nearera single step mindand you shall have as much of my weapon as will keep you quiet for the rest of your life remember that so long as you are reasonable i do not threaten you help me to persuade lady cranston to leave us  captain griffiths was out of his depths he was not a coward but he had no hankering after death and there was death in lessinghams threat and in the flash of his eyes while he hesitated there was a knock upon the door mills came silently in he carried a telegram upon a salver  for you sir he announced addressing captain griffiths an orderly has just brought it down  griffiths looked at the pink envelope and frowned he tore it open however without a word as he read his long upper teeth closed in upon his lip so he stood there until two little drops of blood appeared  then he turned to mills  there is no answer he said  the man bowed and left the room he walked slowly and he looked back from the doorway it was scarcely possible for even so perfectly trained a servant to escape from the atmosphere of tragedy  something tells me lessingham remarked coolly as soon as the door was closed that that message concerns me  the commandant made no immediate reply he straightened out the telegram and read it once more under the lamplight as though to be sure there was no possible mistake then he folded it up and placed it in his waistcoat pocket  the notion of your arrest sir he said to lessingham harshly is apparently distasteful to some one at headquarters who has not digested my information i am withdrawing my men for the present  youre not going to arrest him philippa cried  i am not captain griffiths answered but he added turning to lessingham this is only a respite i have more evidence behind all that i have offered you are baron bertram maderstrom a german spy living here in a prohibited area under a false name that i know and that i shall prove to those who have interfered with me in the execution of my duty this is not the end  he left the room without even a word or a salute to philippa lessingham looked after him for a moment thoughtfully then he shrugged his shoulders  i am quite sure that i do not like captain griffiths he declared there is no breeding about the fellow    chapter xxiv   philippa even for some moments after the departure of captain griffiths and his myrmidons remained in a sort of nerveless trance the crisis with its bewildering denouement had affected her curiously lessingham rose presently to his feet  i wonder he asked if i could have a whisky and soda  she stamped her foot at him in a little fit of hysterical passion  youre not natural she cried whisky and soda  well i dont know he protested mildly helping himself from the table in the background i rather thought i was being particularly british when in doubt take a drink that is richard all the world over you know  she broke into a little mirthless laugh  i shall begin to think that you are a poseur she exclaimed  he crossed the room towards her  perhaps i am dear he confessed i want you just to sit up and lose that unnatural look i am not really full of cheap bravado but i am a philosopher something has happened to postponethe end good luck to it i say  he raised his tumbler to his lips and set it down empty philippa rose to her feet and walked restlessly to the window and back  ill try and be reasonable too she promised resuming her seat i was right you see captain griffiths has discovered everything can you tell me what possible reason any one in london could have had for interference  i seem to have got a friend up there without knowing it dont i he observed  this is aging me terribly philippa declared throwing herself back into her seat all my life i have hated mysteries here i am face to face with two absolutely insoluble ones captain griffiths has assured me that there is here in dreymarsh something of sufficient importance to account for the presence of a foreign spy you have confirmed it i have been torturing my brain about that for the last twentyfour hours now there happens something more inexplicable still you are arrested and you are not arrested your identity is known and captain griffiths is forbidden to do his duty  it seems puzzling does it not lessingham agreed i shouldnt worry about the first but this last little episode takes some explaining  if anything further happens this evening i think i shall go mad philippa sighed  and something is going to happen lessingham declared rising to his feet did you hear that  above even the roar of the wind they heard the brazen report of a gun from almost underneath the window the room was suddenly lightened by a single vivid flash  a mortar lessingham exclaimed and that was a rocket unless im mistaken  the signal for the lifeboat philippa announced i wonder if we can see anything  she hastened towards the window but paused at the abrupt opening of the door nora burst in followed more sedately by helen  mummy theres a wreck the former cried in excitement i heard something an hour ago and i got up and ive been sitting by the window watching i saw the lifeboat go out and theyre signalling now for the other one  its quite true philippa helen declared were going to try and fight our way down to the beach  ill go too lessingham decided perhaps i may be of use  well all go philippa agreed wait while i get my things on what is it mills she added as the door opened and the latter presented himself  there is a trawler on the rocks just off the breakwater your ladyship he announced they have just sent up from the beach to know if we can take some of the crew in they are landing them as well as they can on the line  of course we can was the prompt reply tell them to send as many as they want to we will find room for them somehow ill go upstairs and see about the fires youll all come back she added turning around  we will all come back lessingham promised  they fought their way down to the beach at first the storm completely deafened all sound the lanterns waved here and there by unseen hands seemed part of some ghostly tableau of which the only background was the raging of the storm then suddenly with a startling hiss another rocket clove its way through the darkness they had an instantaneous but brilliant view of all that was happeningsaw the trawler lying on its side apparently only a few yards from the shore saw the line stretched to the beach on which even at that moment a man was being drawn ashore licked by the spray his strained face and windtossed hair clearly visible then all was darkness again more complete than ever they struggled down on to the shingle where the little cluster of fishermen were hard at work with the line almost the first person they ran across was jimmy dumble he was standing on the edge of the breakwater with a great lantern in his hand superintending the line and as they drew near lessingham who was a little in advance could hear his voice above the storm he was shouting towards the wreck his hand to his mouth  send the master over next you lubbers or well cut the line do you hear  there was no reply or if there was it was drowned in the wind lessingham gripped the fisherman by the arm  whom do you mean by master he demanded dumble scarcely glanced at his interlocutor  why sir henry cranston to be sure was the agitated answer these lubbers of sea hands are all coming off first and the line wont stand for more than another one or two he added dropping his voice  then the thrill of those few minutes excitement unrolled itself into a great drama before lessinghams eyes sir henry was on that ship as near as any man might wish to be to death  eres the next jimmy muttered as they turned the windlass vigorously gosh es a heavy one too  then came a cry which sounded like a moan and above it the shrill fearful yell of a man who feels himself dropping out of the worlds hearing lessingham raised the lantern which stood on the beach by jimmys side the line had broken the body of its suspended traveller had disappeared and just then strangely enough for the first time for over an hour the heavens opened in one great sheet of lightning and they could see the figure of one man left on the ship clinging desperately to the rigging  tie the line around me jimmy shouted let her go get the other end on the windlass  they paid out the rope through their hands jimmy kicked off his boots and plunged into the cauldron he swam barely a dozen strokes before he was caught on the top of an incoming wave tossed about like a cork and flung back upon the beach where he lay groaning there was a little murmur amongst the fisherman who rushed to lean over him  swimming aint no more use than trying to walk on the water one of them declared  lessingham raised the lantern which he was carrying and flashed it around  where are the young ladies he asked  gone up to the house with two as weve just taken off the wreck some one informed him  lessingham stooped down willing hands helped him unfasten the cord from jimmys waist he tore off his own coat and waistcoat and boots some helped other sought to dissuade him as he secured the line around his own waist  weve sent for more rockets one man shouted in his ear the man will be back in half an hour  lessingham pushed them on one side he stood on the edge of the beach and borrowing a lantern watched for his opportunity then suddenly he vanished they looked after him they could see nothing but the rope slipping past their feet inch by inch sometimes it was stationary sometimes it was drawn taut the first great wave that came flung a yard or so of slack amongst them then after the roar of its breaking had died away they saw the rope suddenly tighten and pass rapidly out and the excitement began to thicken  that un didnt get him anyway one of them muttered  hell go through the next with luck another declared hopefully  lessingham fighting for his consciousness deafened and half stunned by the roar of the waters about him still felt the exhilaration of that great struggle he looked once into seas which seemed to touch the clouds drew himself stiff and plunged into the depths of a mountain of foaming waters whose summit seemed to him like one of those grotesque and nightmaredistorted efforts of the opiumeating brain then the roar sounded all behind him and he knew that he was through the breakers he swam to the side of the ship and clutched hold of a chain it was sir henrys outstretched hand which pulled him on to the deck  my god that was a swim the latter declared as he pulled his rescuer up not in the least recognising him lets have the end of that cord quick so he went on paying it out through his fingers until the end of the rope appeared youd better get your breath young man and then over you go ill follow  im damned if i do was the vigorous reply you start off while i get my breath  they were suddenly half drowned with a shower of spray sir henry held lessingham in a grip of iron or he would have been swept overboard  get one arm through the chains man he shouted my god he added peering through the gloom lessingham  well dont stop to worry about that was the fierce reply lets get on with our job  sir henry threw off his oilskins and his underneath coat  follow me when they wave the lantern twice he directed if we either of us get the knockwell thanks  lessingham felt the grip of sir henrys hand as he passed him and went overboard into the darkness then with one arm through the chains he drew towards him by means of his heel the coat which sir henry had thrown upon the deck gradually it came within reach of his disengaged hand he seized it shook it out and dived eagerly into the breast pocket there were several small articles which he threw ruthlessly away and then a square packet wrapped in oilcloth which bent to his fingers another breaking wave threw him on his back one arm was still through the chain the other gripped what some illuminating instinct had already convinced him was the chart as soon as he had recovered his breath a grim effort of humour parted his lips he lay there for a moment and laughed till the spray this time with a rush of green water underneath very nearly swept him from his place  they were waving a lantern on the beach when he struggled again to his feet  he slipped the little packet down his clothes next to his skin and groped about to find the end of the line which sir henry and he had fastened to a staple below the chains then he drew a long breath gripped the rope and shouted a second or two later he was back in the cauldron  as they pulled him on to the beach he had but one idea whatever happened he must not lose consciousness the packet was still there against the calf of his leg it must be his own hands which removed his clothes it seemed to him that those few bronzed faces those half a dozen rude lanterns had become magnified and multiplied a hundredfold it was an army of bluejerseyed fishermen which patted him on the back and welcomed him lanterns like the stars flashing everywhere around he set his teeth and fought against the buzzing in his ears he tried to speak and his voice sounded like a weak far away whisper  i am all right he kept on saying  then he felt himself leaning on two brawny arms his feet followed the mesmeric influence of their movement was he going into the clouds he wondered they stopped to open a gate the gate leading to the gardens of mainsail haul how did he get there he had no idea more movements of his feet and then unexpected warmth he looked around him there were voices he listened the one voice the one face bending over his her eyes wet with tears her whispers an incoherent stream of broken words then the warmth seemed to come back to his veins he sat up and found himself on the couch in the library the rain dripping from him in little pools and he knew that he had succeeded he had not fainted  i am all right he repeated what a mess i am making  the voices around him were still a little tangled but the hand which held a steaming tumbler to his lips was philippas  drink it all she begged  he felt the tears come into his eyes felt the warm blood streaming through his body felt a little wet patch at the back of the calf of his leg and the hand which set down the empty tumbler was almost steady  theres a hot bath ready philippa told him some dry clothes and a bedroom with a fire in do let mills show you the way  he rose at once prepared to follow her his feet were not quite so steady as he would have wished but he made a very presentable show mills with a little apology held out his arm philippa walked by his other side  as soon as you have finished your bath and got into some dry clothes philippa whispered please ring or send mills to let us know  he was even able to smile at her  i am quite all right he assured her once more    chapter xxv   philippa unusually early on the following morning glanced at the empty breakfast table with a little air of disappointment and rang the bell  mills she enquired is no one down  sir henry is i believe on the beach your ladyship the man answered and miss helen and miss nora are with him  and mr lessingham  mr lessingham your ladyship mills continued looking carefully behind him as though to be sure that the door was closed has disappeared  disappeared philippa repeated what do you mean mills  i left mr lessingham last night your ladyship mills explained in a suit of the masters clothes and apparently preparing for bedi should say this morning as it was probably about two oclock i called him at half past eight as desired and found the room empty the bed had not been slept in  was there no note or message philippa asked incredulously  nothing your ladyship one of the maid servants believes that she heard the front door open at five oclock this morning  ring up the hotel philippa instructed and see if he is there  mills departed to execute his commission philippa stood looking out of the window across the lawn and shrubbery and down on to the beach there was still a heavy sea but it was merely the swell from the day before the wind had dropped and the sun was shining brilliantly sir henry helen and nora were strolling about the beach as though searching for something about fifty yards out the wrecked trawler was lying completely on its side with the end of one funnel visible scattered groups of the villagers were examining it from the sands in due course mills returned  the hotel people know nothing of mr lessingham your ladyship beyond the fact that he did not return last night they received a message from hills garage however about half an hour ago to say that their mechanic had driven mr lessingham early this morning to norwich where he had caught the mail train to london the boy was to say that mr lessingham would be back in a day or so  philippa pushed open the windows and made her way down towards the beach she leaned over the rail of the promenade and waved her hand to the others who clambered up the shingle to meet her  scarcely seen you yet my dear have i sir henry observed  he stooped and kissed her forehead a salute which she suffered without response helen pointed to the wreck  it doesnt seem possible does it she said that mens lives should have been lost in that little space two men were drowned they say through the breaking of the rope they recovered the bodies this morning  everything else seems to have been washed on shore except my coat sir henry grumbled i was down here at daylight looking for it  your coat philippa repeated scornfully fancy thinking of that when you only just escaped with your life  but to tell you the truth my dear sir henry explained my pocketbook and papers of some value were in the pocket of that coat i cant think how i came to forget them i think it was the surprise of seeing that fellow lessingham crawl on to the wreck looking like a drowned rat jove what a pluck he must have   the fishermen can talk of nothing else nora put in excitedly mummy it was simply splendid helen and i had gone up with two of the rescued men but i got back just in time to see them fasten the rope round his waist and watch him plunge in  how is he this morning helen asked  gone philippa replied  they all looked at her in surprise  gone sir henry repeated what back to the hotel do you mean  his bed has not been slept in philippa told them he must have slipped away early this morning gone to hills garage hired a car and motored to norwich from there he went on to london he has sent word that he will be back in a few days  i hope to god he wont sir henry muttered  philippa swung round upon him  what do you mean by that she demanded dont you want to thank him for saving your life  my dear i certainly do sir henry replied but just nowwell i am a little taken aback gone to london eh tore away without warning in the middle of the night to london and coming back toothats the strange part of it  one would think from sir henrys expression that he was finding food for much satisfaction in this recital of lessinghams sudden disappearance  he is a wonderful fellow this lessingham he added thoughtfully he must haveyes by god he must havein that storm too  if you could speak coherently henry philippa observed i should like to say that i am exceedingly anxious to know why mr lessingham has deserted us so precipitately  sir henry would have taken his wifes arm but she avoided him he shrugged his shoulders and plodded up the steep path by her side  the whole question of lessingham is rather a problem he said of course you and helen have seen very much more of him than i have isnt it true that people have begun to make curious remarks about him  how did you know that henry philippa demanded  well one hears things he replied i should gather from what i heard that his position here had become a little precarious hence his sudden disappearance  but he is coming back again philippa reminded her husband  perhaps  philippa signified her desire that her husband should remain a little behind with her they walked side by side up the gravel path philippa kept her hands clasped behind her  to leave the subject of mr lessingham for a time she began i feel very reluctant to ask for explanations of anything you do but i must confess to a certain curiosity as to why i should find you lunching at the canton with two very beautiful ladies a few days ago when you left here with jimmy dumble to fish for whiting and also why you return here on a trawler which belongs to another part of the coast  sir henry made a grimace  i was beginning to wonder whether curiosity was dead he observed goodhumouredly if you wouldnt mind giving me anotherwell to be on the safe side let us say eight daysi think i shall be able to offer you an explanation which you will consider satisfactory  thank you philippa rejoined with cold surprise i see no reason why you should not answer such simple questions at once  sir henry sighed deprecatingly and made another vain attempt to take his wifes arm  philippa be a little brick he begged i know i seem to have been playing the part of a fool just lately but there has been a sort of reason for it  what reason could there possibly be she demanded which you could not confide in me  he was silent for a moment when he spoke again there was a new earnestness in his tone  philippa he said i have been working for some time at a little scheme which isnt ripe to talk about yet not even to you but which may lead to something which i hope will alter your opinion you couldnt see your way clear to trust me a little longer could you he begged with rather a plaintive gleam in his blue eyes it would make it so much easier for me to say no more but just have you sit tight  i wonder she answered coldly if you realise how much i have suffered sitting tight as you call it and waiting for you to do something  my fishing excursions he went on desperately have not been altogether a matter of sport  i know that quite well she replied you have been making that chart you promised your miserable fishermen none of those things interest me henry i feari am very much inclined to say that none of your doings interest me least of all she went on her voice quivering with passion do i appreciate in the least these mysterious appeals for my patience i have some common sense henry  youre a suspicious little beast he told her  suspicious she scoffed what a word to use from a man who goes off fishing for whiting and is lunching at the carlton some days afterwards with two ladies of extraordinary attractions  that was a trifle awkward sir henry admitted with a little burst of candour but it goes in with the rest philippa  then it can stay with the rest she retorted exactly where i have placed it in my mind please understand me your conduct for the last twelve months absolves me from any tie there may be between us if this explanation that you promise comesin time and i feel like it very well until it does i am perfectly free and you as my husband are nonexistent that is my reply henry to your request for further indulgence  rather a foolish one my dear he answered patting her shoulder but then you are rather a child arent you  she swung away from him angrily  dont touch me she exclaimed i mean every word of what i have said as for my being a childwell you may be sorry some day that you have persisted in treating me like one  sir henry paused for a moment watching her disappearing figure there was an unusual shade of trouble in his face his love for and confidence in his wife had been so absolute that even her threats had seemed to him like little morsels of wounded vanity thrown to him out of the froth of her temper yet at that moment a darker thought crossed his mind lessingham he realised was not a rival after all to be despised he was a man of courage and tact even though sir henry in his own mind had labelled him as a fool if indeed he were coming back to dreymarsh what could it be for how much had philippa known about him he stood there for a few moments in indecision a great impulse had come to him to break his pledge to tell her the truth then he made his disturbed way into the breakfast room  wheres your mother nora he asked as helen took philippas place at the head of the table  she wants some coffee and toast sent up to her room nora explained the wind made her giddy  sir henry breakfasted in silence rang the bell and ordered his car  you going away again daddy nora asked  i am going to london this morning he replied a little absently  to london helen repeated does philippa know  i havent told her yet  helen turned towards nora  i wish youd run up and see if your mother wants any more coffee theres a dear she suggested  nora acquiesced at once as soon as she had left the room helen leaned over and laid her hand upon sir henrys arm  dont go to london henry she begged  but my dear helen i must he replied a little curtly  i wouldnt if i were you she persisted you know youve tried philippa very high lately and she is in an extremely emotional state she is all worked up about last night and i wouldnt leave her alone if i were you  sir henrys blue eyes seemed suddenly like points of steel as he leaned towards her  you think that she is in love with that fellow lessingham he asked bluntly  no i dont helen replied but i think she is more furious with you than you believe for months you have actedwell how shall i say  oh like a coward if you like or a fool go on  she has asked for explanations to which she is perfectly entitled helen continued and you have given her none you have treated her like something between a doll and a child philippa is as good and sweet as any woman who ever lived but hasnt it ever occurred to you that women are rather mysterious beings they may sometimes do out of a furious sense of being wrongly treated out of a sort of aggravated pique what they would never do for any other reason if you must go come back tonight henry come back and if you are obstinate and wont tell philippa all that she has a right to know tell her about that luncheon in town  sir henry frowned  its all very well you know helen he said but a woman ought to trust her husband  i am your friend remember helen replied and upon my word i couldnt trust and believe even in dick if he behaved as you have done for the last twelve months  sir henry made a grimace  well that settles it i suppose then he observed ill have one more try and see what i can do with philippa perhaps a hint of whats going on may satisfy her  he climbed the stairs meeting nora on her way down and knocked at his wifes door there was no reply he tried the handle and found the door locked  are you there philippa he asked  yes she replied coldly  i am going to london this morning can i have a few words with you first  no  sir henry was a little taken aback  dont be silly philippa he persisted i may be away for four or five days  there was no answer sir henry suddenly remembered another entrance from a newly added bathroom he availed himself of it and found philippa seated in an easychair calmly progressing with her breakfast she raised her eyebrows at his entrance  these are my apartments she reminded him  dont be a little fool he exclaimed impatiently  philippa deliberately buttered herself a piece of toast picked up her book and became at once immersed in it  you dont wish to talk to me then he demanded  i do not she agreed you have had all the opportunities which any man should need of explaining certain matters to me my curiosity in them has ended also my interestin you you say you are going to london very well pray do not hurry home on my account  sir henry as he turned to leave the room made the common mistake of a man arguing with a womanhe attempted to have the last word  perhaps i am better out of the way eh  perhaps so philippa assented sweetly    chapter xxvi   philippa late that afternoon found what she soughtsolitude she had walked along the sands until dreymarsh lay out of sight on the other side of a spur of the cliffs before her stretched a long and level plain a fringe of sand and a belt of shingly beach there was not a sign of any human being in sight and of buildings only a quaint tower on the far horizon  she found a dry place on the pebbles removed her hat and sat down her hands clasped around her knees her eyes turned seaward she had come out here to think but it was odd how fugitive and transient her thoughts became her husband was always there in the background but in those moments it was lessingham who was the predominant figure she remembered his earnestness his tender solicitude for her the courage which when necessity demanded had flamed up in him a born and natural quality she remembered the agony of those few minutes on the preceding day when nothing but what still seemed a miracle had saved him at one moment she felt herself inclined to pray that he might never come back at another her heart ached to see him once more she knew so well that if he came it would be for her sake that he would come to ask her finally the question with which she had fenced she knew too that his coming would be the moment of her life she was so much of a woman and the passionate craving of her sex to give love for love was there in her heart almost omnipotent and in the background there was that bitter desire to bring suffering upon the man who had treated her like a child who had placed her in a false position with all other women who had dawdled and idled away his days heedless of his duty heedless of every serious obligation when she tried to reason her way seemed so clear and yet behind it all there was that cold impulse of almost victorian prudishness the inheritance of a long line of virtuous women a prudishness which she had once when she had believed that it was part of her second nature scoffed at as being the outcome of one of the finer forms of selfishness  she told herself that she had come there to decide and decision came no nearer to her a late afternoon star shone weakly in the sky a faint vaporous mist obscured the horizon and floated in tangled wreaths upon the face of the sea only that line of sand seemed still clearcut and distinct and as she glanced along it her eyes were held by something approaching something which seemed at first nothing but a black moving speck then gradually resolved itself into the semblance of a man on horseback galloping furiously she watched him as he drew nearer and nearer the sand flying from his horses hoofs his figure motionless his eyes apparently fixed upon some distant spot it was not until he had come within fifty yards of her that she recognised him his horse shied at the sight of her and was suddenly swung round with a powerful wrist little specks of sand churned up in the momentary stampede of hoofs fell upon her skirt for the rest she watched the struggle composedly a struggle which was over almost as soon as it was begun captain griffiths leaned down from his trembling but subdued horse  lady cranston he exclaimed in astonishment  thats me she replied smiling up at him have you been riding off your bad temper  he glanced down at his horses quivering sides back as far as one could see there was that regular line of hoof marks  am i badtempered he asked  well she observed i dont know you well enough to answer that question i was simply thinking of yesterday evening  he slipped from his horse and stood before her his long severe face had seldom seemed more malevolent  i had enough to make me badtempered he declared i had tracked down a german spy step by step until i had him there waiting for arrestexpecting it evenand then i got that wicked message  what was that wicked message after all she enquired  that doesnt matter he answered it was from a quarter where they ought to know better and it ordered me to make no arrest i have sent to the war office today a full report and i am praying that they may change their minds  philippa sighed  if you hadnt received that telegram last night she observed it seems to me that i should have been a widow today  he frowned and struck his boot heavily with his riding whip  yes i heard of that he admitted i dare say if he hadnt gone though some one else would  would you have gone if you had been there she asked  if you had told me to he replied looking at her steadfastly  philippa felt a little shiver there was something ominous in the intensity of his gaze and the meaning which he had contrived to impart to his tone she rose to her feet  well she said dont let me keep you here i am getting cold  he passed his arm through the bridle of his horse i will walk with you if i may he proposed she made no reply and they set their faces homewards  i hear lessingham has left the place he remarked a little abruptly  oh i expect hell come back philippa replied  how long is it lady cranston since you took to consorting with german spies he asked  dont be foolishor impertinent she enjoined you are making a ridiculous mistake about mr lessingham  he laughed unpleasantly  no need for us to fence he said you and i know who he is what i do want to know what i have been wondering all the way from the point therefour miles of hard galloping and one questionwhy are you his friend what is he to you  really captain griffiths she protested looking up at him of what possible interest can that be to you  well it is anyhow he answered gruffly anything that concerns you is of interest to me  philippa realised at that moment perhaps for the first time what it all meant she realised the significance of those apparently purposeless afternoon calls when through sheer boredom she had had to send for helen to help her out the significance of those long silences the melancholy eyes which seemed to follow her movements she felt an unaccountable desire to laugh and then at the first twitchings of her lips she restrained herself she knew that tragedy was stalking by her side  i think captain griffiths she said gravely that you are talking nonsense and you are not a very good hand at it wont you please ride on  he made no movement to mount his horse he plodded along the soft sand by her sidea queer elongated figure his gloomy eyes fixed upon the ground  until this fellow lessingham came you were never so hard he persisted  she looked at him with genuine curiosity  i was never so hard she repeated do you imagine that i have ever for a single moment considered my demeanour towards youyou of all persons in the world i simply dont remember when you have been there and when you havent i dont remember the humours in which i have been when we have conversed all that you have said seems to me to be the most arrant nonsense  he swung himself into the saddle and gathered up the reins  thank you he said bitterly i understand only let me tell you this he went on his whip poised in his hand you may have powerful friends who saved your  he hesitated so long that she glanced up at him and read all that he had wished to say in his face  my what she asked  his courage failed him  mr lessingham he proceeded from arrest but if he shows his face here again in dreymarsh i shant stop to arrest him i shall shoot him on sight and chance the consequences  theyll hang you she declared savagely  he laughed at her  hang me for shooting a man whom i can prove to be a german spy they wont dare they wont even dare to place me under arrest for an hour why when the truth becomes known he went on his voice gaining courage as the justice of his case impressed itself upon him what do you suppose is going to happen to two women who took this fellow in and befriended him introduced him under a false name to their friends gave him the run of their housethis man whom they knew all the time was a german you lady cranston chafing and scolding your husband by night and by day because he isnt where you think he ought to be you so patriotic that you cannot bear the sight of him out of uniform youthe hostess the befriender the god knows what of bertram maderstrom it will be a pretty tale when its all told  i really think philippa asserted calmly that you are the most utterly impossible and obnoxious creature i have ever met  his face was dangerous for a moment they had not yet reached the promontory which sheltered them from dreymarsh  perhaps he muttered leaning malignly towards her i could make myself even more obnoxious  quite possibly she replied only i want to tell you this if you come a single inch nearer to me one of them shall shoot you  your friend or your husband eh he scoffed  she waved him on  i think she told him that either of them would be quite capable of ridding the world of a coward like you  a coward he repeated  precisely isnt it a cowards part to terrorise a woman  i dont want to terrorise you he said sulkily  well you must admit that you havent shown any particular desire to make yourself agreeable she pointed out  he turned suddenly upon her  i am a fool i know he declared bitterly im an awkward nervous miserable fool my own worst enemy as they say of me in the mess turning the people against me i want to have like me stumbling into every blunder a fool can im the sort of man women make sport of and youve done it for them cruelly perfectly  captain griffiths she protested when have i ever been anything but kind and courteous to you  it isnt your kindness i want nor your courtesy theres a curse upon my tongue he went on desperately im not like other men i dont know how to say what i feel i cant put it into words every one misunderstands me you too here i rode up to you this afternoon and my heart was beating for joy and in five minutes i had made an enemy of you damn that fellow lessingham it is all his fault  without the slightest warning he brought down his hunting crop upon his horses flanks the mare gave one great plunge and he was off riding at a furious gallop philippa watched him with immense relief in the far distance she could see two little specks growing larger and larger she hurried on towards them  whatever did you do to captain griffiths mummy nora demanded why he passed us without looking down galloping like a madman and his face lookedwell what did it look like helen  helen was gazing uneasily along the sands  like a man riding for his enemy she declared    chapter xxvii   philippa and helen looked at one another a little dolefully across the luncheon table  i supposes one misses the child helen said  i feel too depressed for words philippa admitted  a few days ago helen reminded her companion we were getting all the excitement that was good for any one  and a little more philippa agreed i dont know why things seem so flat now we really ought to be glad that nothing terrible has happened  what with henry and mr lessingham both away helen continued and captain griffiths not coming near the place we really have reverted to the normal havent we i wonderif mr lessingham has gone back  i do not think so philippa murmured  helen frowned slightly  personally she said with some emphasis i hope that he has  if we are considering the personal point of view only philippa retorted i hope that he has not  helen looked her disapproval  i should have thought that you had had enough playing with fire she observed  one never has until one has burned ones fingers philippa sighed i know perfectly well what is the matter with you she continued severely you are fretting because curried chicken is dicks favourite dish  i am not such a baby helen protested all the same it does make one think i wonder  i know exactly what you were going to say philippa interrupted you were going to say that you wondered whether mr lessingham would keep his promise  whether he would be able to helen corrected it does seem so impossible doesnt it  so does mr lessingham himself philippa reminded her it isnt exactly a usual thing is it to have a perfectly charming and wellbred young man step out of a zeppelin into your drawingroom  you really believe then helen asked eagerly that he will be able to keep his promise  philippa nodded confidently  do you know she said i believe that mr lessingham by some means or another would keep any promise he ever made i am expecting to see dick at any moment now so you can get on with your lunch dear and not sit looking at the curry with tears in your eyes  it isnt the curry so much as the chutney helen protested faintly he never would touch any other sort  well i shouldnt be surprised if he were here to finish the bottle philippa declared i have a feeling this morning that something is going to happen  how long has nora gone away for helen enquired after a moments pause  a fortnight or three weeks philippa answered her grandmother wired that she would be glad to have her until christmas  just why helen asked seriously have you sent her away  philippa toyed with her curry and glanced around as though she regretted mills absence from the room  i thought it best she said quietly you see i am not quite sure what the immediate future of this menage is going to be  helen leaned across the table and laid her hand upon her friends  dear she sighed it worries me so to hear you talk like that  why  because you know perfectly well although you profess to ignore it that at the bottom of your heart there is no one else but henry it isnt fair you know  to whom isnt it fair philippa demanded  to mr lessingham  philippa was thoughtful for a few moments  perhaps she admitted that is a point of view which i have not sufficiently considered  helen pressed home her advantage  i dont think you realise philippa she said how madly in love with you the man is in a perfectly ingenuous way too no one could help seeing it  then where does the unfairness come in philippa asked it is within my power to give him all that he wants  but you wouldnt do it philippa you know that you wouldnt helen objected you may play with the idea in your mind but thats just as far as youd ever get   philippa looked her friend steadily in the face i disagree with you helen she said helen set down the glass which she had been in the act of raising to her lips it was her first really serious intimation of the tragedy which hovered over her future sisterinlaws life somehow or other philippa had seemed even to her so far removed from that strenuous world of overdrugged overexcited feminine decadence to whom the changing of a husband or a lover is merely an incident in the days excitements philippa with her frail and almost flowerlike beauty her love of the wholesome ways of life and her strong affections represented other things now for the first time helen was really afraid afraid for her friend  but you couldnt everyou wouldnt leave henry  philippa seemed to find nothing monstrous in the idea  that is just what i am seriously thinking of doing she confided  helen affected to laugh but her mirth was obviously forced their conversation ceased perforce with the return of mills into the room  then the wonderful thing happened the windows of the dining room faced the drive to the house and both women could clearly see a motor car turn in at the gate and stop at the front door it was obviously a hired car as the driver was not in livery but the tall mulledup figure in unfamiliar clothes who occupied the front seat was for the moment a mystery to them only helen seemed to have some wonderful premonition of the truth a premonition which she was afraid to admit even to herself her hand began to shake philippa looked at her in amazement  you look as though you had seen a ghost helen she exclaimed who on earth can it be coming at this time of the day  helen was speechless and philippa divined at once the cause of her agitation she sprang to her feet  helen you dont imagine she gasped listen  there was a voice in the haila familiar voice though strained a little and hoarse mills decorous greetings agitated but fervent and thenmajor richard felstead  dick helen screamed as she threw herself into his arms oh dick dick  it was an incoherent breathless moment somehow or other philippa found herself sharing her brothers embrace then the fire of questions and answers was presently interrupted by mills triumphantly bearing in a fresh dish of curry  what will the major take to drink your ladyship he asked  felstead laughed a little chokingly  upon my word theres something wonderfully sound about mills he said its a ghoulish thing to ask for in the middle of the day isnt it philippa but can i have some champagne  you can have the whole cellarful philippa assured him joyously be sure you bring the best mills  the perrier jonet 1904 your ladyship was the murmured reply  mills disappearance was very brief and in a very few moments they found themselves seated once more at the table they sat one on either side of him watching his glass and his plate by degrees their questions and his answers became more intelligible  when did you get here they wanted to know  i arrived in harwich about daylight this morning he told them came across from holland i hired a car and drove straight here  when did you know you were coming home helen asked  only two days ago he replied i never was so surprised in my life even now i cant realise my good luck i cant see what ive done the last two months in fact seem to me to have been a dream jove he went on as he drank his wine i never thought i should be such a pig as to care so much for eating and drinking  and think what weeks of it you have before you helen explained clapping her hands philippa and i will have a new interest in lifeto make you fat  he laughed  it wont be very difficult he promised them i had several months of semistarvation before the miracle happened it was all just the chance of having had a pal up at magdalen whos been serving in the german armybertram maderstrom was his name you remember him philippa he was a swede in those days  what a dear he must have been to have remembered and to have been so faithful philippa observed looking away for a moment  hes a real good sort felstead declared enthusiastically although heaven knows why hes turned german he worked like a slave for me i dare say he didnt find it so difficult to get me better quarters and a servant and decent food but when they told me that i was freewell it nearly knocked me silly  the dear fellow philippa murmured pensively  do you remember him either of you felstead continued rather goodlooking he was and a little shy but quite a sportsman  iseem to remember philippa admitted  the name sounds familiar helen echoed do have some more chutney dick  thanks what a pig i am making of myself he observed cheerfully you girls will think i cant talk about any one but maderstrom but the whole business beats me so completely of course we were great pals in a way but i never thought that i was the apple of his eye or anything of that sort how he got the influence too i cant imagine and oh i knew there was something else i was going to ask you girls felstead went on have you ever had a letter or rather a letter each uncensored just a line or two i think i mentioned maderstrom which i should not have been allowed to do in the ordinary prison letters  felstead was helping himself to cheese and he saw nothing of the quick glance which passed between the two women  yes we had them dick philippa told him it was one afternoonit doesnt seem so very long ago and oh how thankful we were  felstead nodded  he got them across all right then tell me did they come through holland what was the postmark  the postmark philippa repeated a little doubtfully you heard what dick asked helen the postmark  i dont think there was one helen replied glancing anxiously at philippa  felstead set down his glass  no postmark you mean no foreign postmark i suppose they were posted in england eh  philippa shook her head  they came to us dick she said by hand  felstead was without a doubt astonished he turned round in his chair towards philippa  by hand he repeated do you mean to say that they were actually brought here by hand  perhaps something in his manner warned them philippa laughed as she bent over his chair  we will tell you how they came presently she declared but not until you have finished your lunch drunk the last drop of that champagne and had at least two glasses of the port that mills has been decanting so carefully after that we will see just now i have only one feeling and i know that helen has it too nothing else matters except that we have you home again  felstead patted his sister on the cheek drew her face down to his and kissed her  its so wonderful to be at home he exclaimed apologetically but i must warn you that i am the rabidest person alive i went out to the war with a certain amount of respect for the germans i have come back loathing them like vermin i spentbut i wont go on  mills made his appearance with the decanter of port  i beg your ladyships pardon he said as he filled felsteads glass but mr lessingham has arrived and is in the library waiting to see you    chapter xxviii   to major richard felstead mills announcement was without significance for the first time he became conscious however of something which seemed almost like a secret understanding between his sister and his fiancée  tell mr lessingham i shall be with him in a minute or two if he will kindly wait philippa instructed  who is mr lessingham richard enquired as soon as the door had closed behind mills seems a queer time to call  helen glanced at philippa whose lips framed a decided negative  mr lessingham is a gentleman staying in the neighbourhood the latter replied you will probably make his acquaintance before long incidentally he saved henrys life the other night  sounds exciting richard observed what form of destruction was henry courting  there was a trawler shipwrecked in the storm philippa explained you can see it from all the front windows henry was on board returning from one of his fishing excursions they were trying to find dumbles anchorage and were driven in on to that low ridge of rock a rope broke or something they had no more rockets and mr lessingham swam out with the line  sounds like a plucky chap richard admitted  philippa rose to her feet regretfully  i expect he has come to wish us goodby she said ill leave you with helen dick dont let her overfeed you and you know where the cigars are helen take dick into the gun room afterwards youll have it all to yourselves and there is a fire there  philippa entered the library in a state of agitation for which she was glad to have some reasonable excuse she held out both her hands to lessingham  dick is backjust arrived she exclaimed i cant tell you how happy we are and how grateful  lessingham raised her fingers to his lips  i am glad he said simply do you mean that he is in the house here now  he is in the dining room with helen  lessingham for a moment was thoughtful  dont you think he suggested that it would be better to keep us apart  i was wondering she confessed  have you told him about my bringing the letters  she shook her head  we nearly did then i stoppedi wasnt sure  you were wise he said  are you wise she asked him quickly  in coming back here  she nodded  captain griffiths knows everything she reminded him he is simply furious because your arrest was interfered with i really believe that he is dangerous  lessingham was unmoved  i had to come back he said simply  why did you go away so suddenly  well i had to do that too he replied only the governing causes were very different we will speak if you do not mind only of the cause which has brought me back that i believe you know already  philippa was curiously afraid she looked towards the door as though with some vague hope of escape she realised that the necessity for decision had arrived  philippa he went on do you see what this is  he handed her two folded slips of paper she started at the top of one she recognised a small photograph of herself  what are they she asked what does it mean  they are passports for america he told her  forfor me she faltered  for you and me  they slipped from her fingers he picked them up from the carpet her face was hidden for a moment in her hands  i know so well how you are feeling he said humbly i know how terrible a shock this must seem to you when it comes so near you are so different from the other women who might do this thing it is so much harder for you than for them  she lifted her head there was still something of the look of a scared child in her face  dont imagine me better than i am she begged i am not really different from any other woman only it is the first time this sort of thing has ever come into my life  i know you see he went on a little wistfully you have not taken me as yet very far into your confidence philippa you know that i love you as a man loves only once it sounds like an empty phrase to say it but if you will give me your life to take care of i shall only have one thoughtto make you happy could i succeed that is what you have to ask yourself you are not happy now do you think that if you stay on here the future is likely to be any better for you  she shook her head drearily  i believe she confessed that i have reached the very limit of my endurance  he came a little nearer his hands rested upon her shoulders very lightly yet they seemed like some enveloping chain more than ever in those few moments she realised the spiritual qualities of his face his eyes were aglow his voice a little broken with emotion was wonderfully tender he looked at her as though she were some precious and sacred thing  i am rich he said and there are few parts of the world where we could not live we could find our way to the islands like your great writer stevenson in whom you delight so much islands full of colour and wonderful birds and strange blue skies islands where the peace of the tropics dulls memory and time heats only in the heart the world is a great place philippa and there are corners where the sordid crime of this ghastly butchery has scarcely been heard of where the horror and the taint of it are as though they never existed where the sun and moon are still unashamed and the grey monsters ride nowhere upon the sapphire seas  it sounds like a fairy tale she murmured with a half pathetic smile  love always fashions life like a fairy tale he replied  she stood perfectly still  you must have my answer now at this moment she asked at last  there are yet some hours he told her i have a very powerful automobile here and tonight there is a full moon if we leave here at ten oclock we can catch the steamer tomorrow afternoon everything has been made very easy for me and fortune too is with usyour vindictive commandant captain griffiths is in london you see you have the whole afternoon for thought i want you only for your happiness at ten oclock i shall come here if you are coming with me you must be ready then you understand  i understand she assented under her breath and now she went on raising her eyes somehow i think that you are right it would be better for you and dick not to meet  i am sure of it he agreed i shall come for my answer at ten oclock i wonder  he stood looking at her his eyes hungry to find some sign in her face there was so much kindness there so much that might pass even for affection and yet something which behind it all chilled his confidence he left his sentence uncompleted and turned towards the door suddenly she called him back she held up her finger her whole expression had changed she was alarmed  wait she begged i can hear dicks voice wait till he has crossed the hail  they both stood for a moment quite silent then they heard a little protesting cry from helen and a goodhumoured laugh from richard the door was thrown open  you dont mind our coming through to the gun room phil her brother asked were notmy god  there was a queer silence broken by helen who stood on the threshold the picture of distress  i tried to get him to go the other way philippa  richard took a quick step forward his hands were outstretched  bertram he exclaimed is this a miracle you here with my sister  lessingham held out his hand suddenly richard dropped his his expression had become sterner  i dont understand he said simply somebody please explain    chapter xxix   for a few brief seconds no one seemed inclined to take upon themselves the onus of speech richards amazement seemed to increase upon reflection  maderstrom he exclaimed bertram what in the name of all thats diabolical are you doing here  i am just a derelict lessingham explained with a faint smile glad to see you richard you are a day earlier than i expected  you knew that i was coming then richard demanded  naturally lessingham replied i had the great pleasure of arranging for your release  look here richard went on im groping about a bit i dont understand forgive me if i run off the track im not forgetting our friendship maderstrom or what i owe to you since you came and found me at wittenburg but for all that you have served in the german army and are an enemy and i want to know what you are doing here in england in my brotherinlaws house  no particular harm richard i promise you lessingham replied mildly  you are here under a false name  hamar lessingham if you do not mind the other assented i prefer my own name but i do not fancy that the use of it would ensure me a very warm welcome over here just now besides he added with a glance at philippa i have to consider the friends whose hospitality i have enjoyed  in a shadowy sort of way the truth began to dawn upon richard his tone became grimmer and his manner more menacing  maderstrom he said we met last under different circumstances i will admit that i cut a poor figure but mine was at least an honourable imprisonment i am not so sure that yours is an honourable freedom  philippa laid her hand upon her brothers arm  dick dear do remember that they were starving you to death she begged  you would never have lived through it helen echoed  you are talking to mr lessingham philippa protested as though he were an enemy instead of the best friend you ever had in your life  richard waved them away  you must leave this to us he insisted maderstrom and i will be able to understand one another at any rate what are you doing in this housein england what is your mission here  whatever it may have been it is accomplished lessingham said gravely at the present moment my plans are to leave your country tonight  accomplished richard repeated what the devil do you mean accomplished are you playing the spy in this country  you would probably consider my mission espionage lessingham admitted  and you have brought it to a successful conclusion  i have  philippa threw her arms around her brothers neck dick she pleaded please listen mr lessingham has been here in this district ever since he landed in england what possible harm could he do we havent a single secret to be learned everybody knows where our few guns are everybody knows where our soldiers are quartered we havent a harbour or any secret fortifications we havent any shipping information which it would be of the least use signalling anywhere mr lessingham has spent his time amongst trifles here take helen away somewhere and forget that you have seen him in the house remember that he has saved henrys life as well as yours  i invite no consideration upon that account lessingham declared all that i did for you in germany i did or should have attempted to do for my old friend your release was different i am forced to admit that it was the price paid for my sojourn here i will only ask you to remember that the bargain was made without your knowledge and that you are in no way responsible for it  a price richard pronounced fiercely which i refuse to pay  lessingham shrugged his shoulders  the alternative he confessed is in your hands  richard moved towards the telephone  i am sorry maderstrom he said but my duty is clear who is commandant here philippa  philippa stood between her brother and the telephone there was a queer angry patch of colour in her cheeks her eyes were on fire  richard she exclaimed you shall not do this from my house i forbid you  do what  give information do you know what it would mean if they believed you  death he answered maderstrom knew the risk he ran when he came to this country under a false name  perfectly lessingham admitted  but i wont have it philippa protested he has become our friend day by day we have grown to like him better and better he has saved your life dick he has brought you back to us think what it is that you purpose  it is what every soldier has to face richard declared  you men drive me crazy with your foolish ideas philippa cried desperately the war is in your brains i think you would carry it from the battlefields into your daily life because two great countries are at war is everything to go bychivalryall the finer sweeter feelings of life if you two met on the battlefield it would be different here in my drawingroom i will not have this black demon of the war dragged in as an excuse for murder take dick away helen she begged mr lessingham is leaving tonight i will pledge my word that until then he remains a harmless citizen  women dont understand these things philippa richard began  thank heavens we understand them better than you men philippa interrupted fiercely you have but one ideato strikethe narrow idea of men that breeds warfare i tell you that if ever universal peace comes if ever the nations are taught the horror of this lust for blood this criminal outrage against civilisation it is the women who will become the teachers because amongst your instincts the brutish ones of force are the first to leap to the surface at the slightest provocation we women see further we know more i swear to you richard that if you interfere i will never forgive you as long as i live  richard stared at his sister in amazement there seemed to be some new spirit born within her throughout all their days he had never known her so much in earnest so passionately insistent he looked from her to the man whom she sought to protect and who answered unasked the thoughts that were in his mind  whatever harm i may have been able to do lessingham announced is finished i leave this place tonight probably for ever as for the commandant he went on with a faint smile he is already upon my track there is nothing you can tell him about me which he does not know it is just a matter of hours the toss of a coin whether i get away or not  theyve found you out then richard exclaimed  only a miracle saved me from arrest a week ago lessingham acknowledged your commandant here is at the present moment in london for the sole purpose of denouncing me  and yet you remain here paying afternoon calls richard observed incredulously im hanged if i can see through this  you see lessingham explained gently i am a fatalist  it was helen who finally led her lover from the room he looked back from the door  maderstrom he said you know quite well how personally i feel towards you i am grateful for what you have done for me even though i am beginning to understand your motives but as regards the other things we are both soldiers i am going to talk to helen for a time i want to understand a little more than i do at present  lessingham nodded  let me help you he begged here is the issue in plain words all that i did for you at wittenberg i should have done in any case for the sake of our friendship your freedom would probably never have been granted to me but for my mission although even that i might have tried to arrange i brought your letters here and i traded them with your sister and miss fairclough for the shelter of their hospitality and their guarantees now you know just where friendship ended and the other things began do what you believe to be your duty  richard followed helen out closing the door after him lessingham looked down into philippas face  you are more wonderful even than i thought he continued softly you say so little and you live so near the truth it is those of us who feel as you dowho understandto whom this war is so terrible  i want to ask you one question before i send you away she told him this journey to america  it is a mission on behalf of germany he explained but it is after all an open one i have friendshighly placed friendsin my own country who in their hearts feel as i do about the war it is through them that i am able to turn my back upon europe i have done my share of fighting he went on sadly and the horror of it will never quite leave me i think that no one has ever charged me with shirking my duty and yet the sheer black ugliness of this ghastly struggle its criminal inutility have got into my blood so that i think i would rather pass out of the world in some simple way than find myself back again in that debauch of blood is this cowardice philippa  she looked at him with shining eyes  there isnt any one in the world she said who could call you a coward whatever i may decide whatever i may feel towards you that at least i know  he kissed her fingers  at ten oclock he began  but listen she interrupted apart from anything which dick might do you are in terrible danger here all the more if you really have accomplished something why not go now at this moment why wait these few hours may make all the difference  he smiled  they may indeed make all the difference to my life he answered that is for you  he followed mills who had obeyed her summons out of the room philippa moved to the window and watched him until he had disappeared then very slowly she left the room walked up the stairs made her way to her own little suite of apartments and locked the door    chapter xxx   it was a happy if a trifle hysterical little dinner party that evening at mainsail haul philippa was at times unusually silent but helen had expanded in the joy of her great happiness richard shaved and with his hair cut attired once more in the garb of civilisation seemed a different person even in these few hours the lines about his mouth seemed less pronounced they talked freely of maderstrom  a regular vanity fair problem richard declared balancing his wine glass between his fingers a problem too which i cant say i have solved altogether yet the only thing is that if he is really going tonight i dont see why i shouldnt let the matter drift out of my mind  it is so much better helen agreed try as hard as ever i can i cannot picture his doing any harm to anybody and as for any information he may have gained here well i think that we can safely let him take it back to germany  he was always richard continued reminiscently a sort of cross between a dreamer an idealist and a sportsman there was never anything of the practical man of affairs about him he was scrupulously honourable and almost a purist in his outlook upon life i have met a great many germans richard went on and ive killed a few thank godbut he is about as unlike the ordinary type as any one i ever met the only pity is that he ever served his time with them  philippa had been listening attentively she was more than ever silent after her brothers little appreciation of his friend richard glanced at her goodhumouredly  you havent killed the fatted calf for me in the shape of clothes philippa he observed one would think that you were going on a journey  she glanced down at her highnecked gown and avoided helens anxious eyes  i may go for a walk she said and leave you two young people to talk secrets i am rather fond of the garden these moonlight nights  when is henry coming back her brother enquired  philippas manner was quiet but ominous  i have no idea she confessed he comes and goes as the whim seizes him and i very seldom know where he is one week it is whiting and another codling lately he seems to have shown some partiality for london life  richards eyes were wide open now  you mean to say that he is still not doing anything  nothing whatever  but what excuse does he giveor rather i should say reason richard persisted  he says that he is too old for a ship and he wont work in an office philippa replied that is what he says his point of view is so impossible that i can not even discuss it with him  its the rummest go i ever came across richard remarked reminiscently i should have said that old henry would have been up and at em at the admiralty before the first gun was fired  on the contrary philippa rejoined he took advantage of the war to hire a scotch moor at halfprice about a week after hostilities had commenced  its a rum go richard repeated i cant fancy henry as a skulker forgive me philippa he added  you are entirely forgiven she assured him drily  he comes of such a fine fighting stock richard mused i suppose his health is all right  his health philippa declared is marvellous i should think he is one of the strongest men i know  her brother patted her hand  youve been making rather a trouble of it old girl he said affectionately its no good doing that you know you wait and let me have a talk with henry  i think she replied that nearly everything possible has already been said to him  perhaps youve put his back up a bit richard suggested and he may really be on the lookout for something all the time  it has been a long search philippa retorted with quiet sarcasm let us talk about something else  they gossiped for a time over acquaintances and relations made their plans for the weekrichard must report at the war office at once  philippa grew more and more silent as the meal drew to a close it was at helens initiative that they left richard alone for a moment over his port she kept her arm through her friends as they crossed the hall into the drawingroom and closed the door behind them philippa stood upon the hearth rug already her mouth had come together in a straight line her eyes met helens defiantly  i know exactly what you are going to say helen she began and i warn you that it will be of no use  helen drew up a small chair and seated herself before the fire  are you going away with mr lessingham philippa she asked  i am was the calm response i made up my mind this afternoon we are leaving tonight  helen stretched out one foot to the blaze  motoring she enquired  naturally philippa replied you know there are no trains leaving here tonight  youll have a cold ride helen remarked i should take your heavy fur coat  philippa stared at her companion  you dont seem much upset helen  i think helen declared looking up that nothing that has ever happened to me in my life has made me more unhappy but i can see that you have reasoned it all out and there is not a single argument i could use which you havent already discounted it is your life philippa not mine  since you are so philosophical philippa observed let me ask youshould you do what i am going to do if you were in my place  i should not was the firm reply  philippa laughed heartily  oh i know what you are going to say helen continued quickly youll tell me wont you that i am not temperamental i think in your heart you rather despise my absolute fidelity to richard you would call it cowlike or something of that sort there is a difference between us philippa and that is why i am afraid to argue with you  what should you do philippa demanded if richard failed you in some great thing  i might suffer helen confessed but my love would be there all the same perhaps for that reason i should suffer the more but i should never be able to see with those who judged him hardly  you think then philippa persisted that i ought still to remain henrys loving and affectionate wife ready to take my place amongst the pastimes of his lifewhen he feels inclined for instance to wander from his dark ladylove to something petite and of my complexion or when he settles down at home for a few days after a fortnights sport on the sea and expects me to tell him the war news  i dont think that i should do that helen admitted quietly but i am quite certain that i shouldnt run away with another man  why not  because i should be punishing myself too much  philippas eyes suddenly flashed  helen she said you are not such a fool as you try to make me think cant you see what is really at the back of it all in my mind cant you realise that whatever the punishment it may bring it will punish henry more  i see helen observed you are running away with mr lessingham to annoy henry  oh hell be more than annoyed philippa laughed sardonically he has terrible ideas about the sanctity of things that belong to him hell be remarkably sheepish for some time to come he may even feel a few little stabs when i have time i am going to write him a letter which he can keep for the rest of his life it wont please him  where are youand mr lessingham going to live helen enquired  in america to start with ive always longed to go to the states  what shall you do helen continued if you dont get out of the country safely  mr lessingham seems quite sure that we shall philippa replied and he seems a person of many expedients of course if we didnt i should go back to cheshire i should have gone back there anyway before now if mr lessingham hadnt come  well it all seems very simple helen admitted i think mr lessingham is a perfectly delightful person and i shouldnt wonder if you didnt now and then almost imagine that you were happy  you seem to be taking my going very coolly philippa remarked  i told you how i felt about it just now helen reminded her your going is like a great black cloud that i have seen growing larger and larger day by day i think that in his way dick will suffer just as much as henry we shall all be utterly miserable  why dont you try and persuade me not to go then philippa demanded you sit there talking about it as though i were going on an ordinary countryhouse visit  helen raised her head and philippa saw that her eyes were filled with tears  philippa dear she said if i thought that all the tears that were ever shed all the words that were ever dragged from ones heart could have any real effect id go on my knees to you now and implore you to give up this idea but i thinkyou wont be angry with me deari think you would go just the same  you seem to think that i am obstinate philippa complained  you see you are temperamental dear helen reminded her you have a complex nature i know very well that you need the daily love that henry doesnt seem to have been willing to give you lately and i couldnt stop your turning towards the sun you know onlyall the time theres that terrible anxietyare you quite sure it is the sun  you believe in mr lessingham dont you philippa asked  i do indeed helen replied i am not quite sure though that i believe in you  philippa was a little startled  well i never she exclaimed exactly what do you mean by that helen  i am not quite sure helen continued that when the moment has really come and your head is upturned and your arms outstretched and your feet have left this world in which you are now i am not quite sure that you will find all that you seek  you think he doesnt love me  i am not convinced helen replied calmly that you love him  why you idiot philippa declared feverishly of course i love him i think he is one of the sweetest most lovable persons i ever knew and as to his being a swede i shouldnt care whether he were a fiji islander or a chinese  helen nodded sympathetically  i agree with you she said but listen you know that i havent uttered a single word to dissuade you well then grant me just one thing before you start off this evening tell mr lessingham the truth whatever it may be the truth which you havent told me it very likely wont make any difference two people as nice as you and he who are going to join their lives generally do i believe find the things they seek still tell him  philippa made no reply richard opened the door and lingered upon the threshold helen rose to her feet  i am coming dick she called out cheerfully theres a gorgeous fire in the gun room and two big easychairs and well have just the time i have been looking forward to all day youll tell me things wont you  she looked very sweet as she came towards him her eyes raised to him her face full of the one happiness he passed his arm around her waist  ill try dear he said you wont be lonely philippa  ill come and disturb you when i am she promised  the door closed she stood gazing down into the fire listening to their footsteps as they crossed the hall    chapter xxxi   lessingham stood for a moment by the side of the car from which he had just descended glanced at the huge tires and the tins of petrol lashed on behind  nothing more you want chauffeur he asked  nothing sir was the almost inaudible reply  you have the route map  yes sir and enough petrol for three hundred miles  lessingham turned away pushed open the gate and walked up the drive of mainsail haul decidedly it was the moment of his life he was hardpressed as he knew by others besides griffiths a few hours now was all the start he could reasonably expect he was face to face with a very real and serious danger which he could no longer ignore and from which escape was all the time becoming more difficult and yet all the emotionalism of this climax was centered elsewhere it was from philippas lips that he would hear his real sentence it was her answer which would fill him once more with the lust for life or send him on in his rush through the night for safety callous almost indifferent as to its result  he walked up the drive curiously at his ease in a state of suspended animation which knew no hope and feared no disappointment just before he reached the front door the postern gate in the wall on his lefthand side opened and philippa stood there muffled up in her fur coat framed in the faint and shadowy moonlight against the background of seabounded space he moved eagerly towards her  i heard the car she whispered come and sit down for a moment it isnt in the least cold and the moon is just coming up over the sea i came out she went on as he walked obediently by her side because the house somehow stifled me  she led him to a seat below the long waves were breaking through upon the rocks throwing little fountains of spray into the air the village which lay at their feet was silent and lifelessthere was indeed a curious absence of sound except when the incoming waves broke upon the rocks and ground the pebbles together in their long backward swish very soon the sleeping country now wrapped in shadows would take form and outline in the light of the rising moon hedges would divide the square fields the black woods would take shape and the hills their mystic solemnity but those few minutes were minutes of suspense lessingham was to some extent conscious of their queer allegorical significance  i have come he reminded her quite steadily for my answer  she showed him the small bag by her side upon the seat and touched her cloak she was indeed prepared for a journey  you see she told him here i am  his face was suddenly transformed she was almost afraid of the effect of her words she found herself struggling in his arms  not yet she begged please remember where we are  he released her reluctantly a few yards away they could hear the soft purring of the sixcylinder engine inexorable reminder of the passing moments he caught her by the hand  come he whispered passionately every moment is precious  she hesitated no longer the open postern gate seemed to him suddenly to lead down the great thoroughfare of a new and splendid life he was to be one of those favoured few to whom was given the divine prize and then he stopped short even while she walked willingly by his side he knew so well the need for haste the gentle murmur of that engine was inviting him all the while yet he knew there was one thing more which must be said  philippa he began you know what we are doing we can escape i believe my flight is all wonderfully arranged but there will be no coming back it will be all over when our car passes over the hills there you will not regret you care enough even for this supreme sacrifice  i shall never reproach you as long as i live she promised i have made up my mind to come and i am ready  but it is because you care he pleaded anxiously  it is because i care for one reason  in the great way he persisted in the only way  she hesitated he suddenly felt her hand grow colder in his he saw her frame shiver beneath its weight of furs  dont ask me quite that she begged breathlessly be content to know that i have counted the cost and that i am willing to come  he felt the chill of impending disaster he closed the little gate through which they had been about to pass and stood with his back to it in that faint light which seemed to creep over the world before the moon itself was revealed she seemed to him at that moment the fairest the most desirable thing on earth her face was upturned towards his half pathetic half protesting against the revelation which he was forcing from her  listen philippa he said miss fairclough warned me of one thing i put it on one side it did not seem to be possible now i must ask you a question you have some other motive have you not for choosing to come away with me it is not only because you love me better than any one else in the world as i do you and therefore that we belong to one another and it is right and good that we should spend our lives in one anothers company there is something else is there not at the root of your determination some ally  it was a strange moment for philippa nothing had altered within her and yet a wonderful pity was glowing in her heart tearing at her emotions bringing a sob into her throat  you meanhenry she faltered  i mean your husband he assented  she was suddenly passionately angry with herself it seemed to her that the days of childishness were back she was behaving like an imbecile whilst he played the great game  you see he went on his own voice a little unsteady this is one of those moments in both our lives when anything except the exact truth would mean shipwreck you still love your husband  i am such a fool she sobbed clutching at his arm  you were willing to go away with me he continued mercilessly partly because of the anger you felt towards him and partly out of revenge and just a little because you liked me is that not so  her head pressed upon his arm she nodded it was just that convulsive movement of her head with its wealth of wonderful hair and its plain black motoring hat which dealt the deathblow to his hopes she was just a child once moreand she trusted him  very well then he said just let me thinkfor a moment  she understood enough not to raise her head lessingham was gazing out through the chaotic shadows of the distant banks of clouds from which the moon was rising already the pain had begun and yet with it was that queer sense of exaltation which comes with sacrifice  we have been very nearly foolish he told her with grave kindliness it is well perhaps that we were in time those windows which lead into your librarythrough which i first came to you bytheby he added with a strange reminiscent little sigh are they open  yes she whispered  come then he invited before i leave there is something i want to make clear to you  they made their way rather like two conspirators along the little terraced walk philippa opened the window and closed it again behind them the room was empty lessingham watching her closely almost groaned as he saw the wonderful relief in her face she threw off the cloak and he groaned again as he remembered how nearly it had been his task to remove it in her plain travelling dress she turned and looked at him very pathetically  you have perhaps a morning paper here he enquired  a newspaper why yes the times she answered a little surprised  he took it from the table towards which she pointed and held it under the lamplight presently he called to her his forefinger rested upon a certain column  read this he directed  she read it out in a tone which passed from surprise to blank wonder  commander sir henry cranston baronet to receive the dso for special services and to be promoted to the rank of acting rearadmiral  what does it mean she asked feverishly henry a dso for henry for special services  it means he told her with a forced smile that your husband is as you put it in your expressive language a fraud    chapter xxxii   for a moment philippa was unsteady upon her feet lessingham led her to a chair from outside came the low cautious hooting of the motor horn calling to its dilatory passenger  i can not of course explain everything to you he began in a tone of unusual restraint but i do know that for the last two years your husband has been responsible to the admiralty for most of the mine fields around your east coast to begin with his stay in scotland was a sham he was most of the time with the fleet and round the coasts his fishing excursions from here have been of the same order only more so all the places of importance from here to the mouth of the thames have been mined or rather the approaches to them have been mined under his instructions my mission in this country here at dreymarshdo not shrink from me if you can help itwas to obtain a copy of his mine protection scheme of a certain town on the east coast  why should i shrink from you she murmured this is all too wonderful what a little beast henry must think me she added with truly feminine and marvellously selfish irrelevance  you and miss fairclough lessingham went on have rather scoffed at my presence here on behalf of our secret service it seemed to you both very ridiculous now you understand  it makes no difference philippa protested tearfully you always told us the truth  and i shall continue to do so lessingham assured her i am not a clever person at my work which is all new to me but fortune favoured me the night your husband was shipwrecked i succeeded in stealing from him on board that wrecked trawler the plan of the mine field which i was sent over to procure  of course you had to do it if you could philippa sobbed i think it was very clever of you  he smiled  there are others who might look at the matter differently he said i am going to ask you a question which i know is unnecessary but i must have your answer to take away with me if you had known all the time that your husband instead of being a skulker as you thought him was really doing splendid work for his country you would not have listened to me for one moment would you you would not have let me grow to love you  she clutched his hands  you are the dearest man in the world she exclaimed her lips still quivering but as you say you know the answer i was always in love with henry it was because i loved him that i was so furious i liked you so much that it was mean of me ever to think ofof what so nearly happened  so nearly happened he repeated with a sudden access of the bitterest selfpity  once more the low warning hoot of the motor horn this time a little more impatient broke the silence philippa was filled with an unreasoning terror  you must go she implored you must go this minute if they were to take you i couldnt bear it and that man griffithshe has sworn that if he can not get the government authority he will shoot you  griffiths has gone to london he reminded her  yes but he may be back by this train she cried glancing at the clock and i have a strange sort of fancyi have had it all daythat henry might come too it is overdue now any one might arrive here oh please for my sake hurry away she begged the tears streaming from her eyes if anything should happen i could never forgive myself it is because you have been so dear so true and honourable that all this time has been wasted if it were to cost you your life   she was seized by a fit of nervous anxiety which became almost a paroxysm she buttoned his coat for him and almost dragged him to the door and then she stopped for a moment to listen her eyes became distended her lips were parted she shook as though with an ague  it is too late she faltered hysterically i can hear henrys voice quick come to the window you must get out that way and through the postern gate  your husband will have seen the car he protested and besides there is your dressingbag and your travelling coat  i shall tell him everything she declared wildly nothing matters except that you escape oh hurry i can hear henry talking to jimmy dumblefor gods sake  the words died away upon her lips the door had been opened and closed again immediately there was the quick turn of the lock sounding like the click of fate sir henry well inside the room nodded to them both affably  well philippa you werent expecting me eh hullo lessingham not gone yet running it a trifle fine arent you  lessingham glanced towards the fastened door  perhaps he admitted a trifle too fine  sir henry was suddenly taken by storm philippa had thrown herself into his arms her fingers were locked around his neck her lips her eyes were pleading with him  henry henry you must forgive me i never knewi never dreamed what you were really doing i shall never forgive myself but youyou will be generous  thats all right dear he promised stooping down to kiss her partly my fault of course i had to humour those old ladies down at whitehall who wanted me to pose as a particularly harmless idiot you see he went on glancing towards lessingham they were always afraid that my steps might be dogged by spies if my position were generally known  philippa did not relinquish her attitude she was still clinging to her husband she refused to let him go  henry she begged oh listen to me i have so much to confess so much of which i am ashamed and yet with it all i want to entreatto implore one great favour from you  sir henry looked down into his wifes face  is it one i can grant he asked gravely  if you want me ever to be happy again you will she sobbed for helens sake as well as mine help mr lessingham to escape  lessingham took a quick step forward he had the air of one who has reached the limits of his endurance  you mean this kindly lady cranston i know he said but i desire no intervention  sir henry patted his wifes hand and held her a little away from him there was a curious but unmistakable change in his deportment his mouth had not altogether lost its humorous twist but his jaw seemed more apparent the light in his eyes was keener and there was a ring of authority in his tone  come he said let us understand one another philippa and you had better listen too mr lessingham i can promise you that your chances of escape will not be diminished by my taking up these few minutes of your time philippa he went on turning back to her you have always posed as being an exceedingly patriotic englishwoman yet it seems to me that you have made a bargain with this man knowing full well that he was in the service of germany to give him shelter and hospitality here access to my house and protection amongst your friends in return for certain favours shown towards your brother  philippa was speechless it was a view of the matter which she and helen had striven so eagerly to avoid  but henry she protested his stay here seemed so harmless you yourself have laughed at the idea of espionage at dreymarsh there is nothing to discover there is nothing going on here which the whole world might not know  that was never my plea lessingham intervened  nor is it the truth sir henry added sternly  the baron maderstrom was sent here philippa to spy upon me to gain access by any means to this house to steal if he could certain plans and charts prepared by me  philippa began to tremble she seemed bereft of words  he told me this she faltered he told me not half an hour ago  there was a tapping at the door sir henry moved towards it but did not turn the key  who is that he asked  captain griffiths is here with an escort sir mills announced he has seized the motor car outside and he begs to be allowed to come in    chapter xxxiii   mills words were plainly audible throughout the room philippa made eager signs to lessingham pointing to the french windows lessingham however shook his head  i prefer he said gently to finish my conversation with your husband  there was another and more insistent summons from outside this time it was captain griffiths raucous voice  sir henry cranston he called out i am here with authority i beg to be admitted  where is your escort  in the hall  if i let you come in sir henry continued will you come alone  i should prefer it was the eager reply i wish to make this business as little unpleasant toto everybody as possible  sir henry softly turned the key opened the door and admitted griffiths the man seemed to see no one else but lessingham he would have hastened at once towards him but sir henry laid his hand upon his arm  you must kindly restrain your impatience for a few moments he insisted this is a private conference your business with the baron maderstrom can be adjusted later  it is my duty griffiths proclaimed impatiently to arrest that man as a spy i have authority granted me this morning in london  quite so sir henry observed but we are in the midst of a very interesting little discussion which i intend to conclude your turn will come later captain griffiths  i can countenance no discussion with such men as that griffiths declared scornfully i am here in the execution of my duty and i resent any interference with it  no one wishes to interfere with you sir henry assured him but until i say the word you will obey my orders  so far as i am concerned lessingham intervened i wish it to be understood that i offer no defence  you have no defence sir henry reminded him suavely i gather that not only had you the effrontery to steal a chart from my pocket in the midst of a life struggle upon the trawler but you have capped this exploit with a deliberate attempt to abduct my wife   griffiths seemed for a moment almost beside himself his eyes glowed his long fingers twitched he kept edging a little nearer to lessingham  both charges the latter confessed looking sir henry in the eyes are true  then philippa found herself she saw the sudden flash in her husbands eyes the grim fury in griffiths face she stepped once more forward  henry she insisted you must listen to what i have to say  we have had enough words griffiths interposed savagely  sir henry ignored the interruption  i am listening philippa he said calmly  it was my intention an hour ago to leave this place with mr lessingham tonight she told him deliberately  the devil it was sir henry muttered  as for the reason you know it she continued her tone full of courage i am willing to throw myself at your feet now but all the same i was hardly treated i was made the scapegoat of your stupid promise you kept me in ignorance of things a wife should know you even encouraged me to believe you a coward when a single word from you would have changed everything therefore i say that it is you who are responsible for what i nearly did and what i should have done but for himlisten henrybut for him  but for him her husband repeated curiously  it was mr lessingham she declared who opened my eyes concerning you it was he who refused to let me yield to that impulse of anger look at my coat there my bag is on that table i was ready to leave with him tonight before we went he insisted on telling me everything about you he could have escaped and i was willing to go with him instead he spent those precious minutes telling me the truth about you that was the end  lady cranston omits to add lessingham put in that before i did so she told me frankly that her feelings for me were of warm friendlinessthat her love was given to her husband and her husband only  how long is this to go on griffiths asked harshly i have the authority here and the power to take that man these domestic explanations have nothing to do with the case  excuse me sir henry retorted with quiet emphasis they have a great deal to do with it  i am commandant of this place griffiths commenced  and i possess an authority here which you had better not dispute sir henry reminded him sternly  there was a moments tense silence griffiths set his teeth hard but his hand wandered towards the back of his belt  i am now sir henry continued going to announce to you a piece of news over which we shall all be gloating when tomorrow mornings newspapers are issued but which is not as yet generally known during last night a considerable squadron of german cruisers managed to cross the north sea and found their way to a certain port of considerable importance to us  lessingham started his face was drawn as though with pain he had the air of one who shrinks from the news he is about to hear  incidentally sir henry continued threequarters of the squadron also found their way to the bottom of the sea and the other quarter met our own squadron lying in wait for their retreat and will not return  lessingham swayed for a moment upon his feet one could almost fancy that sir henrys tone was tinged with pity as he turned towards him  the chart of the mine field of which you possessed yourself he said which it was the object of your visit here to secure was a chart specially prepared for you you see our own secret service is not altogether asleep those very safe and invitinglooking channels for british and allied traffici marked them very clearly didnt iwere where id laid my mines the channels which your cruisers so carefully avoided were the only safe avenues so you see why it is maderstrom that i have no grudge against you  lessinghams face for a moment was the face of a stricken man there was a look of dull horror in his eyes  is this the truth he gasped  it is the truth sir henry assured him gravely  does this conclude the explanations captain griffiths demanded impatiently your news is magnificent sir henry as regards this felon  sir henry held up his hand  maderstroms fate he said is mine to deal with and not yours captain griffiths  philippa was the first to grasp the intentions of the man who was standing only a few feet from her she threw herself upon his arm and dragged down the revolver which he had raised sir henry with a shout of fury was upon them at once he took griffiths by the throat and threw him upon the sofa the revolver clattered harmlessly on to the carpet  his majestys service has no use for madmen he thundered you know that i possess superior authority here  that man shall not escape griffiths shouted  he struggled for his whistle sir henry snatched it from him and picked up the revolver from the carpet  look here griffiths he remonstrated severely one single move in opposition to my wishes will cost you your career let there be no misunderstanding about it that man will not be arrested by you tonight  griffiths staggered to his feet he was half cowed half furious  you take the responsibility for this sir henry he demanded thickly the man is a proved traitor if you assist him to escape you are subject to penalties  sir henry threw open the door  captain griffiths he interrupted i am not ignorant of my position in this matter believe me your last chance of retaining your position here is to remember that you have had specific orders to yield to my authority in all matters kindly leave this room and take your soldiers back to their quarters  griffiths hesitated for a single moment he had the appearance of a man half demented by a passion which could find no outlet then he left the room without salute without a glance to the right or to the left out in the hall a moment later they heard a harsh voice of command the hall door was opened and closed behind the sound of retreating footsteps  sir henry lessingham reminded him i have not asked for your intervention  my dear fellow you wouldnt was the prompt reply as for the little trouble that has happened in the north sea dont take it too much to heart it was entirely the fault of the people who sent you here  the fault of the people who sent me here lessingham repeated i scarcely understand  its simple enough sir henry continued you see you are about as fit to be a spy as philippa my wife here is to be a detective you possess the one insuperable obstacle of having the instincts of a gentlemancome come he went on we have nothing more to say to one another open that window and take the narrow path down to the beach jimmy dumble is waiting for you at the gate he will row you out to a dutch trawler which is lying even now off the point  you mean me to get away lessingham exclaimed bewildered  believe me it will cost nothing sir henry assured him i was not bluffing when i told captain griffiths that i had supreme authority here he knows perfectly well that i am within my rights in aiding your escape  philippa moved swiftly to where lessingham was standing she gave him her hands  dear friend she begged so wonderful a friend as you have been dont refuse this last thing  be a sensible fellow maderstrom sir henry said remember that you cant do yourself or your adopted country a haporth of good by playing the quixote  besides philippa continued holding his hands tightly it is after all only an exchange you have saved henrys life set richard free and brought us happiness why should you hesitate to accept your own liberty  sir henry threw open the window and looked towards a green light out at sea  theres your trawler he pointed out and remember the tide will turn in half an hour i dont wish to hurry you  lessingham raised philippas fingers to his lips  i shall think of you both always he said simply you are very wonderful people  he turned towards the window sir henry took up the homburg hat from the table by his side  better take your hat he suggested  lessingham paused accepted it and looked steadfastly at the donor  you knew from the first he asked  from the very first sir henry assured him dont look so confounded he went on consolingly remember that espionage is the only profession in which it is an honour to fail  philippa came a little shyly into her husbands arms as he turned back into the room the tenderness in his own face however and a little catch in his voice broke down at once the wall of reserve which had grown up between them  my dear little woman he murmured my little sweetheart you dont know how ive ached to explain everything to youincluding the russian ladies  explain them at once sir philippa insisted pretending to draw her face away for a moment  they were the wife and sisterinlaw of the russian admiral draskieff who was sent over to report upon our method of mine laying he told her  you and i have to go up to a little dinner they are giving tomorrow or the next day  oh dear what an idiot i was philippa exclaimed ruefully i imaginedall sorts of things but henry dear she went on do you know that we have a great surprise for youhere in the house  no surprise dear he assured her shaking his head i knew the very hour that richard left wittenberg and here he is by jove  richard and helen entered together philippa could not even wait for the conclusion of the hearty but exceedingly british greeting which passed between the two men  listen to me both of you she cried incoherently helen you especially you never heard anything so wonderful in your life they werent fishing excursions at all there werent any whiting henry was laying mines all the time and hes blown up half the german fleet its all in the times this morning hes got a dsohenry hasand hes a rearadmiral oh helen i want to cry  the two women wandered into a far corner of the room richard wrung his brotherinlaws hand  philippa isnt exactly coherent he remarked but it sounds all right  you see sir henry explained ive been mine laying ever since the war started i always had ideas of my own about mine fields as you may remember i started with scotland and then they moved me down here the admiralty thought theyd be mighty clever and they insisted upon my keeping my job secret it led to a little trouble with philippa but i think we are through with all thati suppose you know that those two young women have been engaged in a regular conspiracy dick  i know a little richard replied gravely and im sure you will believe that i wouldnt have countenanced it for a moment if id had any idea what they were up to  im sure you wouldnt sir henry agreed anyway it led to no harm  maderstrom then richard asked with a sudden more complete apprehension of the affair was over here to spy upon you  thats the ticket sir henry assented  richard frowned  and he bribed philippa and helen with my liberty  dont you worry about that his brotherinlaw begged they must have known by instinct that a chap like maderstrom couldnt do any harm  where is he now richard asked eagerly helen insisted upon keeping me out of the way but weve heard all sorts of rumours the commandant has been up here after him hasnt he  yes and i sent him away with a flea in his ear i dont like the fellow  and maderstrom  the pseudomr lessingham eh sir henry observed well to tell you the truth dick if there is one person i am a little sorry for in the history of the last few weeks its maderstrom  you too richard exclaimed why every one seems crazy about the fellow  sir henry nodded  i remember him in your college days dick he was a gentleman and a good sort only unfortunately his mother was a german he did his bit of soldiering with the prussian guards at the beginning of the war got a knock and volunteered for the secret service they sent him over here the fellow must have no end of pluck for as i dare say you know they let him down from the observation car of a zeppelin he finds his way here all right makes his silly little bargain with our dear but gullible womenkind and sets himself to watchto watch me mind the whole affair is too ridiculously transparent for a time he cant bring himself even to touch my papers here although as it happens they wouldnt have done him the least bit of good it was only the stress and excitement of the shipwreck last week that he ventured to steal the chart which i had so carefully prepared for him i really think if he hadnt done that i should have had to slip it into his pocket or absolutely force it upon him somehow he sends it off like a lamb and behold the result weve crippled the german navy for the rest of the war  it was a faked chart then of course richard demanded breathlessly  and quite the cleverest i ever prepared sir henry acknowledged i can assure you that it would have taken in von tirpitz himself if hed got hold of it  but where is maderstrom now sir richard asked  sir henry moved his head towards the window where philippa for the last few moments had softly taken her place her
