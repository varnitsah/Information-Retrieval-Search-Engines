72875913	the voyage of captain popanilla  by benjamin disraeli   this narrative of an imaginary voyage was first published in 1827     chapter 1   there is an island in the indian ocean so unfortunate as not yet to have been visited either by discovery ships or missionary societies it is a place where all those things are constantly found which men most desire to see and with the sight of which they are seldom favoured it abounds in flowers and fruit and sunshine lofty mountains covered with green and mighty forests except where the red rocks catch the fierce beams of the blazing sun bowery valleys broad lakes gigantic trees and gushing rivers bursting from rocky gorges are crowned with a purple and ever cloudless sky summer in its most unctuous state and most mellow majesty is here perpetual so intense and overpowering in the daytime is the rich union of heat and perfume that living animal or creature is never visible and were you and i to pluck before sunset the huge fruit from yonder teeming tree we might fancy ourselves for the moment the future sinners of another eden yet a solitude it is not  the island is surrounded by a calm and blue lagoon formed by a ridge of coral rocks which break the swell of the ocean and prevent the noxious spray from banishing the rich shrubs which grow even to the waters edge it is a few minutes before sunset that the first intimation of animal existence in this seeming solitude is given by the appearance of mermaids who floating on the rosy sea congregate about these rocks they sound a loud but melodious chorus from their seashells and a faint and distant chorus soon answers from the island the mermaidens immediately repeat their salutations and are greeted with a nearer and a louder answer as the red and rayless sun drops into the glowing waters the choruses simultaneously join and rushing from the woods and down the mountain steeps to the nearest shore crowds of human beings at the same moment appear and collect  the inhabitants of this island in form and face do not misbecome the clime and the country with the vivacity of a faun the men combine the strength of a hercules and the beauty of an adonis and as their more interesting companions flash upon his presence the least classical of poets might be excused for imagining that like their blessed goddess the women had magically sprung from the brilliant foam of that ocean which is gradually subsiding before them  but sunset in this land is not the signal merely for the evidence of human existence at the moment that the islanders crowned with flowers and waving goblets and garlands burst from their retreats upon each mountain peak a lion starts forward stretches his proud tail and bellowing to the sun scours back exulting to his forest immense bodies which before would have been mistaken for the trunks of trees now move into life and serpents untwining their green and glittering folds and slowly bending their crested heads around seem proudly conscious of a voluptuous existence troops of monkeys leap from tree to tree panthers start forward and alarmed not alarming instantly vanish a herd of milkwhite elephants tramples over the background of the scene and instead of gloomy owls and noxious beetles to hail the longenduring twilight from the bell of every opening flower beautiful birds radiant with every rainbow tint rush with a long and living melody into the cool air  the twilight in this island is not that transient moment of unearthly bliss which in our less favoured regions always leaves us so thoughtful and so sad on the contrary it lasts many hours and consequently the islanders are neither moody nor sorrowful as they sleep during the day four or five hours of tipsy dance and revelry are exercise and not fatigue at length even in this delightful region the rosy tint fades into purple and the purple into blue the white moon gleams and at length glitters and the invisible stars first creep into light and then blaze into radiancy but no hateful dews discolour their loveliness and so clear is the air that instead of the false appearance of a studded vault the celestial bodies may be seen floating in aether at various distances and of various tints ere the showery fireflies have ceased to shine and the blue lights to play about the tremulous horizon amid the voices of a thousand birds the dancers solace themselves with the rarest fruits the most delicate fish and the most delicious wines but flesh they love not they are an innocent and a happy though a voluptuous and ignorant race they have no manufactures no commerce no agriculture and no printingpresses but for their slight clothing they wear the bright skins of serpents for corn nature gives them the breadfruit and for intellectual amusement they have a pregnant fancy and a ready wit tell inexhaustible stories and always laugh at each others jokes a natural instinct gave them the art of making wine and it was the same benevolent nature that blessed them also with the knowledge of the art of making love but time flies even here the lovely companions have danced and sung and banqueted and laughed what further bliss remains for man they rise and in pairs wander about the island and then to their bowers their life ends with the night they love so well and ere day the everlasting conqueror wave his flaming standard in the luminous east solitude and silence will again reign in the isle of fantaisie    chapter 2   the last and loudest chorus had died away and the islanders were pouring forth their libation to their great enemy the sun when suddenly a vast obscurity spread over the glowing west they looked at each other and turned pale and the wine from their trembling goblets fell useless on the shore the women were too frightened to scream and for the first time in the isle of fantaisie silence existed after sunset they were encouraged when they observed that the darkness ceased at that point in the heavens which overlooked their coral rocks and perceiving that their hitherto unsullied sky was pure even at this moment of otherwise universal gloom the men regained their colour touched the goblets with their lips further to reanimate themselves and the women now less discomposed uttered loud shrieks  suddenly the wind roared with unaccustomed rage the sea rose into large billows and a ship was seen tossing in the offing the islanders whose experience of navigation extended only to a slight paddling in their lagoon in the half of a hollow trunk of a tree for the purpose of fishing mistook the tight little frigate for a great fish and being now aware of the cause of this disturbance and at the same time feeling confident that the monster could never make way through the shallow waters to the island they recovered their courage and gazed upon the labouring leviathan with the same interested nonchalance with which students at a modern lecture observe an expounding philosopher  what a shadow he casts over the sky said the king a young man whose divine right was never questioned by his female subjects what a commotion in the waters and what a wind he snorts forth it certainly must be the largest fish that exists i remember my father telling me that a monstrous fish once got entangled among our rocks and this part of the island really smelt for a month i cannot help fancying that there is a rather odd smell now pah  a favourite queen flew to the suffering monarch and pressing her aromatic lips upon his offended nostrils his majesty recovered  the unhappy crew of the frigate who with the aid of their telescopes had detected the crowds upon the shore now fired their signal guns of distress which came sullenly booming through the wind  oh the great fish is speaking was the universal exclamation  i begin to get frightened said the favourite queen i am sure the monster is coming here so saying her majesty grasped up a handful of pearls from the shore to defend herself  as screaming was now the fashion all the women of course screamed and animated by the example of their sovereign and armed with the marine gems the amazons assumed an imposing attitude  just at the moment that they had worked up their enthusiasm to the highest pitch and were actually desirous of dying for their country the ship sunk    chapter 3   it is the flush of noon and strange to say a human figure is seen wandering on the shore of the isle of fantaisie  one of the crew of the wrecked frigate of course what an escape fortunate creature interesting man probably the indefatigable captain parry possibly the undaunted captain franklin perhaps the adventurous captain lyon  no sweet blueeyed girl my plots are not of that extremely guessable nature so admired by your adorable sex indeed this book is so constructed that if you were even according to custom to commence its perusal by reading the last page you would not gain the slightest assistance in finding out how the story ends  the wanderer belongs to no frigatebuilding nation he is a true fantaisian who having in his fright during yesterdays storm lost the lock of hair which in a moment of glorious favour he had ravished from his fair mistresss brow is now after a sleepless night tracing every remembered haunt of yesterday with the fond hope of regaining his most precious treasure ye gentlemen of england who live at home at ease know full well the anxiety and exertion the days of management and the nights of meditation which the rape of a lock requires and you can consequently sympathize with the agitated feelings of the handsome and the hapless popanilla  the favourite of all the women the envy of all the men popanilla passed a pleasant life no one was a better judge of wine no one had a better taste for fruit no one danced with more elegant vivacity and no one whispered compliments in a more meaning tone his stories ever had a point his repartees were never illnatured what a pity that such an amiable fellow should have got into such a scrape  in spite of his grief however popanilla soon found that the ardency of his passion evaporated under a smoking sun and exhausted he was about to return home from his fruitless search when his attention was attracted by a singular appearance he observed before him on the shore a square and hitherto unseen form he watched it for some minutes but it was motionless he drew nearer and observed it with intense attention but if it were a being it certainly was fast asleep he approached close to its side but it neither moved nor breathed he applied his nose to the mysterious body and the elegant fantaisian drew back immediately from a most villanous smell of pitch not to excite too much in this calm age the readers curiosity let him know at once that this strange substance was a seachest upon it was marked in large black letters s d k no 1  for the first time in his life popanilla experienced a feeling of overwhelming curiosity his fatigue his loss the scorching hour and the possible danger were all forgotten in an indefinite feeling that the body possessed contents more interesting than its unpromising exterior and in a resolute determination that the development of the mystery should be reserved only for himself  although he felt assured that he must be unseen he could not refrain from throwing a rapid glance of anxiety around him it was a moment of perfect stillness the island slept in sunshine and even the waves had ceased to break over the opposing rocks a thousand strange and singular thoughts rushed into his mind but his first purpose was ever uppermost and at length unfolding his girdle of skin he tied the tough cincture round the chest and exerting all his powers dragged his mysterious waif into the nearest wood  but during this operation the top fell off and revealed the neatest collection of little packages that ever pleased the eye of the admirer of spruce arrangement popanilla took up packets upon all possible subjects smelt them but they were not savory he was sorely puzzled at last he lighted on a slender volume bound in brown calf which with the confined but sensual notions of a savage he mistook for gingerbread at least it was the universal linguist by mr hamilton or the art of dreaming in languages  no sooner had popanilla passed that wellformed nose which had been so often admired by the lady whose lock of hair he had unfortunately lost a few times over a few pages of the hamiltonian system than he sank upon his bed of flowers and in spite of his curiosity was instantly overcome by a profound slumber but his slumber though deep was not peaceful and he was the actor in an agitating drama  he found himself alone in a gay and glorious garden in the centre of it grew a pomegranate tree of prodigious size its top was lost in the sky and its innumerable branches sprang out in all directions covered with large fruit of a rich golden hue beautiful birds were perched upon all parts of the tree and chanted with perpetual melody the beauties of their bower tempted by the delicious sight popanilla stretched forward his ready hand to pluck but no sooner had he grasped the fruit than the music immediately ceased the birds rushed away the sky darkened the tree fell under the wind the garden vanished and popanilla found himself in the midst of a raging sea buffeting the waves  he would certainly have been drowned had he not been immediately swallowed up by the huge monster which had not only been the occasion of the storm of yesterday but ah most unhappy business been the occasion also of his losing that lock of hair  ere he could congratulate himself on his escape he found fresh cause for anxiety for he perceived that he was no longer alone no friends were near him but on the contrary he was surrounded by strangers of a far different aspect they were men certainly that is to say they had legs and arms and heads and bodies as himself but instead of that bloom of youth that regularity of feature that amiable joyousness of countenance which he had ever been accustomed to meet and to love in his former companions he recoiled in horror from the swarthy complexions the sad visages and the haggard features of his present ones they spoke to him in a harsh and guttural accent he would have fled from their advances but then he was in the belly of a whale when he had become a little used to their tones he was gratified by finding that their attentions were far from hostile and after having received from them a few compliments he began to think that they were not quite so ugly he discovered that the object of their inquires was the fatal pomegranate which still remained in his hand they admired its beauty and told him that they greatly esteemed an individual who possessed such a mass of precious ore popanilla begged to undeceive them and courteously presented the fruit no sooner however had he parted with this apple of discord than the countenances of his companions changed immediately discovering its real nature they loudly accused popanilla of having deceived them he remonstrated and they recriminated and the great fish irritated by their clamour lashed its huge tail and with one efficacious vomit spouted the innocent popanilla high in the air he fell with such a dash into the waves that he was awakened by the sound of his own fall  the dreamer awoke amidst real chattering and scuffling and clamour a troop of green monkeys had been aroused by his unusual occupation and had taken the opportunity of his slumber to become acquainted with some of the first principles of science what progress they had made it is difficult to ascertain because each one throwing a tract at popanillas head they immediately disappeared it is said however that some monkeys have been since seen skipping about the island with their tails cut off and that they have even succeeded in passing themselves off for human beings among those people who do not read novels and are consequently unacquainted with mankind  the mornings adventure immediately rushed into popanillas mind and he proceeded forthwith to examine the contents of his chest but with advantages which had not been yet enjoyed by those who had previously peeped into it the monkeys had not been composed to sleep by the universal linguist of mr hamilton as for popanilla he took up a treatise on hydrostatics and read it straight through on the spot for the rest of the day he was hydrostatically mad nor could the commonest incident connected with the action or conveyance of water take place without his speculating on its cause and consequence  so enraptured was popanilla with his new accomplishments and acquirements that by degrees he avoided attendance on the usual evening assemblages and devoted himself solely to the acquirement of useful knowledge after a short time his absence was remarked but the greatest and the most gifted has only to leave his coterie called the world for a few days to be fully convinced of what slight importance he really is and so popanilla the delight of society and the especial favourite of the women was in a very short time not even inquired after at first of course they supposed that he was in love or that he had a slight cold or that he was writing his memoirs and as these suppositions in due course take their place in the annals of society as circumstantial histories in about a week one knew the lady another had beard him sneeze and a third had seen the manuscript at the end of another week popanilla was forgotten    chapter 4   six months had elapsed since the first chest of the cargo of useful knowledge destined for the fortunate maldives had been digested by the recluse popanilla for a recluse he had now become great students are rather dull companions our fantaisian friend during his first studies was as moody absent and querulous as are most men of genius during that mystical period of life he was consequently avoided by the men and quizzed by the women and consoled himself for the neglect of the first and the taunts of the second by the indefinite sensation that he should some day or other turn out that little being called a great man as for his mistress she considered herself insulted by being addressed by a man who had lost her lock of hair when the chest was exhausted popanilla was seized with a profound melancholy nothing depresses a mans spirits more completely than a selfconviction of selfconceit and popanilla who had been accustomed to consider himself and his companions as the most elegant portion of the visible creation now discovered with dismay that he and his fellowislanders were nothing more than a horde of useless savages  this mortification however was soon succeeded by a proud consciousness that he at any rate was now civilised and that proud consciousness by a fond hope that in a short time he might become a civiliser like all projectors he was not of a sanguine temperament but he did trust that in the course of another season the isle of fantaisie might take its station among the nations he was determined however not to be too rapid it cannot be expected that ancient prejudices can in a moment be eradicated and new modes of conduct instantaneously substituted and established popanilla like a wise man determined to conciliate his views were to be as liberal as his principles were enlightened men should be forced to do nothing bigotry and intolerance and persecution were the objects of his decided disapprobation resembling in this particular all the great and good men who have ever existed who have invariably maintained this opinion so long as they have been in the minority  popanilla appeared once more in the world  dear me is that you pop exclaimed the ladies what have you been doing with yourself all this time travelling i suppose every one travels now really you travelled men get quite bores and where did you get that coat if it be a coat  such was the style in which the fantaisian females saluted the long absent popanilla and really when a man shuts himself up from the world for a considerable time and fancies that in condescending to reenter it he has surely the right to expect the homage due to a superior being these salutations are awkward the ladies of england peculiarly excel in this species of annihilation and while they continue to drown puppies as they daily do in a sea of sarcasm i think no true englishman will hesitate one moment in giving them the preference for tact and manner over all the vivacious french all the selfpossessing italian and all the tolerant german women this is a claptrap and i have no doubt will sell the book  popanilla however had not reentered society with the intention of subsiding into a nonentity and he therefore took the opportunity a few minutes after sunset just as his companions were falling into the dance to beg the favour of being allowed to address his sovereign only for one single moment  sire said he in that mild tone of subdued superciliousness with which we should always address kings and which while it vindicates our dignity satisfactorily proves that we are above the vulgar passion of envy sire but let us not encourage that fatal faculty of oratory so dangerous to free states and therefore let us give only the substance of popanillas speech  he commenced his address in a manner somewhat resembling the initial observations of those pleasing pamphlets which are the fashion of the present hour and which being intended to diffuse information among those who have not enjoyed the opportunity and advantages of study and are consequently of a gay and cheerful disposition treat of light subjects in a light and polished style popanilla therefore spoke of man in a savage state the origin of society and the elements of the social compact in sentences which would not have disgraced the mellifluous pen of bentham from these he naturally digressed into an agreeable disquisition on the anglosaxons and after a little badinage on the bill of rights flew off to an airy aper u of the french revolution when he had arrived at the isle of fantaisie he begged to inform his majesty that man was born for something else besides enjoying himself it was doubtless extremely pleasant to dance and sing to crown themselves with chaplets and to drink wine but he was free to confess that he did not imagine that the most barefaced hireling of corruption could for a moment presume to maintain that there was any utility in pleasure if there were no utility in pleasure it was quite clear that pleasure could profit no one if therefore it were unprofitable it was injurious because that which does not produce a profit is equivalent to a loss therefore pleasure is a losing business consequently pleasure is not pleasant        substance of a speech in parliamentary language means a printed        edition of an harangue which contains all that was uttered in the        house and about as much again  he also showed that man was not born for himself but for society that the interests of the body are alone to be considered and not those of the individual and that a nation might be extremely happy extremely powerful and extremely rich although every individual member of it might at the same time be miserable dependent and in debt he regretted to observe that no one in the island seemed in the slightest decree conscious of the object of his being man is created for a purpose the object of his existence is to perfect himself man is imperfect by nature because if nature had made him perfect he would have had no wants and it is only by supplying his wants that utility can be developed the development of utility is therefore the object of our being and the attainment of this great end the cause of our existence this principle clears all doubts and rationally accounts for a state of existence which has puzzled many pseudophilosophers  popanilla then went on to show that the hitherto received definitions of man were all erroneous that man is neither a walking animal nor a talking animal nor a cooking animal nor a lounging animal nor a debtincurring animal nor a taxpaying animal nor a printing animal nor a puffing animal but a developing animal development is the discovery of utility by developing the water we get fish by developing the earth we get corn and cash and cotton by developing the air we get breath by developing the fire we get heat thus the use of the elements is demonstrated to the meanest capacity but it was not merely a material development to which he alluded a moral development was equally indispensable he showed that it was impossible for a nation either to think too much or to do too much the life of man was therefore to be passed in a moral and material development until he had consummated his perfection it was the opinion of popanilla that this great result was by no means so near at hand as some philosophers flattered themselves and that it might possibly require another halfcentury before even the most civilised nation could be said to have completed the destiny of the human race at the same time he intimated that there were various extraordinary means by which this rather desirable result might be facilitated and there was no saying what the building of a new university might do of which when built he had no objection to be appointed principal  in answer to those who affect to admire that deficient system of existence which they style simplicity of manners and who are perpetually committing the blunder of supposing that every advance towards perfection only withdraws man further from his primitive and proper condition popanilla triumphantly demonstrated that no such order as that which they associated with the phrase state of nature ever existed man said he is called the masterpiece of nature and man is also as we all know the most curious of machines now a machine is a work of art consequently the masterpiece of nature is the masterpiece of art the object of all mechanism is the attainment of utility the object of man who is the most perfect machine is utility in the highest degree can we believe therefore that this machine was ever intended for a state which never could have called forth its powers a state in which no utility could ever have been attained a state in which there are no wants consequently no demand consequently no supply consequently no competition consequently no invention consequently no profits only one great pernicious monopoly of comfort and ease society without wants is like a world without winds it is quite clear therefore that there is no such thing as nature nature is art or art is nature that which is most useful is most natural because utility is the test of nature therefore a steamengine is in fact a much more natural production than a mountain        the age seems as antimountainous as it is antimonarchical        a late writer insinuates that if the english had spent their        millions in levelling the andes instead of excavating the        tablelands society might have been benefited  these        monstrosities are decidedly useless and therefore can neither        be sublime nor beautiful as has been unanswerably demonstrated        by another recent writer on political aestheticssee also a        personal attack on mont blanc in the second number of the        foreign quarterly review 1828  you are convinced therefore he continued by these observations that it is impossible for an individual or a nation to be too artificial in their manners their ideas their laws or their general policy because in fact the more artificial you become the nearer you approach that state of nature of which you are so perpetually talking here observing that some of his audience appeared to be a little sceptical perhaps only surprised he told them that what he said must be true because it entirely consisted of first principles         first principles are the ingredients of positive truth  they        are immutable as may be seen by comparing the first principles        of the eighteenth century with the first principles of the        nineteenth  after having thus preliminarily descanted for about two hours popanilla informed his majesty that he was unused to public speaking and then proceeded to show that the grand characteristic of the social action  of the isle of fantaisie was a total want of development this he observed with equal sorrow and surprise he respected the wisdom of their ancestors at the same time no one could deny that they were both barbarous and ignorant he highly esteemed also the constitution but regretted that it was not in the slightest degree adapted to the existing want of society he was not for destroying any establishments but on the contrary was for courteously affording them the opportunity of selfdissolution he finished by reurging in strong terms the immediate development of the island in the first place a great metropolis must be instantly built because a great metropolis always produces a great demand and moreover popanilla had some legal doubts whether a country without a capital could in fact be considered a state apologising for having so long trespassed upon the attention of the assembly he begged distinctly to state  that he had no wish to see his majesty and his fellowsubjects adopt these new principles without examination and without experience they might commence on a small scale let them cut down their forests and by turning them into ships and houses discover the utility of timber let the whole island be dug up let canals be cut docks be built and all the elephants be killed directly that their teeth might yield an immediate article for exportation a short time would afford a sufficient trial in the meanwhile they would not be pledged to further measures and these might be considered only as an experiment  taking for granted that these principles would be acted on and taking into consideration the site of the island in the map of the world the nature and extent of its resources its magnificent race of human beings its varieties of the animal creation its wonderfully fine timber its undeveloped mineral treasures the spaciousness of its harbours and its various facilities for extended international communication popanilla had no hesitation in saying that a short time could not elapse ere instead of passing their lives in a state of unprofitable ease and useless enjoyment they might reasonably expect to be the terror and astonishment of the universe and to be able to annoy every nation of any consequence        this simple and definite phrase we derive from the nation to        whom we were indebted during the last century for some other        phrases about as definite but rather more dangerous       another phrase of parliament which i need not observe is        always made use of in oratory when the orator can see his        meaning about as distinctly as sancho perceived the charms        of dulcinea      a very famous and convenient phrase thisbut in politics        experiments mean revolutions  1828  here observing a smile upon his majestys countenance popanilla told the king that he was only a chief magistrate and he had no more right to laugh at him than a parish constable he concluded by observing that although what he at present urged might appear strange nevertheless if the listeners had been acquainted with the characters and cases of galileo and turgot they would then have seen as a necessary consequence that his system was perfectly correct and he himself a man of extraordinary merit  here the chief magistrate no longer daring to smile burst into a fit of laughter and turning to his courtiers said i have not an idea what this man is talking about but i know that he makes my head ache give me a cup of wine and let us have a dance  all applauded the royal proposition and pushing popanilla from one to another until he was fairly hustled to the brink of the lagoon they soon forgot the existence of this bore in one word he was cut when popanilla found himself standing alone and looking grave while all the rest were gay he began to suspect that he was not so influential a personage as he previously imagined rather crestfallen he sneaked home and consoled himself for having nobody to speak to by reading some amusing conversations on political economy    chapter 5   popanilla was discomposed but he was not discomfited he consoled himself for the royal neglect by the recollection of the many illustrious men who had been despised banished imprisoned and burnt for the maintenance of opinions which centuries afterwards had been discovered to be truth he did not forget that in still further centuries the lately recognised truth had been rediscovered to be falsehood but then these men were not less illustrious and what wonder that their opinions were really erroneous since they were not his present ones the reasoning was equally conclusive and consolatory popanilla therefore was not discouraged and although he deemed it more prudent not to go out of his way to seek another audience of his sovereign or to be too anxious again to address a public meeting he nevertheless determined to proceed cautiously but constantly propagating his doctrines and proselytizing in private  unfortunately for popanilla he did not enjoy one advantage which all founders of sects have duly appreciated and by which they have been materially assisted it is a great and an unanswerable argument in favour of a providence that we constantly perceive that the most beneficial results are brought about by the least worthy and most insignificant agents the purest religions would never have been established had they not been supported by sinners who felt the burthen of the old faith and the most free and enlightened governments are often generated by the discontented the disappointed and the dissolute now in the isle of fantaisie unfortunately for our revolutionizer there was not a single grumbler  unable therefore to make the bad passions of his fellow creatures the unconscious instruments of his good purposes popanilla must have been contented to have monopolised all the wisdom of the moderns had he not with the unbaffled wit of an inventor hit upon a new expedient like socrates our philosopher began to cultivate with sedulousness the society of youth  in a short time the ladies of fantaisie were forced to observe that the fair sex most unfashionably predominated in their evening assemblages for the young gentlemen of the island had suddenly ceased to pay their graceful homage at the altar of terpsichore in an indian isle not to dance was as bad as heresy the ladies rallied the recreants but their playful sarcasms failed of their wonted effect in the natural course of things they had recourse to remonstrances but their appeals were equally fruitless the delicate creatures tried reproaches but the boyish cynics received them with a scowl and answered them with a sneer  the women fled in indignation to their friendly monarch but the voluptuary of nature only shrugged his shoulders and smiled he kissed away their tears and their frowns vanished as he crowned their long hair with roses  if the lads really show such bad taste said his majesty why i and my lords must do double duty and dance with a couple of you at once consoled and complimented and crowned by a king who could look sad the women forgot their anger in their increasing loyalty  but the pupils of popanilla had no sooner mastered the first principles of science than they began to throw off their retired habits and uncommunicative manners being not utterly ignorant of some of the rudiments of knowledge and consequently having completed their education it was now their duty as members of society to instruct and not to study they therefore courted instead of shunned their fellowcreatures and on all occasions seized all opportunities of assisting the spread of knowledge the voices of lecturing boys resounded in every part of the island their tones were so shrill their manners so presuming their knowledge so crude and their general demeanour so completely unamiable that it was impossible to hear them without delight advantage and admiration  the women were not now the only sufferers and the only complainants dinned to death the men looked gloomy and even the king for the first time in his life looked grave could this babel he thought be that empire of bliss that delightful fantaisie where to be ruler only proved that you were the most skilful in making others happy his brow ached under his light flowery crown as if it were bound by the barbarous circle of a tyrant heavy with gems and gold in his despair he had some thoughts of leaving his kingdom and betaking himself to the mermaids  the determination of the most precious portion of his subjects saved his empire as the disciples of the new school were daily demanding what is the use of dancing what is the use of drinking wine what is the use of smelling flowers the women like prescient politicians began to entertain a nervous suspicion that in time these sages might even presume to question the utility of that homage which in spite of the grecian philosophers and the british essayists we have been in the habit of conceding to them ever since eden and they rushed again to the king like frightened deer something now was to be done and the monarch with an expression of countenance which almost amounted to energy whispered consolation  the king sent for popanilla the message produced a great sensation the enlightened introducer of the new principles had not been at court since he was cut no doubt his majesty was at last impregnated with the liberal spirit of the age and popanilla was assuredly to be premier in fact it must be so he was sent for there was no precedent in fantaisie though there might be in other islands for a person being sent for and not being premier his disciples were in high spirits the world was now to be regulated upon right principles and they were to be installed into their right places  illustrious popanilla said the king you once did me the honour of making me a speech which unfortunately for myself i candidly confess i was then incapable of understanding no wonder as it was the first i ever beard i shall not however easily forget the effect which it produced upon me i have since considered it my duty as a monarch to pay particular attention to your suggestions i now understand them with sufficient clearness to be fully convinced of their excellence and in future i intend to act upon them without any exception or deviation to prove my sincerity i have determined to commence the new system at once and as i think that without some extension of our international relations the commercial interest of this island will be incapable of furnishing the taxes which i intend to levy i have determined therefore to fit out an expedition for the purpose of discovering new islands and forming relations with new islanders it is but due to your merit that you should be appointed to the command of it and further to testify my infinite esteem for your character and my complete confidence in your abilities i make you postcaptain on the spot as the axiom of your school seems to be that everything can be made perfect at once without time without experience without practice and without preparation i have no doubt with the aid of a treatise or two you will make a consummate naval commander although you have never been at sea in the whole course of your life farewell captain popanilla  no sooner was this adieu uttered than four brawny lords of the bedchamber seized the turgot of fantaisie by the shoulders and carried him with inconceivable rapidity to the shore his pupils who would have fled to his rescue were stifled with the embraces of their former partners and their utilitarianism dissolved in the arms of those they once so rudely rejected as for their tutor he was thrust into one of the canoes with some fresh water breadfruit dried fish and a basket of alligatorpears a band of mermaids carried the canoe with exquisite management through the shallows and over the breakers and poor popanilla in a few minutes found himself out at sea tremendously frightened he offered to recant all his opinions and denounce as traitors any individuals whom the court might select but his former companions did not exactly detect the utility of his return his offers his supplications were equally fruitless and the only answer which floated to him on the wind was farewell captain popanilla    chapter 6   night fell upon the waters dark and drear and thick and misty how unlike those brilliant hours that once summoned him to revelry and love unhappy popanilla thy delicious fantaisie has vanished ah pitiable youth what could possibly have induced you to be so very rash and all from that unlucky lock of hair  after a few natural paroxysms of rage terror anguish and remorse the captain as naturally subsided into despair and awaited with sullen apathy that fate which could not be far distant the only thing which puzzled the philosophical navigator was his inability to detect what useful end could be attained by his death at length remembering that fish must be fed his theory and his desperation were at the same time confirmed  a clear dry morning succeeded the wet gloomy night and popanilla had not yet gone down this extraordinary suspension of his fate roused him from his stupor and between the consequent excitement and the morning air he acquired an appetite philosophical physicians appear to have agreed that sorrow to a certain extent is not unfavourable to digestion and as popanilla began to entertain some indefinite and unreasonable hopes the alligatorpears quickly disappeared in the meantime the little canoe cut her way as if she were chasing a smuggler and had it not been for a shark or two who in anticipation of their services being required never left her side for a second popanilla really might have made some ingenious observations on the nature of tides he was rather surprised certainly as he watched his frail bark cresting the waves but he soon supposed that this was all in the natural course of things and he now ascribed his previous fright not to the peril of his situation but to his inexperience of it  although his apprehension of being drowned was now removed yet when he gazed on the boundless vacancy before him and also observed that his provisions rapidly decreased he began to fear that he was destined for a still more horrible fate and that after having eaten his own slices he must submit to be starved in this state of despondency with infinite delight and exultation le clearly observed on the second clay at twentyseven minutes past three pm though at a considerable distance a mountain and an island his joy and his pride were equal and excessive he called the first alligator mountain in gratitude to the pears and christened the second after his mistress that unlucky mistress the swift canoe soon reached the discoveries and the happy discoverer further found to his mortification that the mountain was a mist and the island a seaweed popanilla now grew sulky and threw himself down in the bottom of his boat  on the third morning he was awakened by a tremendous roar on looking around him he perceived that he was in a valley formed by two waves each several hundred feet high this seemed the crisis of his fate he shut his eyes as people do when they are touched by a dentist and in a few minutes was still bounding on the ocean in the eternal canoe safe but senseless some tremendous peals of thunder a roaring wind and a scathing lightning confirmed his indisposition and had not the tempest subsided popanilla would probably have been an idiot for life the dead and soothing calm which succeeded this tornado called him back again gradually to existence he opened his eyes and scarcely daring to try a sense immediately shut them then hearing a deep sigh he shrugged his shoulders and looked as pitiable as a prime minister with a rebellious cabinet at length he ventured to lift up his head there was not a wrinkle on the face of ocean a halcyon fluttered over him and then scudded before his canoe and gamesome porpoises were tumbling at his side the sky was cloudless except in the direction to which he was driving but even as popanilla observed with some misgivings the mass of vapours which had there congregated the great square and solid black clouds drew off like curtains and revealed to his entranced vision a magnificent city rising out of the sea  tower and dome and arch column and spire and obelisk and lofty terraces and manywindowed palaces rose in all directions from a mass of building which appeared to him each instant to grow more huge till at length it seemed to occupy the whole horizon the sun lent additional lustre to the dazzling quays of white marble which apparently surrounded this mighty city and which rose immediately from the dark blue waters as the navigator drew nearer he observed that in most parts the quays were crowded with beings who he trusted were human and already the hum of multitudes broke upon his inexperienced ear to him a sound far more mysterious and far more exciting than the most poetical of winds to the most wind of poets on the right of this vast city rose what was mistaken by popanilla for an immense but leafless forest but more practical men than the fantaisian captain have been equally confounded by the first sight of a million of masts  the canoe cut its way with increased rapidity and ere popanilla had recovered himself sufficiently to make even an ejaculation he found himself at the side of a quay some amphibious creatures whom he supposed to be mermen immediately came to his assistance rather stared at his serpentskin coat and then helped him up the steps popanilla was instantly surrounded  who are you said one  what are you asked another  who is it exclaimed a third  what is it screamed a fourth  my friends i am a man  a man said the women are you sure you are a real man  he must be a seagod said the females  she must be a seagoddess said the males  a triton maintained the women  a nereid argued the men  it is a great fish said the boys  thanks to the universal linguist captain popanilla under these peculiar circumstances was more loquacious than could have been captain parry  good people you see before you the most injured of human beings  this announcement inspired general enthusiasm the women wept the men shook hands with him and all the boys huzzaed popanilla proceeded  actuated by the most pure the most patriotic the most noble the most enlightened and the most useful sentiments i aspired to ameliorate the condition of my fellowmen to this grand object i have sacrificed all that makes life delightful i have lost my station in society my taste for dancing my popularity with the men my favour with the women and last but oh not least excuse this emotion i have lost a very particular lock of hair in one word my friends you see before you banished ruined and unhappy the victim of a despotic sovereign a corrupt aristocracy and a misguided people  no sooner had he ceased speaking than popanilla really imagined that he had only escaped the dangers of sedition and the sea to expire by less hostile though not less effective means to be strangled was not much better than to be starved and certainly with halfadozen highly respectable females clinging round his neck he was not reminded for the first time in his life what a domestic bowstring is an affectionate woman in an agony of suffocation he thought very little of his arms although the admiration of the men had already in his imagination separated these useful members from his miserable body and had it not been for some justifiable kicking and plunging the veneration of the ingenuous and surrounding youth which manifested itself by their active exertions to divide his singular garment into relics of a martyr of liberty would soon have effectually prevented the illstarred popanilla from being again mistaken for a nereid order was at length restored and a committee of eight appointed to regulate the visits of the increasing mob  the arrangements were judicious the whole populace was marshalled into ranks classes of twelve persons were allowed consecutively to walk past the victim of tyranny corruption and ignorance and each person had the honour to touch his finger during this proceeding which lasted a few hours an influential personage generously offered to receive the eager subscriptions of the assembled thousands even the boys subscribed and ere six hours had passed since his arrival as a coatless vagabond in this liberal city captain popanilla found himself a person of considerable means  the receiver of the subscriptions while he crammed popanillas serpentskin pockets fall of gold pieces at the same time kindly offered the stranger to introduce him to an hotel popanilla who was quite beside himself could only bow his assent and mechanically accompanied his conductor when he had regained his faculty of speech he endeavoured in wandering sentences of grateful incoherency to express his deep sense of this unparalleled liberality it was an excess of generosity in which mankind could never have before indulged  by no means said his companion with great coolness far from this being an unparalleled affair i assure you it is a matter of hourly occurrence make your mind quite easy you are probably not aware that you are now living in the richest and the most charitable country in the world  wonderful said popanilla and what is the name may i ask of this charitable city  is it possible said his companion with a faint smile that you are ignorant of the great city of hubbabub the largest city not only that exists but that ever did exist and the capital of the island of vraibleusia the most famous island not only that is known but that ever was known  while he was speaking they were accosted by a man upon crutches who telling them in a broken voice that he had a wife and twelve infant children dependent on his support supplicated a little charity popanilla was about to empty part of his pocketfuls into the mendicants cap but his companion repressed his unphilosophical facility by no means said his friend who turning round to the beggar advised him in a mild voice to work calmly adding that if he presumed to ask charity again he should certainly have him bastinadoed then they walked on  popanillas attention was so distracted by the variety the number the novelty and the noise of the objects which were incessantly hurried upon his observation that he found no time to speak and as his companion though exceedingly polite was a man of few words conversation rather flagged  at last overwhelmed by the magnificence of the streets the splendour of the shops the number of human beings the rattling of the vehicles the dashing of the horses and a thousand other sounds and objects popanilla gave loose to a loud and fervent wish that his hotel might have the good fortune of being situated in this interesting quarter  by no means said his companion we have yet much further to go far from this being a desirable situation for you my friend no civilised person is ever seen here and had not the cause of civil and religious liberty fortunately called me to the waterside today i should have lost the opportunity of showing how greatly i esteem a gentleman who has suffered so severely in the cause of national amelioration  sir said popanilla your approbation is the only reward which i ever shall desire for my exertions you will excuse me for not quite keeping up with you but the fact is my pockets are so stuffed with cash that the action of my legs is greatly impeded  credit me my friend that you are suffering from an inconvenience which you will not long experience in hubbabub nevertheless to remedy it at present i think the best thing we can do is to buy a purse  they accordingly entered a shop where such an article might be found and taking up a small sack for popanilla was very rich his companion inquired its price which he was informed was four crowns no sooner had the desired information been given than the proprietor of the opposite shop rushed in and offered him the same article for three crowns the original merchant not at all surprised at the intrusion and not the least apologising for his former extortion then demanded two his rival being more than his match he courteously dropped upon his knee and requested his customer to accept the article gratis for his sake the generous dealer would infallibly have carried the day had not his rival humbly supplicated the purchaser not only to receive his article as a gift but also the compliment of a crown inside  what a terrible cheat the first merchant must have been said the puzzled popanilla as they proceeded on their way  by no means said his calm companion the purse was sufficiently cheap even at four crowns this is not cheatery this is competition  what a wonderful nation then this must be where you not only get purses gratis but even well loaded what use then is all this heavy gold it is a tremendous trouble to carry i will empty the bag into this kennel for money surely can be of no use in a city where when in want of cash you have only to go into a shop and buy a purse  your pardon said his companion far from this being the case vraibleusia is without doubt the dearest country in the world  if then said the inquisitive popanilla with great animation if then this country be the dearest in the world if how  my good friend said his companion i really am the last person in the world to answer questions all that i know is that this country is extremely dear and that the only way to get things cheap is to encourage competition  here the progress of his companion was impeded for some time by a great crowd which had assembled to catch a glimpse of a man who was to fly off a steeple but who had not yet arrived a chimneysweeper observed to a scientific friend that probably the density of the atmosphere might prevent the intended volitation and popanilla who having read almost as many pamphlets as the observer now felt quite at home exceedingly admired the observation  he must be a very superior man this gentleman in black said popanilla to his companion  by no means he is of the lowest class in society but you are probably not aware that you are in the most educated country in the world  delightful said popanilla  the captain was exceedingly desirous of witnessing the flight of the vraibleusian daedalus but his friend advised their progress this however was not easy and popanilla animated for the moment by his natural aristocratic disposition and emboldened by his superior size and strength began to clear his way in a manner which was more cogent than logical the chimneysweeper and his comrades were soon in arms and popanilla would certainly have been killed or ducked by this superior man and his friends had it not been for the mild remonstrance of his conductor and the singular appearance of his costume  what could have induced you to be so imprudent said his rescuer when they had escaped from the crowd  truly said popanilla i thought that in a country where you may bastinado the wretch who presumes to ask you for alms there could surely be no objection to my knocking down the scoundrel who dared to stand in my way  by no means said his friend slightly elevating his eyebrows here all men are equal you are probably not aware that you are at present in the freest country in the world  i do not exactly understand you what is this freedom  my good friend i really am the last person in the world to answer questions freedom is in one word liberty a kind of thing which you foreigners never can understand and which mere theory can make no man understand when you have been in the island a few weeks all will be quite clear to you in the meantime do as others do and never knock men down    chapter 7   although we are yet some way from our hotel remarked popanillas conductor we have now arrived at a part of the city where i can ease you without difficulty from your troublesome burthen let us enter here  as he spoke they stopped before a splendid palace and proceeding through various halls full of individuals apparently intently busied the companions were at last ushered into an apartment of smaller size but of more elegant character a personage of prepossessing appearance was lolling on a couch of an appearance equally prepossessing before him on a table were some papers exquisite fruits and some liqueurs popanilla was presented and received with fascinating complaisance his friend stated the object of their visit and handed the sackful of gold to the gentleman on the sofa the gentleman on the sofa ordered a couple of attendants to ascertain its contents while this computation was going on he amused his guests by his lively conversation and charmed popanilla by his polished manners and easy civility he offered him during his stay in vraibleusia the use of a couple of equipages a villa and an operabox insisted upon sending to his hotel some pineapples and some rare wine and gave him a perpetual ticket to his picturegallery when his attendants had concluded their calculation he ordered them to place popanillas precious metal in his treasury and then presenting the captain with a small packet of pink shells he kindly inquired whether he could be of any further use to him popanilla was loth to retire without his gold of the utility of which in spite of the convenience of competition he seemed to possess an instinctive conception but as his friend rose and withdrew he could do nothing less than accompany him for having now known him nearly half a day his confidence in his honour and integrity was naturally unbounded  that was the king of course said popanilla when they were fairly out of the palace  the king said the unknown nearly surprised into an exclamation by no means  and what then  my good friend is it possible that you have no bankers in your country  yes it is very possible but we have mermaids who also give us shells which are pretty what then are your bankers  really my good friend that is a question which i never remember having been asked before but a banker is a man who keeps our money for us  ah and he is bound i suppose to return your money when you choose  most assuredly  he is then in fact your servant you must pay him handsomely for him to live so well  by no means we pay him nothing  that is droll he must be very rich then  really my dear friend i cannot say why yes ii suppose he may be very rich  tis singular that a rich man should take so much trouble for others  my good friend of course he lives by his trouble  ah how then continued the inquisitive fantaisian if you do not pay him for his services and he yet lives by them how i pray does he acquire these immense riches  really my good sir i am in truth the very last man in the world to answer questions he is a banker bankers are always rich but why they are or how they are i really never had time to inquire but i suppose if the truth were known they must have very great opportunities  ah i begin to see said popanilla it was really very kind of him continued the captain to make me a present of these little pink shells what would i not give to turn them into a necklace and send it to a certain person at fantaisie  it would be a very expensive necklace observed his companion almost surprised i had no idea i confess from your appearance that in your country they indulged in such expensive tastes in costume  expensive said popanilla we certainly have no such shells as these in fantaisie but we have much more beautiful ones i should think from their look they must be rather common  his conductor for the first time nearly laughed i forgot said he that you could not be aware that these pink shells are the most precious coin of the land compared with which those bits of gold with which you have recently parted are nothing your whole fortune is now in that little packet the fact is continued the unknown making an effort to communicate although we possess in this country more of the precious metals than all the rest of the world together the quantity is nevertheless utterly disproportioned to the magnitude of our wealth and our wants we have been therefore under the necessity of resorting to other means of representing the first and supplying the second and taking advantage of our insular situation we have introduced these small pink shells which abound all round the coast being much more convenient to carry they are in general circulation and no genteel person has ever anything else in his pocket  wonderful but surely then it is no very difficult thing in this country to accumulate a fortune since all that is necessary to give you every luxury of life is a stroll one morning of your existence along the beach  by no means my friend you are really too rapid the fact is that no one has the power of originally circulating these shells but our government and if any one by any chance choose to violate this arrangement we make up for depriving him of his solitary walks on the shore by instant submersion in the sea  then the whole circulation of the country is at the mercy of your government remarked popanilla summoning to his recollection the contents of one of those shipwrecked brochures which had exercised so strange an influence on his destiny suppose they do not choose to issue  that is always guarded against the mere quarterly payments of interest upon our national debt will secure an ample supply  debt i thought you were the richest nation in the world  tis true nevertheless if there were a golden pyramid with a base as big as the whole earth and an apex touching the heavens it would not supply us with sufficient metal to satisfy our creditors  but my dear sir exclaimed the perplexed popanilla if this really be true how then can you be said to be the richest nation in the world  it is very simple the annual interest upon our debt exceeds the whole wealth of the rest of the world therefore we must be the richest nation in the world  tis true said popanilla i see i have yet much to learn but with regard to these pink shells how can you possibly create for them a certain standard of value it is merely agreement among yourselves that fixes any value to them  by no means you are so rapid each shell is immediately convertible into gold of which metal let me again remind you we possess more than any other nation but which indeed we only keep as a sort of dress coin chiefly to indulge the prejudices of foreigners  but said the perpetual popanilla suppose every man who held a shell on the same day were to  my good friend i really am the last person in the world to give explanations in vraibleusia we have so much to do that we have no time to think a habit which only becomes nations who are not employed you are now fast approaching the great shell question a question which i confess affects the interests of every man in this island more than any other but of which i must candidly own every man in this island is more ignorant than of any other no one however can deny that the system works well and if anything at any time go wrong why really mr secretary periwinkle is a wonderful man and our most eminent conchologist he no doubt will set it right and if by any chance things are past even his management why then i suppose to use our national motto something will turn up  here they arrived at the hotel having made every arrangement for the comfort and convenience of the fantaisian stranger popanillas conductor took his leave previously informing him that his name was skindeep that he was a member of one of the largest families in the island that had he not been engaged to attend a lecture he would have stayed and dined with him but that he would certainly call upon him on the morrow  compared with his hotel the palace of his banker was a dungeon even the sunset voluptuousness of fantaisie was now remembered without regret in the blaze of artificial light and in the artificial gratification of desires which art had alone created after a magnificent repast his host politely inquired of popanilla whether he would like to go to the opera the comedy or a concert but the fantaisian philosopher was not yet quite corrupted and still inspired with a desire to acquire useful knowledge he begged his landlord to procure him immediately a pamphlet on the shell question  while his host was engaged in procuring this luxury a man entered the room and told popanilla that he had walked that day two thousand five hundred paces and that the tax due to the excise upon this promenade was fifty crowns the captain stared and remarked to the exciseofficer that he thought a mans paces were a strange article to tax the exciseofficer with great civility answered that no doubt at first sight it might appear rather strange but that it was the only article left untaxed in vraibleusia that there was a slight deficiency in the last quarters revenue and that therefore the government had no alternative that it was a tax which did not press heavily upon the individual because the vraibleusians were of a sedentary habit that besides it was an opinion every day more received among the best judges that the more a man was taxed the richer he ultimately would prove and he concluded by saying that popanilla need not make himself uneasy about these demands because if he were ruined tomorrow being a foreigner he was entitled by the law of the land to five thousand ayear whereas he the exciseman being a nativeborn vraibleusian had no claims whatever upon the government therefore he hoped his honour would give him something to drink  his host now entered with the novum organon of the great periwinkle while popanilla devoured the lively pages of this treatise he discovered that the system which had been so subtilely introduced by the government and which had so surprised him in the morning had soon been adopted in private life and although it was a drowning matter to pick up pink shells still there was nothing to prevent the whole commerce of the country from being carried on by means of a system equally conchological he found that the social action in every part of the island was regulated and assisted by this process oystershells were first introduced muscleshells speedily followed and as commerce became more complicate they had even been obliged to have recourse to snailshells popanilla retired to rest with admiration of the people who thus converted to the most useful purposes things apparently so useless there was no saying now what might not be done even with a nutshell it was evident that the nation who contrived to be the richest people in the world while they were over head and ears in debt must be fast approaching to a state of perfection finally sinking to sleep in a bed of eiderdown popanilla was confirmed in his prejudices against a state of nature    chapter 8   skindeep called upon popanilla on the following morning in an elegant equipage and with great politeness proposed to attend him in a drive about the city  the island of vraibleusia is one hundred and fifty miles in circumference twothirds of which are covered by the city of hubbabub it contains no other city town or village the rest of the island consists of rivers canals and railroads popanilla was surprised when he was informed that hubbabub did not contain more than five millions of inhabitants but his surprise was decreased when their journey occasionally lay through tracts of streets consisting often of capacious mansions entirely tenantless on seeking an explanation of this seeming desolation he was told that the hubbabubians were possessed by a frenzy of always moving on westward and that consequently great quarters of the city are perpetually deserted even as skindeep was speaking their passage was stopped by a large caravan of carriages and wagons heavily laden with human creatures and their children and chattels on skindeep inquiring the cause of this great movement he was informed by one on horseback who seemed to be the leader of the horde that they were the late dwellers in sundry squares and streets situated far to the east that their houses having been ridiculed by an itinerant balladeer the female part of the tribe had insisted upon immediately quitting their unfashionable fatherland and that now after three days journey they had succeeded in reaching the late settlement of a horde who had migrated to the extreme west  quitting regions so subject to revolutions and vicissitudes the travellers once more emerged into quarters of a less transitory reputation and in the magnificent parks the broad streets the ample squares the palaces the triumphal arches and the theatres of occidental hubbabub popanilla lost those sad and mournful feelings which are ever engendered by contemplating the gloomy relics of departed greatness it was impossible to admire too much the architecture of this part of the city the elevations were indeed imposing in general the massy egyptian appropriately graced the atticstories while the finer and more elaborate architecture of corinth was placed on a level with the eye so that its beauties might be more easily discovered spacious colonnades were flanked by porticoes surmounted by domes nor was the number of columns at all limited for you occasionally met with porticos of two tiers the lower one of which consisted of three the higher one of thirty columns pedestals of the purest ionic gothic were ingeniously intermixed with palladian pediments and the surging spire exquisitely harmonised with the horizontal architecture of the ancients but perhaps after all the most charming effect was produced by the pyramids surmounted by weathercocks  popanilla was particularly pleased by some chimneys of caryatides and did not for a moment hesitate in assenting to the assertion of skindeep that the vraibleusians were the most architectural nation in the world true it was they had begun late their attention as a people having been for a considerable time attracted to much more important affairs but they had compensated for their tardy attention by their speedy excellence         see a work which will be shortly published entitled the        difference detected between architecture and parchitecture        by sansovino the second  before they returned home skindeep led popanilla to the top of a tower from whence they had a complete view of the whole island skindeep particularly directed the captains attention to one spot where flourished as he said the only cornfields in the country which supplied the whole nation and were the property of one individual so unrivalled was his agricultural science that the vulgar only accounted for his admirable produce by a miraculous fecundity the proprietor of these hundred golden acres was a rather mysterious sort of personage he was an aboriginal inhabitant and though the only one of the aborigines in existence had lived many centuries and to the consternation of some of the vraibleusians and the exultation of others exhibited no signs of decay this awful being was without a name when spoken of by his admirers he was generally described by such panegyrical periphrases as soul of the country foundation of the state the only real and true and substantial being while on the other hand those who presumed to differ from those sentiments were in the habit of styling him the dead weight the vampire the nightmare and other titles equally complimentary they also maintained that instead of being either real or substantial he was in fact the most flimsy and fictitious personage in the whole island and then lashing themselves up into metaphor they would call him a meteor or a vapour or a great windy bubble that would some day burst  the aboriginal insisted that it was the common law of the land that the islanders should purchase their corn only of him they grumbled but he growled he swore that it was the constitution of the country that there was an uninterrupted line of precedents to confirm the claim and that if they did not approve of the arrangement they and their fathers should not have elected to have settled or presumed to have been spawned upon his island then as if he were not desirous of resting his claim on its mere legal merits he would remind them of the superiority of his grain and the impossibility of a scarcity in the event of which calamity an insular people could always find a plentiful though temporary resource in seaweed he then clearly proved to them that if ever they had the imprudence to change any of their old laws they would necessarily never have more than one meal a day as long as they lived finally he recalled to their recollection that he had made the island what it was that he was their mainstay and that his counsel and exertions had rendered them the wonder of the world thus between force and fear and flattery the vraibleusians paid for their corn nearly its weight in gold but what did that signify to a nation with so many pink shells    chapter 9   the third day after his drive with his friend skindeep popanilla was waited upon by the most eminent bookseller in hubbabub who begged to have the honour of introducing to the public a narrative of captain popanillas voyage this gentleman assured popanilla that the vraibleusian public were nervously alive to anything connected with discovery that so ardent was their attachment to science and natural philosophy that voyages and travels were sure to be read with eagerness particularly if they had coloured plates popanilla was charmed with the proposition but blushingly informed the mercantile maecenas that he did not know how to write the publisher told him that this circumstance was not of the slightest importance that he had never for a moment supposed that so sublime a savage could possess such a vulgar accomplishment and that it was by no means difficult for a man to publish his travels without writing a line of them  popanilla having consented to become an author upon these terms the publisher asked him to dine with him and introduced him to an intelligent individual this intelligent individual listened attentively to all popanillas adventures the captain concealed nothing he began with the eternal lock of hair and showed how wonderfully this world was constituted that even the loss of a thing was not useless from which it was clear that utility was providence after drinking some capital wine the intelligent individual told popanilla that he was wrong in supposing fantaisie to be an island that on the contrary it was a great continent that this was proved by the probable action of the tides in the part of the island which had not yet been visited that the consequence of these tides would be that in the course of a season or two fantaisie would become a great receptacle for icebergs and be turned into the north pole that therefore the seasons throughout the world would be changed that this year in vraibleusia the usual winter would be omitted and that when the present summer was finished the dogdays would again commence popanilla took his leave highly delighted with this intelligent individual and with the booksellers wine  owing to the competition which existed between the publishers the printers and the engravers of the city of hubbabub and the great exertions of the intelligent individual the narrative of captain popanillas voyage was brought out in less than a week and was immediately in everybodys hand the work contained a detailed account of everything which took place daring the whole of the three days and formed a quarto volume the plates were numerous and highly interesting there was a line engraving of alligator mountain and a mezzotint of seaweed island a view of the canoe ne a view of the canoe nw a view of the canoe se a view of the canoe sw there were highlyfinished coloured drawings of the dried fish and the breadfruit and an exquisitely tinted representation of the latter in a mouldy state but the chefdoeuvre was the portrait of the author himself he was represented trampling on the body of a boa constrictor of the first quality in the skin of which he was dressed at his back were his bow and arrows his right hand rested on an uprooted pinetree he stood in a desert between two volcanoes at his feet was a lake of magnitude the distance lowered with an approaching tornado but a lucky flash of lightning revealed the range of the andes and both oceans altogether he looked the most dandified of savages and the most savage of dandies it was a sublime lithograph and produced scarcely less important effects upon popanillas fortune than that lucky lock of hair for no sooner was the portrait published than popanilla received a ticket for the receptions of a lady of quality on showing it to skindeep he was told that the honour was immense and therefore he must go by all means skindeep regretted that he could not accompany him but he was engaged to a lecture on shoemaking and a lecture was a thing he made it a point never to miss because as he very properly observed by lectures you may become extremely well informed without any of the inconveniences of study no fixity of attention no continuity of meditation no habits of reflection no aptitude of combination are the least requisite all which things only give you a nervous headache and yet you gain all the results of all these processes true it is that that which is so easily acquired is not always so easily remembered but what of that suppose you forget any subject why then you go to another lecture very true said popanilla  popanilla failed not to remember his invitation from lady spirituelle and at the proper hour his announcement produced a sensation throughout her crowded saloons  spirituelle was a most enchanting lady she asked popanilla how tall he really was and whether the women in fantaisie were as handsome as the men then she said that the vraibleusians were the most intellectual and the most scientific nation in the world and that the society at her house was the most intellectual and the most scientific in vraibleusia she told him also that she had hoped by this season the world would have been completely regulated by mind but that the subversion of matter was a more substantial business than she and the committee of management had imagined she had no doubt however that in a short time mind must carry the day because matter was mortal and mind eternal therefore mind had the best chance finally she also told him that the passions were the occasion of all the misery which had ever existed and that it was impossible for mankind either to be happy or great until like herself and her friends they were all soul  popanilla was charmed with his company what a difference between the calm smiling easy uninteresting stupid sunset countenances of fantaisie and those around him all looked so interested and so intelligent their eyes were so anxious their gestures so animated their manners so earnest they must be very clever he drew nearer if before he were charmed now he was enchanted what an universal acquisition of useful knowledge three or four dukes were earnestly imbibing a new theory of gas from a brilliant little gentleman in black who looked like a willothewisp the prime minister was anxious about pinmaking a bishop equally interested in a dissertation on the escapements of watches a fieldmarshal not less intent on a new specific from the concentrated essence of hellebore but what most delighted popanilla was hearing a lecture from the most eminent lawyer and statesman in vraibleusia on his first and favourite study of hydrostatics his associations quite overcame him all fantaisie rushed upon his memory and he was obliged to retire to a less frequented part of the room to relieve his too excited feelings  he was in a few minutes addressed by the identical little gentleman who had recently been speculating with the three dukes  the little gentleman told him that he had heard with great pleasure that in fantaisie they had no historians poets or novelists he proved to popanilla that no such thing as experience existed that as the world was now to be regulated on quite different principles from those by which it had hitherto been conducted similar events to those which had occurred could never again take place and therefore it was absolutely useless to know anything about the past with regard to literary fiction he explained that as it was absolutely necessary from his nature that man should experience a certain quantity of excitement the false interest which these productions created prevented their readers from obtaining this excitement by methods which by the discovery of the useful might greatly benefit society  you are of opinion then exclaimed the delighted popanilla that nothing is good which is not useful  is it possible that an individual exists in this world who doubts this great first principle said the little man with great animation  ah my dear friend said popanilla if you only knew what an avowal of this great first principle has cost me what i have suffered what i have lost  what have you lost asked the little gentleman  in the first place a lock of hair  poh nonsense  ah you may say poh but it was a particular lock of hair  my friend that word is odious nothing is particular everything is general rules are general feelings are general and property should be general and sir i tell you what in a very short time it must be so why should lady spirituelle for instance receive me at her house rather than i receive her at mine  why dont you then asked the simple popanilla  because i have not got one sir roared the little gentleman  he would certainly have broken away had not popanilla begged him to answer one question the captain reiterating in the most solemn manner his firm belief in the dogma that nothing was good which was not useful and again detailing the persecutions which this conviction had brought upon him was delighted that an opportunity was now afforded to gain from the lips of a distinguished philosopher a definition of what utility really was the distinguished philosopher could not refuse so trifling a favour  utility said he is  at this critical moment there was a universal buzz throughout the rooms and everybody looked so interested that the philosopher quite forgot to finish his answer on inquiring the cause of this great sensation popanilla was informed that a rumour was about that a new element had been discovered that afternoon the party speedily broke up the principal philosophers immediately rushing to their clubs to ascertain the truth of this report popanilla was unfashionable enough to make his acknowledgments to his hostess before he left her house as he gazed upon her ladyships brilliant eyes and radiant complexion he felt convinced of the truth of her theory of the passions he could not refrain from pressing her hand in a manner which violated etiquette and which a nativity in the indian ocean could alone excuse the pressure was graciously returned as popanilla descended the staircase he discovered a little note of pink satin paper entangled in his ruffle he opened it with curiosity it was all soul he did not return to his hotel quite so soon as he expected    chapter 10   popanilla breakfasted rather late the next morning and on looking over the evening papers which were just published his eyes lighted on the following paragraph  arrived yesterday at the hotel diplomatique his excellency prince popanilla ambassador extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from the newlyrecognised state of fantaisie  before his excellency could either recover from his astonishment or make any inquiries which might throw any illustration upon its cause a loud shout in the street made him naturally look out of the window he observed three or four magnificent equipages drawing up at the door of the hotel and followed by a large crowd each carriage was drawn by four horses and attended by footmen so radiant with gold and scarlet that had popanilla been the late ingenious mr keates he would have mistaken them for the natural children of phoebus and aurora the ambassador forgot the irregularity of the paragraph in the splendour of the liveries he felt triumphantly conscious that the most beautiful rose in the world must look extremely pale by the side of scarlet cloth and this new example of the superiority of art over nature reminding him of the inferiority of breadfruit to grilled muffin he resolved to return to breakfast  but it was his fate to be reminded of the inutility of the best resolutions for ere the cup of coffee had touched his parched lips the door of his room flow open and the marquess of moustache was announced  his lordship was a young gentleman with an expressive countenance that is to say his face was so covered with hair and the back of his head cropped so bald that you generally addressed him in the rear by mistake he did not speak but continued bowing for a considerable time in that diplomatic manner which means so much by the time he had finished bowing his suite had gained the apartment and his private secretary one of those uncommonly able men who only want an opportunity seized the present one of addressing popanilla  bowing to the late captain with studied respect he informed him that the marquess moustache was the nobleman appointed by the government of vraibleusia to attend upon his excellency during the first few weeks of his mission with the view of affording him all information upon those objects which might naturally be expected to engage the interest or attract the attention of so distinguished a personage the ancien marin and present ambassador had been so used to miracles since the loss of that lock of hair that he did not think it supernatural having during the last few days been in turn a fantaisian nobleman a postcaptain a fish a goddess and above all an author he should now be transformed into a plenipotentiary drinking therefore his cup of coffee he assumed an air as if he really were used to have a marquess for an attendant and said that he was at his lordships service  the marquess bowed low and the private secretary remarked that the first thing to be done by his excellency was to be presented to the government after that he was to visit all the manufactories in vraibleusia subscribe to all the charities and dine with all the corporations attend a dejeuner a la fourchette at a palace they were at present building under the sea give a gold plate to be run for on the fashionable racecourse be present at morning prayers at the government chapel hunt once or twice give a dinner or two himself make one pun and go to the play by which various means he said the good understanding between the two countries would be materially increased and in a manner established  as the fantaisian ambassador and his suite entered their carriages the sky if it had not been for the smoke would certainly have been rent by the acclamations of the mob popanilla for ever sounded from all quarters except where the shout was varied by vraibleusia and fantaisie against the world which perhaps was even the most popular sentiment of the two the ambassador was quite agitated and asked the marquess what he was to do the private secretary told his excellency to bow popanilla bowed with such grace that in five minutes the horses were taken out of his carriage and that carriage dragged in triumph by the enthusiastic populace he continued bowing and their enthusiasm continued increasing in the meantime his excellencys portrait was sketched by an artist who hung upon his wheel and in less than half an hour a lithographic likeness of the popular idol was worshipped in every printshop in hubbabub  as they drew nearer the hall of audience the crowd kept increasing till at length the whole city seemed poured forth to meet him although now feeling conscious that he was the greatest man in the island and therefore only thinking of himself popanillas attention was nevertheless at this moment attracted by a singular figure he was apparently a man in stature a patagonian and robust as a wellfed ogre his countenance was jolly but consequential and his costume a curious mixture of a huntingdress and a court suit he was on foot and in spite of the crowd with the aid of a good whip and his left fist made his way with great ease on inquiring who this extraordinary personage might be popanilla was informed that it was the aboriginal inhabitant as the giant passed the ambassadors carriages the whole suite even lord moustache rose and bent low and the secretary told popanilla that there was no person in the island for whom the government of vraibleusia entertained so profound a respect  the crowd was now so immense that even the progress of the aboriginal inhabitant was for a moment impeded the great man got surrounded by a large body of little mechanics the contrast between the pale perspiring visages and lean forms of these emaciated and halfgenerated creatures and the jolly form and ruddy countenance gigantic limbs and ample frame of the aboriginal was most striking nor could any one view the group for an instant without feeling convinced that the latter was really a superior existence the mechanics who were worn by labour not reduced by famine far from being miserable were impudent they began rating the mighty one for the dearness of his corn he received their attacks with mildness he reminded them that the regulation by which they procured their bread was the aboriginal law of the island under which they had all so greatly flourished he explained to them that it was owing to this protecting principle that he and his ancestors having nothing to do but to hunt and shoot had so preserved their health that unlike the rest of the human race they had not degenerated from the original form and nature of man he showed that it was owing to the vigour of mind and body consequent upon this fine health that vraibleusia had become the wonder of the world and that they themselves were so actively employed and he inferred that they surely could not grudge him the income which he derived since that income was in fact the foundation of their own profits he then satisfactorily demonstrated to them that if by any circumstances he were to cease to exist the whole island would immediately sink under the sea having thus condescended to hold a little parley with his fellowsubjects though not followcreatures he gave them all a good sound flogging and departed amidst the enthusiastic cheering of those whom he had so briskly lashed  by this time popanilla had arrived at the hall of audience  it was a vast and venerable pile  his excellency and suite quitted their carriages amidst the renewed acclamations of the mob proceeding through a number of courts and quadrangles crowded with guards and officials they stopped before a bronze gate of great height over it was written in vast characters of living flame this inscription                   to        the wisest and the best     the richest and the mightiest      the glory and the admiration   the defence and the consternation  on reading this mysterious inscription his excellency experienced a sudden and awful shudder lord moustache however who was more used to mysteries taking up a silver trumpet which was fixed to the portal by a crimson cord gave a loud blast the gates flew open with the sound of a whirlwind and popanilla found himself in what at first appeared an illimitable hall it was crowded but perfect order was preserved the ambassador was conducted with great pomp to the upper end of the apartment where after an hours walk his excellency arrived at the extremity of the hall was a colossal and metallic statue of extraordinary appearance it represented an armed monarch the head and bust were of gold and the curling hair was crowned with an imperial diadem the body and arms were of silver worked in the semblance of a complete suit of enamelled armour of the feudal ages and the thighs and legs were of iron which the artist had clothed in the bandaged hose of the old saxons the figure bore the appearance of great antiquity but had evidently been often repaired and renovated since its first formation the workmanship was clearly of different eras and the reparations either from ignorance or intention had often been effected with little deference to the original design part of the shoulders had been supplied by the other though less precious metal and the roman and imperial ornaments had unaccountably been succeeded by the less classic though more picturesque decorations of gothic armour on the other hand a great portion of the chivalric and precious material of the body had been removed and replaced by a style and substance resembling those of the lower limbs in its right hand the statue brandished a naked sword and with its left leant upon a huge though extremely rich and elaborately carved crosier it trampled upon a shivered lance and a broken chain  your excellency perceives said the secretary pointing to the statue that ours is a mixed government  popanilla was informed that this extraordinary statue enjoyed all the faculties of an intellectual being with the additional advantage of some faculties which intellectual beings do not enjoy it possessed not only the faculty of speech but of speaking truth not only the power of judgment but of judging rightly not only the habit of listening but of listening attentively its antiquity was so remote that the most profound and acute antiquarians had failed in tracing back its origin the aboriginal inhabitant however asserted that it was the work of one of his ancestors and as his assertion was confirmed by all traditions the allegation was received whatever might have been its origin certain it was that it was now immortal for it could never die and to whomsoever it might have been originally indebted for its power not less sure was it that it was now omnipotent for it could do all things thus alleged and thus believed the vraibleusians marvellous and sublime people who with all the impotence of mortality have created a government which is both immortal and omnipotent  generally speaking the statue was held in great reverence and viewed with great admiration by the whole vraibleusian people there were a few persons indeed who asserted that the creation of such a statue was by no means so mighty a business as it had been the fashion to suppose and that it was more than probable that with the advantages afforded by the scientific discoveries of modern times they would succeed in making a more useful one this indeed they offered to accomplish provided the present statue were preliminarily destroyed but as they were well assured that this offer would never be accepted it was generally treated by those who refused it as a braggadocio there were many also who though they in general greatly admired and respected the present statue affected to believe that though the execution was wonderful and the interior machinery indeed far beyond the powers of the present age nevertheless the design was in many parts somewhat rude and the figure altogether far from being wellproportioned some thought the head too big some too small some that the body was disproportionately little others on the contrary that it was so much too large that it had the appearance of being dropsical others maintained that the legs were too weak for the support of the whole and that they should be rendered more important and prominent members of the figure while on the contrary there were yet others who cried out that really these members were already so extravagantly huge so coarse and so ungenteel that they quite marred the general effect of a beautiful piece of sculpture  the same differences existed about the comparative excellence of the three metals and the portions of the body which they respectively formed some admired the gold and maintained that if it were not for the head the statue would be utterly useless others preferred the silver and would assert that the body which contained all the machinery must clearly be the most precious portion while a third party triumphantly argued that the iron legs which supported both body and head must surely be the most valuable part since without them the statue must fall the first party advised that in all future reparations gold only should be introduced and the other parties of course recommended with equal zeal their own favourite metals it is observable however that if under these circumstances the iron race chanced to fail in carrying their point they invariably voted for gold in preference to silver but the most contradictory opinions perhaps were those which were occasioned by the instruments with which the statue was armed and supported some affected to be so frightened by the mere sight of the brandished sword although it never moved that they pretended it was dangerous to live even under the same sky with it while others treating very lightly the terrors of this warlike instrument would observe that much more was really to be apprehended from the remarkable strength and thickness of the calm and peaceinspiring crosier and that as long as the government was supported by this huge pastoral staff nothing could prevail against it that it could dare all things and even stand without the help of its legs all these various opinions at least proved that although the present might not be the most miraculous statue that could possibly be created it was nevertheless quite impossible ever to form one which would please all parties  the care of this wonderful statue was entrusted to twelve managers whose duty it was to windup and regulate its complicated machinery and who answered for its good management by their heads it was their business to consult the oracle upon all occasions and by its decisions to administer and regulate all the affairs of the state they alone were permitted to hear its voice for the statue never spoke in public save on rare occasions and its sentences were then really so extremely commonplace that had it not been for the deep wisdom of its general conduct the vraibleusians would have been almost tempted to believe that they really might exist without the services of the capital member the twelve managers surrounded the statue at a respectful distance their posts were the most distinguished in the state and indeed the duties attached to them were so numerous so difficult and so responsible that it required no ordinary abilities to fulfil and demanded no ordinary courage to aspire to them  the fantaisian ambassador having been presented took his place on the right hand of the statue next to the aboriginal inhabitant and public business then commenced  there came forward a messenger who knocking his nose three times with great reverence on the floor a knock for each metal of the figure thus spoke  o thou wisest and best thou richest and mightiest thou glory and admiration then defence and consternation lo the king of the north is cutting all his subjects heads off  this announcement produced a great sensation the marquess moustache took snuff the private secretary said he had long suspected that this would be the case and the aboriginal inhabitant remarked to popanilla that the corn in the north was of an exceedingly coarse grain while they were making these observations the twelve managers had assembled in deep consultation around the statue and in a very few minutes the oracle was prepared the answer was very simple but the exordium was sublime it professed that the vraibleusian nation was the saviour and champion of the world that it was the first principle of its policy to maintain the cause of any people struggling for their rights as men and it avowed itself to be the grand patron of civil and religious liberty in all quarters of the globe fortyseven battalions of infantry and eighteen regiments of cavalry twentyfour sail of the line seventy transports and fifteen bombketches were then ordered to leave vraibleusia for the north in less than sixty minutes  what energy said popanilla what decision what rapidity of execution  ay said the aboriginal smacking his thigh let them say what they like about their proportions and mixtures and metalsabstract nonsense no one can deny that our government works well but see here comes another messenger  o thou wisest and best thou richest and mightiest thou glory and admiration thou defence and consternation lo the people of the south have cut their kings head off  well i suppose that is exactly what you all want said the innocent popanilla  the private secretary looked mysterious and said that he was not prepared to answer that his department never having been connected with this species of business he was unable at the moment to give his excellency the requisite information at the same time he begged to state that provided anything he said should not commit him he had no objection to answer the question hypothetically the aboriginal inhabitant said that he would have no hypotheses or jacobins that he did not approve of cutting off kings heads and that the vraibleusians were the most monarchical people in the world so saying he walked up without any ceremony to the chief manager and taking him by the button conversed with him some time in an earnest manner which made the stocks fall two per cent  the statue ordered three divisions of the grand army and a batteringtrain of the first grade off to the south without the loss of a second a palace and establishment were immediately directed to be prepared for the family of the murdered monarch and the commanderinchief was instructed to make every exertion to bring home the body of his majesty embalmed such an immense issue of pink shells was occasioned by this last expedition that stocks not only recovered themselves but rose considerably  the excitement occasioned by this last announcement evaporated at the sight of a third messenger he informed the statue that the emperor of the east was unfortunately unable to pay the interest upon his national debt that his treasury was quite empty and his resources utterly exhausted he requested the assistance of the most wealthy and the most generous of nations and he offered them as security for their advances his gold and silver mines which for the breadth of their veins and the richness of their ores he said were unequalled he added that the only reason they were unworked was the exquisite flavour of the watermelons in his empire which was so delicious that his subjects of all classes passing their whole day in devouring them could be induced neither by force nor persuasion to do anything else the cause was so reasonable and the security so satisfactory that the vraibleusian government felt themselves authorised in shipping off immediately all the gold in the island pink shells abounded and stocks were still higher  you have no mines in vraibleusia i believe said popanilla to the aboriginal  no but we have taxes  very true said popanilla  i understand that a messenger has just arrived from the west said the secretary to the fantaisian plenipotentiary he must bring interesting intelligence from such interesting countries next to ourselves they are evidently the most happy the most wealthy the most enlightened and the most powerful governments in the world although founded only last week they already rank in the first class of nations i will send you a little pamphlet tomorrow which i have just published upon this subject in which you will see that i have combated i trust not unsuccessfully the ridiculous opinions of those cautious statesmen who insinuate that the stability of these governments is even yet questionable  the messenger from the republics of the west now prostrated himself before the statue he informed it that two parties had unfortunately broken out in these countries and threatened their speedy dissolution that one party maintained that all human government originated in the wants of man while the other party asserted that it originated in the desires of man that these factions had become so violent and so universal that public business was altogether stopped trade quite extinct and the instalments due to vraibleusia not forthcoming finally he entreated the wisest and the best of nations to send to these distracted lands some discreet and trusty personages well instructed in the first principles of government in order that they might draw up constitutions for the ignorant and irritated multitude  the private secretary told popanilla that this was no more than he had long expected that all this would subside and that he should publish a postscript to his pamphlet in a few days which he begged to dedicate to him  a whole corps diplomatique and another shipful of abstract philosophers principally scotchmen were immediately ordered off to the west and shortly after to render their first principles still more effective and their administrative arrangements still more influential some brigades of infantry and a detachment of the guards followed free constitutions are apt to be misunderstood until half of the nation are bayoneted and the rest imprisoned  as this mighty vraibleusian nation had within the last halfhour received intelligence from all quarters of the globe and interfered in all possible affairs civil and military abstract administrative diplomatic and financial popanilla supposed that the assembly would now break up some petty business however remained war was declared against the king of sneezeland for presuming to buy pockethandkerchiefs of another nation and the emperor of pastilles was threatened with a bombardment for daring to sell his peppers to another people there were also some dozen commercial treaties to be signed or canvassed or cancelled and a report having got about that there was a rumour that some disturbance had broken out in some parts unknown a flying expedition was despatched with sealed orders to circumnavigate the globe and arrange affairs by this time popanilla thoroughly understood the meaning of the mysterious inscription  just as the assembly was about to be dissolved another messenger who in his agitation even forgot the accustomed etiquette of salutation rushed into the presence  o most mighty sir bombastes furioso who commanded our last expedition having sailed in the hurry with wrong orders has attacked our ancient ally by mistake and utterly destroyed him  here was a pretty business for the best and wisest at first the managers behaved in a manner the most undiplomatic and quite lost their temper they raved they stormed they contradicted each other they contradicted themselves and swore that sir bombastes head should answer for it then they subsided into sulkiness and at length beginning to suspect that the fault might ultimately attach only to themselves they got frightened and held frequent consultations with pale visages and quivering lips after some time they thought they could do nothing wiser than put a good face upon the affair whatever might be the result it was at any rate a victory and a victory would please the vainest of nations and so these blundering and blustering gentlemen determined to adopt the conqueror whom they were at first weak enough to disclaim then vile enough to bully and finally forced to reward the statue accordingly whispered a most elaborate panegyric on furioso which was of course duly delivered the admiral who was neither a coward nor a fool was made ridiculous by being described as the greatest commander that ever existed one whom nature in a gracious freak had made to shame us little men a happy compound of the piety of noah the patriotism of themistocles the skill of columbus and the courage of nelson and his exploit styled the most glorious and unrivalled victory that was ever achieved even by the vraibleusians honours were decreed in profusion a general illumination ordered for the next twenty nights and an expedition immediately despatched to attack the right man  all this time the conquerors were in waiting in an anteroom in great trepidation and fully prepared to be cashiered or cut in quarters they were rather surprised when bowing to the ground they were saluted by some halfdozen lordsinwaiting as the heroes of the age congratulated upon their famous achievements and humbly requested to appear in the presence  the warriors accordingly walked up in procession to the statue who opening its mighty mouth vomited forth a flood of ribbons stars and crosses which were divided among the valiant band this oral discharge the vraibleusians called the fountain of honour  scarcely had the mighty furioso and his crew disappeared than a body of individuals arrived at the top of the hall and placing themselves opposite the managers began rating them for their inefficient administration of the island and expatiated on the inconsistency of their late conduct to the conquering bombastes the managers defended themselves in a manner perfectly in character with their recent behaviour but their opponents were not easily satisfied with their confused explanations and their explained confusions and the speeches on both sides grew warmer at length the opposition proceeded to expel the administration from their places by force and an eager scuffle between the two parties now commenced the general body of spectators continued only to observe and did not participate in the fray at first this melee only excited amusement but as it lengthened some wisely observed that public business greatly suffered by these private squabbles and some even ventured to imagine that the safety of the statue might be implicated by their continuance but this last fear was futile  popanilla asked the private secretary which party he thought would ultimately succeed the private secretary said that if the present managers retained their places he thought that they would not go out but if on the other hand they were expelled by the present opposition it was probable that the present opposition would become managers the aboriginal thought both parties equally incompetent and told popanilla some long stories about a person who was chief manager in his youth about five hundred years ago to whom he said he was indebted for all his political principles which did not surprise popanilla  at this moment a noise was heard throughout the hall which made his excellency believe that something untoward had again happened and that another conqueror by mistake had again arrived a most wonderful being galloped up to the top of the apartment it was half man and half horse the secretary told popanilla that this was the famous centaur chiron that his horseship having wearied of his ardent locality in the constellations had descended some years back to the island of vraibleusia that he had commanded the armies of the nation in all the great wars and had gained every battle in which he had ever been engaged chiron was no less skilful he said in civil than in military affairs but the vraibleusians being very jealous of allowing themselves to be governed by their warriors the centaur had lately been out of employ while the secretary was giving him this information popanilla perceived that the great chiron was attacking the combatants on both sides the tutor of achilles hercules and aeneas of course soon succeeded in kicking them all out and constituted himself chief and sole manager of the statue some grumbled at this autocratic conduct upon principle but they were chiefly connections of the expelled the great majority wearied with public squabbles occasioned by private ends rejoiced to see the public interest entrusted to an individual who had a reputation to lose intelligence of the appointment of the centaur was speedily diffused throughout the island and produced great and general satisfaction there were a few indeed impartial personages who had no great taste for centaurs in civil capacities from an apprehension that if he could not succeed in persuading them by his eloquence his grace might chance to use his heels    chapter 11   on the evening of his presentation day his excellency the fantaisian ambassador and suite honoured the national theatre with their presence such a house was never known the pit was miraculously overflown before the doors were opened although the proprietor did not permit a single private entrance the enthusiasm was universal and only twelve persons were killed the private secretary told popanilla with an air of great complacency that the vraibleusian theatres were the largest in the world popanilla had little doubt of the truth of this information as a long time elapsed before he could even discover the stage he observed that every person in the theatre carried a long black glass which he kept perpetually fixed to his eye to sit in a huge room hotter than a glasshouse in a posture emulating the most sanctified faquir with a throbbing headache a breaking back and twisted legs with a heavy tube held over one eye and the other covered with the unemployed hand is in vraibleusia called a public amusement  the play was by the most famous dramatist that vraibleusia ever produced and certainly when his excellency witnessed the first scenes it was easier to imagine that he was once more in his own sunset isle of fantaisie than in the railroad state of vraibleusia but unfortunately this evening the principal characters and scenes were omitted to make room for a moving panorama which lasted some hours of the chief and most recent vraibleusian victories the audience fought their battles oer again with great fervour during the play one of the inferior actors was supposed to have saluted a female chorussinger with an ardour which was more than theatrical and every lady in the house immediately fainted because as the eternal secretary told popanilla the vraibleusians are the most modest and most moral nation in the world the male part of the audience insisted in indignant terms that the offending performer should immediately be dismissed in a few minutes he appeared upon the stage to make a most humble apology for an offence which he was not conscious of having committed but the most moral and the most modest of nations was implacable and the wretch was expelled having a large family dependent upon his exertions the actor according to a custom prevalent in vraibleusia went immediately and drowned himself in the nearest river then the ballet commenced  it was soon discovered that the chief dancer a celebrated foreigner who had been announced for this evening was absent the uproar was tremendous and it was whispered that the house would be pulled down because as popanilla was informed the vraibleusians are the most particular and the freest people in the world and never will permit themselves to be treated with disrespect the principal chandelier having been destroyed the manager appeared and regretted that signor zephyrino being engaged to dine with a grandee of the first class was unable to fulfil his engagement the house became frantic and the terrified manager sent immediately for the signor the artist after a proper time had elapsed appeared with a napkin round his neck and a fork in his hand with which he stood some moments until the uproar had subsided picking his teeth at length when silence was obtained he told them that he was surprised that the most polished and liberal nation in the world should behave themselves in such a brutal and narrowminded manner he threatened them that he would throw up his engagement immediately and announce to all foreign parts that they were a horde of barbarians then abusing them for a few seconds in round terms be retired amidst the cheerings of the whole house to finish his wine  when the performances were finished the audience rose and joined in chorus on popanilla inquiring the name and nature of this effusion he was told that it was the national air of the isle of fantaisie sung in compliment to himself his excellency shrugged his shoulders and bowed low  the next morning attended by his suite popanilla visited the most considerable public offices and manufactories in hubbabub he was received in all places with the greatest distinction he was invariably welcomed either by the chiefs of the department or the proprietors themselves and a sumptuous collation was prepared for him in every place his excellency evinced the liveliest interest in everything that was pointed out to him and instantaneously perceived that the vraibleusians exceeded the rest of the world in manufactures and public works as much as they did in arms morals modesty philosophy and politics the private secretary being absent upon his postscript popanilla received the most satisfactory information upon all subjects from the marquess himself whenever he addressed any question to his lordship his noble attendant with the greatest politeness begged him to take some refreshment popanilla returned to his hotel with a great admiration of the manner in which refined philosophy in vraibleusia was applied to the common purposes of life and found that he had that morning acquired a general knowledge of the chief arts and sciences eaten some hundred sandwiches and tasted as many bottles of sherry    chapter 12   the most commercial nation in the world was now busily preparing to diffuse the blessings of civilisation and competition throughout the native country of their newlyacquired friend the greatest exporters that ever existed had never been acquainted with such a subject for exportation as the isle of fantaisie there everything was wanted it was not a partial demand which was to be satisfied nor a particular deficiency which was to be supplied but a vast population was thoroughly to be furnished with every article which a vast population must require from the manufacturer of steamengines to the manufacturer of stockings all were alike employed there was no branch of trade in vraibleusia which did not equally rejoice at this new opening for commercial enterprise and which was not equally interested in this new theatre for vraibleusian industry vraibleusian invention vraibleusian activity and above all vraibleusian competition  day and night the whole island was employed in preparing for the great fleet and in huzzaing popanilla when at borne every ten minutes he was obliged to appear in the balcony and then with hand on heart and hat in hand ah that bow that perpetual motion of popularity if a man love ease let him be most unpopular the managers did the impossible to assist and advance the intercourse between the two nations they behaved in a liberal and enlightened manner and a deputation of liberal and enlightened merchants consequently waited upon them with a vote of thanks they issued so many pink shells that the price of the public funds was doubled and affairs arranged so skilfully that money was universally declared to be worth nothing so that every one in the island from the premier down to the mendicant whom the lectureloving skindeep threatened with the bastinado was enabled to participate in some degree in the approaching venture if we should use so dubious a term in speaking of profits so certain  compared with the fantaisian connection the whole commerce of the world appeared to the vraibleusians a retail business all other customers were neglected or discarded and each individual seemed to concentrate his resources to supply the wants of a country where they dance by moonlight live on fruit and sleep on flowers at length the first fleet of five hundred sail laden with wonderful specimens of vraibleusian mechanism and innumerable bales of vraibleusian manufactures articles raw and refined goods dry and damp wholesale and retail silks and woollen cloths cottons cutlery and camlets flannels and ladies albums under waistcoats kid gloves engravings coats cloaks and ottomans lamps and lookingglasses sofas round tables equipages and scentbottles fans and tissueflowers porcelain poetry novels newspapers and cookery books bearsgrease blue pills and bijouterie arms beards poodles pages mustachios courtguides and bonbons music pictures ladies maids scrapbooks buckles boxinggloves guitars and snuffboxes together with a company of operasingers a band of comedians a popular preacher some quacks lecturers artists and literary gentlemen principally sketchbook men quitted one day with a favourable wind and amid the exultation of the inhabitants the port of hubbabub  when his excellency prince popanilla heard of the contents of this stupendous cargo notwithstanding his implicit confidence in the superior genius and useful knowledge of the vraibleusians he could not refrain from expressing a doubt whether in the present undeveloped state of his native land any returns could be made proportionate to so curious and elaborate an importation but whenever he ventured to intimate his opinion to any of the most commercial nation in the world he was only listened to with an incredulous smile which seemed to pity his inexperience or told with an air of profound selfcomplacency that in fantaisie there must be great resources  in the meantime public companies were formed for working the mines colonizing the waste lands and cutting the coral rocks of the indian isle of all which associations popanilla was chosen director by acclamation these however it must be confessed were speculations of a somewhat doubtful nature but the branch bank society of the isle of fantaisie really held out flattering prospects  when the fleet had sailed they gave popanilla a public dinner it was attended by all the principal men in the island and he made a speech which was received in a rather different manner than was his sunset oration by the monarch whom he now represented faintaisie and its accomplished envoy were at the same time the highest and the universal fashion the ladies sang la syrene dressed their hair la mermede and themselves la fantastique which bythebye was not new and the gentlemen wore boaconstrictor cravats and waltzed la mer indiennea title probably suggested by a remembrance of the dangers of the sea  it was soon discovered that without taking into consideration the average annual advantages which would necessarily spring from their new connection the profits which must accrue upon the present expedition alone had already doubled the capital of the island everybody in vraibleusia had either made a fortune or laid the foundation of one the penniless had become prosperous and the principal merchants and manufacturers having realised large capitals retired from business but the colossal fortunes were made by the gentlemen who had assisted the administration in raising the price of the public funds and in managing the issues of the pink shells the effect of this immense increase of the national wealth and of this creation of new and powerful classes of society was speedily felt great moves to the westward were perpetual and a variety of sumptuous squares and streets were immediately run up in that chosen land butlers were at a premium coachmakers never slept cardengravers having exhausted copper had recourse to steel and the demand for arms at the heralds college was so great that even the mystical genius of garter was exhausted and hostile meetings were commenced between the junior members of some ancient families to whom the same crest had been unwittingly apportioned but the seconds interfering they discovered themselves to be relations all the eldest sons were immediately to get into parliament and all the younger ones as quickly into the guards and the simple fantaisian envoy who had the peculiar felicity of taking everything au pied du lettre made a calculation that if these arrangements were duly effected in a short time the vraibleusian representatives would exceed the vraibleusian represented and that there would be at least three officers in the vraibleusian guards to every private judging from the beards and mustachios which now abounded this great result was near at hand with the snub nose which is the characteristic of the millionaires these appendages produce a pleasing effect  when the excitement had a little subsided when their mighty mansions were magnificently furnished when their bright equipages were fairly launched and the due complement of their liveried retainers perfected when in short they had imitated the aristocracy in every point in which wealth could rival blood then the new people discovered with dismay that one thing was yet wanting which treasure could not purchase and which the wit of others could not supplymanner in homely phrase the millionaires did not know how to behave themselves accustomed to the countinghouse the factory or the exchange they looked queer in saloons and said sir when they addressed you and seemed stiff and hard and hot then the solecisms they committed in more formal society oh they were outrageous and a leading article in an eminent journal was actually written upon the subject i dare not write the deeds they did but it was whispered that when they drank wine they filled their glasses to the very brim all this delighted the old class who were as envious of their riches as the new people were emulous of their style  in any other country except vraibleusia persons so situated would have consoled themselves for their disagreeable position by a consciousness that their posterity would not be annoyed by the same deficiencies but the wonderful vraibleusian people resembled no other even in their failings they determined to acquire in a day that which had hitherto been deemed the gradual consequence of tedious education  a society for the diffusion of fashionable knowledge was announced the millionaires looked triumphantly mysterious the aristocrats quizzed the object of the society is intimated by its title and the method by which its institutors proposed to attain this object was the periodical publication of pamphlets under the superintendence of a competent committee the first treatise appeared its subject was nonchalance it instructed its students ever to appear inattentive in the society of men and heartless when they conversed with women it taught them not to understand a man if he were witty to misunderstand him if he were eloquent to yawn or stare if he chanced to elevate his voice or presumed to ruffle the placidity of the social calm by addressing his fellowcreatures with teeth unparted excellence was never to be recognised but only disparaged with a look an opinion or a sentiment and the nonchalant was lost for ever for these he was to substitute a smile like a damp sunbeam a moderate curl of the upper lip and the allspeaking and perpetual shrug of the shoulders by a skilful management of these qualities it was shown to be easy to ruin anothers reputation and ensure your own without ever opening your mouth to woman this exquisite treatise said much in few words listlessness listlessness listlessness was the edict by which the most beautiful works of nature were to be regulated who are only truly charming when they make us feel and feel themselves listlessness listlessness listlessness for when you choose not to be listless the contrast is so striking that the triumph must be complete  the treatise said much more which i shall omit it forgot however to remark that this vaunted nonchalance may be the offspring of the most contemptible and the most odious of passions and that while it may be exceedingly refined to appear uninterested when others are interested to witness excellence without emotion and to listen to genius without animation the heart of the insensible may as often be inflamed by envy as inspired by fashion  dissertations on leaving cards on cutting intimate friends on cravats on dinner courses on poor relations on bores on lions were announced as speedily to appear in the meantime the essay on nonchalance produced the best effects a cidevant stockbroker cut a duke dead at his club the day after its publication and his daughter yawned while his graces eldest son the marquess made her an offer as she was singing di tanti palpiti the aristocrats got a little frightened and when an eminent hopmerchant and his lady had asked a dozen countesses to dinner and forgot to be at home to receive them the old class left off quizzing  the pamphlets however continued issuing forth and the new people advanced at a rate which was awful they actually began to originate some ideas of their own and there was a whisper among the leaders of voting the aristocrats oldfashioned the diffusion society now caused these exalted personages great anxiety and uneasiness they argued that fashion was a relative quality that it was quite impossible and not to be expected that all people were to aspire to be fashionable that it was not in the nature of things and that if it were society could not exist that the more their imitators advanced the more they should baffle their imitations that a first and fashion able class was a necessary consequence of the organisation of man and that a line of demarcation would for ever be drawn between them and the other islanders the warmth and eagerness with which they maintained and promulgated their opinions might have tempted however an impartial person to suspect that they secretly entertained some doubts of their truth and soundness  on the other hand the other party maintained that fashion was a positive quality that the moment a person obtained a certain degree of refinement he or she became in fact and essentially fashionable that the views of the old class were unphilosophical and illiberal and unworthy of an enlightened age that men were equal and that everything is open to everybody and that when we take into consideration the nature of man the origin of society and a few other things and duly consider the constant inclination and progression towards perfection which mankind evince there was no reason why in the course of time the whole nation should not go to almacks on the same night  at this moment of doubt and dispute the government of vraibleusia with that spirit of conciliation and liberality and that perfect wisdom for which it had been long celebrated caring very little for the old class whose interest it well knew was to support it and being exceedingly desirous of engaging the affections of the new race declared in their favour and acting upon that sublime scale of measures for which this great nation has always been so famous the statue issued an edict that a new literature should be invented in order at once to complete the education of the millionaires and the triumph of the romantic over the classic school of manners  the most eminent writers were as usual in the pay of the government and burlington a tale of fashionable life in three volumes post octavo was sent forth two or three similar works bearing titles equally euphonious and aristocratic were published daily and so exquisite was the style of these productions so naturally artificial the construction of their plots and so admirably inventive the conception of their characters that many who had been repulsed by the somewhat abstract matter and arid style of the treatises seduced by the interest of a story and by the dazzling delicacies of a charming style really now picked up a considerable quantity of very useful knowledge so that when the delighted students had eaten some fifty or sixty imaginary dinners in my lords diningroom and whirled some fifty or sixty imaginary waltzes in my ladys dancingroom there was scarcely a brute left among the whole millionaires but what produced the most beneficial effects on the new people and excited the greatest indignation and despair among the old class were some volumes which the government with shocking machiavelism bribed some needy scions of nobility to scribble and which revealed certain secrets vainly believed to be quite sacred and inviolable    chapter 13   shortly after the sailing of the great fleet the private secretary engaged in a speculation which was rather more successful than any one contained in his pamphlet on the present state of the western republics  one morning as he and popanilla were walking on a quay and deliberating on the clauses of the projected commercial treaty between vraibleusia and fantaisie the secretary suddenly stopped as if he had seen his fathers ghost or lost the thread of his argument and asked popanilla with an air of suppressed agitation whether he observed anything in the distance popanilla who like all savages was longsighted applying to his eye the glass which in conformity to the custom of the country he always wore round his neck confessed that he saw nothing the secretary who had never unfixed his glass nor moved a step since he asked the question at length by pointing with his finger attracted popanillas attention to what his excellency conceived to be a porpoise bobbing up and down in the waves the secretary however was not of the same opinion as the ambassador he was not very communicative indeed as to his own opinion upon this grave subject but he talked of making farther observations when the tide went down and was so listless abstracted and absent during the rest of their conversation that it soon ceased and they speedily parted   the next day when popanilla read the morning papers a feat which he regularly performed for spelling the newspaper was quite delicious to one who had so recently learned to read he found that they spoke of nothing but of the discovery of a new island information of which had been received by the government only the preceding night the fantaisian ambassador turned quite pale and for the first time in his life experienced the passion of jealousy the greeneyed monster so called from only being experienced by greenhorns already the prominent state he represented seemed to retire to the background he did not doubt that the vraibleusians were the most capricious as well as the most commercial nation in the world his reign was evidently over the new island would send forth a prince still more popular his allowance of pink shells would be gradually reduced and finally withdrawn his doubts also as to the success of the recent expedition to fantaisie began to revive his rising reminiscences of his native land which with the joint assistance of popularity and philosophy he had hitherto succeeded in stifling were indeed awkward he could not conceive his mistress with a page and a poodle he feared much that the cargo was not well assorted popanilla determined to inquire after his canoe  his courage however was greatly reassured when on reading the second edition he learned that the new island was not of considerable size though most eligibly situate and moreover that it was perfectly void of inhabitants when the third edition was published he found to his surprise that the private secretary was the discoverer of this opposition island this puzzled the plenipotentiary greatly he read on he found that this acquisition upon which all vraibleusia was congratulated in such glowing terms by all its journals actually produced nothing his excellency began to breathe another paragraph and he found that the rival island was a rock he remembered the porpoise of yesterday the island certainly could not be very large even at low water popanilla once more felt like a prince he defied all the discoverers that could ever exist he thought of the great resources of the great country he represented with proud satisfaction he waited with easy confidence the return of the fleet which had carried out the most judicious assortment with which he had ever been acquainted to the readiest market of which he had any knowledge he had no doubt his mistress would look most charmingly in a barege popanilla determined to present his canoe to the national museum  although his excellency had been in the highest state of astonishment daring his whole mission to vraibleusia it must be confessed now that he understood his companions question of yesterday he particularly stared his wonder was not decreased in the evening when the government gazette appeared it contained an order for the immediate fortification of the new island by the most skilful engineers without estimates a strong garrison was instantly embarked a governor and a deputygovernor and storekeepers more plentiful than stores were to accompany them the private secretary went out as president of council a bishop was promised and a complete court of judicature chancery kings bench common pleas and exchequer were to be off the next week it is only due to the characters of courtiers who are so often reproached with ingratitude to their patrons to record that the private secretary in the most delicate manner placed at the disposal of his former employer the marquess moustache the important office of agent for the indemnity claims of the original inhabitants of the island the post being a sinecure the income being considerable and local attendance being unnecessary the noble lord in a manner equally delicate appointed himself  upon what system one day inquired that unwearied political student the fantaisian ambassador of his old friend skindeep does your government surround a small rock in the middle of the sea with fortifications and cram it full of clerks soldiers lawyers and priests  why really your excellency i am the last man in the world to answer questions but i believe we call it the colonial system  before the president and governor and deputygovernor and storekeepers had embarked the vraibleusian journals who thought that the public had been satiated with congratulations on the colonial system detected that the present colony was a job their reasoning was so convincing and their denunciations so impressive that the managers got frightened and cut off one of the deputystorekeepers the president of council now got more frightened than the managers he was one of those men who think that the world can be saved by writing a pamphlet a pamphlet accordingly appeared upon the subject of the new colony the writer showed that the debateable land was the most valuable acquisition ever attained by a nation famous for their acquisitions that there was a spring of water in the middle of the rock of a remarkable freshness and which was never dry except during the summer and the earlier winter months that all our outwardbound ships would experience infinite benefit from this fresh water that the scurvy would therefore disappear from the service and that the naval victories which the vraibleusians would gain in future wars would consequently be occasioned by the present colony no one could mistake the felicitous reasoning of the author of the present state of the western republics  about this time popanilla fell ill he lost his appetite and his spirits and his digestion was sadly disordered his friends endeavoured to console him by telling him that dyspepsia was the national disease of vraibleusia that its connection with civil and religious liberty was indissoluble that every man woman and child above fifteen in the island was a martyr to it that it was occasioned by their rapid mode of despatching their meals which again was occasioned by the little time which the most active nation in the world could afford to bestow upon such a losing business as eating  all this was no consolation to a man who had lost his appetite and so popanilla sent for a gentleman who he was told was the most eminent physician in the island the most eminent physician when he arrived would not listen to a single syllable that his patient wished to address to him he told popanilla that his disorder was decidedly liver that it was occasioned by his eating his meat before his bread instead of after it and drinking at the end of the first course instead of the beginning of the second that he had only to correct these ruinous habits and that he would then regain his tone  popanilla observed the instructions of the eminent physician to the very letter he invariably eat his bread before his meat and watched the placing of the first dish of the second course upon the table ere he ventured to refresh himself with any liquid at the end of a week he was infinitely worse  he now called in a gentleman who was recommended to him as the most celebrated practitioner in all vraibleusia the most celebrated practitioner listened with great attention to every particular that his patient had to state but never condescended to open his own mouth popanilla was delighted and revenged himself for the irritability of the eminent physician after two more visits the most celebrated practitioner told popanilla that his disorder was unquestionably nervous that he had overexcited himself by talking too much that in future he must count five between each word he uttered never ask any questions and avoid society that is never stay at an evening party on any consideration later than twentytwo minutes past two and never be induced by any persuasion to dine out more than once on the same day the most celebrated practitioner added that he had only to observe these regulations and that he would speedily recover his energy  popanilla never asked a question for a whole week and skindeep never knew him more delightful he not only counted five but ten between every word he uttered and determining that his cure should not be delayed whenever he had nobody to speak to he continued counting in a few days this solitary computation brought on a slow fever  he now determined to have a consultation between the most eminent physician and the most celebrated practitioner it was delightful to witness the meeting of these great men not a shade of jealousy dimmed the sunshine of their countenances after a consultation they agreed that popanillas disorder was neither liver nor nervous but mind that he had done too much that he had overworked his brain that he must take more exercise that he must breathe more air that he must have relaxation that he must have a change of scene  where shall i go was the first question which popanilla had sent forth for a fortnight and it was addressed to skindeep  really your excellency i am the last man in the world to answer questions but the place which is generally frequented by us when we are suffering from your complaint is blunderland  well then to blunderland let us go  shortly before popanillas illness he had been elected a member of the vraibleusian horticultural society and one evening he had endeavoured to amuse himself by reading the following chapter on fruit    chapter 14   that a taste for fruit is inherent in man is an opinion which is sanctioned by the conduct of man in all ages and in all countries while some nations have considered it profanation or pollution to nourish themselves with flesh or solace themselves with fish while almost every member of the animal creation has in turn been considered either sacred or unclean mankind in all climes and in all countries the hindoo and the hebrew the egyptian and the greek the roman and the frank have in some degree made good their boastful claim to reason by universally feeding upon those delightful productions of nature which are nourished with the dews of heaven and which live for ever in its breath  and indeed when we consider how exceedingly refreshing at all times is the flavour of fruit how very natural and in a manner born in him is mans inclination for it how little it is calculated to pall upon his senses and how conducive when not eaten to excess it is to his health as well as to his pleasure we must not be surprised that a conviction of its excellence should have been one of those few subjects on which men have never disagreed  that some countries are more favoured in their fruit than others is a fact so notorious that its notice is unnecessary but we are not therefore to suppose that their appetite for it is more keen than the appetite of other nations for their fruit who live in less genial climes indeed if we were not led to believe that all nations are inspired by an equal love for this production it might occasionally be suspected that some of those nations who are least skilful as horticulturists evince a greater passion for their inferior growths than more fortunate people for their choicer produce the effects of bad fruit however upon the constitution and consequently upon the national character are so injurious that every liberal man must regret that any people either from ignorance or obligation should be forced to have recourse to anything so fatal and must feel that it is the duty of everyone who professes to be a philanthropist to propagate and encourage a taste for good fruit throughout all countries of the globe  a vast number of centuries before popanilla had the fortune to lose his mistresss lock of hair and consequently to become an ambassador to vraibleusia the inhabitants of that island then scarcely more civilised than their new allies of fantaisie were at present suffered very considerably from the trash which they devoured from that innate taste for fruit already noticed in fact although there are antiquaries who pretend that the vraibleusians possessed some of the species of wild plums and apples even at that early period the majority of inquirers are disposed to believe that their desserts were solely confined to the wildest berries horsechestnuts and acorns  a tradition runs that while they were committing these abominations a ship one of the first ships that had ever touched at the island arrived at the present port of hubbabub then a spacious and shipless bay the master of the vessel on being brought before the king for the story i am recording happened long before the construction of the miraculous statue presented with his right hand to his majesty a small pyramidal substance of a golden hue which seemed to spring out of green and purple leaves his majesty did not exactly understand the intention of this ceremony but of course like a true legitimate construed it into a symbol of homage no sooner had the king brought the unknown substance near to his eyes with the intention of scrutinising its nature than the fragrance was so delightful that by mistake he applied it to his mouth the king only took one mouthful and then with a cry of rapture instantly handed the delicacy to his favourite who to the great mortification of the secretary of state finished it the stranger however immediately supplied the surrounding courtiers from a basket which was slung on his left arm and no sooner had they all tasted his gift than they fell upon their knees to worship him vowing that the distributor of such delight must be more than man if this avowal be considered absurd and extraordinary in this present age of philosophy we must not forget to make due allowance for the palates of individuals who having been so long accustomed merely to horsechestnuts and acorns suddenly for the first time in their lives tasted pineapple  the stranger with an air of great humility disclaimed their proffered adoration and told them that far from being superior to common mortals he was on the contrary one of the lowliest of the human race in fact he did not wish to conceal it in spite of his vessel and his attendants he was merely a marketgardener on a great scale this beautiful fruit he had recently discovered in the east to which quarter of the world he annually travelled in order to obtain a sufficient quantity to supply the great western hemisphere of which he himself was a native accident had driven him with one of his ships into the island of vraibleusia and as the islanders appeared to be pleased with his cargo he said that he should have great pleasure in supplying them at present and receiving their orders for the future  the proposition was greeted with enthusiasm the king immediately entered into a contract with the marketgardener on his own terms the sale or cultivation or even the eating of all other fruits was declared hightreason and pineapple for weighty reasons duly recited in the royal proclamation announced as the established fruit of the realm the cargo under the superintendence of some of the most trusty of the crew was unshipped for the immediate supply of the island and the merchant and his customers parted mutually delighted and mutually profited  time flew on the civilisation of vraibleusia was progressive as civilisation always is and the taste for pineapples ever on the increase as the taste for pineapples ever should be the supply was regular and excellent the prices reasonable and the tradesmen civil they of course had not failed to advance in fair proportion with the national prosperity their numbers had much increased as well as their customers fresh agents arrived with every fresh cargo they had long quitted the stalls with which they had been contented on their first settlement in the island and now were the dapper owners of neat depots in all parts of the kingdom where depots could find customers  a few more centuries and affairs began to change all that i have related as matter of fact and which certainly is not better authenticated than many other things that happened two or three thousand years ago which however the most sceptical will not presume to maintain did not take place was treated as the most idle and ridiculous fable by the dealers in pineapples themselves they said that they knew nothing about a marketgardener that they were and had always been the subjects of the greatest prince in the world compared with whom all other crowned heads ranked merely as subjects did with their immediate sovereigns this prince they said lived in the most delicious region in the world and the fruit which they imported could only be procured from his private gardens where it sprang from one of the trees that had bloomed in the gardens of the hesperides the vraibleusians were at first a little surprised at this information but the old tradition of the marketgardener was certainly an improbable one and the excellence of the fruit and the importance assumed by those who supplied it were deemed exceedingly good evidence of the truth of the present story when the dealers had repeated their new tale for a certain number of years there was not an individual in the island who in the slightest degree suspected its veracity one more century and no person had ever heard that any suspicions had ever existed  the immediate agents of the prince of the world could of course be no common personages and the servants of the gardener who some centuries before had meekly disclaimed the proffered reverence of his delighted customers now insisted upon constant adoration from every eater of pineapples in the island in spite however of the arrogance of the dealers of their refusal to be responsible to the laws of the country in which they lived and of the universal precedence which on all occasions was claimed even by the shopboys so decided was the taste which the vraibleusians had acquired for pineapples that there is little doubt that had the dealers in this delicious fruit been contented with the respect and influence and profit which were the consequences of their vocation the vraibleusians would never have presumed to have grumbled at their arrogance or to have questioned their privileges but the agents wearied of the limited sphere to which their exertions were confined and encouraged by the success which every new claim and pretence on their part invariably experienced began to evince an inclination to interfere in other affairs besides those of fruit and even expressed their willingness to undertake no less an office than the management of the statue  a century or two were solely occupied by conflicts occasioned by the unreasonable ambition of these dealers in pineapples such great political effects could be produced by men apparently so unconnected with politics as marketgardeners ever supported by the lower ranks whom they supplied with fruit of the most exquisite flavour without charge they were for a long time often the successful opponents always the formidable adversaries of the vraibleusian aristocracy who were the objects of their envy and the victims of their rapaciousness the government at last by a vigorous effort triumphed in spite of the wishes of the majority of the nation the whole of the dealers were one day expelled the island and the managers of the statue immediately took possession of their establishments  by distributing the stock of fruit which was on hand liberally the government for a short time reconciled the people to the chance but as their warehouses became daily less furnished they were daily reminded that unless some system were soon adopted the islanders must be deprived of a luxury to which they had been so long accustomed that its indulgence had in fact become a second nature no one of the managers had the hardihood to propose a recurrence to horsechestnuts pride and fear alike forbade a return to their old purveyor other fruits there were which in spite of the contract with the marketgardener had at various times been secretly introduced into the island but they had never greatly flourished and the statue was loth to recommend to the notice of his subjects productions an indulgence in which through the instigation of the recentlyexpelled agents it had so often denounced as detrimental to the health and had so often discouraged by the severest punishments  at this difficult and delicate crisis when even expedients seemed exhausted and statesmen were at fault the genius of an individual offered a substitute an inventive mind discovered the power of propagating suckers the expelled dealers had either been ignorant of this power or had concealed their knowledge of it they ever maintained that it was impossible for pineapples to grow except in one spot and that the whole earth must be supplied from the gardens of the palace of the prince of the world now the vraibleusians were flattered with the patriotic fancy of eating pineapples of a homegrowth and the blessed fortune of that nation which did not depend for their supply of fruit upon a foreign country was eagerly expatiated on secure from extortion and independent of caprice the vraibleusians were no longer to be insulted by the presence of foreigners who while they violated their laws with impunity referred the vraibleusians when injured and complaining to a foreign master  no doubt this appeal to the patriotism and the common sense and the vanity of the nation would have been successful had not the produce of the suckers been both inferior in size and deficient in flavour the vraibleusians tasted and shook their heads the supply too was as imperfect as the article for the government gardeners were but sorry horticulturists and were ever making experiments and alterations in their modes of culture the article was scarce though the law had decreed it universal and the vraibleusians were obliged to feed upon fruit which they considered at the same time both poor and expensive they protested as strongly against the present system as its promulgators had protested against the former one and they revenged themselves for their grievances by breaking the shopwindows  as any result was preferable in the view of the statue to the reintroduction of foreign fruit and foreign agents and as the managers considered it highly important that an indissoluble connection should in future exist between the government and so influential and profitable a branch of trade they determined to adopt the most vigorous measures to infuse a taste for suckers in the discontented populace but the eating of fruit being clearly a matter of taste it is evidently a habit which should rather be encouraged by a plentiful supply of exquisite produce than enforced by the introduction of burning and bayonets the consequences of the strong measures of the government were universal discontent and partial rebellion the islanders foolishly ascribing the miseries which they endured not so much to the folly of the government as to the particular fruit through which the dissensions had originated began to entertain a disgust for pineapples altogether and to sicken at the very mention of that production which had once occasioned them so much pleasure and which had once commanded such decided admiration they universally agreed that there were many other fruits in the world besides pineapple which had been too long neglected one dilated on the rich flavour of melon another panegyrised pumpkin and offered to make up by quantity for any slight deficiency in gout cherries were not without their advocates strawberries were not forgotten one maintained that the fig had been pointed out for the established fruit of all countries while another asked with a reeling eye whether they need go far to seek when a god had condescended to preside over the grape in short there was not a fruit which flourishes that did not find its votaries strange to say another foreign product imported from a neighbouring country famous for its barrenness counted the most and the fruit faction which chiefly frightened the vraibleusian government was an acid set who crammed themselves with crabapples  it was this party which first seriously and practically conceived the idea of utterly abolishing the ancient custom of eating pineapples while they themselves professed to devour no other fruit save crabs they at the same time preached the doctrine of an universal fruit toleration which they showed would be the necessary and natural consequence of the destruction of the old monopoly influenced by these representations the great body of the people openly joined the crabapple men in their open attacks the minority who still retained a taste for pines did not yield without an arduous though ineffectual struggle during the riots occasioned by this rebellion the hall of audience was broken open and the miraculous statue which was reputed to have a great passion for pineapples dashed to the ground the managers were either slain or disappeared the whole affairs of the kingdom were conducted by a body called the fruit committee and thus a total revolution of the government of vraibleusia was occasioned by the prohibition of foreign pineapples what an argument in favour of freetrade  every fruit except that one which had so recently been supported by the influence of authority and the terrors of law might now be seen and devoured in the streets of hubbabub in one corner men were sucking oranges as if they had lived their whole lives on salt in another stuffing pumpkin like cannibals at their first child here one took in at a mouthful a bunch of grapes from which might have been pressed a good quart another was lying on the ground from a surfeit of mulberries the effect of this irrational excess will be conceived by the judicious reader calcutta itself never suffered from a cholera morbus half so fearful thousands were dying were i thucydides or boccaccio i would write pages on this plague the commonwealth itself must soon have yielded its ghost for all order had ceased throughout the island ever since they had deserted pineapples there was no government anarchy alone was perfect of the fruit committee many of the members were dead or dying and the rest were robbing orchards  at this moment of disorganisation and dismay a stout soldier one of the crabapple faction who had possessed sufficient command over himself in spite of the seeming voracity of his appetite not to indulge to a dangerous excess made his way one morning into the old hall of audience and there groping about succeeded in finding the golden head of the statue which placing on the hilt of his sword the point of which he had stuck in the pedestal he announced to the city that he had discovered the secret of conversing with this wonderful piece of mechanism and that in future he would take care of the health and fortune of the state  there were some who thought it rather strange that the headpiece should possess the power of resuming its old functions although deprived of the aid of the body which contained the greater portion of the machinery as it was evidently well supported by the sword they were not surprised that it should stand without the use of its legs but the stout soldier was the only one in the island who enjoyed the blessing of health he was fresh vigorous and vigilant they exhausted weak and careless of everything except cure he soon took measures for the prevention of future mischief and for the cure of the present and when his fellowislanders had recovered some were grateful others fearful and all obedient  so long as the stout soldier lived no dissensions on the subject of fruit ever broke out although he himself never interfered in the sale of the article and never attempted to create another monopoly still by his influence and authority he prevented any excess being occasioned by the fruit toleration which was enjoyed indeed the vraibleusians themselves had suffered so severely from their late indiscretions that such excesses were not likely again to occur people began to discover that it was not quite so easy a thing as they had imagined for every man to be his own fruiterer and that gardening was a craft which like others required great study long practice and early experience unable to supply themselves the majority became the victims of quack traders they sickened of spongy apricots and foxy pears and withered plums and blighted apples and tasteless berries they at length suspected that a nation might fare better if its race of fruiterers were overseen and supported by the state if their skill and their market were alike secured although no longer being tempted to suffer from a surfeit the health of the islanders had consequently recovered this was after all but a negative blessing and they sadly missed a luxury once so reasonable and so refreshing they sighed for an established fruit and a protected race of cultivators but the stout soldier was so sworn an enemy to any government fruit and so decided an admirer of the least delightful that the people having no desire of being forced to cat crabapples only longed for more delicious food in silence  at length the stout soldier died and on the night of his death the sword which had so long supported the pretended government snapped in twain no arrangement existed for carrying on the administration of affairs the mastermind was gone without having imported the secret of conversing with the golden head to any successor the people assembled in agitated crowds each knew his neighbours thoughts without their being declared all smacked their lips and a cry for pineapples rent the skies  at this moment the aboriginal inhabitant appeared and announced that in examining the old hall of audience which had been long locked up he had discovered in a corner where they had been flung by the stout soldier when he stole away the head the remaining portions of the statue that they were quite uninjured and that on fixing the head once more upon them and winding up the works he was delighted to find that this great work of his ancestor under whose superintendence the nation had so flourished resumed all its ancient functions the people were in a state of mind for a miracle and they hailed the joyful wonder with shouts of triumph the state was placed under the provisional care of the aboriginal all arrangements for its superintendence were left to his discretion and its advice was instantly to be taken upon that subject which at present was nearest the peoples hearts  but that subject was encompassed with difficulties pineapples could only be again procured by an application to the prince of the world whose connection they had rejected and by an introduction into the island of those foreign agents who now convinced that the vraibleusians could not exist without their presence would be more arrogant and ambitious and turbulent than ever indeed the aboriginal feared that the management of the statue would be the sine qua non of negotiation with the prince if this were granted it was clear that vraibleusia must in future only rank as a dependent state of a foreign power since the direction of the whole island would actually be at the will of the supplier of pineapples ah this mysterious taste for fruit in politics it has often occasioned infinite embarrassment  at this critical moment the aboriginal received information that although the eating of pineapples had been utterly abolished and although it was generally supposed that a specimen of this fruit had long ceased to exist in the country nevertheless a body of persons chiefly consisting of the descendants of the government gardeners who had succeeded the foreign agents and who had never lost their taste for this preeminent fruit had long been in the habit of secretly raising for their private eating pineapples from the produce of those suckers which had originally excited such odium and occasioned such misfortunes long practice they said and infinite study had so perfected them in this art that they now succeeded in producing pineapples which both for size and flavour were not inferior to the boasted produce of a foreign clime their specimens verified their assertion and the whole nation were invited to an instant trial the long interval which had elapsed since any man had enjoyed a treat so agreeable lent perhaps an additional flavour to that which was really excellent and so enraptured and enthusiastic were the great majority of the people that the propagators of suckers would have had no difficulty had they pushed the point in procuring as favourable and exclusive a contract as the marketgardener of ancient days  but the aboriginal and his advisers were wisely mindful that the passions of a people are not arguments for legislation and they felt conscious that when the first enthusiasm had subsided and when their appetites were somewhat satisfied the discontented voices of many who had been long used to other fruits would be recognised even amidst the shouts of the majority they therefore greatly qualified the contract between the nation and the present fruiterers an universal toleration of fruit was allowed but no man was to take office under government or enter the services or in any way become connected with the court who was not supplied from the government depots  since this happy restoration pineapple has remained the established fruit of the island of vraibleusia and it must be confessed has been found wonderfully conducive to the health and happiness of the islanders some sectarians still remain obstinate or tasteless enough to prefer pumpkin or gorge the most acid apples or chew the commonest pears but they form a slight minority which will gradually altogether disappear the votaries of pineapple pretend to observe the characteristic effect which such food produces upon the feeders they denounce them as stupid sour and vulgar  but while notwithstanding an universal toleration such an unanimity of taste apparently prevails throughout the island as if fruit were a subject of such peculiar nicety that difference of opinion must necessarily rise among men great fruit factions even now prevail in vraibleusia and what is more extraordinary prevail even among the admirers of pineapples themselves of these the most important is a sect which professes to discover a natural deficiency not only in all other fruits but even in the finest pineapples fruit they maintain should never be eaten in the state in which nature yields it to man and they consequently are indefatigable in prevailing upon the less discriminating part of mankind to heighten the flavour of their pineapples with ginger or even with pepper although they profess to adopt these stimulants from the great admiration which they entertain for a high flavour there are nevertheless some less ardent people who suspect that they rather have recourse to them from the weakness of their digestion    chapter 15   as his excellency prince popanilla really could not think of being annoyed by the attentions of the mob during his visit to blunderland he travelled quite in a quiet way under the name of the chevalier de fantaisie and was accompanied only by skindeep and two attendants as blunderland was one of the islands of the vraibleusian archipelago they arrived there after the sail of a few hours  the country was so beautiful that the chevalier was almost reminded of fantaisie green meadows and flourishing trees made him remember the railroads and canals of vraibleusia without regret or with disgust which is much the same the women were angelic which is the highest praise and the men the most lighthearted merry obliging entertaining fellows that he had met with in the whole course of his life oh it was delicious  after an hours dashing drive he arrived at a city which had he not seen hubbabub he should have imagined was one of the most considerable in the world but compared with the vraibleusian capital it was a street  shortly after his arrival according to the custom of the place popanilla joined the public table of his hotel at dinner he was rather surprised that instead of knives and forks being laid for the convenience of the guests the plates were flanked by daggers and pistols as popanilla now made a point of never asking a question of skindeep he addressed himself for information to his other neighbour one of the civilest most hospitable and joyous rogues that ever set a table in a roar on popanilla inquiring the reason of their using these singular instruments his neighbour with an air of great astonishment confessed his ignorance of any people ever using any other and in his turn asked how they could possibly eat their dinner without the chevalier was puzzled but he was now too well bred ever to pursue an inquiry  popanilla being thirsty helped himself to a goblet of water which was at hand it was the most delightful water that he ever tasted in a few minutes he found that he was a little dizzy and supposing this megrim to be occasioned by the heat of the room he took another draught of water to recover himself  as his neighbour was telling him an excellent joke a man entered the room and shot the joker through the head the opposite guest immediately charged his pistol with effect and revenged the loss a party of men well armed now rushed in and a brisk conflict immediately ensued popanilla who was very dizzy was fortunately pushed under the table when the firing and slashing had ceased he ventured to crawl out he found that the assailants had been beaten off though unfortunately with the total loss of all the guests who lay lifeless about the room even the prudent skindeep who had sought refuge in a closet had lost his nose which was a pity because although this gentleman had never been in blunderland before he had passed his whole life in maintaining that the accounts of the disturbances in that country were greatly exaggerated popanilla rang the bell and the waiters who were remarkably attentive swept away the dead bodies and brought him a roasted potato for supper  the chevalier soon retired to rest he found at the side of his bed a blunderbuss a cutlass and a pike and he was directed to secure the door of his chamber with a great chain and a massy iron bar feeling great confidence in his securities although he was quite ignorant of the cause of alarm and very much exhausted with the bustle of the day he enjoyed sounder sleep than had refreshed him for many weeks he was awakened in the middle of the night by a loud knocking at his door he immediately seized his blunderbuss but recognising the voice of his own valet he only took his pike his valet told him to unbar without loss of time for the house had been set on fire popanilla immediately made his escape but found himself surrounded by the incendiaries he gave himself up for lost when a sudden charge of cavalry brought him off in triumph he was convinced of the utility of lighthorse  the military had arrived with such despatch that the fire was the least effective that had wakened the house for the whole week it was soon extinguished and popanilla again retired to his bedroom not forgetting his bar and his chain  in the morning popanilla was roused by his landlord who told him that a large party was about to partake of the pleasures of the chase and most politely inquired whether he would like to join them popanilla assented and after having eaten an excellent breakfast and received a favourable bulletin of skindeeps wound he mounted his horse the party was numerous and well armed popanilla inquired of a huntsman what sport they generally followed in blunderland according to the custom of this country where they never give a direct answer the huntsman said that he did not know that there was any other sport but one popanilla thought him a brute and dug his spurs into his horse  they went off at a fine rate and the exercise was most exhilarating in a short time as they were cantering along a defile they received a sharp fire from each side which rather reduced their numbers but they revenged themselves for this loss when they regained the plain where they burnt two villages slew two or three hundred head of women and bagged children without number on their return home to dinner they chased a small body of men over a heath for nearly two hours which afforded good sport but they did not succeed in running them down as they themselves were in turn chased by another party altogether the day was not deficient in interest and popanilla found in the evening his powers of digestion improved  after passing his days in this manner for about a fortnight popanilla perfectly recovered from his dyspepsia and skindeeps wound having now healed he retired with regret from this healthy climate he took advantage of the leisure moment which was afforded during the sail to inquire the reason of the disturbed state of this interesting country he was told that it was in consequence of the majority of the inhabitants persisting in importing their own pineapples    chapter 16   on his return to hubbabub the chevalier de fantaisie found the city in the greatest confusion the military were marshalled in all directions the streets were lined with fieldpieces no one was abroad all the shops were shut although not a single vehicle was visible popanillas progress was slow from the quantity of shells of all kinds which choked up the public way when he arrived at his hotel he found that all the windows were broken he entered and his landlord immediately presented him with his bill as the landlord was pressing and as popanilla wished for an opportunity of showing his confidence in skindeeps friendship he requested him to pay the amount skindeep sent a messenger immediately to his banker deeming an ambassador almost as good security as a nation which we all know to be the very best  this little arrangement being concluded the landlord resumed his usual civility he informed the travellers that the whole island was in a state of the greatest commotion and that martial law universally prevailed he said that this disturbance was occasioned by the return of the expedition destined to the isle of fantaisie it appeared from his account that after sailing about from new guinea to new holland the expedition had been utterly unable not only to reach their new customers but even to obtain the slightest intelligence of their locality no such place as fantaisie was known at ceylon sumatra gave information equally unsatisfactory java shook its head celebes conceived the inquirers were jesting the philippine isles offered to accommodate them with spices but could assist them in no other way had it not been too hot at borneo they would have fairly laughed outright the maldives and the moluccas the luccadives and the andamans were nearly as impertinent the five hundred ships and the judiciouslyassorted cargo were therefore under the necessity of returning home  no sooner however had they reached vraibleusia than the markets were immediately glutted with the unsold goods all the manufacturers who had been working day and night in preparing for the next expedition were instantly thrown out of employ a run commenced on the government bank that institution perceived too late that the issues of pink shells had been too unrestricted as the emperor of the east had all the gold the government bank only protected itself from failure by bayoneting its creditors the manufacturers who were starving consoled themselves for the absence of food by breaking all the windows in the country with the discarded shells every tradesman failed the shipping interest advertised two or three fleets for firewood riots were universal the aboriginal was attacked on all sides and made so stout a resistance and broke so many cudgels on the backs of his assailants that it was supposed he would be finally exhausted by his own exertions the public funds sunk ten per cent daily all the millionaires crashed in a word dismay disorganisation despair pervaded in all directions the wisest the greatest and the richest nation in the world the master of the hotel added with an air of becoming embarrassment that had not his excellency been fortunately absent he probably would not have had the pleasure of detailing to him this little narrative that he had often been inquired for by the populace at his old balcony and that a crowd had perpetually surrounded the house till within the last day when a report had got about that his excellency had turned into steam and disappeared he added that caricatures of his highness might be procured in any shop and his account of his voyage obtained at less than halfprice  ah said popanilla in a tone of great anguish and all this from losing a lock of hair  at this moment the messenger whom skindeep had despatched returned and informed him with great regret that his banker to whom he had entrusted his whole fortune had been so unlucky as to stop payment during his absence it was expected however that when his stud was sold a respectable dividend might be realised this was the personage of prepossessing appearance who had presented popanilla with a perpetual ticket to his picture gallery on examining the bankers accounts it was discovered that his chief loss had been incurred by supporting that competition establishment where purses were bought full of crowns  in spite of his own misfortunes popanilla hastened to console his friend he explained to him that things were not quite so bad as they appeared that society consisted of two classes those who laboured and those who paid the labourers that each class was equally useful because if there were none to pay the labourers would not be remunerated and if there were none to labour the payers would not be accommodated that skindeep might still rank in one of these classes that he might therefore still be a useful member of society that if he were useful he must therefore be good and that if he were good he must therefore be happy because happiness is the consequence of assisting the beneficial development of the ameliorating principles of the social action  as he was speaking two gentlemen in blue with red waistcoats entered the chamber and seized popanilla by the collar the vraibleusian government which is so famous for its interpretation of national law had arrested the ambassador for high treason    chapter 17   a prison conveyed the most lugubrious ideas to the mind of the unhappy plenipotentiary and shut up in a hackneycoach with a man on each side of him with a most gloomy conceptions of overwhelming fetters black bread and green water he arrived at the principal gaol in hubbabub he was ushered into an elegantly furnished apartment with french sash windows and a piano its lofty walls were entirely hung with a fanciful paper which represented a tuscan vineyard the ceiling was covered with sky and clouds roses were in abundance and the windows though well secured excited no jarring associations in the mind of the individual they illumined protected as they were by polished bars of cut steel this retreat had been fitted up by a poetical politician who had recently been confined for declaring that the statue was an old idol originally imported from the sandwich isles taking up a brilliantly bound volume which reposed upon a rosewood table popanilla recited aloud a sonnet to liberty but the account given of the goddess by the bard was so confused and he seemed so little acquainted with his subject that the reader began to suspect it was an effusion of the gaoler  next to being a plenipotentiary popanilla preferred being a prisoner his daily meals consisted of every delicacy in season a marble bath was ever at his service a billiardroom and dumbbells always ready and his old friends the most eminent physician and the most celebrated practitioner in hubbabub called upon him daily to feel his pulse and look at his tongue these attentions authorised a hope that he might yet again be an ambassador that his native land might still be discovered and its resources still be developed but when his gaoler told him that the rest of the prisoners were treated in a manner equally indulgent because the vraibleusians are the most humane people in the world popanillas spirits became somewhat depressed  he was greatly consoled however by a daily visit from a body of the most beautiful the most accomplished and the most virtuous females in hubbabub who tasted his food to see that his cook did his duty recommended him a plentiful use of pineapple well peppered and made him a present of a very handsome shirt with worked frills and ruffles to be hanged in this enchanting committee generally confined their attentions to murderers and other victims of the passions who were deserted in their hour of need by the rest of the society they had outraged but popanilla being a foreigner a prince and a plenipotentiary and not illlooking naturally attracted a great deal of notice from those who desire the amelioration of their species  popanilla was so pleased with his mode of life and had acquired such a taste for poetry pinapples and pepper since he had ceased to be an active member of society that he applied to have his trial postponed on the ground of the prejudice which had been excited against him by the public press as his trial was at present inconvenient to the government the postponement was allowed on these grounds  in the meantime the public agitation was subsiding the nation reconciled itself to the revolution in its fortunes the cidevant millionaires were busied with retrenchment the government engaged in sweeping in as many pink shells as were lying about the country the mechanics contrived to live upon chalk and seaweed and as the aboriginal would not give his corn away gratis the vraibleusians determined to give up bread the intellectual part of the nation were intently interested in discovering the cause of the national distress one of the philosophers said that it might all be traced to the effects of a war in which the vraibleusians had engaged about a century before another showed that it was altogether clearly ascribable to the pernicious custom of issuing pink shells but if instead of this mode of representing wealth they had had recourse to blue shells the nation would now have advanced to a state of prosperity which it had never yet reached a third demonstrated to the satisfaction of himself and his immediate circle that it was all owing to the statue having recently been repaired with silver instead of iron the public were unable to decide between these conflicting opinions but they were still more desirous of finding out a remedy for the evil than the cause of it  an eloquent and philosophical writer who entertains consolatory opinions of human nature has recently told us that it is in the nature of things that the intellectual wants of society should be supplied whenever the man is required invariably the man will appear so it happened in the present instance a public instructor jumped up in the person of mr flummery flam the least insinuating and the least plausible personage that ever performed the easy task of gulling a nation his manners were vulgar his voice was sharp and his language almost unintelligible flummery flam was a provisional optimist he maintained that everything would be for the best if the nation would only follow his advice he told the vraibleusians that the present universal and overwhelming distress was all and entirely and merely to be ascribed to a slight overtrading and that all that was required to set everything right again was a little time he showed that this overtrading and every other injudicious act that had ever been committed were entirely to be ascribed to the nation being imbued with erroneous and imperfect ideas of the nature of demand and supply he proved to them that if a tradesman cannot find customers his goods will generally stay upon his own hands he explained to the aboriginal the meaning of rent to the mechanics the nature of wages to the manufacturers the signification of profits he recommended that a large edition of his own work should be printed at the public expense and sold for his private profit finally he explained how immediate though temporary relief would be afforded to the state by the encouragement of emigration  the vraibleusians began to recover their spirits the government had the highest confidence in flummery flam because flummery flam served to divert the public thoughts by his direction lectures were instituted at the corner of every street to instil the right principles of politics into the mind of the great body of the people every person from the managers of the statue down to the chalkchewing mechanics attended lectures on flummeryflammism the vraibleusians suddenly discovered that it was the great object of a nation not to be the most powerful or the richest or the best or the wisest but to be the most flummeryflammistical    chapter 18   the day fixed for popanillas trial was at hand the prince was not unprepared for the meeting for some weeks before the appointed day he had been deeply studying the published speeches of the greatest rhetorician that flourished at the vraibleusian bar he was so inflated with their style that he nearly blew down the gaoler every morning when he rehearsed a passage before him indeed popanilla looked forward to his trial with feelings of anticipated triumph he determined boldly and fearlessly to state the principles upon which his public conduct had been founded the sentiments he professed on most of the important subjects which interest mankind and the views he entertained of the progress of society he would then describe in the most glowing language the domestic happiness which he enjoyed in his native isle he would paint in harrowing sentences the eternal misery and disgrace which his ignominious execution would entail upon the greyheaded father who looked up to him as a prop for his old age the affectionate mother who perceived in him her husband again a youth the devoted wife who could never survive his loss and the sixteen children chiefly girls whom his death would infallibly send upon the parish this with an eulogistic peroration on the moral qualities of the vraibleusians and the political importance of vraibleusia would he had no doubt not only save his neck but even gain him a moderate pension  the day arrived the court was crowded and popanilla had the satisfaction of observing in the newspapers that tickets for the best gallery to witness his execution were selling at a premium  the indictment was read he listened to it with intense attention to his surprise he found himself accused of stealing two hundred and nineteen camelopards all was now explained he perceived that he had been mistaken the whole of this time for another person he could not contain himself he burst into an exclamation he told the judge in a voice of mingled delight humility and triumph that it was possible he might be guilty of high treason because he was ignorant of what the crime consisted but as for stealing two hundred and nineteen camelopards he declared that such a larceny was a moral impossibility because he had never seen one such animal in the whole course of his life  the judge was kind and considerate he told the prisoner that the charge of stealing camelopards was a fiction of law that he had no doubt he had never seen one in the whole course of his life nor in all probability had any one in the whole court he explained to popanilla that originally this animal greatly abounded in vraibleusia that the present court the highest and most ancient in the kingdom had then been instituted for the punishment of all those who molested or injured that splendid animal the species his lordship continued had been long extinct but the vraibleusians duly reverencing the institutions of their ancestors had never presumed to abrogate the authority of the camelopard court or invest any other with equal privileges therefore his lordship added in order to try you in this court for a modern offence of high treason you must first be introduced by fiction of law as a stealer of camelopards and then being in praesenti regio in a manner we proceed to business by a special power for the absolute offence popanilla was so confounded by the kindness of the judge and the clearness of his lordships statement that he quite lost the thread of his peroration  the trial proceeded everybody with whom popanilla had conversed during his visit to vraibleusia was subpoenaed against him and the evidence was conclusive skindeep who was brought up by a warrant from the kings bench proved the fact of popanillas landing and that he had given himself out as a political exile the victim of a tyrant a corrupt aristocracy and a misguided people but either from a secret feeling towards his former friend or from his aversion to answer questions this evidence was on the whole not very satisfactory  the bookseller proved the publication of that fatal volume whose deceptive and glowing statements were alone sufficient to ensure popanillas fate it was in vain that the author avowed that he had never written a line of his own book this only made his imposture more evident the little philosopher with whom he had conversed at lady spirituelles and who being a friend of flummery flam had now obtained a place under government invented the most condemning evidence the marquess of moustache sent in a state paper desiring to be excused from giving evidence on account of the delicate situation in which he had been placed with regard to the prisoner but he referred them to his former private secretary who he had no doubt would afford every information accordingly the president of fort jobation who had been brought over specially finished the business  the judge although his family had suffered considerably by the late madness for speculation summed up in the most impartial manner he told the jury that although the case was quite clear against the prisoner they were bound to give him the advantage of every reasonable doubt the foreman was about to deliver the verdict when a trumpet sounded and a government messenger ran breathless into court presenting a scroll to the presiding genius he informed him that a remarkably able young man recently appointed one of the managers of the statue in consequence of the inconvenience which the public sustained from the innumerable quantity of edicts of the statue at present in force had last night consolidated them all into this single act which to render its operation still more simple was gifted with a retrospective power for the last half century  his lordship looking over the scroll passed a high eulogium upon the young consolidator compared to whom he said justinian was a country attorney observing however that the crime of high treason had been accidentally omitted in the consolidated legislation of vraibleusia he directed the jury to find the prisoner not guilty as in vraibleusia the law believes every mans character to be perfectly pure until a jury of twelve persons finds the reverse popanilla was kicked out of court amid the hootings of the mob without a stain upon his reputation  it was late in the evening when he left the court exhausted both in mind and body the mischief being now done and being totally unemployed according to custom he began to moralise i begin to perceive said he that it is possible for a nation to exist in too artificial a state that a people may both think too much and do too much all here exists in a state of exaggeration the nation itself professes to be in a situation in which it is impossible for any nation ever to be naturally placed to maintain themselves in this false position they necessarily have recourse to much destructive conduct and to many fictitious principles and as the character of a people is modelled on that of their government in private life this system of exaggeration equally prevails and equally produces a due quantity of ruinous actions and false sentiment in the meantime i am starving and dare not show my face in the light of day  as he said this the house opposite was suddenly lit up and the words emigration committee were distinctly visible on a transparent blind a sudden resolution entered popanillas mind to make an application to this body he entered the committeeroom and took his place at the end of a row of individuals who were severally examined when it was his turn to come forward he began to tell his story from the beginning and would certainly have got to the lock of hair had not the president enjoined silence popanilla was informed that the last emigrationsquadron was about to sail in a few minutes and that although the number was completed his broad shoulders and powerful frame had gained him a place he was presented with a spade a blanket and a hard biscuit and in a quarter of an hour was quitting the port of hubbabub  once more upon the waters yet once more  as the emigrationsquadron quitted the harbour two large fleets hove in sight the first was the expedition which had been despatched against the decapitating king of the north and which now returned heavily laden with his rescued subjects the other was the force which had flown to the preservation of the body of the decapitated king of the south and which now brought back his majesty embalmed some princes of the blood and an emigrant aristocracy  what became of the late fantaisian ambassador whether he were destined for van diemens land or for canada what rare adventures he experienced in sydney or port jackson or guelph city or goodrich town and whether he discovered that man might exist in too natural a state as well as in too artificial a one will probably be discovered if ever we obtain captain popanillas second voyage
